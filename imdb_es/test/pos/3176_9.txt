This is one of those films that were never published and, therefore, were lost when they were originally aired in theaters. <br /> <br /> I found it while changing the television channels and I was immediately absorbed in this story of an old boo rodeo whose imprudence and lack of responsibility hurts everyone around it. He often wanted to see the movie again, but he could not even remember his name, and he had never seen it in the rental shops. <br /> <br /> James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo shoot was top quality. Being an action movie and a Western stage and theme, anyone can enjoy it regardless of their taste in the movies.
