A very accurate representation of the life of the small-scale mafia filmed in New Jersey. The story, the characters and the script are believable, but the acting drops the ball. Still, it's worth seeing, especially because of the strong images, some still with me, although I saw them for the first time 25 years ago. <br /> <br /> A young hood comes forward and starts doing bigger things (tries) but these things are still going badly, which leads the local boss to suspect that his end is being removed, it is not a good place if you enjoy your health or your life. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that introduced Joe Pesce to Martin Scorsese. Also present is that wise expert of the perennial screen, Frank Vincent. Strong in characterizations and visuals. It sounds confusing and a lot of the acting is amateur, but it's a great story.
