The German-born Turkish director, Faith Akin, captures in his film the infinite variety of different styles of music and songs in Istanbul, a city that is a bridge between East and West, a city that is uniquely located both sides of the Bosphorus, in Europe and in Asia. Kurdish left-handers are represented by Aynur, who plays his own brand of Kurdish gospel music, passionate and melodic. We are introduced to the Romani instruments, to Orhan Gencebay, who has been called the Elvis of Arabic music. Music sounds are heard everywhere in the city when Faith Akin takes us to underground clubs, street performers and recording sessions. German bassist Alexander Hacke, who comes to Istanbul to play and learn about Turkish music, quotes Confucius: "To understand the place, you must listen to the music it plays". Akin's excellent documentary does just that: it gives us 90 minutes of music that helps cross bridges. For me, watching the film was especially interesting because I recently visited Istanbul as part of my vacation and spent four days there. The city fascinated me by its images, colors, crowds, vitality and visual beauty. Now, I can add the sounds of music to the ever-changing portrait of Istanbul.
