I remember seeing this movie again and again when I was a child. I loved. Although I have not seen him recently, I'm sure he would enjoy it just the same today. It is a very light fun movie that guarantees to make anyone laugh. The situations with each of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked that of the girl who travels with the ashes of her mother (who ends up picking them up on the road after the explosion), the thieves and the nuns. This style of good humor is very lost these days. In addition, this film showed that actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty / Days of our Lives) had a great start. I recommend it to anyone who is lucky enough to find it in their local video store.
