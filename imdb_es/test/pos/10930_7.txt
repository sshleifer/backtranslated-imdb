The mere presence of Sam Waterston as an Indian is enough to put this film in the category that must be seen. It is beautiful and very subtle, with no lines at all. He is tender with his kidnapper and, nevertheless, we can see that he is among the most proud Indian men of all. Martin Sheen is just a fool who decides to challenge Waterston (White Bull) for a beautiful white horse. Other subplots are really unnecessary. I do not understand the role played by Caroline Langrishe, like the poor girl that White Bull kidnaps ... I do not know how she keeps her hands away from this beautiful Indian man! Although it is very fun; Especially if you are a fan of Waterston. Man, it looks good in this one !!! The role of Harvey Keitel is not even worth mentioning, to tell the truth! But, rent it and enjoy! Actually, I think that if the music were better, it would have been a more dramatic movie ... the music is so bad that it distracts. Still, there's Mr. Waterston!
