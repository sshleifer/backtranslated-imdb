I also remember seeing this movie as a young man in a small local theater that presented foreign films every week. Since then, it was the daring adventure of everything that remained in my memory. <br /> <br /> Especially impressionable was the scene with Noel Purcell as the old sailor, Paddy, who drank too much, saw or heard apparitions and died. of fear in a cave. I always kept up with Noel's career even decades later because I saw him then. There is also a young Cyril Cusack as James Barman, with the designs of charming Jean Simmons, shown as Emmeline when she grew up. <br /> <br /> I would very much like to have a video of this disturbing movie and refresh my memory of it. Where do I send my application?
