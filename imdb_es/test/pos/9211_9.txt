I just entered the viewing program for the first time recently: the 2-hour "kidnapping" program. Do not you know why I did not do it before? James Caan is outstanding and completely credible in the role of the head of honor at the 5 * Vegas resort presented. <br /> <br /> Very often, programs like this one have one or more in the set that are completely annoying, or it seems that they have been chosen because they must be related to the producer or director. <br /> <br /> This is not the case with this program. Along with Caan, all the main and supporting actors are attractive, and credible. The invited actors are well chosen. <br /> <br /> The stories I've seen are interesting, and the show also presents a good view of the city. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining program, and I hope it remains. I do not know how I managed to waste so much time, but I plan TIVO from now on.
