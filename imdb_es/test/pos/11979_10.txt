This movie deserves the 10 that I give it. <br /> <br /> But they are not the 10 that you would give to films like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' or 'Psycho'. This is the kind of 10 you give to a movie that only makes you laugh, again and again! It is the most horribly written and directed film, but it does not stop entertaining. It has the most amateur effects, but you enjoy every moment! I saw this movie today on television, and I did not want to get away! Read the following dialogue to find out why! <br /> <br /> (The whole university is around Manisha, who just suffered an attempted rape and the guys who tried to rape ask for forgiveness) <br /> <br /> Bad Guy 1: Please, forgive us! <br /> <br /> Bad boy 2: Yes, we will not do it again. <br /> <br /> (No response from Manisha) <br /> <br /> Akshay: Come on, forgive them! <br /> <br /> Manisha: I do not know ... <br /> <br /> Akshay: You're a beautiful woman, and even dead men can excite you! And these are young and alive males! Do not blame them! <br /> <br /> Pancholi: Yes, Manisha ... <br /> <br /> Manisha (To Suniel): What if they tried to rape your girlfriend? <br /> <br /> Suniel: It would break my hands, my legs and I would kill them. But anyway, just forgive them. <br /> <br /> Akshay: Yes, if you do not forgive them, then it will be as if you are too arrogant with your beauty! <br /> <br /> Now it's a true masterpiece of a dialogue! This movie never stops entertaining, mainly because there are so many nonsense and unrealistic situations! The bad boy (Munish) can do basically anything ... He can blow a sandstorm out of his mouth, or he can get a motorcycle out the back and make it disappear as easily. <br /> <br /> All the actors take turns talking ... A line from Akshay, then from Suniel, then from Arshad, then Aftab, then Nigam. It is the main rule followed by the director, so each player is given an equal screen time. And then there is the almighty pendant, which can make even a moving car pass through without being harmed! All these things make it a nice movie, and I can watch it again and again. I think this movie can go to the comedy hall of fame if there is one ... <br /> <br /> The only problem is that I was not trying to be funny.
