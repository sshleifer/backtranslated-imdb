I go to the cinema to entertain myself. I entertained myself a lot with the first film in this series: The DaVinci Code. I had many twists and turns to keep me very interested. Angels and demons is not different. If you enjoyed the DaVinci Code, you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie too. Angels and Demons is done practically in the same style as in the previous movie, but with a faster rhythm, which I liked. Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without getting bored. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about this movie was that, even though it's obviously fictional, they leave enough real story to do It seems very believable. If there is something that I did not like about this movie, it is that the plot itself is very incredible (I do not want to give it any kind of spoilers). But hey, it's a movie. I entertained myself all the time and was very satisfied with what I saw.
