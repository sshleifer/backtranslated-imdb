I agree that this film achieved its objectives perfectly. I saw him on Showtime late at night when I was a teenager, and again in college. I thought it was fun. And there are tits everywhere! It seems that at the end of the 70s and 80s there was a lot of this type of film made, from films with R classification as "Porkys" to "Au Pair Girls" of soft core; It's a shame they seem to have fallen by the wayside in terms of popularity. What made HOTS great was that, like the previous two movies, it's a lot of fun. HOTS is like a female version of "Animal House", where the girls form a kind of sisterhood of women and get involved in the Bedlam campus. As a side note, whoever designed the outfits for "Hooters" girls must certainly have seen this movie.
