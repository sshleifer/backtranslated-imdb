On September 29, 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror movies. This was the date on which BBC1 issued (for the only time I know) Jeff Lieberman's super creepy surprise of 1981, Just Before Dawn, which made a big impression on me. Almost twenty years later, I am pleased to report that I finally got my hands on the special edition of Shriek Show / Media Blasters on two albums, and it is as disturbing and disturbing as I remember it, if not more. <br /> <br /> The plot, as is usual in genre films (and this was Lieberman's first film as "rent director", although at least it eliminated the script from the mumbo-jumbo cult of snakes) of religious worship)), is a bit thin: five nice twentysomethings (including Chris Lemmon, son of Jack, in a pair of uncomfortably tight white steps) venture into the dense Oregon woods to camp and see a piece of land that has been bequeathed to one of their numbers. But Just Before Dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators because Lieberman does not waste time showing us how disturbed things are in this particular mountain patch, with a complete and innocent skewer and a drunken preacher truck pushed downhill and wrapped in Flames within minutes of the beginning of the movie. The youngsters come rolling in the image in a swift Winnebago, the "Heart of Glass" of Blondie hits the soundtrack, and before you can say "The Texas massacre!" They have beaten an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first experience of aggression by the maniac responsible for the opening catastrophes. Ranger Roy (George Kennedy) warns them that things are likely to go wrong if they go further, but go ahead with the trip anyway, refusing to take the perplexed preacher even though, understandably, he is scared, and finally camp in the camp. from wherever. Needless to say, things go downhill from here. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not without horror and well-managed action scenes, the highlights for me are those in which Lieberman lets his camera move away, long and hard. slow, from seemingly innocuous shots of the fun-loving children who roam the desert, or just let them settle for a while in dense, imposing, dwarf forests. It makes Oregon's exteriors as threatening and as sinister as Kubrick made the spacious interiors of the Overlook Hotel in the Shining, and Brad Fiedel's score (discounting the horribly distorted racket that runs over the titles) remains on the right side of the intruders, underlining the threat that is advancing slowly. With subtlety and elegance. There are many surprises along the way, settle Deliverance with the discovery of a backward baby and his disturbed and disturbing family, and a really strange killing technique implemented shortly before the end of the movie. I will not spoil it for you. I've said enough. <br /> <br /> It is quite difficult to determine why this jewel of undervalued horror fell through the cracks and became an element of worship instead of a rupture, but I hope it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years. for come - it deserves to be.
