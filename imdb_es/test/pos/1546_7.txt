Recently released on a British DVD, this is a good movie (provided you have a period of attention and an IQ of more than one fruit fly). It's not as depressing as it could have been, this is the kitchen sink at its dirtiest point. Terrance Stamp is great at that, the music is sweet, Carol White is very credible as the single mother who can not stop loving the criminals. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where Carol and her friend who works at The Pub with her (the one with the huge beehive hair that falls over one eye) sit and gossip about all the men who walk by . <br /> <br /> The only thing that tarnished this was Shakey's performance. Carol's first husband, but if you can overcome that, you're fine. And Donovan provides some of the most languid, soft and bittersweet lyrics of the sixties.
