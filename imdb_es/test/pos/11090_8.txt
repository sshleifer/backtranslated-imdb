"The belief in the Great Other as an invisible power structure that exists in the Real is the briefest definition of paranoia." ?? Slavoj Zizek <br /> <br /> This is a review of "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman", two films by director John Schlesinger. <br /> <br /> Although Hitchcock and Lang brought the "The Conspiracy Movie" to Hollywood, the genre flourished in the late 60s and 70s, with films like "The Parallax View", "Z", "Marathon" Man "," Capricorn One "," The Manchurian Candidate "," Three Days of The Condor and "All the President's Men." This was the time of Vietnam and Watergate, the public that deeply distrusted all political leaders. < br /> <br /> The genre remained silent in the 80s and early 90s, until the TV series "X Files" came to life, with phrases like "The truth is out there" and "Do not trust nobody, "the series proposed a world of vast conspiracies and government plans, the common man at the mercy of all the ridiculously elaborated schemes, the only way out of the labyrinth? Fight against the future!" as proclaimed by the slogan of the final season of the series, apparently it was our duty to trace the labyrinth of the ormation, discovering an elusive "truth" that assured our own freedom. <br /> <br /> This trend ended with the rise of the Internet, the conspiracy thrillers that now give way to "conspiracy documentaries". The internet generation included independent documentaries such as "Loose Change" and "Zeitgeist," while Michael Moore twinkled his audience with things like "Fahrenheit 9/11." All these documentaries believed in a "secret order", a clique of politicians and wealthy businessmen who conspire to reduce human rights and enslave the world. They fight to create a mono-myth, uniting several conspiracies and hidden agendas in a single narrative that encompasses everything that explains the purpose, the point and the future of everything. <br /> <br /> This need to "rationalize narratives", to make them more "efficient", is reflected in the scientific community, which strives to create a "Great Unification Theory" and, ultimately, , a "Theory of everything", combining everything from Quantum Mechanics to Special Relativity in a formula that encompasses every giant. <br /> <br /> So, ultimately, the "conspiracy thriller" is rooted in man's desire to have control. The modern subject is one who shows absolute cynicism towards official institutions, but at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies (an invisible Other that pulls on the ropes). This seemingly contradictory coupling of cynicism and belief is strictly related to the disappearance of the great Other. His disappearance causes us to build an Other from the Other (conspiracy) to escape the unbearable freedom caused by his loss. Conversely, it is not necessary to take the Great Other seriously if we believe in an Other of the Other. Therefore, we are allowed to show cynicism and belief in equal measure. <br /> <br /> Man, therefore, tries to exert control over a misguided universe, to create a kind of paternal nanny (be it God, a mathematical formula, a theory of conspiracy, an explanation of violence / conspiracies / murder / war, etc.). ) that provides meaning and symbolic order. The Great Other provides guarantees to the believer. It is a "lifestyle choice," similar to religion, in which its place in the world depends on pure irrationality. <br /> <br /> The problem with most "conspiracy thrillers", from the innocent days of Hitchcock's "Topaz" to modern rates like "The Da Vinci Code", has two aspects. First, they are not wrong in suggesting that something is "wrong" between the "elite" or "the best people," but they are wrong to individualize and personalize processes that are social, collective and systemic, an approach that implies that it is fair A matter of personal morality rather than social structures. Second, and most importantly, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that the Great Other simply does not exist. There is no symbolic order to pull the strings. <br /> <br /> Some modern "conspiracy thrillers" ("Eyes Wide Shut", "Existenz", etc.) recognize this, with its countless webs of lies, accidents, truths and averages. The truths, nothing that adds up, nothing that makes sense, the real and the hyperreal, the truth and the desire, all fuzzy, without an identifiable zero point, but mostly they are films of intellectual directors. <br /> <br /> Compared to these modern "conspiracy thrillers", "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman" are positively archaic. "Marathon Man" is a graduate student (Dustin Hoffman) who is involved in the business of his older brother (Roy Scheider), which unfortunately has to do with spies, weapons, double agents, diamonds and evil Nazi dentists. Scheider is smooth, Hoffman is excellent and Schlesinger hits us with some visual effects (the revelation of the Eiffel Tower is impressive), but the most interesting thing about the film is the way in which its various plot lines do not cross to the mark of 1 hour. . Even then, it takes another half hour for things to start making sense. Unfortunately, the film ends with a cliché confrontation between the villain and the good guy, all solved and explained. <br /> <br /> "The hawk and the snowman" is a little more ambitious. Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the Soviet Union. Hutton works in a civil defense contractor and smuggles information out of his office and into the hands of Penn, a drug dealer who has no qualms about selling to the KGB. Penn does this strictly for the money, while Hutton is disillusioned with the US government (particularly his attempt to depose the Australian leader) and that is why he sells the secrets strictly because he hates the way his country conducts crimes and drug games. espionage. In other words, the film is about a conspiracy undertaken in response to conspiracies. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man"? 7.9 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The hawk and the snowman" ?? 8/10 <br /> <br /> Aside from a strange automobile accident and its final cliché, "Marathon Man" is an effective thriller, with several impeccable scenes. "The Hawk and the Snowman" is even better, Penn is achieving a memorable performance.
