While it is not "perfect", it is close. I love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman Police Chief), the housekeeper, the restaurant waiter Felix and the judge ... I can go on and on. This film has been part of my family's Christmas tradition since I was a child, and my children also grew up with her! "The baby swallowed the clock" was always my son's favorite phrase. <br /> <br /> The sexy Barbara Stanwyck with pants and dresses stole the show along with the adorable and funny S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan also has some great songs. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and I suggest you skip the remake (blah).
