I must say that I thought the Greek show would be really ridiculous and stupid. As I am part of a sisterhood of women, I did not want them to make Greek organizations look bad ... <br /> <br /> but I think Greek is hilarious. Yes, they have the stereotyped brotherhood of women and fraternity, but it is not mocking, but humorous. <br /> <br /> All the characters are quite nice except Rebecca Logan (I just can not stand her), Casey and Rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there's Cappie. Who does not love a guy like Cappie haha ​​His character contributes a lot to the show. Rusty's roommate, Dale, played by Clark Duke, is also hilarious. <br /> <br /> It's definitely fun to watch, so tune in for season 2. I can not wait until I start again!
