The hypnotic "Northfork" by Michael Polish is a film that will remain in the memory for a long time. This exquisitely crafted film written by Michael and Mark Polish is visually one of the best things that came out of the world of independent films last year. The film is splendidly photographed by M. David Mullen, with an unforgettable score by Stuart Matthewman. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, maybe you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​putting the film in Montana was a big blow for the Polish brothers. Never the majestic views of the country and the mountains have been captured as vividly as in "Northfork". We do not need any color! The beauty is in the dark tones of the film that enhances the history of desolation in this remote outpost. <br /> <br /> At the center of the story is Irwin, the sick child under the care of the mysterious father Harlan. This child is seen in his bed where the kind priest administers the medicine for his body. But are you really there? We see him interacting with the strange group we found for the first time in the cemetery. There are two newly opened tombs. Will it be one of them for Irwin? <br /> <br /> At the same time, another plot line is reproduced parallel to this first theme. We see the six men in black who have come to the area to remove as many people as they can from the area. This will be the bed for the artificial lake that will be created. Your reward is an acre and a half of lakefront property if you move a certain amount of people. <br /> <br /> The third line of the story focuses on the mystical group composed of Flower Hercules, Cup of Tea, Cod and Happy. They are following the possibility of a link to an angel that has been injured in this area. When Irwin meets them in the cemetery, he offers help, only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here. We observe how the quartet examines the feathers that the child has placed between the pages of his bible. Could Irwin be that angel? <br /> <br /> The closing sequence shows all the parties leaving Northfork in different directions. The men in black, riding in their cars, may go home to enjoy the newly acquired properties that were given to them as a reward. The mystical group is seen boarding an airplane and taking off to a higher place. We also realize that the child in Father Harlan, in spite of the medicines and the care he received from the holy figure, has died. <br /> <br /> Michael Polish obtained one of the best acting ensembles of all the directors. Nick Nolte, while Father Harlan becomes a low profile actor in his interpretation of this kind man. James Woods, like Walter, one of the men who works for the developer, does a good job. The biggest surprise is Duel Farmer, who leaves an excellent impression as Irwin. This child actor, with the right guidance, shows great promise. <br /> <br /> The mystical group is brilliantly played by Daryl Hannah, Robin Sachs, Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards, the man with the fun shows. Peter Coyote, Mark Polish, Ben Foster and the rest of the cast are impeccable under the direction of Mr. Polish. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film is based on its simplicity. Mr. Polish's vision will torment the memory. The images of Montana, as perhaps an unreal landscape, is one of the best things in American films in quite some time.
