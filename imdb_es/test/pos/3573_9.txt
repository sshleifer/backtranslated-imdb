In fact, I went to see this movie with few expectations, since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And surprisingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian films tend to have a similar pattern, and I always try to make reference to average vulgar people, especially trying to make jokes about the curse continues. But let's face it, the language used in this movie is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, that's how real people talk. History and rhythm are brilliant, and could be extrapolated to any country in the world. The performance was excellent, and for me the script is one of the best that has been produced on Colombian soil. I think that anyone in the whole world can get a good hour and a half of entertainment, with a beautifully directed black humor comedy. It reminded me of movies like snatching, and others of the type. I highly recommend it and I hope it can be seen by more people, since Colombian films seem to have begun to focus more internationally since last year.
