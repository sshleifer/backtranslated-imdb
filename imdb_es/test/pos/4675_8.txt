I enjoyed this movie. More than what I expected. It has enough action, intrigue and locations to make it worthwhile. Although I still can not see Mark Wahlberg as a leader, he has become good enough to be a credible manager and that's fine. <br /> <br /> The superhero of the movie is the Mini Cooper. It has been shown to have the speed, dexterity and muscle to carry out any work. And to handle a maniac driver like Charlize Theron's character.
