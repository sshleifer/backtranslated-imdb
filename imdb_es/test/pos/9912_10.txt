Of all the episodes of all series, this is the closest to the original Roddenberry principle. According to the book THE MAKING OF STAR TREK, in Roddenberry's writer's guide to his story writers, he affirms that any alien creature, no matter how horribly ugly, impossible to believe, benign or malicious, MUST have some appearance of humanity that television can see. The public can empathize with and / or interact with. The Devil In The Dark HORSE, which resembles nothing more than a large patch of cow dung, is a mother who protects her babies, those ball-shaped silicon nodules that miners still find along of the passages of the mine and destroying, because they have no idea what they are! This is one of my absolute favorite episodes if only for that!
