I saw this movie the day it opened in New York, at Ziegfield. At that time, Madonna was no longer the cultural icon she is now. She had a couple of hits, she was very good at "Desparately Seeking Susan" and I had tickets to see her at a concert at Giants Stadium. <br /> <br /> "Who is that girl?" it gives Madonna a real role to play, which is not just a variation of her own personality. She does the madness / heroin routine better than you think. Griffin Dunne is very well regarded as the man around to witness all the scams. <br /> <br /> The story involves a huge cat named Murray, a future wife who has slept with all taxi drivers in New York, a half-father-in-law and a key. There are a lot of car chases and policemen who crawl on their way. All the elements of an intact screwball comedy. <br /> <br /> Sir John Mills is seen briefly. He shares a glass of champagne with the electrodes and has the best apartment on the Upper West Side, with a rainforest and all. <br /> <br /> Compared to most of Madonna's films (which I've been able to tolerate anyway), this is fantastic. On its own, it's not that bad. 6/10. <br /> <br /> PS The concert was terrible.
