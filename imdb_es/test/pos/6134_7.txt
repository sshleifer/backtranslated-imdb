Yes, I saw this mini series with my mom and dad when I was a kid. It was one of the few mini-series that my 9-year-old mind could follow. I remember it was very well done, and I did not necessarily have the feeling of the typical mini trash series. It was more or less an original concept that really caught your attention. I would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of the story and the twists of the plot. Although most of the twists in this movie are detailed or predictable, it's still worth it. However, I have not checked if you can get it through Netflix. I guess not. They should play it on the history channel or something like that.
