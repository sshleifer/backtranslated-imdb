The first time I saw this DVD, I not only felt happy about the fact that it was the first time in decades that the band published something, but also because the DVD itself is extremely loud. Jimmy Page obviously can not live with quiet music, I suppose. However, I must say that during the concert at the Royal Albert Hall, they expanded 'How many more times' and 'Moby Dick' for too long. Apart from that, it was exquisite. My favorite song of all time is now on that DVD. Trampled. It's that or "In my time to die." In that song, Jimmy really plays that thing well. Have you ever seen Randy Rhoads play? Well, Jimmy plays just like him, except that his guitar is lower.
