Yes, I know, Roscoe Arbuckle did not like being called 'Fatty', but I could not resist the joke. <br /> <br /> This is a very good Lloyd Hamilton short film from his peak period, directed by Roscoe. . The two work together with many good gags and Roscoe's usual attention to the details of taking pictures in an interesting way. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a couple of long tracking shots and some camera tricks to tell his story and show Ham as a good actor, as well as a talented comedian. <br /> <br /> This story plays with some interesting themes, like Lloyd's classic, MOVE ALONG: here it's about the perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them. Or you can choose to ignore such problems and laugh.
