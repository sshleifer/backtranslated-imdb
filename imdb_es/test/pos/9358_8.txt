"Crossfire" is a famous 1947 noir that is a murder mystery with a strong message. It stars Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene and Gloria Grahame, and is strongly directed by Edward Dmytryk. We witness the murder in the shade at first, and for the rest of the film, Young, as a detective, Finlay, in charge of the case, tries to find out which of the three soldiers is responsible for the death, and just as important, for what. The victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) is someone that the soldiers are in a bar; They go up to their apartment to continue their visit, and Samuels ends up dead. <br /> <br /> I do not know in 1947, but seeing "Crossfire" today, you know who did it and why at the time you see the suspects I do not think it was so obvious back then, since these actors were just beginning. However, the film has a great impact with its powerful acting, good direction, violence and an implacable anti-Semitic language. <br /> <br /> The characterizations are vivid, including that of Gloria Grahame in a rather small role. A woman who knows Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspicious soldiers, in a bar and can provide an alibi. The great performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but they are all excellent. Robert Young is especially effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is very nice as a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely man who is not sure if he still feels something for his wife. <br /> <br /> Really excellent, and you have to see it.
