Well, unfortunately, I can not help feeling a bit disappointed after my much anticipated "Just Before Dawn" visualization. Jeff Lieberman is a great filmmaker and, without a doubt, he can do great things with a small budget, but nevertheless he expected to see a much more sadistic and frightening slasher at the beginning of the 80s. But in reality I am beginning to think that Lieberman is not the guilty of this, but WE are gorehounds! It is more than obvious that Lieberman intended to make his version of the backwoods sasher look like "Deliverance" and absolutely NOT like "Friday the 13th", which greatly popularized the subgenre a year before. The horror and the constant sense of threat do not come mainly from the demented maniacs with their machetes, but from the genuinely sinister and isolated forests of Oregon where this film was shot. In case the film seems slow and uneventful, this is only because Lieberman takes his time to present dark woods and mysterious mountains as additional characters in his film. We almost never see the killers in person, but there seems to always be someone who attracts from behind the trees or from under the mountain lakes. Keeping this in mind, "Just Before Dawn" becomes a very admirable horror effort and, in fact, much better than your contemporary blood-soaked colleagues. In the midst of an almost infinite selection of bloody and disgusting slashers, Lieberman re-emphasizes stress and character development. The plot revolves around five friends in their twenties who are heading to a camping holiday in the forests of Oregon, where one of them owns a small piece of land. The forests are deserted and, naturally, the campers ignore the advice of Roy's ranger (George Kennedy!) To return to civilization. Soon after, they find themselves brutally with an innate family of which the twin sons have murderous tendencies. The five main characters are surprisingly nice and convincing! There are no irritating stereotypes that you do not feel sympathy for, like whores girls or soccer players. As a result of this "natural" character, you automatically animate them, even when they eventually become wild by themselves. Sublime camera work gives the film a sometimes unbearable level of tension and Brad Fiedel's chilling electronic result only adds to this effect. "Just Before Dawn" is a good part of the horror of the early 80s, as long as you do not want blood dripping from your television.
