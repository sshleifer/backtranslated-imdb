Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) on the surface can be described as a French variation of John Huston's seminal theft film, Asphalt Jungle (1950). The difference between the two films is that Rififi (1955) pays a bit more attention in detail to the robbery sequence. In addition, the police are not involved in the aftermath of the robbery in Rififi as much as in Asphalt Jungle. In the end, Rififi (1955) is, in my opinion, a slightly better movie than Asphalt Jungle (1950). Notable image of Noir that defines the French cinema of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Spartacus (1960) may have been the one who broke the infamous blacklist, but in my opinion Rififi (1955) was the movie that began to separate from the unbreakable Hollywood blacklist. First film in five years for Jules Dassin, who was the victim of McCarthy's communist hunting of the late 40s in the early 50s. He got some kind of retribution when Rififi (1955) became a hit in France and Europe. In this way, challenging the poisoned Hollywood blacklist in an important way that probably inspired others to do the same. Rififi (1955) is the most important film of Dassin's career because it not only restored his name, but also gave him a second chance to make films. <br /> <br /> Jules Dassin gave the world of cinema and its audiences more and more numerous. Masterpiece of influential proportions. His handling of the material is exceptional and the direction of the actors is impeccable. Build tense situations with precise craftsmanship. Dassin completed the circle in the Film Noir genre directing his best and last Noir, Rififi (1955). Marked the end of Dassin's period in making films when he participated in the making of Noir movies. <br /> <br /> Rififi (1955) is the number one film in an arsenal of more than thirty films for director, Jules Dassin. A masterpiece in acting, cinematography, directing, editing and writing. It is not a movie that leaves your seat for a minute because there is always something memorable going on. As brilliant as anything by Jean Pierre Melville, he was a master of this type of film. Masterpieces like Rififi (1955) are relatively small compared to the billions of films made in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> The only fascinating aspect of Rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a stealing that continues. a thickness of 118 minutes. The main characters plan and execute the theft of jewels in the same way that a film director prepares for pre-production, production and post-production of a film. It shows how difficult it is a jewel heist in Rififi (1955) to commit and why very few would do something like that. The fact that the scene hardly contains a disaster like in other robbery films makes this scene even bigger. The closest you can get to having a perfect sequence in a moving image. <br /> <br /> The lack of unnatural sound in the historic minute-hit sequence of the story places him in a realm of absolute realism. Any dialogue and / or music would ruin any suspense and tension that the director is trying to create. The use of natural sound makes the theft sequence a rewarding experience to watch movies. Now filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of the lack of confidence in the patience of the viewers. It maintains a level of consistency that never fails. <br /> <br /> Maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the theft sequence work perfectly. The director achieves suspense in the robbery sequence that seldom equals in most scenes of theft from theft movies. Jean Servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with a bit of low profile acting. Putting suspense in a scene is a task that few are able to do. The sequence of robberies of Rififi (1955) reaches a level of suspense and tension of Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers from the years following Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) have been influenced, if not inspired by it. An influential filmmaker was Jean Pierre Melville (original choice for director of Rififi) who used variations of the theft sequence in Le Doulos (1961) and Le Cercle Rouge (1970). Another filmmaker influenced was Stanley Kubrick, who made a similarly themed film in The Killing (1956). In addition, Quentin Tarantino, whose first feature film Reservoir Dogs (1992) was inspired by this film. Other directors of influenced cinema are John Woo, Michael Mann, Paul Schrader, Ringo Lam, etc ... <br /> <br /> Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) is comparable to Bob le Flambeur (1955) in many ways . One, Jules Dassin and Jean Pierre Melville directed innovative films in Rififi (1955) and Bob le Flambeur (1955). Two, each film involves an old delinquent who plans and carries out a daring robbery. Three, Bob le Flambeur and Rififi finish fatalistically. Four, each film shares many reasons and situations that classify both as great movies. <br /> <br /> Part of the charm of Rififi are the colorful characters that surround the story such as Tony le Stephanois, Jo le Suedois, Mario Farrati, and Cesar le Milanais. Most of the violence is implicit but effectively brutal. The main characters led by Tony le Stephanois are governed by an obsolete honor code reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo. Jean Servais becomes the role of Tony le Stephanois with his cynical attitude and tired appearance. Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) became one of my favorites at the time I saw it on the big screen from start to finish.
