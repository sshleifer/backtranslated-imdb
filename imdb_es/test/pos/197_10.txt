This film won a special prize at Cannes for its performance and it is not hard to see why. (Some spoilers, but by the end, you'll have to watch the movie!) A simple story: in Moscow, on the eve of the war between Russia and Germany, in the Second World War Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they spit when she learns that she has joined the army. Boris goes to the front before Veronika can tell him that she loves him. Boris is shot, but his final destination remains unknown to Veronika or her family. Mark, Boris's cousin, rapes Veronika, who feels obligated to marry him. Demeaned and degraded by the coward Mark, Veronika clings to the hope that one day Boris will return. Excellent camera work and wonderful pieces by director Kalatozov. (For anyone interested in the technique of cinema, another Kalatozov film, I AM CUBA, has at least two magnificent pieces, one of them with a long tracking trace that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana. two floors to a cigar factory, he crawls through the window and follows the procession down a long, long avenue, all uncut.) Excellent performance, particularly by Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris's uncle) is still made most poignant for the absolute underestimation. A devastating and romantic film with a moving performance by Samoilova. (This film is often linked to the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier).
