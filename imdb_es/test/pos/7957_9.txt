I always had this concept that Korean movies were all about comedy and drama, but "Christmas in autumn" has changed my point of view. This movie is so simple. It does not have melodramatic scenes or comedy scenes. Not a single scene where the actors scream loudly. Not even a scene where the actor and the actress kiss, not even a simple kiss. And yet, this film is able to reach its viewers in ways I do not know. The end of the movie left me speechless. I did not even cry, but my eyes were red hot. This movie left me with a feeling that I can barely describe with words. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can recommend this movie to everyone, but I do recommend it to people who want to see real cinema. 9.4 / 10
