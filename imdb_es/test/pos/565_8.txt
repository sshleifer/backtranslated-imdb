I saw him on HBO because he won the Oscar a week earlier. It compares favorably with the fictional dramas of the court. <br /> <br /> The story is about a 15-year-old black child prosecuted for the murder of an elderly white woman from Jacksonville, FL, based almost exclusively on the identification of the victim's husband and on a confession that the defense She is coerced. <br /> <br /> Approximately half of the images are from the trial; It is complemented by images of defense attorneys (two public defenders) who explain their case, interview witnesses and visit key locations. This is edited with a minimum of unnecessary repetition and placed in logical order. The camera work is pretty solid. And there is a somewhat surprising epilogue.
