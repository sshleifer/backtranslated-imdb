Mr Baseball was a fun video rental with my fianc√© Susan Nauss. Susan said she had been waiting to see the movie. Ken Takakura Oda as a difficult but honorable manager makes sense. Ken Takakura has made so many wonderful Asian movies, I correct the only critic and say that Takakura is still a cinematic presence with films like Hotari. Of course, everyone likes Tom Selleck, but Ken Takakura is the best dramatic actor of the two. Today someone accused me of being Yakuza, well, I say that the president of My Great Uncle Shadow, Jack F. Kennedy, and others, we are part of the legitimate human leadership in our Universe and thanks to our collaborators. Humans are free people who fight against all the parts of the adversity that President Kennedy spoke about in his inaugural speech. To be honest, someone has kept food prices very low in Canada on things like bread. In honor of our CoCreators, stop eating amphibians, reptiles and eggs. I hope that one day there will be a sequel to Mr Baseball with Father Ken Takakura Oda as Manager. Thanks to IMDb for supporting freedom of expression as kind President George W. Bush and I support. IMDb support.
