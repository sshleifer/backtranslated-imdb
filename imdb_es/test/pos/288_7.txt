One thing that occurred to me when watching this movie is that it was fun / exciting for the cast and crew; I could feel that they were against the budget constraint with enthusiasm and dedication because apparently they liked the people involved. <br /> <br /> I tend to like B movies that are original and have a heart, and I think this is one of those works. It seems to me that the actors put their hearts more than usual, perhaps because of the good direction of the actress / director, and they were obviously sufficiently clear in their parts of the story to make a work of art coherent and visible . . <br /> <br /> The critics of this movie who more or less say, "why not rent a hardcore porn movie," explain why they did not like the movie. Going to this movie waiting for a lot of T & A without patience for the plot material is the reason why it is so unpleasant for them. You could say that the movie is more a romantic work than a soft porn movie, although I think the star has done its share of soft porn. I think she graduated. <br /> <br /> Regarding the writing, the dialogue is not a big part of the film, like in a Tarentino movie, but the plot is decent and the turns are original and, at times, funny. Particularly, the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure, with the villain / heroine and the "leading man" learning from their complex network of feelings. <br /> <br /> I understand that the producer got a 3 movie contract for this. We take our hats off by trying a few tens of thousands of dollars if you have some artistic sensitivity and pride. <br /> <br /> Gabriella and the other girls with nudity scenes were nice, as well as being hot, not only bimbos with air, but also as a piece of fantasy erotic science with a beautiful naked art, even with the B movie limits Earth, not disappointing.
