I captured this film at the Glenwood theaters over the weekend as part of the Kansas International Film Festival, which, as usual, has provided a thoughtful and eclectic showcase of world cinema. <br /> <br /> I have been interested in Australian cinema for several years, so I was pleased to know that this film was included and, of course, I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Superbly filmed, firmly directed, it is a mysterious story of a man and his journey into the heart of darkness, so to speak. It reminded me a bit of Lynch's Wild at Heart, it has that strange madness, but it was stuck to the movie for other reasons, namely, that it presents a portrait of Australia that is ... well, very believable. <Br /> <br /> I've been on vacation to Land Down Under several times, once in the 1980s and again about 7 years ago with my wife. <br /> <br /> I do not want to make great efforts to explain my vacation, but director Frayne seems to understand a lot of what I find so strange and eccentric about Australia, a country that is responsible for tips from, say, Nick Dig on one side, and Steve Irwin (the "Crocodile Hunter") on the other. <br /> <br /> An incessant buzzing ... I would have preferred more than the "unknown". Australia. Much more in fact. But I also realize that there is only 1 hour and a half to do everything in ... "Sigh." <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is very, very accomplished.
