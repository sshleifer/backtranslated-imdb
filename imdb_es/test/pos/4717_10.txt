This is a great movie in many different ways ... perhaps the most important is that it presents Western audiences with the tragic and extraordinary story of Aung San Suu Kyi and her struggle for freedom and democracy. Wonderful performance, magnificent cinematography, impressive action and suspense: "Beyond Rangoon" has it all. I have seen this movie several times in the last ten years and each time means more to me. Not everyone will like it (hence the relatively low rating in IMDb), but that's because it's not a conventional Hollywood nightmare; rather, it challenges the viewer on several levels. I have never seen him without sobbing at the end and promising to live a more meaningful life.
