James L. Brook is one of those directors who always seems to have a peculiar aspect of life. Not only is he the producer of "The Simpsons," he has some classic comedies to his credit, "Broadcast News" is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although it does not match your subsequent effort "As good as it gets," "Broadcast News" is still a very smart, funny and witty movie about a television broadcast station and all the problems it suffers from . There is a great comic sequence of physical humor in which Joan Cusack runs around the building trying to bring a news tape to the editing room in a matter of minutes before it is broadcast live on television. <br /> <br /> This is not only very accurate in terms of the way in which the transmission stations are operated, but it is also an honest and skilful portrait of human beings. <br /> <br /> A subtle and discreet film with a good performance (especially from Hurt, who I do not always like so much) and apt address.
