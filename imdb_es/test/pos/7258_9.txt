I do not want to write a lot about the movie, but basically it's an action comedy with a bit of romance about two men who come together in unlikely circumstances and become men of the road. Fantastic performance by Robert Carlysle and everyone else involved. A bright 'bad' that really makes you hate it. Some great comic lines - they actually laugh out loud, incredible action and a great plot. Choice of music and fantastic atmosphere, basically brilliant and brilliant writing. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good British movie or a little action, I do not know why the movie never took off, I thought I did not have as much recognition as I deserved. If it were not for something else, watch this movie for one of the best finals of all time. It is not to give anything away, but this really gets to beat the heart!
