This television adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel was so lovingly that I can hardly find the words to appreciate it. Not since "Tipping the Velvet" (also highly recommended) I have seen such performance of the leading actresses, this time by Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy. They acted with their souls, and this is what reaches the audience! The supporting actors were also well chosen, they made a great set. <br /> <br /> For those who think that history is just a lesbian relationship, no, this is only one part. The other main issue is the betrayal of the person you love. And the plot has some more surprising twists. So the movie should be interesting for heterosexual people or guys like me too.
