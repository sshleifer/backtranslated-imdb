I was not surprised to read a comment from the director that she made this movie as an antidote to all those "making of" DVD featurettes, since that certainly impressed me. I confess that I have a penchant for "goal", but I thought that this movie was very accessible and entertaining, and not even in a laborious, self-conscious way, which is certainly a bit of what you expect in a movie. about making movies. It's very "French" in the sense that there are a lot of extravagant, but sometimes compelling theories about how to "make movies" (and even sexuality), "but how the director does not behave (use an avatar instead) ), we have many options left (since I'm pretty sure she contradicts herself constantly.) Apparently, Catherine Breillat specializes in hard-to-see movies, but I would definitely say that she does not qualify, I really enjoyed the dialogue, the balance between cinematographic and natural, the relations between the character of the director and his assistant and actor, and so on.
