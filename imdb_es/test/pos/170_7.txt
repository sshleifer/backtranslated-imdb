Sorry for the phrase "extremely intelligent". I do not know what I was thinking, but I really could not help it. <br /> <br /> A long time ago I wanted to see 'Bloody Birthday' and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this movie by accident and for such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American town and it is very unlikely that these things will happen. It is a pity that some of these "gems" of the 80s are now almost completely forgotten. 'Bloody Birthday' is one of those films that, surprisingly, is old enough to remain visible today. It's not a masterpiece for sure, but it's still entertaining and guess what? ... really does not have funny scenes without intention. I know it's a surprise if we take into account that this is a low budget movie of the early 80's about a group of evil children who kill people. But believe me, the movie remains respectable and visible for the most part. <br /> <br /> In 'Blood Birthday', the story revolves around three children who were born during a total eclipse. According to astrology, during eclipses, the sun and the moon block Saturn, which controls emotions. As a result, the three children that are born that day, eventually become indifferent and evil. Since they do not experience any remorse, these 10-year-old children basically face everyone who gets in their way, including their own parents and siblings ... and they kill them! The count of corpses increases day after day and the police authorities believe that there is a psychopath stalking around the place. Meanwhile, Debbie, Curtis and Steven, do not hesitate to continue murdering people, as no one seems to suspect those sweet angel faces (?) <br /> <br /> As I said before, 'Bloody Birthday' Surprisingly NOT it is funny. I know I said that before, but I'm really surprised by this. I expected some hilariously bad scenes, but the movie showed that I was wrong. It is true that it is not exactly what most people would consider a "serious" horror movie, but if I have to be fair, I would say that the story is decently executed. One of the most important reasons why one would normally expect situations of laughter (as I did), is because in these types of movies in which the main villains are children, young actors tend to be simply frightening and make everything be ridiculous Let's face it: children tend to be horrible actors, which is understandable and we can not blame them for that. But to my surprise, the three young actors who played the ruthless murderers in this movie, looked very disturbing and not at all funny. The rest of the actors are also good and if you're a fan of George Clooney, you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie. Yes, I know, who cares? In addition, Julie Brown, the great actress, singer, comedian and gay icon, offers a solid performance as the naughty older sister and, in case anyone is interested in nudity: she also strips in one of the scenes and looks very well naked. What a pity that I did not have more time on the screen! Julie is "absolutely fabulous": P <br /> <br /> So, basically, this movie is fine if you're in the mood for some modest horror of the 80s. My only objection to 'Bloody Birthday' would be the way to justify the children's motives. This is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film. Let's see: if the children born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers, then why were these three the only ones who actually murdered people? I'm sure there were other children who were born the same day ... and also on other days of total eclipse, good! In general, it's not a big deal, it's just a simple observation, that's all. I've seen worse things, trust me. Take 'The Children' (1980), for example, in which the precocious murderer gets his evil after becoming zombies by toxic clouds. No, believe me, 'Bloody Birthday' is much more decent and, if you enjoy the simple slashers, you will enjoy it a lot. <br /> <br /> So, you know: you're invited to the children's birthday party ... and the hosts will serve a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests. Come on, you can not miss it;)
