Well, I grew up in Who, but I have not loved a doctor since Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love Who again and I'll be furious with him forever to leave. <br /> <br /> The writing is great, the acting excellent, the direction (which was terrible in the old days) is just fantastic. I was very skeptical about this program, and I saw it just for being forced, but now I am a big fan and I love it (I have a call tone from a Dalek shouting "Exterminate" then). <br /> <br /> Some of the things that I love about the new program: 1) people realize when Rose (Billie Piper) disappears from the planet. Some of the old programs that an assistant would leave for a while, and then return home as if nothing had happened, nobody noticed. 2) Chris Eccleston's doctor loves Rose, whether romantic or not, but there is no doubt that she loves and cares for her partner. It would destroy the world if it had to save it, of what was lacking in the previous program, often a doctor would not mind if he never saw his assistants again. 3) They talk and think like real people: when Rose is shown something extravagant or new (like the aliens) she acts like a real person, astonished. I never liked it when an assistant of the old show, who never saw anything strange, simply fit and adapted instantly. I want to see the surprise on Rose's face when she sees a plastic doll come to life. She gives it to me. <br /> <br /> The few things that I do not like about this series: 1) almost everything happens on earth (London or Cardiff) and I was hoping for a show more out of the world. 2) That Eccleston went so fast, it really made the show brilliant. <br /> <br /> But I can leave those few things, I enjoy much more of the series than I expected, so I do not care if they have things on earth. <br /> <br /> Just do not take this program seriously: it's fun, it's smart, it's entertaining, but it's not a very serious heavy-duty program. It's pure fun, and pure British, and I can not get enough. Look at it with an open mind, and simply put your brain in neutral and have fun! <br /> <br /> ps, do not look at series 2 or later. The series 1 was brilliant, the first episodes of the series 2 were good, but you do not see it once it arrives at Love and Monsters. The total trash, completely destroys the show.
