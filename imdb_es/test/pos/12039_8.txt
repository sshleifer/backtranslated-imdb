This is not far from the trash that Bollywood normally does, but there is something really good. <br /> <br /> The title song is one of the best in Bollywood and is disturbing at all times. This is one of the films (along with Baazigar, a must-see film in Bollywood) that Shah Rukh Khan made, and for that you have to see it. <br /> <br /> Other reviews reveal the story: it's a pretty basic idea: ShaRukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this movie an extra star. <br /> <br /> It's pretty corny, but it's definitely worth seeing if you're new to Bollywood or not! 8/10
