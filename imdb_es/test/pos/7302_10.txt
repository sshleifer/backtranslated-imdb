This movie is excellent in how it portrays the reality of sexual abuse. The daughters perfectly express their conflicting emotions of affection and betrayal. The stage in the place is absorbing and the soundtrack is discreet and moving. This film is a postgraduate course in a reality that is very little recognized in American society. Personally, I am scared by the names of the characters, the character of Lange is Ginny Cook Smith, my name is Connie Cook Smith and my mother is Genny Cook. The youngest daughter is Caroline Cook, which is the name of my sister, and the father is Larry Cook, the name of my cousin. But the sexual abuse was not in our immediate family.
