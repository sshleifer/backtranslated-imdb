"Subspecies", like many other horror movies, gets a raw deal in IMDb. Most moviegoers feel a great disdain for horror, and when they rent horror movies from time to time, they want to laugh at them or tremble from excessively bloody scenes. Unfortunately, "subspecies" is not particularly ridiculous, and it's not that bloody, so it gets a low rating. That's too bad. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a lot to criticize here. Those who are not actors are flat, the subspecies have a poor special effect and the night scenes have too bright lighting. But what are you waiting for? For a direct horror film to video, "Subspecies" has decent production values ​​and more integrity than you could anticipate. The Romanian scene of the film is virtually unique (I think it was the first American film made in that country, post-communism), and the locations, both indoor and outdoor, are beautiful. The script has moments of intelligence, especially when it delves into local folklore (all that is false, I'm sure). Somehow, the location of the filming and the elegant script work well together: "Subspecies" has its own very distinctive world. Risking me to curse with weak praise ... could be much more foolish. <br /> <br /> Fans of the most horrifying aspects of horror will no doubt get angry with the vampire villain who kills the blood, Radu. It is quite effective in this movie (powerful, with a memorable raspy voice), but I like it more in the aftermath, when the actor Anders Hove gives a more self-taught camper performance. A totally sincere Radu is something silly. Other foolish aspects include free nudity and the subspecies itself, which are clearly only in the film because producer Charles Band has a fetish for the little evil creatures (see also Puppetmaster and Demonic Toys). <br /> <br /> But I also stop a lot in the flaws of the movie. For what it is, the horror of the vampire direct to the video, "Subspecies" is perfectly fine. The sequels have better production values, more violence and something more reflective, so I recommend them even more. Still, this is not a bad start for the series.
