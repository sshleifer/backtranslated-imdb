First, let me say that it seems to me that films like Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile, and most of Spielberg is absolutely horrible and my stomach churns. Although, National Velvet on the surface seems to be in the same genre and has moments that are worth it, I enjoyed it thoroughly, laughing and screaming throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The premise of the plot A girl with an unknown horse from a small town that enters the Grand National is certainly as unlikely as it could be, but it is the only thing that must be accepted to work as a story of Fairies or an allegory. The characters have depth and grow throughout the story. Ann Revere offers an absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women to have been depicted in an American movie. His interaction with the good heart of Donald Crisp is fun and sweet. While Liz Taylor tries too hard to be even prettier than Margaret O'Brien (she succeeds), her passion and love for her horse shines in her face. Mickey Rooney offers a beautifully nuanced interpretation of the coach. <br /> <br /> This is far from being a perfect movie. Some of the situations and scenes are a little cheesy and outdated (the pranks of the kids and the scenes of Rooney on the track and in the pub, for example) but it does not matter. The plot remains faithful to the characters and is left largely unspoken. We do not have too dramatic unnatural moments and preaching, sometimes more is less. The final scene is a great example of this: emotional dialogue is left to the viewer to complete. <br /> <br /> Discreet actions, rounded characters, concise dialogue, intelligent and internally coherent story. We believe in the characters and we are moved by their story. Yes, they just do not do it that way anymore ...
