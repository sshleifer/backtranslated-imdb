Okay, first of all, if you're not a fan of the whole low-budget horror genre, do not worry about this. You really need to be a fan to get the gag. <br /> <br /> The movement is basically about snakes ... on a train. Many of them. <br /> <br /> There is an old curse involved and a crazy ending that I will not ruin. The bloody effect is full and disgusting ... but the film is mainly a big joke about snakes that scare a lot of people trapped in a train. <br /> <br /> The suspense has accumulated. Well, and there are some memorable and well-composed scenes ... some of the performances are a bit hammy (watch out for surf types), but that's not really the point ... Give this movie a shot. Know what to expect and you will not regret it!
