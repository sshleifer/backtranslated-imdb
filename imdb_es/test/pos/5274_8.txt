This is a puzzling, short nonsense. A miller, dressed in white, is heading towards us from a windmill in a desolate landscape. Although the image is reduced, here is an obvious logic. However, the sweep stops him, all in black due to his work. They begin to hit each other for no particular reason: did the annoying fanatic insult the soot sweep? Is this class war? <br /> <br /> Whatever it is, he throws bags of grain at his opponent that fly through the fight, doing everything he had done before the fight, making the windmill redundant, so that everything It becomes as useless as the fight. . The grain of the miller whitens the blackness of the sweep; the later westerns would not be so subtle, the heroes and the villains would be coded by colors. Is there a racial dye here? <br /> <br /> If this was not wonderful enough, the fighters are kicked off the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere, an appropriately Kafkaesque ending to a strange story (or are they just the Increasing social awareness? Against a fight that denies order and purpose?), and very unusual in the days of early silent movies. This mix of comedy, surrealism and the absurd is an obvious precursor of BUster Keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, the "Foreign Correspondent" of Hitchcock.
