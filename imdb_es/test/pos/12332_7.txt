I was a little surprised at the PG rating on the back of the DVD case. I certainly would not want my children to see this. I think this would scare a 10-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Argument: A girl who tries to fit into the gang is harassed and tormented by the "crowd". They convince her to spend the night in this spooky mausoleum (which reminded me of Ghost ...) and proceed to torment her in the night. Little do they know, a recently deceased clairvoyant is coming back to life and resurrecting the dead around him! It sounds terribly corny, but given the age and the budget, which was certainly quite small, this movie is fun on many levels. <br /> <br /> Watch an EG newspaper early as one of the crowd brats. I enjoyed it and it scared my girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 children.
