Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator when describing this as a fascinating, fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It is not necessary to watch all the episodes, since the first ones are the best ones, while the last ones are a bit tedious, but for anyone who likes German and its affable ways, all the episodes are worth seeing. In typical German fashion, values ​​are constantly questioned, even their murderous Nazi past faces in recent episodes, rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany, preferably in the original language! <br /> <br />
