One of the genres that flourished during the 1930s was the variation of the crime fiction known as "the mystery of murder", since the addition of sound to the films helped to make a more faithful translation to the film than the audiences experienced in the original. theater plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by highlighting the horror elements of the plots, the murder mystery movies experienced a popularity almost equal to that of the previous decade (in which the first films were produced). of the genre). The aspiring dramatist Charles Belden saw in this renewed interest in the murder mysteries the opportunity to make a name for himself, after Warner Bros. chose his three-act play, "The Wax Works", to create the film of Terror of 1933, "Mystery of the Wax Museum". Belden joined independent filmmaker Frank R. Strayer to continue making films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of his best. <br /> <br /> In "The Ghost Walks," John Miljan plays Prescott Ames, a young playwright who wants to impress a famous Broadway producer named Herman Wood (Richard Carle) with his new play. Ames takes Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) to his country house to read his game, but his car ends up trapped in the mud during a terrible storm. The three men seek refuge in an old mansion that is owned by one of the old acquaintances of Ames. Inside the house, Wood and Homer are witnesses of the strange relation between Ames and the owners of the houses, nevertheless, all this is a plan conceived to impress to Wood: all in the house are actors who play a role in their mystery of murder. Unfortunately, the murder is actually committed, and while Wood and Homer believe that everything is false (after discovering the original plan of Ames), the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real murderer. <br /> <br /> As expected, Charles Belden's script for "The Ghost Walks" presents the classic elements of the murder mystery stories of his time, as we have the stormy night in an old dark house as a stage, the obligatory group of suspects and the touch of comedy. However, the interesting thing here is how Belden makes the film a real parody in the genre with the many twists he puts into his story to play with the clichés of murder mystery plays. The dialogues are excellent, full of wit and cheerful charm, and although the plot certainly loses a lot of steam at the end (it follows the routine of the mystery of murder anyway), it never ceases to be interesting and entertaining thanks to its intelligent twists and especially its peculiar characters. Interestingly, there is an obvious gay subtext that, while it is stereotyped, never denigrates and is sometimes really fun. <br /> <br /> In 1934, director Frank R. Strayer was already an experienced artisan in the film industry. , but his association with writer Charles Belden would give him a couple of his most interesting films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of them. Although obviously made with a reduced budget and production values ​​typical of independent films of his time, Strayer manages to take advantage of his set and makes an atmospheric film that fits perfectly with the tone and tone of the story. The rhythm is a little slow at times, but Strayer knew that the power of his film was in the script of Belden and makes the most of it, letting his cast make the most of their characters with excellent results. Certainly, the execution is a bit typical and unoriginal, but Strayer does an effective but moderate job in this film. <br /> <br /> As written previously, the script is full of great lines that make the extravagant characters shine, and fortunately, the majority of the cast plays with this in their favor. Veteran character actor Richard Carle is extraordinarily funny as the bad-tempered producer Herman Wood, who adds a lot of charm to his character, especially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur, who plays the extravagant secretary Homer. Arthur is the one who gets the best scenes, and presents a hilarious performance as the cowardly but witty assistant. John Miljan is effective as Presocott Ames, nothing surprising, but nothing really bad, and the same could be said of June Collyer as Gloria Shaw (the compulsory love interest), who is well. However, Donald Kirke is really funny as the malicious Terry Shaw, and it's a shame he has not had more time on screen. <br /> <br /> As usual in the films of Frank R. Strayer, the low budget seriously harms the film. While Strayer does the best he can, the film sometimes still feels a bit simple. However, the main problem is the problem of the very slow pace it has, because even when the movie is full of brilliant moments of witty dialogue, it moves at such a slow pace that it can become boring and tedious for a few moments. It must also be said that, although they are effective in their roles, Miljan and Collyer are quite boring and average compared to Arthur and Carle, and one would wish that the film had been more focused on the couple of comedies that do that in the main couple . Finally, as written above, the end is a little weak and is not up to the first and middle parts, although the credit must go to Belden to keep the creative twists of the plot that appear until the end. <br /> <br /> One could say that Charles Belden is an unknown hero of the murder mystery genre, since among the many horror and mystery films that came out of the B movie studios dubbed "Poverty", "The Ghost Walks" is easily among the best (The former film by Alongisde Strayer, "The Vmapire Bat") despite its shortcomings. And even when it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre, it's a good way to spend a night enjoying the way it mocks its own origin as a work of murder mystery. A highly recommended movie if you like the genre. 7/10
