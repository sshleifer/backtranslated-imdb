* Minor spoiler * <br /> <br /> Inhabited is not scary, but it is spooky. It's an interesting 'little' story with good acting and a great special effects makeup. <br /> <br /> Basic plot: a little girl blames the strange things that happen in her family's new home and in the playhouse that accompanies her beloved friends. <br /> <br /> The film does not waste time moving, although the ending could have been more complicated. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to those who expect / want extreme horror, but I recommend it to those who want a cooler and not necessarily a thriller.
