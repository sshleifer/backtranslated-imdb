The dreams of Karim Hussain are fearsome. When the right hemisphere of its characters surpasses the left, shocking images of blood, dismemberment and various abominations are released. Religion will not save you, neither mother nature nor your own family. The dark poetry of Hussain, because that is what this film really is, destabilizes all the institutions of the sanctuary. <br /> <br /> 'Subconcious Cruelty' is a pleasure for the public in the circuit of horror and fantasy festivals. The opening meditation of the film about madness is well written and is profound. The protagonist's desire to desecrate the birth process that led him to the hell he inhabits develops with a horrible and credible illogical. From here the film continues to deepen the subconscious and addresses nature. Hussain offers depictions of lustful pagan fertility and the twisted madness of mushrooms. Nature is exposed as bloody and violent in the terrifying illumination of Hussain. <br /> <br /> The "subconscious cruelty" is disturbing for all and gratifying for those who see beyond the impact on the mature themes of life, lust and madness. A very good movie explores. CJ Goldman deserves congratulations for his special makeup, as does David Kristian for puzzling the sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki for his score.
