The film, with its unique set, minimal cast, and direct photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those 60-minute old dramas that are so popular in the early years of television. Nonetheless, the suspense weighs on poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic little handyman Robert Ryan before one of her mood swings kills her. And who better to play the problematic role than the great actor Ryan? He was not very versatile, watching him rehearse comedy is almost painful. But nobody was better in the wounded idealism (In Dangerous Terrain) or in the psychic pain of this film. Few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and imposing figure. <br /> <br /> Lupino's problem is that she is locked in her house with a kind and gentle man in one moment and furious in the next. The suspense comes from his various tactics to keep him happy while he tries to escape. It's a nail biter all the way. This is not one of the many beautiful parts of Lupino where it was so good. Instead, it is a role that many minor actresses could have handled well enough. My favorite scene is with Ryan and the teenager Margaret Whiting. Ryan is already having difficulties with his masculinity and what others say about him. Then, when Whiting enters and finds Ryan, attractive looking, scrubbing the floor, begins to show shy, flirting with his budding sexuality. Feeling trouble, Ryan rejects her brusquely, delicacy is not her forte. Insulted, Whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work "women's work". That does it. Until that moment, he has been courteous and professional with Lupino, trying to get in the normal way. But Whiting has hit his raw nerve. Now there's a devil to pay when Whiting jumps out the door, letting Lupino pay the price. It is a fascinating scene, performed by experts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is one of a dozen movies produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these small black and white of favor of wide-screen glasses . Too. What an enormously talented figure was behind the camera and in front. She deserves at least an honorary Oscar from a film industry to which she contributed so much.
