As a big fan of the Hammer Studios and an enthusiastic observer of his Gothic Horror films, I wonder what took me so long to start watching his television series "Hammer House of Horror", which was only published for one season in 1980. I've seen the first four episodes of the program, I can say that it satisfies my expectations so far. While this first episode, "Witching Time," may not be the most imaginative horror story ever told, and does not offer the wonderful Gothic ambience that I love Hammer's films from the 50s to the 70s, it undoubtedly manages to say something amazing . Spooky tale and create a genuine chill within fifty minutes. Film composer David Winter (Jon Finch) is tormented by seventeenth-century witch Lucinda (Patricia Quinn) ... Although his story may be simple, but during a run time of less than an hour, it is effective and It offers many spooky moments. . The Northern Irish actress, Patricia Quinn, probably best known for her role in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (1975), as well as for the fantastic Monty Python comedy "The meaning of life of Monty Python" (1983), she is wonderfully malicious in her role. that fits like a glove. Jon Finch is also very good as David, and while Prunella Gee, who plays his adulterous wife actress, may not be the best actress in history, it's definitely nice to watch. The episode is accompanied by a good score that plays well with the environment. In general, "Witching Time" is a very entertaining episode with several truly spooky moments and a decent start for the series.
