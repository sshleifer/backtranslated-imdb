This movie begins as it ends and ends as it begins. What is in between is a collection of comedy, philosophy, music, observations, commentaries, mini stories, color and much more. Look at the world and our lives and tell the story of The Monkees from the eyes of the group members themselves. He also watches television and movies and makes a visual comment. It also surprises, with scenes of war and shows how we are only pawns in a great game. It says all this and much more, but if you do not look at it objectively you will not see much more than scenes united to unite the music. It's the kind of movie that can never get bored because it's done with a lot of intelligence.
