The definition of a vampire is an inhuman corpse that is supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakjwi almost nailed this concept to his head without the clich√© of pointed fangs and biting his neck. Being an R-rated movie, I knew it was really going to belong to vampires who are really vampires. Which means that the characters in the film are going to do what vampires really do without moderation and, exactly, lack glamorous moments compared to Twilight. Having seen the former Oldboy of Chan-wook Park, I had high expectations regarding Bakjwi. <br /> <br /> I anticipated some uncomfortable plot sequences with our antihero, known as Priest Sang-hyeon, and I was very impressed by his acting as a holy man who is forced to accept this human dilemma and obey his be like a vampire (SPOILER) After the initial premise that he survived the transfusion of defective blood, he begins to desire blood and discovers his super strength and ability to fly. The screenshots make their transition phase without overwhelming the exhibition. Begin to drink the blood of the dying and those who wish to be sacrificed for moral reasons. The often tragic and dysfunctional love story that the priest has with the manipulator Tae-joo is very fascinating, as they are played by Kanh-ho Song of The Host and the actress OK-vin Kim. The special effects are placed correctly in the background and, although it does not offer anything new in terms of tricks and CGI, it was not imposed on the premise based on the plot and the character. The story and key points of the plot are very perverse and grotesque, but very original in their own Korean style. <br /> <br /> There are not many negative things I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I wonder if the transition phase of the priests could have shown that more of the priest had an emotional crisis with his transformation, but once again, this would have made the film last for 3 hours. The movie was long to start. In the same way, to begin with, vampires do not really have much in terms of expressing emotions. As mentioned earlier, this movie is very tragic, so do not expect anything hopeful as you watch this. <br /> <br /> In general, Bakjwi is deliciously dark, morbid and original. I recommend this movie to serious viewers who have passed the teenage phase of Twilight. This is definitely the Korean answer to the Swedish Let's Right One In, which is also a good movie.
