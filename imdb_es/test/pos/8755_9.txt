I remember seeing this in the early 90's on UK television and I was hooked. The international scope of the production is impressive and see how the characters develop throughout the five hours it lasts is magnificent. The scenes set in Pakistan and Afghanistan are of particular interest and, as a spectator, he has a real vision of the culture and environment of these countries during the last stages of the Cold War. The characters of Fazal and Helen develop very well throughout the series and compete with modern shows like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in this area. In the UK, the VHS costs around £ 6 and the DVD around £ 10, a bargain of quality. I thought Soderbergh's version was great too, but I clearly owe this masterpiece a huge debt.
