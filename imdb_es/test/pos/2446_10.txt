I would like to know if "The Outsiders" (Australian TV series) will be released on DVD at some point in the future. And is the music (title theme) available on the CD? <br /> <br /> There was only a series of 13 episodes of this drama and I should have continued with at least three or even four series in total. <Br /> <br /> The young German actor of the series also participated in a German television series called "Black Forest Clinic", which aired here in the UK with an English dialogue superimposed on lip syncing. <br /> <br /> I hope to hear any comments from the TV industry staff about the above questions, thanks in advance.
