Very good movie. Very good documentary. <br /> <br /> It's great to see these vermin detectives humiliated and discovered as the intolerant, narcissistic and ruthless fanatics that their one-eyed parents, the community and the environment educated them. <br /> <br /> I give my cover to Pat McGuinness. Can we make this decent human being participate in some kind of 911 commission or investigation? We need your integrity, resistance, intelligence, clarity and spirit to fight against the rigged game that is world politics and big business. <br /> <br /> All the animals come out at night: whores, pussies, buggers, queens, fairies. , dopers, drug addicts, sick, venal. Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum from the streets. Pat McGuinness should be the first drops of that real rain. The people who control this land are animals. They need you to drown. <br /> <br /> I'm in shock. Walking the night is a matter of fear. The inhuman howl and laughter are of detectives, in Murder On A Sunday Morning. In the center of attention of Pat McGuinness, they look horribly trapped, horribly guilty and ready for a just and horrible drowning. <br /> <br /> It is exceptionally satisfying, in a world where gamblers play a rigged game, to see how justice is done and to watch all criminal narcissists drown like the pathetic human rats they are. <br /> <br /> How does it make you feel like you are dropping, abominable, snakes of the law? How does it feel when they discover what was really your prosecutor's office rigged, your rigged confession, your rigged detective job? How do you feel? <br /> <br /> I hope it twists like a knife, miserable, no eyes.
