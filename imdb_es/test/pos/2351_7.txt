"Hollywood Cavalcade" is a slightly entertaining 1939 film starring two main members of the 20th Century Fox list, Don Ameche and Alice Faye, and which contains a couple of jokes. <br /> <br /> The film is about a guy from Max Sennett, Michael Connors (Ameche), who brings an actress to Hollywood, Molly Adair (Faye) and turns her into a great silent comedian, who finally takes her to more dramatic roles. He becomes extremely successful with her as his star. Obsessed with her work, she is surprised when she and her protagonist (Alan Curtis) escape and get married. He is so surprised, that he abandons her. She and her husband leave and continue to be increasingly popular as Connors' study begins to lose money at an alarming rate. Before you know it, he is finished. Molly wants to help and asks Connors to direct her next movie. <br /> <br /> There are many images of the Keystone Kop type, which are quite funny, and some fantastic slapstick of Buster Keaton, which is wonderful. The movie also has a scene from "The Jazz Singer" when the talkies take over. The joke, of course, has to do with Rin Tin-Tin, for whom Zanuck used to write. In one scene, Rinny's coach incorporates him as a possible player hired to study Connors. Connors shoots them both out of his office. Some scenes later, it is shown that Rin-Tin-Tin is box office number 1. The role of the famous German shepherd in this film is played by Rin Tin-Tin, Jr., who died in the arms of Jean Harlow in 1932, one month before turning 14. Fortune smiled at him even at the end. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye is very pretty and does a good job, just like Ameche, who becomes an energetic act. J. Edward Bromberg and Stuart Erwin provide great support. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not very sure of what it is: history, comedy, romance or drama. However, "Hollywood Cavalcade" is still quite visible.
