Having seen the uncut version, I thought that this movie was very well made. It captured my attention from beginning to end; The tension was beautifully transmitted. Nasaan Ka Man portrays the typical Filipino family with precision in their presentation of secrets and lies. Even in religious culture, the human tendency to maintain appearances and maintain a pure reputation is shown with great clarity in the character of Gloria Diaz. There is not a small scene in this film that has no purpose: the cinematography is excellent and the writing brilliant. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is excellent, I personally found the turn at the end, the revelation related to the character of Jericho was not as shocking as it should be. But maybe it's just me, because otherwise, Nasaan Ka Man is a very clever movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the casting was good, but the performance of Deither and Claudine was the icing on the cake. Do not miss it if you are looking for a Filipino movie that surprises and exceeds expectations. Thumb up to the director.
