I must admit that I am a fan of the cartoons of the 80s, but this is one of the best. Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer is one of the most watched and entertaining cartoons of Rainbow Brite, and is much better than the television series. I especially like the relationship between Rainbow and Darian and I find it very funny. However, my favorite character is Starlite, which is definitely the "most magnificent horse in the universe"! <br /> <br /> I also recommend Rainbow Brite: New Beginnings, which tells the story of how Rainbowland came to be. Have a rainbow day!
