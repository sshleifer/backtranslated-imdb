Many accuse Rod Steiger of exaggerating, and anyone who has seen the Amityville Horror and the "fly" section would have trouble saying otherwise. That said, it's brilliant in this. <br /> <br /> It's never on TV, you can not buy it on DVD (legitimately). In 1988, when Channel 4 still had a recipe for innovation, they showed it in a small amalgam of films from the 60s, Privilege, etc., and I remember an essentially theatrical experience, well adapted to the cinema. The good thing about the theater is that it is closed. How do you make it available and interesting on the screen? PH almost succeeds. Because this type of film is not even transmitted by cable or Sky TV anywhere, it is difficult to hold a debate, but for anyone who has seen or can remember, my memories are of a frank and almost strident performance by Sally Geeson . All of them are taken care of "(which avoids the almost timid general actions of her and her sister in many of the offers of the early 70s), says ref conception.There are several of these key lines that you remember years, decades later.That is the power of a movie like this. <br /> <br /> PS: I just saw it and it's just as good.One day, the television will also light up.
