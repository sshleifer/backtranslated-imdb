Tracy and Matt, Michelle and Sebastian: these are the two couples whose lives of addiction, crime and misery are captured brilliantly in this HBO documentary, raw and honest. They are in turn petulant, charming, repulsive, amazingly stupid and dedicated: to drugs and to each other. They are also very different: Matt is a working-class boy who delights in his wickedness, while Tracy leaves school and supports the couple with Western Union money from his father, who makes a surprisingly sympathetic cameo towards the end of the movie. . Meanwhile, widow Michelle (whose husband died of an OD) earns her daily bread by posing as a New York police vice cop willing to make a deal to her possible Johns to avoid imprisonment, and the sad companion of sacks, Sebastian, live on the profits. You will be dragged into their stories and you will want the film to last twice as long. Unlike most documentaries of this type, there is no coda that offers us an update on their progress (can Matt and Tracy actually keep the Brooklyn apartment? Will Michelle return to Bellevue in search of more detoxification? Sebastian can become more pathetic?). As a result, the film seems incomplete, but that may have been the point. Essential visualization, as long as you are not completely averse to the scenes of people shooting.
