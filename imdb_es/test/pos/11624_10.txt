The first time I saw All the Rivers Run on television was when I was a kid and I loved it. It was great to see a miniseries that was recorded in a place so close to home. Living quite close to Echuca, I loved going to the historic port to see the steamboats. The first one I had a ride on was the Pevensy (Philadelphia in the movie). I love how it takes time to let the events unfold. Nothing feels rushed like most movies are today. The performance was fantastic. The entire Rivers Run was perfect and I love the Philadelphia crew. Mac is always fun to look at with his raw onion sandwich brand after a great night out. It easily deserves 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorite miniseries of all time, along with the Dirtwater Dynasty.
