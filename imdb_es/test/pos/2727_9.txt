Mrs. Aparna Sen, the creator of Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, directs this film about a girl's struggle to cope with her debilitating condition. <br /> <br /> Meethi (Konkona Sen) has been a distant girl since childhood and shows signs of deception, nobody knows why. However, the latent tendency gets out of control when the job assignment takes her to neighboring Bihar, where she is raped by some political thugs. The resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manic-depressive psychosis in addition to its schizophrenia. She gets out of control over the years, progressively getting worse and sinking deeper into her private "world". <br /> <br /> The juxtaposition of an "unsolved" older sister (divorced) and how their dominant forms make the worst situation worse is indicative of the fine line between abnormal and * apparently normal *. Ms. Sen also makes an excellent comment about the social alienation of such individuals. Social rehabilitation is a standard therapy along with all deadly drugs that alter the mind. But what about the poor and the helpless, who always allow themselves to stand up and generally stay on the road? <br /> <br /> The romantic connection between Dr. Kunal and Anu was unnecessary. The cafeteria scene where Dr. Kunal explains to Anu how real his world is for them was also redundant. Anu should already know all that. The dialogue in English is a little uncomfortable at times, although the performance makes up for it. Konkona and Shabana prove that their reputation is worth it. Waheeda, Rahul and Shefali play their limited roles very well. <br /> <br /> It seems that there has been extensive research on this disease, it is very evident. But it is not clear if the MDP can coexist with schizophrenia in the same patient, side by side. Also in the first part, Dr. Kunal recommends ECT (shock therapy) while invalidating the fact that it does not work for schizophrenics, only for the extreme MDP with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> the end of the remarkable story suggests an unknown solution (maybe there is no solution). The film could have ended with a more pleasant note, since all over the world the mentally ill can lead in a balanced and fruitful way, although not very satisfactory, they live under good medical care. <br /> <br /> However, it is an excellent film made with extreme sensitivity to the subject. Congratulations to Mrs. Sen! No one in India could have done better.
