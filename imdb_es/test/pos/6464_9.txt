This is an excellent film that addresses the issue of racism in a delicate and balanced way. Great performances all over the world but absolutely exceptional performance by Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> It makes this film breathe and live. His portrayal of a man who fights against discrimination and violence is simply hallucinatory. His performance is forceful, delicate and subtle at the same time. Poitier, truly worthy of an Oscar, had to wait (due to his skin color) for many more years before the Academy recognized the brilliance of his performance. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes becomes a great performance too. Retired, worried and realistic, as it has become his hallmark. He and Poitier contrast inimitably with the forces of cowardice, courage and human transformation through friendship. <br /> <br /> The film is pleasant and at the same time deeply disturbing in its depiction of racism in the United States. The irony is that it somehow reflects the realities under which Poitier had to work.
