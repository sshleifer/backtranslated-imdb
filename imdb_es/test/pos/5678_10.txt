I went out with my friends and saw this movie last weekend here in London. We did not know what to expect, the poster revealed part of him, and I will not say anything else so as not to spoil the plot, but we consider it an excellent film with a great performance, a convincing plot and something terrifying. as hell! After investigating a little about the making of the film, I have to give it to those guys, the filmmakers, the actors, the writers, etc., for having put together a movie with such limited resources. Well-made post-production, too. For all that I give them 10 out of 10, and I hope they continue their good work. Keep it up, guys. Your rock
