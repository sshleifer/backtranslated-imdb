I am surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this movie. If you are looking for something different, this movie is a good option. Definitely not your typical senseless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual movie, you really need to pay attention so that some people get discouraged by that. However, if you are looking for something to keep you alert, this is a good option. Warning to parents: it has some pretty graphic sex scenes, so look at it once the children are in bed. People who like Euro movies will like this one. Adam Sandler fans should skip it because it will be over their heads and it definitely will not be their style.
