I just saw this thriller again, one that I thought was one of Hitch's minor efforts. How wrong you can be! Maybe because I'm older, or maybe because the movie improves with each viewing, but now I think it's amazing. Every detail of suspense is extracted from the smallest detail, and the final scene of the merry-go-round is simply stunning! Perfect in every way, highly recommended.
