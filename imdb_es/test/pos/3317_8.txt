Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) is killing time to get a job. His true ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby. <br /> <br /> April (Diane Baker) is too innocent to stay that way for long and she falls in love very easily, a dangerous combo. <br /> <br /> Greg (Suzy Parker) is an ambitious and wants to be an actress. <br /> <br /> The three are condemned by the dramatic in 'The Best of Everything', a telenovela play / moral play of 1959 / sometimes solid film that is aging by the second. <br /> <br /> The fierce world of paperback publishing begins, it's not as garbage as "Valley of the Dolls", but not as vanilla as "Three Coins in the Fountain". <br /> <br /> The men in the mix - Brian Aherne, Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan and Robert Evans, are smart, well-dressed and not at all good, for the most part. Aherne is the resident sexual aggressor: she will pinch anything that happens and will make unwanted advances from right to left. His character is offensive as hell, but he does not play seriously. The harassment had not been discovered yet, I suppose. Boyd also works there, although you never see him doing anything. He is too busy being older, wiser and drunk. Evans is abroad just so Diane Baker can suffer in style. He is a rich child who has gotten her into "trouble", so instead of marrying her, as promised, he will take her to an "operation". <br /> <br /> Jourdan is a director who mistakenly has an affair with Parker. They share a fight scene that is virtually forbidden, in a movie like this anyway, but the scene is finally ruined by Parker's history. She ends up almost stalking him, and he really did not deserve such a bad fate, despite his bad performance. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford breathes fire like Amanda Farrow, the resident "witch" who is automatically rude and rude. disdainful of any of his legions of secretaries. Well, they are younger, right? Is not that enough reason to hate a person? Caroline does not believe it, as she admirably confronts Miss Farrow whenever she can. Crawford only lets go once, when he tells his married boyfriend that "your rabbit-faced wife can go to hell" and criticizes the phone. You never get to see the poor soul who dares to cross it. <br /> <br /> The "story" of Martha Hyer, so to speak, is extremely weak, and she is painfully exaggerated as a single mother. Without carrying a huge "W" (for 'whore') in his cardigan, he walks like a pathetic mess for most of his screen time. Worse still, you are not given the courtesy of having everything 'tied', in one way or another, in the end. It will not matter much, but still ... <br /> <br /> It is painfully obvious that all this took place in a totally different world. The people were kinder to each other in general and the work was not a drag, but something exciting, for a girl from outside of New York City anyway. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the unconvincing drunken scene, Hope Lange helps make it look reasonably real. Caroline, who at least has more than one side in her character. <br /> <br /> I admire that women are seen as having an opinion, an opportunity and a choice. It is not that it is not wrapped in a beautiful bow, but it has some points for equality. In 1959 that was probably remarkable and possibly controversial. 7/10.
