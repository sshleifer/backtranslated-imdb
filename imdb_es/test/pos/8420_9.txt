He captured this film on DD while changing the channels ... And thank God, also when it has just started ... After having studied in Pune, this film caused many happy memories of the city ... that aside, one wonders why more movies like this is not done ... All the characters are so well recorded: the grandfather, the child, the doctor ... with the exception of the social worker who challenges a bit, the rest of the movie just has a defect ... a deserved entry for the Oscars, even if it was not nominated ... definitely leaves a lump in the throat ... Who do you think is necessary to tickle your tear dips? And to think that this movie needed Sachin Tendulkar to propagate it. Despite being in Marathi, there was hardly a time when I could not continue the movie ... the subtitles were good ... A must for any fan of good movies.
