I remember seeing this movie when I was quite young and it bothered me a lot. The story I found very distressing and I can still remember the various techniques of bullying used. One in particular was when the other children at school spit on their soup before he could taste a spoonful. They also tied him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because I was bad at games. However, I have the feeling that even if I was good at the games, I would have been harassed because it is difficult to decide what makes someone popular. For me, he is the kind of person who will always be chosen because that is how the children operate. Popular children are popular because they are "great" in some way. Popularity is a difficult thing to define. So, even in the end, when he is successful in his career, there is no difference and he still feels tormented. I found the ending quite distressing since there was no resolution.
