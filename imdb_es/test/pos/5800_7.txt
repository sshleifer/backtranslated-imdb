The Captain and Tennille have released a very good package of 3 DVDs with minimal edition. Unlike most program releases, these programs have not been hacked. Musical and dance numbers are included with the parodies as they were when they were first broadcast. I suspect that some musical numbers on the DVD may have been edited in programs that did not appear originally but could not verify that suspicion. I have noticed some inconsistencies between what is on the DVD and the program information I found on the network. I have not been able to verify if the information on the network is incorrect or if the musical performances have been edited in the DVD programs. Whatever the truth, I greatly appreciate the efforts made by the producer. I would like each released variety show to show the same respect for the format. I guess about half of the shows are included. I think they encountered rights problems in the programs that were not included. We hope that these problems can be solved and that Volume 2 can be published in the future. There are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal between the extras. I recommend this DVD to any C & T fan.
