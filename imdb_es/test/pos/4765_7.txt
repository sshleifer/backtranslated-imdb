What you saw in BULLITT and THE FRENCH CONNECTION is nothing compared to what you have here. The chase continues for almost 15 minutes and is the best you'll see. This film has become a classic criminal drama since the heyday of the 70s cinematography. It is a realistic and realistic portrait of the streets of New York City. With one of the most astute and wise guys that have put on screen, the behavior of Tony Lo Bianco in this movie is great as ice. He is swindling his own associates and making it look like the police are responsible. His childhood friend, Roy Scheider, is a street detective who is disconcerted by the disappearances of gangsters. It can be said that Lo Bianco is enjoying the game throughout the movie. Sometimes, however, the movie becomes boring, but just when you feel like giving up, something big happens and makes you come back. Don Ellis' score marks the tone of the cold and gray winter in New York City and To top it off, my man Joe Spinell appears in a first role as Toredano, the garage man. <br /> <br /> Score, 7 out of 10 stars
