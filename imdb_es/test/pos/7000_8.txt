Allow me to lose a moment of your time to explain how I approached this movie. First, I dismissed the advances because the film seemed to be an uncredited remake of Aliens, which I consider one of the weakest films in the Alien series. I went on stupidly discarding the film after I heard positive things from people whose opinions I trust, I lost my theatrical career altogether. Then I hooked up with Farscape, in its third or fourth season at the time, and I found Pitch Black on the wire one night around bedtime, so I said "oh, why not, at least you have Claudia Black in the". Soon, I recognized Keith David, and I began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could act (so this should surprise me, I do not know). It captivated me. I have been enthralled for four years. I just watched the movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. <br /> <br /> This is not an art film, it is not independent, and it is not entirely original, but it can not break a movie. A lot of new terrain, it has a great success by providing interesting and realistic characters, hard handling action in the middle of a convincing but simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; An absolutely beautiful environment with special effects of good taste. It sounds too good to be true? Do not trust my word ... see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> The film also highlighted the charisma of Vin Diesel, somewhat iconoclastic, when presenting the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would continue to star in his somewhat riddick-ulous chronicles (which I also enjoyed, although recognizing his rather great flaws) and now it's something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big and so interesting to see that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor, but also an intelligent one. Checking the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the audio comments, might surprise you. <br /> <br /> The film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after an accident. Landing in which his captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but brilliant and heroic (Mitchell), but is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities: a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel). That is all? Of course not: the planet is inhabited and the inhabitants are hungry. <br /> <br /> As unlikely and unlikely as this may be, Pitch Black is very well filmed, well said and very well done. Do not expect to learn anything, and do not have to think much, but expect to have fun with this classic of modern science fiction.
