This is a 100% improvement over the scum of a third movie and it is an incredible moment. This is a John Hughes movie with The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought that Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes, once again, really makes this movie shine. Actually they are the only good parts of the movie. I got pretty bored with the scenes of Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable. It is as if they had been thrown there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day. But Chucky and Tiffany were great to see and I really liked black humor. I thought it made the movie stand out more. If you want to have a good time, be sure to check this. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
