What Bergman has here is "What would happen if all those bad things happened here in Sweden, to nice people like us?" And what it gives us, in Swedish, with Swedish actors, in Swedish places (and using what appear to be authentic Swedish military vehicles) is what was familiar to us from war movies set in almost every other country in Europe: everything confused invasions and counter-invasions, political lies, internment camps, false confessions, summary executions, torture, shelters, "collaborators", etc. As in a modern story, it is done in an abstract way, without real names, cities or countries used. But the strongest faction is the "Nazis": they are characterized by being important, and some wear shiny boots for the knees. One even whips things with a whip (well, it's actually a cane). The victimized couple is called Rosenberg. Aside from the shame they feel at finding dirtier ways to survive, and who would not do what they did? What all the above suggests is that the title is clearly intended to refer to the de facto complicity of Stockholm with the Nazis. In fact, what is shown to us is how Sweden might have looked like if Germany had asked for more than mining concessions. <br /> <br /> The first half is presented as a black comedy. We see the "fog of war" from the point of view of a comically passive couple ignoring the troops, the long convoys, the bombed buildings, the news reports, etc. They do not even bother to find a radio that works. They are the latest in "Not in my backyard." They talk about wine and cranberries; Meanwhile, friends are mysteriously recruited and an increasing number of troops appear in the city. They do not show curiosity about the war that has been going on around them for many years. <br /> <br /> The man (Von Sydow) is cultured, moody, and a navel observer; The woman (Ullman) is something more impulsive, passionate and of external appearance. There is a beautiful scene in which the man talks about his violin: the manufacturer, he says without thinking, fought in the Napoleonic wars, but his own interest stops at the cultural artifact he has in hand, or, more precisely, in the that his own warm feelings about owning him, and the security that that property assumes. Not in my backyard! But when the war finally breaks out in his bucolic idyll, the shyness of the man, an irritation in good times, becomes a responsibility, one for which he ends up compensating, as is often the case, as Bergman shows in a subtle and beautiful way. Definitely worth seeing.
