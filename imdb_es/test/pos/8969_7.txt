Charlie Wilson's war, based on a true story, tells the story of a Texas congressman and a CIA agent working to raise funds for the mujahidin's covert support in Afghanistan in the 1980s after the invasion of the USSR. This conflict played an important role in the last years of the Cold War between the USA. UU And the USSR. <br /> <br /> In terms of film shooting, the Charlie Wilson War is a definite winner. It is well written, well acted and well shot. While most of the attention was directed to Tom Hanks for another excellent performance, I was even more impressed by Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn as CIA agent, Gust Avrakotos. The scenes of Soviet attacks against unarmed villages and the refugee camp pull the heart effectively. The film also offers a good image behind the cameras and the treatment that Congressman Wilson must make to obtain the desired funds. <br /> <br /> There are, however, two complaints about the film. The first is that there is a secondary plot that involves a scandal investigation that is not well developed and, as such, only serves as a small distraction for the story line. The second complaint is that the film lacks part of the context of the war. The film makes the mujahedin look like innocent victims, and while they suffered heavy civilian casualties, the mujaheddin were, in fact, rebels trying to overthrow the government of Afghanistan. This government, completely ignored in the film, did not fight surprisingly to suppress the rebellion, and then asked for help from the Soviet Union in its effort. The film also ignores that the United States was helping the mujahideen before the Soviet deployment in Afghanistan. The film hinted at the unintended consequences of our covert actions, the consequences we still feel today, but it seems that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative. (Not having read the book, I do not know if George Crile made the same commitment.) Despite the complaints, I enjoyed watching Charlie Wilson's war and I recommend it. I would have preferred a film that more accurately described the complexities of the situation, as Stephen Gaghan did in Syriana, but the audiences were better connected to the cohesive narrative of the Charlie Wilson War than to the ambiguities present in Syriana.
