I must admit that at first I was worried about Farscape. The opening segment was not very strong and I began to worry about what would come. However, once he settled in Henson's family territory with the ironic sense of humor, the unique and enduring characters, and compelling storyline combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction. The story follows John Crichton (played by Ben Browder), a scientist who has developed a spaceship and a theory based on the propulsion of slingshots. However, during the first test, his ship encounters an unknown magnetic field, and is propelled into an unknown galaxy, where he finds himself in the middle of a fight between the escaping prisoners (on the Moya starship) and the Guardians. of Peace (human executors). He is literally attracted to the prisoner's ship, and after many twists and turns he is joined by the prisoners (Ka D'argo, a Luxom warrior, Pa'U Zhaan, a Delian priestess, Rygel XVI, a deposed ruler, and Aeryn Sun, a peacemaker who has reluctantly joined the crew). With excellent special effects, moderate makeup and puppets and robots that exceed Henson's standard of perfection; In addition to a well-written story and a plot based on the characters, FarScape seems to be a fantastically original, creative and intelligent science fiction series.
