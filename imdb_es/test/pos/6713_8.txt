Tobe Hooper (fresh out of conventional success with 'Poltergeist') points to the heavens this time. 'Lifeforce' is an adaptation of 'The Vampires of Space' by Colin Wilson. The script of 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby] varies a bit as they told me: the futuristic plot became contemporary and Hailey's Comet was added to coincide with its real passage through the Earth a few weeks after the release of the films (so 'I've read). <br /> <br /> The story concerns a shuttle mission (commander of Steve Railsback) sent to investigate Hailey's Comet as it passes through Earth. Everything goes off without problems, but when arriving at the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers creatures like dried bats. Upon looking inside the ship, there is a camera containing three humanoids (two naked men and one also looking for a naked woman) in stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a towed bat creature. <br /> <br /> A little later, the ship returns to Earth, but NASA can not make contact and another launcher is launched to determine the status of the mission. When docking with the Churchill, it is discovered that, apparently, a massive fire has killed the crew and all the data related to the flight. But the three humanoids remain. However, it is known that an escape pod has been launched but its whereabouts are unknown. <br /> <br /> They soon discover the origin of the extraterrestrial when the very attractive space vampire queen emerges from her dream to easily seduce the life force. of the men around him. If you suck her face, you will like them and if you do not feed after two hours, you will dry up and turn to dust. The objective of the three is to drain enough of the essence of the population to be able to sustain them and their ship so that the trip to the next planet also ruins them. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the Commander survives the entry into the capsule (he does not land in Texas) and now has a psychic link to his real realism, the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen while she and the surviving man try to bleed London out of their souls. . <br /> <br /> Tobe Hooper (from 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (1974)) does an admirable job in what has to be his biggest production to date. The production brought together many excellent technicians from throughout the film industry. Production designer John Graysmark (fresh out of 'The Bounty (1984)') uses each of the four stages at Elsree Studios to create the ship's spacious interiors and so on. Filmmaker Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a season in 'Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi' (1983) and three consecutive episodes of James Bond. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with great effects. John Dykstra, winner of an Oscar, innovator of the innovative effects of the original 'Star Wars' (1977) manages to push the envelope once again creating highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Even master Henry Mancini shows up to give the film a very memorable title track that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of adventure. In the acting department, he almost falls on the shoulders of Steve Railsback and the newcomer Mathilda May (vampire queen). Railsback always brings an advantage to the characters he plays and can play as a nobody's affair. That comes from the hand when his mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens in his soul. The beautiful French actress May does not have a lot of lines (was there more than ten?), But her often naked presence never gets old and you have to congratulate her on having the little bells to throw out. Almost all the queen that is there to do is feed and to do so, she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. Work done and where do I sign up to be a victim? I really enjoyed how they pinched the old vampire clichés and still managed to make it look cool but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is explained here: bats (their true form resembles a big bat), coffins (stasis fields look like these), transformations (scan your mind and can be anything), mass sexual attractiveness (Miss May ?? ™ Duh) Not to mention that they even include the old stake resting through the heart (this time a bit like a lead dagger to the energy center slightly below the heart). The only thing they did not touch was religion, but I think the vampires who use the cathedral at the end as a base of operations can be a bit of a wink and a wink. <br /> <br /> In short (yes just 800 words later) 'Lifeforce' is an excellent combination of science fiction and horror that pays tribute to the theme of the vampire while adding different and neat wrinkles. The effects and scale of the production are enough to keep the types of summer films engaged (at least at that moment) and the fans of horror and science fiction. 4 out of 5
