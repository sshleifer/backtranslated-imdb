Normally I do not like this kind of movie, but I was working at home and I wanted something to do half-heartedly while doing it. I was so absorbed that I stopped working to just sit down and finish seeing the last half hour without interruptions. And I do not usually shed tears in this kind of show, but in the end I was crying. Many emotional nuances. Great performance, and good southern atmosphere. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors, and the guy who played Luke was also very good. Highly recommended.
