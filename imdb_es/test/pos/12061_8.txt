I really like this series. His funny and unique style of off the wall, sometimes controversial comedy, is a new version of the genre. While it is a comedy, it stands out for what could be uncomfortable topics. <br /> <br /> Every aspect has a comic twist, and the show is really very good. My favorite part of the show is the rather strange comments from the father, Dave. Your slides break the program and allow a really good flow. It's not perfect, because sometimes comedy does not laugh out loud, and actors sometimes seem to be waiting for a response from the audience, but otherwise, this program is good. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this program, and I am very sad that it has been canceled. please do another series, and finish it correctly
