This is a forgotten classic from a movie, and Harmony Karin lent him a ton for "Gummo". Gummo is good, River's Edge is much, much better. It's no secret that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor that walked the earth. No, in fact, he's a horrible actor. But, he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire of Bill and Ted, and his role in this movie. He is perfect as a kind of adolescent of good character, but very apathetic and confused. Then there's Crispin Glover. I think his acting in this movie is the best of his career. He is phenomenal as the deranged drugged character. Then there's Dennis Hopper, who is also perfect. This movie is just amazing, and if you have not seen it, go back to see it today. It is brilliant. One of the best representations of modern America I've seen.
