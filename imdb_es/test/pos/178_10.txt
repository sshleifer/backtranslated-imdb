The first time I saw this great movie and Alyssa, my star *, playing Frances Ella Fitz, was great in this movie! He was so real and his dog so cute! I saw her for the first time when she was 11 and it was the best movie she had ever seen, and you know what? I still believe it! 10/10 ********** = the best of all!
