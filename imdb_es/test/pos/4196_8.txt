"I'm ... proud of 'Head,'" said Mike Nesmith. It should be, because this film, which has already been ridiculed by many of us or studied and examined by film teachers, works on many levels. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is not conventional. For many, frustrating. It is almost as if the producers gave him the film and tempted it: "You solve it". <br /> <br /> You probably already know that The Monkees television program was a great marketing success that depended on business acumen and not quite. Serving public deception. The television shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first to entertain. The fact that The Monkees came out of the box for a short time to do "Head" is a testament to the popularity and importance of the group in pop culture, regardless of where your head is. Clarify one thing: "Head" is not the television program Monkees. <br /> <br /> So, what we have here is a "psychedelic documentary" about western pop culture from a source that has authority over the subject. "Head" is a film that can only come from those "inside the box". In 1968, the cast and crew of The Monkees were experienced and tired professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment. The film was a deliberate attempt at repositioning in the market. So, he did three things: make a movie the way the Monkees imagined. The most important thing is to reinvent the group to one that is not subordinated to their former bosses, and yes, more fashionable than before. Make a movie that exposes American attitudes of information dissemination. <br /> <br /> "Head", therefore, it really is about the manipulation of the means and its net result: deception. The media are supposed to inform, educate us about events in the world at large and, ultimately, ask us to formulate opinions about these events that can turn thinking into positive action. Therefore, we assume that the information we absorb is complete and impartial; otherwise, how can a valuable conclusion be drawn about any idea presented by a book, newspaper or television program? In one of the street interviews in "Head," a man admits: "I have not looked at a newspaper or a television in years." Is the man younger or better? Even the parallels of the drug are a soft veil of "Things are not what they seem". Do you remember the old joke, "Everything you know is wrong"? The script begins with The Monkees' public admission of its own "fabricated image" and is executed with football, literally. Is the soccer scene in the film a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind "Head"? Is the film a current exercise of consciousness? Is the film the culmination of marathons of smoking marijuana? There are too many coincidences that occur in the movie that suggest the opposite. My guess is that "Head" is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intentional and unintended. <br /> <br /> To a large extent, the connoisseurs responsible for "Head" seem to have fun at the revelry that takes place in the film, but there is anger: anger at the chaos that characterized the late sixties and anger at the way in which the media, especially television, changed the culture in a negative way. Drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late 1960s and still are, but the producers of "Head" want you to know that poor "information" is a much greater danger. <br /> <br /> Wars have been attributed to deceptions and lies. What perfect way to spread disinformation that through television? Repeatedly, the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle to The Monkees and, apparently, all of us as well. In one scene, Peter is sitting in a room holding a cone of melted ice cream, and a monkey asks, "What's wrong?" "I bought this ice cream cone and I do not want it." The film suggests that the first purpose of the media is not to inform, but to sell blind mass. "Head" goes further: he puts any idea in someone's head, and he goes happily. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers know it, and the danger is real. "Head" is a film that creates itself "as we move forward" or is a deliberate statement. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it's just "Pot Meet Meet Advertising," as the critics criticized in 1968. The jokes are about The Monkees and us. Be careful what you ask for, you can get it. <br /> <br /> Greetings: a real guilty pleasure. Very funny. Smart. The fans will be pleased. Find the substance, it's there. Uncharacteristically strange Strange collection of characters. Good tuning The length is appropriate. A lot of excellent liners, including my favorite prophetic of all time: "The tragedy of your times, my young friends, is that you can get exactly what you want." <br /> <br /> Warnings: Dated. The drugs There is no plot. There is no linear delivery of any particular thought. At least twenty-five stories that intersect in the form of coming and going. Therefore, it can easily frustrate. It may seem pretentious to some. People who do not support the Monkees do not need to look, although that in itself is not a reason to avoid it. Psychedelic special effects can kill the diseased image tube or eyeballs burned with acid. <br /> <br /> Combine, cut.
