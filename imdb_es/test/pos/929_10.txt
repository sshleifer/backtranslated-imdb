It's my favorite movie because there are so many things that you do not see at the beginning and so many things that make you wonder "Did Kieslowski mean that or is it in my head?" For example, is the judge supposed to be God or some supreme being? <br /> <br /> Also Irene Jacob, as in The Double Life of Veronique, is outstanding, there may be some superficially prettier actresses but none that manages to convey Beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way it does. <br /> <br /> Tritingnant is also magnificent without saying much and the things he says are excellent, like his answer to Valentine. . . "Be".
