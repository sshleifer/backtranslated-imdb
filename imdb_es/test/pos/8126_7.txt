This movie was a pleasant surprise because I did not expect much. I did not know that some of the actors have become bigger stars in the main image. Although moving to Matrix is ​​not an advantage in my book (I hated it), I'm sure it's an advantage for Hugo. James Purefoy is great at this and Jennifer Ehle is sweet and wonderful. Sometimes it looked like a Carnaby street game 30 years later, but I enjoyed Janis Joplin's second-hand clothing store mixed with the modern mentality of sexual and gender blurring. The real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with your ads is very funny. The group meetings of Iron John's men are a little dated, but I still loved them. It's a sexual satire comedy in the best way and reminds me a bit of the old "Carry On" movies. The British know how to do sexual comedies and it is an old tradition, unlike the United States, which is too cautious to understand that sex is fun.
