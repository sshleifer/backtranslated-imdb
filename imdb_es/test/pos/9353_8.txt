My 2 best actors are in this movie, Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. <br /> <br /> Ryan could play anything from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller, and play it superbly. In this film, when he begins his speech "... people with names like Samuels and others with names that are difficult to say" - it is chilling to see him. <br /> <br /> Robert Young plays the policeman who is called to investigate the murder of Samuels (Sam Levine), a civilian, who is conversing with several soldiers in a bar. Mitchell is the soldier he was looking for in relation to him: his wallet was found in the apartment. But Mitchell is a kind soldier, who only misses his wife. <br /> <br /> The story is told from different perspectives. Mitchell and Samuels become friends and return to the Samuels department. Samuels seems to know the loneliness that Mitchell is feeling. "For years you've concentrated on just one peanut and now it's gone, you do not know what to feel," he says of the war. <br /> <br /> Ryan is excellent as Monty, the psychotic racist. <Br /> <br /> Robert Young (along with Dick Powell) was an actor whose career was redefined by black movies. "Crossfire", "They Will not Believe Me" and "The Other Woman" are excellent examples. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is his relaxed self as the philosophical Keeley. <br /> <br /> Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly as the "strange couple" are also outstanding in their brief but revealing roles. <br /> <br /> This is probably the best film about racism ever made.
