I'm a fan of Dads die hard army and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVDs and audiobooks and every time I see them / listen they are new. <br /> <br /> The movie. The film is a repetition of certain episodes, The man and the hour, Enemy inside the gates, Battle school and many others with a different advantage. The introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move, especially when he did not cash the check (something that is rarely done now). <br /> <br /> It is followed during the first years of obtaining equipment and Uniforms, start-up and training. All in all, it's a great movie for a boring Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Two setbacks. One is the German false German accent (for example, Germans can not pronounce the letter "W" like us) and Two Cast of Liz Frazer instead of the familiar Janet Davis. I like Liz in other movies like The carry ons, but she does not do it correctly and Janet Davis would have been the best option.
