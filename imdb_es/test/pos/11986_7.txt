One has to take Martin & Lewis as a pinch of salt and pepper. Why does Martin support Lewis? So, again, why do all the women in this movie like Jerry? Because he is innocently nice! Martin sings some good songs (with lip sync at least once) and Jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all his other movies combined. In general, I find that I can endure both Jerry's antics before they become aggravating. BUT ... in this movie, watch when Jerry gets stuck out in a submerged submarine of the Navy! EXCELLENT! Buster Keaton should have been proud. I give the movie a 7.
