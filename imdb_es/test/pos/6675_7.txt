Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a patient of a psychiatric hospital who claims to be a native of a distant planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) tries to help him, while trying to understand Prot and find out if it really is from K-PAX. <br /> <br /> This movie does not really fall in any particular genre. A big part of K-PAX is drama / science fiction, another part of fantasy, in addition, add a bit of comedy to this and start to understand what K-PAX is all about. The story (as seen above) is not too complicated or profound, but still offers some twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did with me. There are no special effects or graphics that accompany this movie, and there is no need to have them, however, the music of the film is excellent. A techno soundtrack along with an excellent piano piece makes K-PAX sound like science fiction and makes some scenes intriguing. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is the heart of the film and plays a very convincing alien (Prot) from the planet K-PAX, emotional with great facial expressions, Spacey does a good job in the lead role. Jeff Bridges is Dr. Powell, who helps and tries to understand Prot. Bridges is also excellent on his part. Bridges and Spacey fit very well and should, after all, both have had a lot of experience. Dr. Powell's wife is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays her role well, demonstrating the frustration of having her husband outside and so dedicated to her patient. Alfe Woodard plays the co-worker of Dr. Powell, Claudia Villars, we really do not see Claudia too much, but in general she presents a good performance. <br /> <br /> K-PAX is classified as PG-13 for "a sequence of violent images, and brief language and sensuality", and that covers it. As far as "violent images" are concerned, we do not see too much. A few people who have enough blood in them, but that's it. The language is as follows: 1 word "f" (wow, only one!), 11 "s" words and some uses of the Lord's name in vain. It really is not that bad. The part of "sensuality" is only when Prot explains to Dr. Powell how reproduction works in K-PAX, nothing terrible, only that it feels like "having a madman". It's not so bad at the content level for a PG-13 movie, it could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, K-PAX is not a bad movie. It will not leave you stunned, but it's fun and fun to watch. It has some funny parts, sad parts, really sad parts and, well, you know what I mean. It's the story of a patient in a psychiatric hospital, what do you expect? In short, it is a good rental for those looking for a good drama to which they can relax and relax. K-PAX is a well-made movie. <br /> <br /> Bonus! If you have already seen this movie, I like it, and you are thinking about getting the DVD, I would recommend it a lot. It has a lot of extras to review, and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes. 8/10
