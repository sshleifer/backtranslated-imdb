While Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly observes her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being killed by killer assassins Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her hurt sense of reality is completely immersed in the fantasy world of your favorite soap. Opera. In a state of total denial and illusion, Betty physically and mentally escapes from her dissatisfied life in a small town to look for "Dr. David Ravell" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of "A Reason to Love", a telenovela set in a hospital and produced in los angeles. Immune to reality, Betty arrives at L.A. and becomes "Nurse Betty" when she tries to belong to the hospitable world of her dream lover. Meanwhile, the angry Charlie and Wesley track Betty, convinced that she is a dangerous witness who also knows about her commitments to Del. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty creates comedy and suspense by contrasting extreme innocence and optimism of his main character. With the evident hypocrisy and violence that surrounds her. By clearly defining the difficult life of the protagonist, Nurse Betty justifies the tendency of his character to move away from reality. Therefore, while offering a commentary on the popularity of the telenovela within the film, Nurse Betty also makes a comment about the widespread addiction to television and its celebrities. In addition, Nurse Betty benefits from the effective manipulation of her protagonist's mental state, particularly in those scenes in which she can not distinguish between "Dr. David Ravell", the character, and George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor who he interprets it. Betty's inability to recognize George as an actor leads to amusing misunderstandings, which emphasize the magnitude of her delusional state. However, despite these successes, Nurse Betty suffers from the disturbing characterizations through which the narrative evolves. For example, while Charlie and Wesley are consistently represented as a comedic couple, the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance that the viewer may have initially experienced. Similarly, although the opening scenes establish Del as a detestable man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers outweigh all the humiliation and violence he inflicted on his wife Betty. <br /> <br /> Finally, towards the end of the film, Charlie undergoes strange transformations as he develops an obsession with Betty; an obsession that results in noble feelings of love, and that finally destroys it. Consequently, given that the roles of the characters as victims lack consistency, the processes of victimization of the story seem random and insubstantial. In general, Nurse Betty's indeterminacy, instead of creating suspense, weakens her characters and contaminates her plot. <br /> <br />
