Made the same year as the first Lumiere films, this is a much more dramatic short that the brothers tried until the following year, the "Niagara". The impression that survives is very rough, but this only adds to the visual violence of Turneresque, as huge waves of water are thrown against a solid spring, and seem ready to engulf the camera, the viewer. <br /> <br /> If you look at a series of these first shorts in chronological order, and try to get into the mindset of the times, there is an additional shock in that, unlike the single-frame configurations of the Lumieres, this film presents an edition, which for me in any case, was as sharp as the razor blade in 'Un Chien Andoulu'. <br /> <br /> Unlike the monophonic vision of the Lumieres films, Paul opens the possibility of multiple perspectives, freeing the viewer from the power of nature, avoiding its reach in a way that Lumieres could never . The second shot has a tone similar to that of Niagara, but it is less frightening because, through editing, we have avoided the danger. In a film like 'L'Arroseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', nature is indifferent and powerful, uncontainable for the camera. The basic grammar of cinema puts an end to its supremacy.
