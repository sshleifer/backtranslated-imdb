Enjoy every moment of this languid show with music to combine (the fifth part of Mahler is beautiful, but listen to the vocal part of the third symphony that is used so beautifully in this film). There are many aspects of this film, but the main theme is the overwhelming force of beauty, its spontaneous nature, the absence of logic for love and adoration. I'm also a fan of Bogarde and I think it was rarely so wonderful (try it on "The Servant", however). Note: I recommend multiple visits.
