Hercules the Avenger is by far the best individual entry in the muscleman genre that I can remember. The accusation made by the critics (it is a cut and paste of two previous films of Hercules, with some new material added to make it look fresh) ignores the fact that this cut-and-paste approach solves one of the central problems of the Movies of sword and sandal. With most of these films, the middle third sinks horribly, usually involving a sappy love story or arcane political intrigue or both (the queen falls in love with Hercules and her evil brother plans against them, etc.). difficult to keep this to see the exciting end. Hercules the avenger cuts out all that shit from the original movies and adds a rather forceful narrative from an impersonator of Hercules who makes his way to power. (It should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but critically critical commentary on the rise of fascism in Italy). This also establishes an excellent final combination between the true Hercules and his imitator. <br /> <br /> In a narrower focus, I could also add that the later editing has improved the individual scenes taken from the other films. For my money, the scene of the mutiny here is much better than what appeared for the first time in Hercules and the Captive Women, since it has been reinforced with the reduction of several characters and their complications in the plot. <br /> <br /> There are also floppies. Monsters, spooky atmospheres of the underworld borrowed (literally) from Mario Bava, a whole city destroyed, and the usual amount of lovely babies in revealing dresses. Since no one expects any of these films to compete with The Seven Samurai, or even The Magnificent Seven, it seems a bit tricky to argue that the film borrows from other films against it.
