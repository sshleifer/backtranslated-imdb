Black cinema at its best. Immediately after the Second World War (1946), "Crossfire" represents the good, the bad and the ugly of that era. Monty Montgomery kills Sam because Sam is a Jew and, therefore, is automatically perceived through the narrow lens of Monty, who was a bum who came out of the war. Monty does not like people like that. The truth is that Sam was also a soldier, but the truth is something that disappears when you feel good with the ideologies of hate in which you have been immersed and the world is full of dirty things and that, much in need of your brand of " cleaning". <br /> <br /> Monty is a sadist in winning soldier clothes. The losers of World War II had more than their share and they also hated prejudiced leaders and soldiers. Some of them were hanged for war crimes, such as starting a "war of aggression". <br /> <br /> This movie put its creators in trouble when that other sadistic cleaner from the United States, Joe McCarthy, began his hearings in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire", just to see how good actor Robert Ryan was. The real Robert Ryan was not Monty. It was a great actor underestimated, although underestimated. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire" and try the dark side of post-World War II America. See it to know the good side of America in the late 40s as well. Robert Mitchim and Robert Young also play leading roles. Mitchim could have played the role of Ryan, in fact, he did when he played as a psychopath in "Cape Fear".
