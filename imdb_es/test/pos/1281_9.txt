Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is memorable. The film was very well received and helped the land contracts to do 'Memento' and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Below is an exquisite example of how movies should be made. No extravagant effects or bloody blood ... just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing. The actors, all unknown to me and I guess most people, did a good job of bringing the characters to life. They were all believable and that is all they need to be. The film is confusing because it plays a lot with the chronology but in the end it is very rewarding. The film is a little short to be a feature film, but any additional length would have ruined the style of the film and the brilliance of the writing would have diminished. Although brief, the film has all the aspects that make a film attractive (IMO): an intriguing beginning, an exciting medium and a surprising ending. <br /> <br /> I daresay that Following is almost as good as Memento, your best movie by far. The revolved chronology is equally masterful in both films, the incredible twists of the plot are present and the acting is very good. <br /> <br /> This movie was made with only $ 6000, but the quality is much higher than most (almost all) millions of dollars in blockbusters. The use of b & w can be a difficult pill to swallow for the large audience. Next, you will mainly find Nolan showing his skills to the studio bosses :-). And what skills are ... I've rarely liked writing as much as "Next". Even Pi does not even come close to IMO, although it is also very good. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that no self-respecting movie lover should miss. If you liked Memento, 'Following' is definitely for you.
