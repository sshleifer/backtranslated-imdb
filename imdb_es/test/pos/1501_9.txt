In the late 1940s, there was a series of short films entitled "Flicker Flashbacks" in which extracts of silent dramas were performed with characters like Mary Pickford and Blanche Sweet. Clips of old-fashioned movies were reorganized, projected too quickly, and were given an overlay of spooky music and nonsense. The attitude expressed through this brutal treatment summed up fairly well the mid-century Hollywood vision of its early days: the silent film was considered a hokey, flowery, a bit embarrassing, and just good for laughing. During the 1950s, this attitude began to change gradually for several reasons. James Agee's famous 1949 essay on silent clowns for Life Magazine was a factor, but television played an important role in re-familiarizing viewers with silent films. It is true that television networks sometimes handled the material as crudely as the people in "Flicker Flashbacks", but higher-pitched series like "Silents, Please" treated the films with respect. Another milestone was Robert Youngson's collection THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMEDY, which turned out to be a surprise hit when it was released in theaters in late 1957. <br /> <br /> I do not know if Charles Chaplin was aware. of Youngson's film or his success at the box office, but it was at this time that he decided to launch a theatrical reissue of three of his best comedies, A DOG'S LIFE, SHOULDER ARMS (both made in 1918), and THE PILGRIM (made in 1922). and released the following year). These three films worked well as a trio, as they contrast very well in the plot, the theme and the configuration. In addition, all three features include familiar faces from the Chaplin stock company, some of which play multiple roles in each short. At the time of the reissue, the films had not been publicly screened in more than thirty years, so perhaps Chaplin was concerned about maintaining his reputation with a new generation of filmgoers, especially since his best work was rarely shown. in TV. the first days of the new medium. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Chaplin apparently came to the conclusion that the films moved too fast at the old silent projection speed, so the decision was made to "print" them, which means that all The frame was printed twice. Maybe he wanted to avoid the "flicker flashbacks" aspect, but this was not the best way to do it. Aesthetically speaking, the results were terrible and practically destroyed the action flow of the films, but anyway, that was how THE CHAPLIN REVUE was released to theaters in 1959, and that is the version that was transferred to video and was set to Commercial disposition by Playhouse Video in the 1980s. I bought a copy of the movie on VHS at that time and I felt terribly disappointed with the abrupt stop rhythm and start of the movies. <br /> <br /> It is a special pleasure to discover that David Shepard is restoring Chaplin's compilation. (originally produced for the laser disc format) is a great improvement over the Playhouse Video version. For the most part, the projection speed has been corrected. The "stretch impression" disappears in any case, although the action seems to drag a little at times. For example: in A DOG'S LIFE during the uncomfortable dance of Edna & Charlie at the Green Lantern Cafe, Edna's naked arms are visibly blurred; at another point, during the trench scene at SHOULDER ARMS, when Charlie is relieved from the guard duty, the action seems slowed down for a few moments, but this may be the result of a maneuver by film restorers to cover a bit of decomposition In general, the quality of the image is fantastic considering the age of the films themselves. <br /> <br /> Other bonuses: the REVUE begins with rare behind-the-scenes images taken at the Chaplin studio. This includes shots of a obviously prepared jokey rehearsal session, where Chaplin strangles the diminutive actor Loyal Underwood, as well as scenes of Charlie in his dressing table, putting on makeup and trimming the famous mustache. These scenes are accompanied by Chaplin's narration, delivered in a quick clip. Chaplin also composed a new musical score for the compilation, and in my opinion, his songs for the REVUE range with his best compositions, especially the pieces used during the coffee sequence in A DOG'S LIFE. The only exception is the song written for THE PILGRIM, a pseudo singer called "Bound for Texas" sung in the style of the fifties by Matt Monro (which sounds more like Gene Autry), which is disturbingly anachronistic and is out of place. Otherwise, throughout the rest of REVUE, the music adapts perfectly to the action and the environment. <br /> <br /> It feels as if the release of THE CHAPLIN REVUE's image is, in a sense, its long postponement. Debut, presenting these classic comedies in the way they should be seen all the time. In this way, the REVUE is classified with the most durable and enjoyable works of Chaplin.
