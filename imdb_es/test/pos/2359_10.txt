It seems b grade and you will probably think that there is no reason to rent this movie! But do it I did not expect anything from this movie, just something to pass the time, but I was hooked from the beginning! Two interesting places: a bank robbery, a million missing dollars and two girls on the road to start a new life. How are these two stories going to collide? Just when you think you know where the film is going, it's 180 and you're amazed by the big twists in the plot! It has an excellent but unexpected ending, and you're left wanting more, always a good sign. Rent or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
