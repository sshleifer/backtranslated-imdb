I felt quite sorry that this movie is not so popular even in Hong Kong. However, for all Chow fans, this will be a masterpiece that should not be omitted. This is "Mo Lei Tou" (a comedy style that is based on an unrealistic and ridiculous argument started by Chow) in its heyday. The plot is absolutely absolutely 1000 times more ridiculous than any movie you can imagine. The dialogue is impressive. No part of the film should cool down so you can stop laughing. <br /> <br /> The plot seems simple but crazy for you to start laughing. It begins with Chow starring a junior magistrate (a corrupt one, of course) stuck in jail when he helps an innocent married woman who loves at first sight to clean her of a murder charge that was hatched by an evil minister whose son was actually the true convict. Chow escapes from prison and flees as a refugee. He intends to go to the capital to see the Emperor and denounce the sentence. On his way, he manages to pick up 2 lovely women, one from the circus, another prostitute, while meanwhile master the supreme skill to fight and the bad mouth of the thin Mama-san (which is his future in law). . Finally, he was able to force the Emperor to reopen the case by sending a black mail to the Emperor with whom he met with him in the brothel. The Emperor made him a high-level judge to judge the case with the evil minister. He manages to set up some bright but fun plots to force the convict to commit the crime, execute him while taking the evil minister to jail. <br /> <br /> The plots are very funny and ridiculously bright. Nor should we forget the tremendous dialogue that includes a brilliant fight with the bad mouth between Chow and Mama-san, the fight between the fat Mama-san and the thin Mama-san to inspire Chow to learn the skill of the fight later and also the fight between Chow and Lee the evil eunuch near the end. Also, some of the scenes are also brilliant. <br /> <br /> One thing that needs to be mentioned is that to really understand the film and update 100% of all the elements correctly, this will be a must to master. Cantonese very well. What could be the reason why Chow's early film receives a moderate response from the Asian world alone? However, when Chow's movie began to spread its influence around the world, hardcore fans like me discovered that his film is not as funny as it used to be.
