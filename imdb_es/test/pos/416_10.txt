"Ahh ... I did not ask for any successful program" ..... "We'll give you one" Hack is simply the best television show ever made. A little bit of me died when I turned on the television. One Friday night to catch a little hack and it was not on. The show delved into key social issues of our culture. I found that at the end of any episode I saw; I walked away having entertained and informed. Actually, I'm stupider now that Hack is gone. I no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate. Since Hack has left, I see them as a monstrosity and an unnecessary tension for taxpayers. So for the love of God we have to bring back Hack!
