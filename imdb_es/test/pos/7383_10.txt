This is one of my favorite movies of all time, I think it's great to see her in groups. It's also great for any Alan Rickman fan, he does a wonderful job. It's fascinating, entertaining, very surprising ... you have to see it twice, at least. I have not seen it with anyone who did not like it or at least I think it's worth it.
