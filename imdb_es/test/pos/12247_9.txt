Typically, I'm a comedy guy. I rented this at the comedy video store, and I thought "Albert Brooks! Awesome!" and I rented it. It seemed like the romantic comedy, and I remembered that I hated them, and I had the mentality to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> While this is a romantic comedy, it is played by an amazing cast leader and cast (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack and Nicholson), and everything works well by itself. The script sounds real and not forced, as this could be happening at the news station you're watching at night. Take your emotions and make you enjoy Hunter and Brooks and detest Hurt, which makes the ending a bit unpleasant and fruitless, but it shows that you do not need a happy ending to finish a movie, you just need a sincere ending, which is what everyone has Not everyone's life ends well, and it's shown on Broadcast News. Maybe people do not like the ending because it's not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies ... but it works, it's real and it's great. Broadcast News is a classic at the time, and a good romantic movie with "Casablanca". Well, maybe not so high, but it's the only other romance I can think I like. <br /> <br /> Broadcast News: 9/10.
