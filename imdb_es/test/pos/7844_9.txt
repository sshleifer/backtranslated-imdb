This is a wonderful movie that takes place during the romantic period of the Civil War. This movie is a must see for Eastwood fans and Eastwood claims that this is one of his favorite movies he made. I could not agree more. Watch out! This is a spoiler. Eastwood dies at the end. Eastwood and director Don Siegel argued, rightly, that the end should be unexpected and unhappy for several reasons. They wanted to stick to the book, for example. Second, there can not always be a happy ending. Third, this was written during the Vietnam War: they wanted a negative statement to this terrible war struggle where people died unnecessarily. I agree with all this. It's a beautifully shot movie and I love most movies related to the Civil War. It is more like a portrait of how deceitful women can be, which can be more dangerous than men, therefore, the title has a lot to do with the BEGUILED movie statement, to be deceived. The song sung by Eastwood at the beginning and end of the film is another statement not only against the Civil War but also against the Vietnam War and, possibly, indirectly, with the women he encounters during the film. Wonderful story of love and disappointment and many memorable scenes. NOTE: This movie is classified as R for no reason. There is almost no language, it is probably part of the topic related to sex, but in reality there is no nudity. Excellent movie- 9/10.
