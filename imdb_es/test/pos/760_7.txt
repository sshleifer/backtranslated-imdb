I had never heard of this movie before I found it, as I was reading the shelves of a local rental store. Having seen the latest installment of Harry Potter, I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. When I read the description on the back about "a zealous evangelical Christian doing good" and identifying myself as an evangelical Christian, I myself thought: "Oooh, this should be interesting". So it was. I thought Mr. Brock's story beautiful in words and images; and, unfortunately, too familiar. The contrast he drew between Ben's parents' interpretations of what it means to be a Christian was a poignant commentary on how Christians see themselves and the impact that perception has on those around them. On the one hand, we have Ben's mother saying: "Whatever happens behind these walls, Ben, we are the ambassadors of God, we show the world a smiling face." On the other hand, Ben's father is discussing the truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film. At the end of his monologue, he says: "The more a person parades in his Christianity for the benefit of others, the less I am inclined to trust in the Christianity he affirms." God tells us that true faith is the freedom to choose the truth. , how you express that, the way, the way, the means at your disposal, these things do not matter, whether you are a Christian or an atheist, unless in your heart you are true ". I wish our churches were full of Christians who attribute to this last definition what it means to be a follower of Jesus, instead of the first. What a difference that would make! As a Christian and psychologist, I would like an imperfect but authentic faith on a perfectly polished image any day. What tragedy? to feel that I always need to play a role when, really, I just need to rest in the freedom to be completely who God made me to be. I think Mr. Brock offers a refreshing insight into how this freedom is seen in Christ. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a new look at faith.
