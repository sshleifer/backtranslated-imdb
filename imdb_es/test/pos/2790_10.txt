My favorite movie this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing were smooth, visually beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> Located in Barcelona, ​​the film follows a year in the life of six foreign graduate students and a variety of others. Cultures and languages ​​collide, but hearts and lives intertwine. The main role would never have been chosen in Hollywood, but he played the role perfectly. The characters were very well developed and their interaction was honest and precise. There were two particularly remarkable scenes, the climax was truly inspired. The film is sentimental, and the last ten minutes could have been cut, but it was wonderfully entertaining. <br /> <br /> I almost did not see it, but I did it just to see Audrey Tautou. His role, although billed second or third was smaller, and was surpassed by several other characters. I would like more movies like this one to be made. It reminded me of The Big Chill or The Breakfast Club. Do not start this movie late if you plan to go to bed in half.
