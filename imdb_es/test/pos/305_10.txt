Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing values ​​and social beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180 degree change with respect to the idealistic rhetoric represented in offers like "The Longest Day" and "The Green Berets" which, in comparison, are more like Disney fantasies. The "apocalypse now!" The project, the production and the resulting film, is "Heart of Darkness" updated in a psychological horror story of the postmodernist variety of the late twentieth century. The cast and crew that worked on it could probably relate to the frightening places that the human mind can reach. This is the difficult situation of the original character of Joseph Conrad, Kurtz, who entered the literary world in 1901 and was subsequently mentioned in TS Eliot's "The hollow men" (Mistah Kurtz, he died) of 1925. Although it is not a story direct from Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" (1901) or a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience, "Apocalypse Now!" it stands as a masterpiece that pushed the envelope of cinematic potential. "Apocalypse" is not only about the "horrors" of war per se, such as "Platoon" and "The Deer Hunter", but about the dark sensitivities of human nature that are revealed through the crude and degrading confrontations of violent conflicts on a large scale. Apocalypse now! He does not look so much as experienced. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is the journey of a trained secret assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a force tour performance), aboard a US Army. UU A boat that crosses an unnamed river to the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia, where few Westerners will tread. His mission is to finish with Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), an officer of the Special Forces Division of the career army that was the favorite of the US Army. UU Until he left without permission and renegade in the deep unexplored jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The classified official report is that the colonel has gone mad, but as the events unfold, something else has happened to him that is much more terrifying than simple madness. Sheen's mission is to finish the colonel with the American public, but the wise one. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty episodic. The trip along the river is composed of several vignettes when Sheen and his crew meet with different "aspects" of the war at ground level. American audiences of the 1970s probably had never seen such films before, with the possible exception of "The Deer Hunter," which premiered the previous year. The first, and one of the most notable, is a helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance) which is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves to play "Ride of the Valkyries" from Wagner's "The Ring" when he bombs defenseless villages. His phrase "I love the smell of Napalm in the morning" is one of those phrases often quoted from the annals of cinema. Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted fans will be entertained by people like the Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies. <br /> <br /> Despite all the production catastrophes that prevented this material from getting into the can, the remarkable aspect of this film is its rhythm. The original release (not the later version of Redux) makes a fine of work until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climate confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange speech between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of the shots of Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the most dazzling and terrifying images ever produced in the film. Not even the likes of Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything in Coppola in terms of horrible images. Brando's Kurtz in a particular scene is so scary that it makes most other horror films seem subdued in comparison, which is due to the recognition that the horror is not from the outside but from within. <br /> <br /> Without giving too much away, Coppola's solution to the climax stands as one of the most innovative film revelations. According to the documentary "Hearts of Darkness," Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would sink into melodrama, and the atmosphere of the film's darker tones would be compromised. He was not sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the natives with whom Coppola used as extras in the scenes with Kurtz in "his" village. After the visualization, Coppola had its end, and is one of the most beautiful and disturbing sequences at the same time in the history of American cinematography. I love it or you hate it, no Western viewer will be the same after watching this scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone, just like Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. . Not only violence and the futility of violence are difficult for most Americans to assimilate. It is the naked revelation of aspects of the human condition that seem so far removed from the suburban life of the United States that makes this film difficult for the average viewer to handle, which is as it should be. Coppola did not make a family photo. However, if the viewer can understand their biggest point, there is a lot to be learned from Apocalypse Now! If you're looking for a cinematic experience to reaffirm preexisting attitudes about American sensibility and heroism, you better stay with John Wayne. But if he is willing to be taken to places he has never been, even beyond the rhetoric of "the evils of war", "Apocalypse now" will take him to a world he thought he had never visited before, and the disturbing part That's what you can recognize.
