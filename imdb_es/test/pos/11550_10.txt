Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best types of film and camera in the business, so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect film of the most heartbreaking story in history. Seriously. If I could have found some way to climb inside my video monitor, I would have hit Pierre for an inch of his life. No one has the right to be so absorbed in himself and so stupid, both at the same time, except maybe Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a big glass of brandy. I've never been so angry with a main character. Ok, having said that, Pola X is an awesome movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've seen in any movie ... which means another piece of brilliant film ... and I'm talking graphics here, true. However, Pola X will beat you, so make sure you are prepared for it if you decide to see it.
