An interesting film based on three of Jules Verne's novels. Considering the special effects and computer-enhanced animation of today, this film stands as a historical marker of cinematographic wit and imagination. Karel Zeman has given life to the lithographic images of Jules Verne's original texts. This is a must see for fans of science fiction and classical history. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 9 out of 10. Enjoy!
