This is one of my favorite games of James in the games because: the missions are fun to play, they have a lot of action in them, they can be difficult, so it's fun to make the weapons you use are good. The way James Bond looks in these James Bond games is pretty, you can see Pierce Brosnan in him, which is great and all the other characters in this game look like the actors who played them in the movie. There's no way you can not have a good time playing this game, I loved it. In addition, the game follows the movie more or less as something additional, but it follows the movie a lot. In addition, this game of James Bond has very good graphics for Nintendo 64 and for evil there were no speakers in this game, but who cares as long as the game is fun. <br /> <br /> Overall score ** ****** out of **********
