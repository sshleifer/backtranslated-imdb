The Twins effect is a vampire martial arts movie available in Cantonese with English subtitles. It's a production by Jackie Chan and he makes a special guest appearance, although it's not for those who like Shanghai Noon / Knights and the other recent Hollywood films for which he has become famous, this film is much more special what's that? It was originally called The Vampire Effect, but as a popular Chinese pop duo called The Twins (Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung) he took the two leading roles that changed the title to capitalize on his fame. <br /> <br /> The film will appeal to three types of audiences: those who love martial arts movies, those who love vampire movies and those who hate the junk movies that Hollywood usually produces. <br /> <br /> The premise for the movie is that the vampires are close and a secret society seeks to hunt them before we all become sandwiches for the undead. This bloody work is done by some martial artists who drink some vampire blood to give them the advantage they need, well, it must be a thirsty job! Things are going well enough for the course until a particularly nasty European vampire learns that if he gets a set of keys from all the vampire princes, then he can walk in sunlight, etc. and generally eat whenever you want. Saying more in the plot would spoil the enjoyment of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The twins consist of one assassinated vampire assigned (Chung) and the sister (Choi) of another. It's the twins who really make the movie; With some of the coolest and funniest performances underway. The fighting scenes they perform are fast and furious and are well choreographed with a mix of genuine athletics and work with cables. To add the cherry to the cake, the twins are also very lovely to watch. <br /> <br /> The direction is clear and the script is clear. There are only 3 things that disappoint this movie: the make-up of the vampires is quite poor, Jackie Chan seems to be in the movie just for hell and does not add anything to its content, and some of the comedies of the comedy tried by the hunter Male vampires are pretty lame. Fortunately, the twins save the day and bring an originality to the film that is normally only found in European films. The best scene for me was one of them (Choi) who only communicated by shouting, his ability to transmit his thoughts through this medium was a comical delight. <br /> <br /> There are many other touches of originality in this film: I particularly liked the complete coffin with surround stereo sound and TV screen! And it is the many touches and original performances of the film that prevents it from becoming an old and tired failure and turns it into a movie that must be seen.
