"Meet Sherri ... for a night of pleasure and terror!" Cheap special effects, cheesy lines, yes, it's the original 1978 movie "Nurse Sherri". Beginning in Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmond and Jill Jacobson as Sherri Martin and Directed. by Al Adamson. <br /> <br /> The film is about an ancient and evil spirit that has a nurse in a hospital, then begins to kill the doctors one by one. The performance was fine, but part of the performance was robotic. The story was good, but the sex scenes were thrown there probably to get more views. The address was bad. And the special effects looked like a drawing, the effects did not deceive anyone. The scenes of death were pretty good, but the director mixed. Too many things there that did not make any sense like the sex scenes, the nudity, the soccer player and many more. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a good movie, but not the best one. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
