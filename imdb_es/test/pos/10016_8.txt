I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. Surely it is a bit slow to move in parts, but what more can you expect from Rollin? There are also a lot of nudes, there is nothing wrong with that, especially because it includes many of the beautiful, Brigitte Lahaie. There are also some dead women spectacularly eroticized, somewhat more evasive, perhaps, but more effective. There is also a story similar to science fiction with a brief explanation at the end, but I would not bother too much with that. No, here we have a more interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to what extent one is "alive" without memory. The cover of my DVD mentions David Cronenberg and although this may not be as good as his best films, there is a certain similarity here, particularly with the great use of seemingly threatening architecture and the effective and chilling use of interior space. As I tried to indicate that this is not a thriller in any way, it is a captivating film, like a nightmare, that makes the most of its locations, including an impressive railway stage at the end.
