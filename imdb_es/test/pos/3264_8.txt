Based on their current IMDb classification, as well as on several plot summaries, I did not expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, you remain deeply absorbed in a genre that has been continuously unoriginal for quite some time. Even in terms of staging and cinematography, the director stands out and creates a film that consists of a great imagination. If you are looking for a movie that is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling and genuinely extraordinary, make this the next movie you see. <br /> <br /> I hope that the tragic death of Heath Ledger has led more people to pick up this movie. He was an incredible talent, and his performance in this is one that should not be missed. Do not make the mistake of judging and dismissing this incredible movie before you have seen it.
