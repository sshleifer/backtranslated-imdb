Closet Land. The title itself evokes thoughts of secrets. And that is really what is at the heart of this Amnesty International film. Secrets of government, personal secrets, both are integral parts of this story. <br /> <br /> By far the best performance seen in a long time, both Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe were phenomenal in their interpretation of a Government and Victim Interrogator respectively. With only the two actors in this unusual film of standard length, it is clear at once that both actors had enough dedication and talent to attract the viewer to this small world bubble and close the door. <br /> <br /> A WORD OF PRECAUTION ... <br /> <br /> What is not mentioned in the description of this film is that there is a secondary plot that deals with child sexual abuse. While there are no graphic details about the abuse, the nature of it may be difficult to see for some viewers, especially given the intensity of the film in general. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Amnesty International films, but this movie attracted me because the performance was so exceptional, and I can not stop making this movie one of my favorites.
