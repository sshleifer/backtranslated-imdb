I think the movie Posse by Mario Van Peebles is a very important film. It is an excellent point-of-entry film on the side of history that many are unaware of. This is a story of the first black settlers, cowboys and infantrymen who returned from the Spanish-American War with a stash of gold. The main character of Peebles is obsessed by the memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infants is explored in this film with an excellent casting that includes Melvin Van Peebles (father of Marios), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance of Big Daddy Kane. <br /> <br /> One feels that Peeples struggled to use as many notable black actors as possible (and some not so remarkable) :) Maybe too many, some notable people (Issac Hayes, Pamela Grier) are just one scene In the cameo, others briefly as Tone Loc. The feeling and efforts of Peebles' efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some. The big cast (a feat for any director) works well and does a good job of telling the story in the classic western "vengeance and fight against justice". <br /> <br /> Most notable was the wonderful narrative role of veteran actor Woody Strode (from Once Upon A Time In The West), whose own life broke the barriers, in the context of an earlier era not yet completed , vanished from memory. No other actor could have made this role better. Read the mini-biography on Woody Strode here as an introduction: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of balancing the action with a bit of sardonic humor . The dialogue was excellent although a bit contemporary! And as others have mentioned, blasphemy was not accurate in that period. The sex scene was a bit too much, it was not really necessary. There are some historical inaccuracies, such as the apparent electronic brand of cattle, etc. But Posse is a good effort to, with luck, open the doors to more historical and creative works that reflect other stories and untold events. The real photos of the real cowboys in the final credits were a very nice touch.
