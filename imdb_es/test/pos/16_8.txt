I went to an anticipated screening of this film thinking that I was about to embark on 120 minutes of funny lines, a meaningless plot and the kind of nausea that made "The Postman" one of the most malignant exhibitions of cinematographic errors of our time . But I was surprised. Surprised to find a movie starring Costner that attracted the soul of the audience. Surprised that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Surprised that a movie starring the two actually hooked and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of deep and complex emotions. Kutcher seems to have adjusted the serious performance with which he played in "Butterfly Effect". These two actors entered this film with a serious and focused attitude that shined in what I thought was one of the best films I've seen this year. No, it's not a movie worthy of an Oscar. It is not an epic movie, or a deep social commentary. Rather, it is a story about a simple theme, illuminated in a way that takes that audience to a higher level of empathy than is believed. That's what I think is making good movies and, for my part, I'm very impressed by this work. Bravo!
