The 70s were a great moment for horror films. The Brotherhood of Satan is another overlooked gem. It is filled to the brim with great surreal, disturbing scenes. It's also great to see Stother Martin and L.Q. Jones (who also produced) in decent roles. <br /> <br /> Some of that is a bit old-fashioned and corny, but The Brotherhood of Satan kicks hard on Race the Devil and many other 70s Satanism movies.
