78 years ago ... the premiere of "Anna Christie" announced by the slogan "Garbo Talks!" The film lasts 16 minutes and the audience reaches the climax of curiosity: Greta enters the bar and goes through a long-awaited transfer of silence to sound: a few seconds closing her silent era and, finally, Greta Garbo says a historical line: " Give me a whiskey, ginger ale on the side and do not be stingy, baby! " <br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" (1930) is the Clarence Brown film that presented the great silent star Greta Garbo to the announcers. Today, we can only imagine how serious a transfer it was for the actors and actresses. The races of many had to end, something that we hardly see at this moment. And it was no coincidence that it was Clarence Brown who directed the first talkie with Swedish beauty. Garbo trusted the director after two of his big silent productions, FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1926) and A WOMAN OF AFFAIRS (1928): films that achieved a resounding success at the box office, both with Garbo at the helm. <br /> <br /> But we are in 2008 and that fact about the film, now purely historical, seems to be of less importance. The question for today's viewer is not how Garbo's voice sounds, but whether the film can still be seen after these 78 years. In other words, we all strive to answer the question if the film has withstood the test of time. Has it? <br /> <br /> When I saw it recently, I came to the conclusion that, with the exception of some minor technical aspects, including the still camera, "Anna Christie" is still very entertaining. It is, on the one hand, a wonderful story of a life, of a reality that the young woman faces (based on the work of Eugene O "Neill), and, on the other hand, an artistic manifestation of the true magnificence in the Field of Direction and Acting Let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs. <br /> <br /> CONTENT: Chris Christopherson (George F Marion), a heavy drinker, lives a sailor's life, on a barge. They are full of sadness, he feels comforted by a letter from his daughter Anna (Garbo) whom he has not seen for 15 years, she says she will go back to him, she begins to change everything for the better, however, she forgets that her daughter She is not a girl who lacks experience, but a 23-year-old woman who has overcome various types of things on a farm in Minnessota where she lived and worked, and forgets that she has the right to accept another type of male love in her life. ... This brief presentation of the content is not des from the perspective of the main chara. character, but the one that presents us before Anna (her father Chris) makes you realize how universal it is. Simply, no letter of the complete text seems to have been deleted after all these years. The cases discussed here in 1930 are still significant and valid ... <br /> <br /> ACTIONS. There are not many characters in the movie, but there are two that really shine in the roles. Of course, it is Greta Garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her 15-year phenomenon, the presence that strongly marked the history of old cinema (something that I have already discussed in many of my previous comments about her films). But here, Garbo is a little different. I admit there are moments in this movie where she does not feel very comfortable with her role. That seems to be caused by his new experience with English sound; However, their performance is, as always, genuine and unique. But that is what everyone has expected from Garbo. The real surprise of the film for the spectators of 1930 and also for us is Marie Dressler as Marthy. She is excellent in her facial expressions, in her accent, in the complete portrait of a drinking woman who looks at life from the perspective of "hitting the bottle". His best moments include the conversation with Anna Christie at the bar preceded by her fun talk with Chris. The rest of the cast is fine but not great at all (here the German version makes up for it). Particularly Dressler, except Garbo, constitutes an absolutely impeccable choice. <br /> <br /> If you asked me what I like about "Anna Christie" nowadays, that's what I would say: it's a classic movie. However, there is one more thing that I should mention at the end. It's humor, wonderful wit that shows in everything. Although the content is quite serious and "Anna Christie" in no way has a comedian spirit (the only comedy of Garbo was NINOTCHKA), there are times when you will divide your sides. Do not skip, for example, the visit of Anna and Matt to the amusement park, especially in the restaurant where he asks for milk thinking that it is virtuous and innocent, beer for him and where, suddenly, Marthy joins them by chance. .. <br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" is a perfect movie for classic fans and a must see for all, at least a little interested in the true magnificence of performance. If you are fed up with many of these modern stars, look for those movies and you will be satisfied. Very worth your search! <br /> <br /> Skaal Greta Garbo! Skaal Marie Dressler! Let us take a toast to the excellent work you did in the movie! Skaal after all these years, when wine tastes much better and their spirits are with us in a different sense ...
