You have to love this movie! I mean, what other Swedish splash movie could be so evil, extravagant and totally cruel ... The whole movie is filled with some kind of weird humor, like: The old cencoreguy just takes off his head and the boss just cleans the blood His glasses and says in a malicious voice: - You're fired! wouppie !!!
