There was talk in the E! Hollywood special about the performance of Dirty Dancing, which is still considered by many women, including a dear friend of mine in her fifties, as one of her favorite movies of all time. Maybe the music, the dance or the melodrama around the plot of Baby Frances becomes a dance sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course, this movie established Jennifer Gray, whose most important role to date was the resentful sister on Ferris Beuller's Free Day. Patrick Swayze is perfectly fused when the heart beats the main man who literally drags the baby. Dirty Dancing has it all to become a Broadway or West End hit. It has a love story, music and, above all, a lot of dancing. Jennifer and Patrick could easily relive their roles. It's nice to see Jerry Orbach playing a doctor instead of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as the mother. It all took place in the Catskills in the 1960s, where many Jewish families spent their vacations in the area during their summer vacations. At the end of the film, it's sad to see the hotel owner, Kellerman, baffled by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and travel in Europe to spend the summer in Catskills. Those big old hotels are turning into Indian gambling casinos. Let's let Broadway bring the dirty dance alive and well. After all, they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, this should not be obvious! I know that this movie is one of the favorites that you do not get tired of after seeing it 800 times. There are people who have probably seen this movie, about a thousand times so far. Somehow, seeing the creation and the story behind Dirty Dancing made me long for my childhood days when I was thirteen. It is possible that Dirty Dancing is not the best film ever made, but its universal appeal still attracts crowds and repeated spectators like the 800 club whose members have seen it so many times. Now I see him with affection with all the discomfort of the first days of Baby and his first true love with Patrick Swayze as a heartbeat, Johnny Castle. No one could have imagined this little movie as a great success with the music of the sixties, two soundtracks and even a tour in the late eighties. I hope they bring him to Broadway in a musical. It would work for the public to be part of a movie. No wonder it still attracts children and even adults, especially women of all ages, to see it again and again. Well, Australia and London have had Dirty Dancing productions. It looks like it will hit Broadway in 2007 just in time for its 20th anniversary.
