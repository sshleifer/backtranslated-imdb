I still lived with my parents when they aired on Dutch television. Usually, I was the one who was watching movies and the other was not worried. But somehow we all sat down and watched this movie. This kind of movie used to be broadcast on Wednesday night. It is the story of a woman who will die soon. But before she dies, she wants to make sure that her (many) children have the best possible foster parents. So we were watching this and my dad (the most emotional of the four) started crying. I followed her almost immediately and, shortly after, my sister and my mother were also crying. There we were, totally moved by this simple but heartbreaking story. If you want a good cry, this is for you!
