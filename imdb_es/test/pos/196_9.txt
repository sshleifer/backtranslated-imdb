The consequences of the Second World War almost caused the death of the Soviet cinema. In the early 1950s, film production was almost paralyzed (nine feature films were released in 1951), and the work of all the filmmakers was closely monitored and often censored by the government. After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, the filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their images, although many were reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propaganda stance towards the war that had prevailed in previous years. It was not until 1957 that director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Viktor Rozov became bold enough to produce what is considered the first Soviet masterpiece after Stalin, 'Letyat zhuravli / The Cranes are Flying', one of the best descriptions of War I have seen from any country or period of time. The film was not only praised for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union, but soon followed by international recognition, and Kalatozov's film was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> 'Cranes are flying' is both an invigorating visual feast and a bold and humanistic portrayal of war. Unlike many Soviet films of the time, it was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional hero of the war, and more concerned with the futility, brutality and, in fact, the inevitability of conflict. Love, as a cinematographic concept, is often idealized as a notion that somehow conquers all and endures endless difficulties, and yet reality is substantially less romantic. In the film, two lovers, Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), separated by the advent of World War II (widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945), commit to marry after the war. , but the tragedy denies the couple their desire. Directed at betrayal by endless torment and the uncertainty of waiting, Veronika agrees to marry Boris's cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin), a handsome but unworthy young man. The film can conclude with the proud victory of the Soviets and a patriotic parade of flags, but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly overshadowed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young protagonist, who wanders impassively through the crowd that celebrates. <Br /> <br /> Perhaps the most notable feature of 'The Cranes are Flying' is Sergei Urusevsky's hand-held and dynamic cinematography, which realistically and vertiginously captures the chaos and confusion of war, not necessarily in the rain of shooting and screaming. of dying companions {in fact, only one of the sequences of the film joins Boris on the Eastern Front}, but from the perspective of the family and friends left behind. In a particularly impressive long shot, often quoted, the camera follows Veronika as she frantically searches for Boris among a crowd of departing recruits and their families. The handheld camera follows the girl gently out of a bus, moves through the crowd at her side, capturing momentary fragments of loved ones saying goodbye to her children and husbands, before turning unexpectedly on the crowd while Veronika disappears into the crowd. dust from a passing squadron. From army tanks, an impressive movement that offers scope and urgency to the dramatic episode. Urusevsky acquired for the first time his experience in filming as a cameraman during the war, and obviously fell in love with the narrative possibilities of hand photography: "The camera," he once said, "can express what the actor can not describe: his internal Sensations, the cameraman must act with the actors.
