This episode is not incoherent as another person said. the source agreed to help because he was not going to keep his word, if he pays attention ... he says that after she (Phoebe) agrees to stay there in hell ", HE CHOOSES WITH THE BALTHAZOR AND I DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM IN THE FUTURE "... and also, he did not let COLE warn the sisters as if he were going to ask for an exchange of acceptance, that's why PRUE DIED, because he received a blow stronger than PIPER and in the head, and there was not a PHOEBE to call LEO this time, and in the past LEO said he had almost killed himself. Pay more attention next time! and there is no "TO CONTINUE ..." after this episode. it is the end of season 3, and in season 4 they can not show anything of PRUE because she owns the rights of "PRUE", so the producers would have to pay for what they show. This is the last episode he is in!
