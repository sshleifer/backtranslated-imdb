In school they taught me what some shots were called and two directors were constantly mentioned: Orson Welles and Sergei M. Eisenstein. I did not care much then (it was a child!), But now I know why, Eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938, where we are trapped for almost half a century. countless blank films! Some say that this film is not worth it for the genius of Eisenstein (then they have to watch it again and again until they can say something bad) or, worse, that it is just a propaganda for the Russians. Let's say it as it is, in fact, it's pure propaganda for patriotism, but is not it "Saving the Private Ryan" or "The Longest Day"? I could summarize so many films where the United States is being elevated to the top, why not Russia and in addition to each war, they fight for their patriotism, why else could they raise flags? Aleksandr Nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography, since almost all the shots are a sublime image. Maybe everything is supervised, but I wonder why this is not included in the Top 250 of IMDB, where, as there are so many overrated Oscarcrap, too.
