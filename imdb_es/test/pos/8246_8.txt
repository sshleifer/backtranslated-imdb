There is an interesting division in the voting of this movie (at least for the moment). Those who are waiting for a documentary are impressed, or at least not disappointed. I anticipate that those who give the film 1 in 10 are those who expected a war movie or a recreation of the invasion of Gallipoli. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to see actors, shots and gore, this movie does not suit you. If you want to see an independent documentary about Gallipoli, without prejudices to any side (the only enemy in these events was the war itself), you will be impressed and sober. I thought it was a very moving movie, and I even liked Captain Guy Nightingale enough at the end.
