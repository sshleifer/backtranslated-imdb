I have read many unpleasant comments about this film, and the only things I have seen that all have in common are: "boring" and "unrealistic". <br /> <br /> First of all, they used the real frickin Crocs! How much more realistic can you get? Without CGI, without animatronics, without miniatures. Only one crocodile and one piece of meat. Have fun, friends! <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this movie has a slow start. The development of the character, how little they had, anyway, takes a little time, and I think this is mainly where this movie is missing. <br /> <br /> However, when the movie starts, I found that the action started. dramatically. I do not want to say that there is a lot of action. In any case, there are more times when you can not see the crocodile and people are waiting. However, we know that there will be no relief, and that the crocodile is waiting for its moment. This had a strange feeling similar to that of other films that achieve their horror through non-action, such as Open Water (another film that has been criticized by some viewers for being "boring"). Personally, I think that viewers who feel unable to feel the suspense have surgically removed their attention at birth, but that's just me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the characters feel real and the situation is such that it could really happen to anyone in the right circumstances. In addition, the deaths are completely real and, at times, it is a bit difficult to see. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a winner.
