One of the best war movies I've seen, if not the best. It is very difficult to talk about such films, since it is very difficult to point out any mistakes made in a movie. The "problem" is that it seems too real and that is why it drags you to the ruins of Stalingrad and makes you suffer on both sides. This is because this film, unlike most Hollywood movies, does not glorify war or the heroism of the main characters. Instead, the film makes them heroes just because they are human and that is why it is against war as much as reason can offer. Extremely convincing war scenes and such an impressive performance, most of the scenes look like isolated theatrical pieces. In addition, the German army is played by the Germans, which is very convincing as well. The film is produced and made by Germans, where you can see their love for detail perfectly. This is the reason why "Stalingrad" is one of the movies that I can watch millions of times and I never feel bored. I saw the movie with my father who fought in World War II and the first thing he said was: "This is real, that's what the war against the Germans looked like." This is the place where you can see what it looked like to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of war in human history and the turning point of World War II: Stalingrad.
