Following my personal research on the pending "final cycle" time of 2012 presented by the Mayan calendar system, I think this movie should look as much as "What the hell do we know?" While some may believe that higher-level science issues should only be communicated at the doctorate level "speak", "The elegant Universe" breaks those barriers. The images and the selection dialog facilitate understanding of this journey through the history of physics. There are numerous messages in this film, the least of which is that academic science should always be ready to review what is being taught. It is true that the science of pure discovery is beautiful because there is always something extra and exciting to highlight if we have the courage to seek it against "established" science.
