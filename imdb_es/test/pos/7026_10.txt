I must admit that, before watching this movie, I thought, this is one of those love stories where everything works perfectly. But it proved to be wrong when I actually sat down to watch this. I discovered that it was actually a very good story about a family going to a dance park for a 3 week holiday and there the youngest daughter, baby, finds love but has difficulty getting there with her new love because of the disagreements with her. father. But on the way he helps another dance instructor, and he risks the whole relationship ... A truly comforting movie, like no other. <br /> <br /> 10/10
