I remember a time when the only thing that existed was in clubs, drug pubs and parties. This movie came out a couple of years after I started going to the clubs. If I had never discovered Javier's side of things, this film may not have made sense to me. That night when I saw him for the first time, with some colleagues, I was completely impressed. I had never seen a movie that came so close to the reality of where I was in my life at that moment. Almost everything that could relate to me in some way. There was never 1 character I could relate to completely, but rather a combination of all of them in one way or another. My classmates were not different and we reminded everyone that they were where we or where they were. We had all been together that weekend doing exactly what the crew does in HT. We were going down while watching and when the movie "went down" I remember that I went down a bit more. Actually, it was quite depressing in our room during those "low points". That is what is good about human trafficking. It really takes advantage of the whole situation. <br /> <br /> is a unique film in the way it is not based on the plot, but then it is not completely oriented to the characters, although the characters are important. It always seemed to be based on situations. Situations as a group and as individuals. Each character is lost in life, for their own reasons. however, each of them responds to the loss in the same way. Work at any job to earn money to pay for the weekend and escape everything. For them, it's their vacation. But the reality is that you really can not escape. Another situation that everyone has to face. <br /> <br /> My colleagues and I are not different from these guys. We all had our own things going on. Human trafficking helped us explain what we did not understand about ourselves. He does it in a way that does not talk to you. It made us feel as if we were not the only ones that we liked and that the lessons learned have been overcome by many others, from all over the world. It was not until my lifestyle changed from a party popper to a career that I did not fully understand this movie. These days I see HT, from time to time (as I just did), and I remember the old days. No other movie can do this. I was Peter Popper, I was Jip Travolta, I never went to earth with my chosen family. I would have $ 200 on my back burner and I would batch the lot! Without worries!
