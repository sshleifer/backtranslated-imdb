As a fan of old Doctor Who, and after the mediocre Fox movie, I doubted this new Doctor Who series. However, I gave him a chance and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> Yes, some episodes are not as bright as others, but they are all nice, and yes, Eccleston's Doctor is far from being any of us. I've had it before, but ... The Eccleston Doctor is the best there is. His performance is sometimes funny, sometimes dramatic, sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic. <br /> <br /> This, and Bille Piper as Rose make this series a cut above the rest (Camille Coduri is also fantastic as Rose's mother), and there is a depth to this series not previously present. This series is incredibly powerful, especially considering its science fiction. I mean, who would have thought that you could have ever felt sorry or even cried for a Dalek before this. How many times in the history of this series have we had moments like those with Rose's father, the emergency doctor and the "You were fantastic"? ... so that was the final speech? I advise anyone, whether it's a Doctor Who fan or even a TV drama that buys this set on DVD, it really is "Fantastic!" <br /> <br /> Now only 4 episodes through the last series (and we hope The new Cybermen) I have to say that David Tennant's Doctor is not so good, of course he can disagree, but I do not think that your Doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series. I must also say that, in my opinion, so far this series has not been as good as the previous one, however, the return of Sarah Jane & K9 was a fantastic episode, a real gem. Not to say that this series is not good, just not quite good. <br /> <br /> So, like it or not, and if you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, The Doctor is back and he is here to stay. "Fantastic!" - Almost as many "fantastic" as the doctor! -
