I just saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival at the beautiful Elgin Theater. I was impressed by the beautiful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of a very complicated work and, last but not least, the bold performance of Al Pacino, who was born to play this role, which balanced perfectly with an equally strong interpretation of Jeremy Irons . <br /> <br /> The film skillfully explores the themes of love against loyalty, law against justice and passion against reason. Some may protest that the content is intrinsically anti-Semitic, however, they must consider the historical context of the story and the delicate and nuanced way in which this adaptation is counted. <br /> <br /> 9/10
