This movie is a funny little story about private detectives as if they were not made. Everything is there: Tom Conway is the soft detective named The Falcon, Goldie Locke (what is in a name) is his clumsy partner, Louisa Braganza is the damsel in distress, and of course there is the maid maiden, the teacher with the secret formula, the bad guy who wants the formula and the police inspector behind El Halc√≥n. There is a murder, and the Falcon is implicated. The landscape is nightclubs, expensive hotel rooms, a luxury train, suburbs and beautiful cars. Go see this little gem when you see it go through the television in the afternoon.
