In The Book of Life, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who shows up at JFK airport on December 31 to start the new millennium fighting Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and deciding the fate of the world. There is also David Simonds (Kurt, Amateur's accountant) as a compulsive and homeless gambler. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary becomes something strange and from another world flows artistically. Framed scenes and urban / industrial landscapes full of dazzling lights and shadows. As usual, he introduces seemingly incidental details at the beginning, then brings them back later in fun and unexpected contexts: the humor is simple, but dizzying and irrepressible. Hartley has an amazing ability to build towards small and sweeping moments of the mundane and outrageous at the same time. As usual, he creates a jaded and tired tone of the world but, at the same time, vulnerable, open and honest. He passes a few minutes of scandalous humor to a metaphysical and poetic language, the type of writing that is so exaggerated and perfect that it is difficult to contain the tears despite the lack of obvious emotion. Another impressive and very entertaining movie. The Book of Life is filmed (a digital camera?) With a blurry effect: a sense of the heavenly hand with an imminent destiny and a hyper-knowledge of the present as fragile and fleeting in its last moments. All of Hartley's films have a way of prioritizing the present, but this unique effect complicates it as the images seep through the screen in a way that at first is discordant, but it becomes increasingly beautiful as it it is installed in it. The final shot is spectacular. All this may seem beautiful, but the film is a comedy and makes fun of itself even when it mocks the concept of Armageddon, the Day of Judgment and "urbanity". Although in reality it is quite profound, moving and affirming of life, for the most part it is cheerful and playful. The performance is impeccable in terms of the kind of moderate tone that Hartley has developed in his films (a tone that some people do not perceive and that incites them to judge that they act as hollows, the same people who have a negative response). to Peter Greenaway). As always, there are likely to be people who respond to this movie with cynicism and disdain, discouraged by Hartley's abrupt changes and what they see as pretentious or mannerist techniques, but who have time to consider the opinions of such boring and insensitive fools. ? Anyone who is a fan of Hartley will love this movie, if they have the opportunity to see it, that is. It's hard to say what it would be like on video.
