Lemuel Gulliver (Ted Danson) is a doctor who disappears into the sea, leaving behind his pregnant wife Mary (Mary Steenburgen). Eight years later, he appears disheveled and seemingly crazy, babbling about his adventures in the lands of the little Lilliputians, the giant Brobdingnags, the floating island of the intellectual Laputa and the Houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent and talking horses. to deal with the yhoos, a race of bestial human beings, among many other adventures. The not-so-good Dr. Bates (James Fox), who has designs on Lemuel's wife, has Gulliver imprisoned in a mental institution, and Lemuel, Mary and their son Thomas (Tom Sturridge) must find a way to prove their sanity . <br /> <br /> A splendid adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical novel, this film is a magnificent adaptation on many levels: the story, the satire, the characters, the visual, the brilliant cast. It's just a pleasure to watch it, and it's almost amazing considering it was a movie made for television. <br /> <br /> The film does an excellent job of capturing Swift's vicious satire, which is filtered like an ax through the British. The society of the time, but still resonates today. The sages Brobdingnags and the Houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who find it almost impossible to understand why Gulliver speaks so proudly of the vices and corruptions of his society. The scenes in which Gulliver strives to show that they are different from the Yahoos are perhaps the best, with a scathing satire when describing how they choose their leaders ("they seem to choose the worst among them ... who rule until they find someone even worse "), go to war (" We only go to war for a very good reason, like they are weaker than us, or we want all their land "), etc. The scenes that involve Laputa are also done effectively, the intellectuals are so wrapped up in their specialized fields, they do not have time for anything else and they really have little common sense. And the addition of the asylum plot line vastly improves the story: Dr. Bates is a really nasty character, and when he gives a speech to the question about Gulliver's supposed vices, it's pretty clear he's describing his own faults . <br /> <br /> The film makes use of beautiful and quite convincing CGI effects that represent the very diverse scenarios of the novel with great effect. The contrast of sizes is done in a very skilful way, and all the worlds represented in the story are convincing in their own way. The cinematography (in particular the relative one to the asylum) and the suits are done brilliantly. The edition of the present with the memories of Lemuel is a device that could be uncomfortable, but it works very well. <br /> <br /> The cast is really wonderful; a true who is who of British and American talent. Ted Danson offers an excellent multi-layered performance like Gulliver, effectively showing his transformation from a person baffled by his strange surroundings, to the lunatic state he was in when he reappears, to his rational and intellectual personality at the end. Best known for his sit-com work, Danson shows that he is more than just Sam Malone with this wonderful serious comic book performance. Mary Steenburgen is effective as his wife, and James Fox is absolutely repulsive as Bates. The rest of the cast is composed mainly of cameos, with Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Warwick Davis, Kristin Scott Thomas, Geraldine Chaplin, Alfre Woodward, Edward Fox and Sir John Gielgud being the most memorable, but even the smallest They are very well interpreted. <br /> <br /> Although they are not 100% faithful to the book, "Gulliver's Travels" is a triumph of history and images. You can not miss it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
