The movie Muppet is an instant classic. I remember the initial scene with the bird's-eye view of the swamp and Kermit beginning in (in my opinion) the most beloved song in the history of the songs. At this point, my mother always sang with Kermit. <br /> <br /> Seeing this title of young adult, it makes me smile. I can still sing along with the desire of my heart. Like many Muppet movies, there are jokes for adults that (in my opinion) are still fun today. My favorite line of all time is in fact from this movie, it is the last line spoken by my hero Kermit with green eyes and with the glasses "Life is like a movie, write your own ending". That's what I intend to do! Thanks Jim Henson.
