Even though this production has received a series of bad reviews, it actually stays pretty well for its age. Also keep in mind that it is not a BBC program, it was simply licensed by Granada Ventures when the Jane Austen collection was released on DVD. <br /> <br /> So, how does it compare to other adaptations of the same novel? The best known version these days is the 1995 film with Amanda Root as Anne Elliott and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth. That movie, of course, was shorter, but it was a good snapshot of the story: the previous version, with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall in the same roles, had four hours to tell the story and was moving at a slower pace. <br /> <br /> Firbank is a good ten years too old for his role, but it's very good. Marshall is excellent as Wentworth, a man disappointed by love and bitter about interference. And hidden in the cast are the people who also contribute: Michael Culver, seen later in Cadfael, as Harvill; Richard Vernon, seen later in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, as Admiral Croft; Noel Dyson, formerly on Coronation Street, as Mrs. Musgrove. <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that hairstyles are a bit distracting and disguises are horrible. Still, this should not detract from an enormously pleasant adaptation of Austen.
