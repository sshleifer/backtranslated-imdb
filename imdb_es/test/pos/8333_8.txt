In World War II, the United States has developed a new HUGE bomber aircraft. Lois Lane and Clark Kent are going to cover the story when the plane goes on its first mission. Lois is saved on the plane before it takes off. There are also some Japanese saboteurs on board who intend to fly the bomber to Tokyo. Can Lois warn Superman? What you think? <br /> <br /> Colorful and fast-moving cartoons. The animation is a bit brusque but much better than anything we see today. The color and sound have been beautifully restored. Only two problems: bad music and racism (especially in the title). Apart from that, this is pretty good. An 8.
