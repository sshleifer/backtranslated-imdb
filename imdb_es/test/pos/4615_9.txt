I watched 2:37 at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and I was impressed! A panic scene opens this movie, at 2:37 p.m., set in a high school in Adelaide. This scene is left unresolved when we return to the beginning of the day and introduce us to the teenagers who are preparing to go to school. The audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters and explores the everyday problems faced by adolescents, including drugs, promiscuity, being homosexual, intimidation and violence. Each scene is reproduced again and again from different perspectives of teenagers, and recalls Gus Van Sant's elephant. This is a remarkable film by the director for the first time Murali K. Thalluri. It was made with non-professional student actors and a purchase was made through 76 drafts of an unprecedented script. It features impressive performances by several of the student actors, particularly Teresa Palmer in the role of Melody. This coming of age film is both intimate and stimulating, with a surprising and disturbing ending.
