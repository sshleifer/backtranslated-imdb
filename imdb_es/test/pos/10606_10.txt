If you are looking for a movie that is not taken seriously ... what Haggard is for you. I must say before writing something else, that if you have not seen any of the videos of CKY (Camp Kill Yourself), most likely the movie is not so fun. My advice is to see some clips from those videos that Bam and his friends did. Haggard does not take everyone seriously, and that was never the purpose. Throughout the film, you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot, which can be annoying, but it is nothing that is out of control. Even in spite of everything, the plot remains focused and the story of Ryan Dunn's character develops quite well. This plot that I have been told is based on a true story (mostly) of Ryan Dunn's ex-girlfriend. Brandon Dicamillo is by far the best character in the movie. He is very talented and knows how to make people laugh. He stole the movie if you ask me. In general, I love this movie because of its simplicity and its rarity. It's a movie people from Bam, it's not going to be normal. Haggard is full of hilarious quotes that my friends and I use constantly from the first time we saw him. I've seen the movie 6-7 times and I still find new things every time. The soundtrack is just as good. Everything from Gnar Kill to New Order and some techno. Just do not enter the movie with high expectations, let everything develop and then judge for what it is.
