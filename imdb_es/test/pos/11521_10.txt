I must say that this film had a great cast, locations, music and camera work. Cameron Diaz was great, had a very exciting, very upset, while Jordana Brewster had a serious roll, but still captured one. For me, Jordana is very nostalgic, remember a companion of mine! What really got me in this movie was the very cleverly planned camera work and the choice of places. History is written with great talent. It is a must see. Those who are in mystery movies should see this, I guarantee everyone that it will keep them in their seats until the end.
