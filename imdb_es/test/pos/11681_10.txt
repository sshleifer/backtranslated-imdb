The decline series is amazing and the PS director can not get enough credit for making these films. I am a little surprised to see that not many people have seen this or the other two, but it is worth digging them up if you want the image of punk in the years of transformation between the late seventies and early eighties. The film begins with a blistering collection of clips played on the X band's music. Many interviews with bands and punkers offer an insight into what it was like to survive on the lowest rung of the main rock scale. There is no internet, poor quality work and all hostility in this genre. For new children who have not heard of these bands or who are just starting one, this movie is a real lesson on how to play rock. All the performances of the band (and there are many) are impressive, especially the FEAR that never ceases to amaze me. This and the second installment are amazing time capsules that offer to those who care about the lives of these crazy people. It's true punk, like in the interview with Darby Crash's girlfriend when they remember a painter who died mysteriously / suddenly out of their house and it took a week or so to solve it, they take pictures next to the boy and everyone, including the EMT He laughed at this, and in truth the interviewer asked the girlfriend if she was sad or upset because this guy had died while painting her house, the answer is "no, I hate the painters". What if Black Flag rents his apartment / rehearsal room for $ 16 a month? My jaw almost fell at that moment to see that I was renting a closet ten times ten to practice for 400. Between seeing this and Deadwood I feel like I was born in the wrong time period, only losing those days and nights of old cowboys The people and bands associated with the film paved the way for what is now the most difficult music, and they did it in a unique way. A brilliant movie, ten stars, see part 2 and it is equally impressive, part 3, however, I do not know what to say.
