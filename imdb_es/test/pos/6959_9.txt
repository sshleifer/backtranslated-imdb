I saw this movie for the first time on a school sick day about ten years ago. Compared to the Lifetime movies I used to watch, it became an instant but dark favorite. <br /> <br /> I've seen it maybe twice since then. I think some parts are a bit corny, maybe the plot could use more action. <br /> <br /> However, it captures the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth. The magical realism is on par with Amelie's, and the heart with The Wonder Years. Despite the particular development of my tastes, I still find the subtle magic of this film, the adorable characters and their charming simplicity.
