Chris Penn is hilarious as Jeff Spicoli's brother stoner of all time. This movie is great because it was so much more real and fun than the fast times on ridgemont high. The casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost everything Eddie van halen that became songs on Ou812 and illegal carnal knowledge. This movie is one of the great heroes of stoner cinema with cheech and chong. The fast times were more depressing than fun. Abortions, friends cheating on friends, masturbating in bathrooms, bad jobs and failing school. Someone must hate the eighties to enjoy the wildlife more than Ridgemont. The film even had great appearances as the creator of the city limits, Michelle Schocked in the liquor store or Ben Stein in his first role in the store of surplus items of Sunny.
