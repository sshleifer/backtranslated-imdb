Hears; Belmondo! Look, there's Anna Karina! The great impromptu wave of the United States (or the independent one you want to call that), is not as good as Godard or Truffaut, and it's not perfect, but he hears so much realism, style, warmth and humor. I love that New York accent; "You know nothing!"; "forget this". Like the French New Wave, it's about young people; Party, falling in love or just spinning around. Lelia Goldoni is so pretty; She is adorable; wonderful. Ben Carruthers is also good, he reminds me of Belmondo. A movie that you will not forget. <br /> <br /> A 26.5 constant of 31 ;-)
