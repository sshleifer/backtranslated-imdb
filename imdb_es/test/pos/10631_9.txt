As with all Haneke movies, make your own decision: do not be fooled by what you read and if you are interested in having someone use the medium of the film for your own purposes, see for yourself. Isabelle Huppert is awesome in this movie; combined with Haneke, these two never take the hit. Haneke catches us with the appeal of the golden boy, Benoit Magimel, but this is an anti-romance, and Funny Games was an anti-thriller. You will have to strain to see a lot and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release, but it is incredibly nervous and provokes thoughts; Haneke continues to hold a mirror of how desensitized Western civilization is. People can take this risk, but they are only taking what Solondz did in Happiness a few more steps. Although it is based on reality, much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be seen as an emotional metaphor. I am not recommending it, but neither will it dissuade you ... it definitely divides people, but since it is largely a matter of repression, it is not a surprise.
