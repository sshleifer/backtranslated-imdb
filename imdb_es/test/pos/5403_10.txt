We just watched this movie, in Australia by satellite. As I have been avoiding the news more than usual in the last week of the United States of A regarding armed men, to be absolutely blunt, this movie is a prophetic jewel. A big bravo for all involved. I only had a small idea of ​​what the film implied, as is usually the case, and this undoubtedly came up with cinematographic products. the scene of the scene is effective in the true sense of the word, with all the hairy subjects that face the world today in relation to their own faltering family, even if it is a suburb. The first forty minutes put a theater so professional that it was not ready for laughter when they came. Although the cathartic moment was built through comedy and character, the family and neighbors united in an extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> In general, a forecast of who and what we are. A very significant film and a must see. <br /> <br /> note the date of this revision.
