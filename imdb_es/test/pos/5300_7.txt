The last and eighth Hayao Miyazaki film for the Ghibili Studio, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the cliff by the sea) is a wonderfully funny and imaginative look from childhood. At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by the CGI masterpieces of Disney / Pixar, it's comforting to know that Miyazaki still relies on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell her charming and enchanting stories. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the friendship between a magical fish / golden magical fish and the human child he encounters during a curious excursion to see the human world. The human child, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in southern Japan (based on the island of Seto) where he lives with his young mother, Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko). Sosuke names the strange golden fish "Ponyo" and takes him to the nursery / nursing center where Lisa works. Ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and adopt human aspects (develops human speech and appetite for ham meat) by taking blood samples from a cut on the finger of Sosuke. <br /> <br /> However, just as Sosuke and Ponyo begin to develop a bond, Ponyo is recovered by his father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji) who is a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now trying to collect and develop magical elixirs taken from the sea that help repair and rejuvenate the world's oceans. <br /> <br /> Ponyo's desire to become human has become so strong, however, Fujimoto can no longer contain it and assumes a more human Appearance and is released from his home in the aquatic world and sees again to Sosuke. <br /> <br /> During his escape, Ponyo unwittingly frees Fujimoto's cache of magical elixirs that unleashes all kinds of magical marine creatures that cause a violent storm in the seas surrounding the city of Sosuke. Desperate to resolve Ponyo's rebellion, he soon requests the help of his beautiful wife, Ponyo's mother, the water elemental, Mother / Lady of the Sea (Amami Yuki). <br /> <br /> As in his previous films, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" by Miyazaki addresses various topics of ecology and environmentalism, this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The opening sequence is sometimes instructive when Ponyo encounters a drudging ship that is scraping the ocean floor, discovering mountains of garbage and debris. One can understand the anger and frustration of the character of Fujimoto who has spent his life trying to repair the damage that civilization is causing in his oceans, but who finds it a daunting and almost fruitless task. <br /> <br /> Enough can not be said about the remarkable animation in this movie. It is sometimes strange and scandalous, but at the same time charming and curious. Clearly, Miyazaki wanted to capture the meaning and style of a child's imagination. The artistic style has the appearance of drawings with crayons / pencils and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful. It's almost as if a child's book of colors comes to life. <br /> <br /> Child actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do a great job as Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring adorable charm to their papers. In particular, Nara Yuria sounds as cute as Ponyo that it's no wonder that Doi Sosuke falls in love with the magical girl. Former model / actress and actress Yamaguchi Tomoko (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail) is also very good in her role as Lisa, the modern mother of Sosuke. At first I was a bit confused by her character, since initially I thought she was Sosuke's older sister. It also did not help that Sosuke continued to refer to her as "Lisa" instead of Mom, but I think it's perhaps a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern Japanese family (in the anime series Crayon Shinchan, Shinnosuke also refers to his mother also by her first name). <br /> <br /> The 80s comedian Tokoro Joji sounds totally different from Fujimoto's serious, but he does not wisely make his character sound cartoony or ridiculous threatening. While we do not know his character any more, former baseball player and actor Nagashima Kazushige (who plays Sosuke's father, Koichi) also offers a good voice job. The opening theme "Umi No Okasan" by Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is simply beautiful and touching. In contrast, the Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi theme "Geke No Ue No Ponyo" is light and fun and evokes images of a traditional Japanese nursery rhyme. During a brilliant sequence, the soundtrack acquires an almost wagnerian operatic sound with music that sounds like "Die Walk√ºre". <br /> <br /> However, the film is not perfect and suffers moments in which the central story of Ponyo and Sosuke takes a back seat to some of Miyazaki's overwhelming fantastic images. I would also like to have more time to explore Fujimoto's background story, as well as the relationship between Sosuke and his father. <br /> <br /> Like "Kiki's Delivery Service / Majo No Takkyubin", "Howl's Moving Castle", "Princess Momonoke / Momonoke Hime" and "My Neighbor Totoro / Tonari No Totoro", "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" It's another Miyazaki classic that is a wonderful feast for the eyes. Like a modern fairy tale, the film tells an eternal story of friendship and love that will surely be appreciated in the coming years.
