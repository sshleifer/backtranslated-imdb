First I played the second game of Monkey Island, and I liked it despite the graphics and the low quality sound. Then, a few months later, I discovered that a new game had been created. I tried it and I liked it a lot. The first thing they notice are the great graphics. The areas are huge, colorful and detailed, with much to explore. The game requires you to use your brain, a lot, as always. The game is challenging, with all the point-and-click games, frustrating. The jokes have not become old for the third time. The animated cut scenes are a great addition to the game as well. This is the best IM game that exists, maybe the best P & C game too! If you like cartoon games that are played like a movie, acquire this game!
