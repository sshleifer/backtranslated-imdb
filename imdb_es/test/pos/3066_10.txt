Mel Brooks has really excelled in this movie. No one can deny that Blazing Saddles was a classic, and a breakthrough in this style of comedy film, but Men In Tights has become the apex of his creative genius. This movie is a definite must see. If you like this movie, I would also recommend Space Balls and History Of The World. The same goes the other way. If you have seen any of these movies, Men In Tights should be next on your list.
