"Shadows" is often hailed as the movie that was the breakthrough for American independent film. Whether that is true or not, it is an undoubtedly important film, one whose influence can be traced back to today's Sundance forage. Here is a film that tackles controversial issues of the day (namely, racism) and refuses to give easy answers and show them in a manipulative way. In addition, he treats sex in a straightforward manner that Hollywood will not even discuss until "The Graduate." <br /> <br /> However, the question remains: is it as powerful today as when it was originally launched? The answer is yes. While many important films are difficult to see and date today, "Shadows" retains every gram of emotional resonance when they are seen now. It treats racism as a personal matter and not a political one, so it is still relevant. In addition, it works as an excellent time capsule, as it captures the beat generation of the 1950s and the New York art scene in a way that possibly no other film has. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, it is certainly uneven. Cassavetes had not yet gained full confidence as a director and the choppy edition reflects the film's low budget. Still, the story of the movie is still powerful. In addition, the performance, considering the inexperience of the cast and the nature of the improvisation, is phenomenal. Around him, the actors create realistic characters, some who remain understanding despite their often less admirable actions. "Sombras" is an absolutely obligatory visualization for moviegoers.
