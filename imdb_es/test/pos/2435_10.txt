This amusing, sometimes moving look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940s and 1950s, Robert Sacci, as a retired former nameless cop, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into that of his idol, Humphrey Bogart. establishes the store as a private eye under the name of "Sam Marlowe". Robert Sacchi, by the way, is one of Bogart's few imitators who got it right; More specifically, the body and facial language are there. For a while, the only "Sam" customer is his landlady, who wants him to find his little boyfriend, and his only conversational friend is his secretary, simply called "Dutchess" (Misty Rowe), who, in his own words, "He looked like Marilyn Monroe and made as much sense as Gracie Allen," and he has a passion for banana divisions. Then he meets Elsa (Olivia Hussey), the simple, sweet and virginal daughter of a retired prop master who has been murdered for no discernible reason. In the process of investigating the murder, Sam finds himself shortly: Gene Tierney's magnificent daughter (Michelle Phillips) of Anastas, a greedy and obscenely rich Greek shipping magnate (Victor Buono, who has become an accredited Sidney Greenstreet), his hapless, long second wife who suffers (Yvonne de Carlo, who manages to interpret a variety of emotions without saying anything), his two henchmen (Herbert Lom, channeling Peter Lorre and Jay Robinson, making a Lionel Atwill reasonably accurate ), and Anastas' Voracious Potential, amoral of the Middle East (Franco Nero) that comes complete with a glamorus and an incredibly loyal lover (Sybil Danning), all of whom would give anything to acquire the "Alexander Eyes", two huge sapphires perfectly combined star. When Elsa is murdered, Marlowe's interest in resolving the case becomes personal, and delves into a maze of Los Angeles landmarks, including the Hollywood Bowl, the eschatological and esoteric attractions of Hollywood Boulevard and Santa Catalina Island in search of the rocks. Determined to get to them before either of the two rich competitors. Launch the cameos of Mike Mazurki and a variety of others, the traditional foolish but sympathetic ally of the police force, and a large number of well-drawn character turns that provide dimension to virtually every player, and despite an unfortunate title song , they have, for My mind, a very nice film experience.
