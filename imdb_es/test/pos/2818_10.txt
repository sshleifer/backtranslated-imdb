I love seeing a female lead, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose asked many interesting questions on her compliance trip. Is it possible to achieve peace and internal compliance through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory that can lead to victimizing others? Is someone responsible for being a product of their environment? To what extent can one control or take control of their environment? How is a "typical" human similar to or different from Rose? Finally, would the result or history change if it were from another country such as France or Italy? I loved that this movie provoked all these questions, while it entertained me, it stimulated me and it kept making me guess until the end! Every time I see it, I have learned more about the film and about myself.
