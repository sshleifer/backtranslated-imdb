I'm a Christian, and I thought that this movie was pretty good! :) While the performance was not the caliber of the Academy Award, I thought it was good, considering that the cast has had a limited acting experience at the time this movie was made. <br /> <br /> The message of the Gospel and the transforming power of Jesus Christ was wonderfully explained. The message that the director was trying to convey (which is important, not how the characters dressed) was definitely transmitted. The theme of having the main characters involved in illegal drag races was also a good idea (cool muscle cars, by the way). I think that this film will undoubtedly reach many young people. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie, it's a great testimonial tool! :)
