The effectiveness of this image was best demonstrated by the target audience, namely, the adolescents. My 14-year-old son felt so absorbed in this movie that I rate her considerably taller than her "Crazy City" impersonator. It provoked a debate in our home on topics such as peer pressure and loyalty compared to doing the right thing. Just for that, I rate this movie with a 10! Parents should see him with his teenagers and discuss it later. <br /> <br /> I liked the intelligent dialogue and the coherent action. I thought that James Remar was adequate in his role, but the cast of teenagers really had this image. Other IMDB users have praised the performance of Corey Feldman, who is truly inspired. All in all, I give this photo my highest recommendation. Go for this one!
