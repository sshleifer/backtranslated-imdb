Beyond The Clouds is a beautifully fascinating and elegant work of art. The general softness of the light with which this film is bathed makes you want to touch the screen. The autumnal mood evoked could only be achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience. Or, to put it another way, an old man. I do not know of any other film that captures and uses the softness of light and the seasonal mood with a quality as dazzling as Beyond The Clouds. Almost all the people in this movie are beautiful, unless your idea of ​​a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo, that is. The dialogue does not really matter too much, it's not that there's much anyway, and as for the stories, forget it. Some movies exist just like visual experiences, this is one of them. Do not get upset if you want "simple entertainment", this is not for you. <br /> <br /> I could get excited about the visual perfection of this movie for days, but I will not. If you are interested in cinematography, photography, film direction, etc., watch this movie.
