This is an incredibly fun action / exploit rocker from the '80s. Charles Bronson rules as Paul Kirsey. Villains are hilariously bad. The soundtrack of Jimmy Page is ridiculously bad. Alex Winter (Bill of Bill & Ted) is great as one of the punks on the street who are wasted by Bronson and his team. Personal? Oh, those are the oppressed people who join Bronson to take back the streets. The whole movie is nice, with the last half hour or so bursting into action and chaos non-stop. 9/10
