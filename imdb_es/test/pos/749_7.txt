I thought that the movie Do not look in the basement is very good, with some great characters. This is a young psychiatric nurse named Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik), who is going to start working in an isolated mental asylum. While there, he meets several different types of characters, including Dr. Geraldine Masters, who takes over the asylum after the hospital owner, Dr. Stephens, is killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an ax. . <br /> <br /> My favorite characters in the movie are Mrs Challingham (Reah MacAdams), a very funny little old lady, Allison, who is a nymphomaniac, and Sam (Bill McGhee), a young black man who walks all day and It seems that there is a world of its own all the time. The movie was a very low budget movie, but it was still a really great movie. I know I was on the 'Video Nasties' list in the 80s, but I did not think I had much blood, although I had some disturbing senses.
