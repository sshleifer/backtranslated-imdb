Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are excellent in this melodrama of 1970. The exuberant configuration, the unforgettable music and the twists of the plot make it a really interesting film. I had seen him when he first appeared on television. Once again it was broadcast when I had a VCR, but I did not have the opportunity to record it. I would love it on VHS if someone has a copy. Apart from the suspense (which is very well worked), I feel that the story is unique and quite faithful to the book, SRA. The love of maitland by margaret lynn. I would say that it was one of the best films that were overlooked in the 70s of films made for television. I have given the film a rating of 10, because it is made with great originality. There is a true pathos and air of romance that has the viewer sympathizing with the culprit.
