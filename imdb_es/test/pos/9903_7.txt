I was lucky to see this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival and I must say that I enjoyed it a lot. When I asked the Director if he had attended the Film School, I was very impressed that he did not. Movies like these do not come from people without talent. To start in commercials and then produce a heartfelt family comedy like this, a real range is shown. I will certainly be aware of what he does next. Like a good independent film, the film is very oriented to the characters. As it is attached to your average Hollywood movie, you are mostly driven by the plot. The film focuses on a Jewish family in New York, the Applebaum family, to whom everyone has been invited back for their parents' "suicide" party. The film is full of witty, quick, hits, dialogues. The fact that the small Jewish family is obsessed with being a Jew and whoever is Jewish bases the unrealistic reality of a "suicidal" party. Director Jeff Hare does a wonderful job of getting characters out of the actors and bringing them to life on the screen. The production design gives life to the sets with a lot of attention to the small details that make the environment feel like a home in which you have lived for 40 years. The editing continues with the dialogue in such a way that it makes you sit in your seat wondering who is going to stab who with the next witty phrase or stroke line. And when appropriate, the film slows down to allow the audience to delve a little deeper into the meanings and motivations hidden within these adorable characters. If you are a fan of Woody Allen or movies like "As good as it gets", go see this movie.
