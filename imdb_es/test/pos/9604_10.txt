As you can see, I have sent 2 comments about this program since 1991 ... and no, ITV has not yet made it available for its general publication. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, I recently contacted ITV to see if there was any way to get a copy, and this was their response ....... <br /> <br /> "Unfortunately, no there are plans for this program to be released on DVD / video, however, you can buy copies in our spectator request department, your email address is: viewers.requests@itv.com ". <br /> <br /> I hope everyone has the opportunity to enjoy this short comedy again. <br /> <br />
