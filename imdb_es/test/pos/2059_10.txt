This movie is a great comedy and comedy flurry, it comes straight from the beginning, there is no boring accumulation. The chemistry of the main roles is added to the emotion and the anticipation of the end, even though my suspicions were not met. The special effects worked brilliantly and were credible! I would have liked to have a different ending, but it still made me wobble with emotions. The line of the story unfolds well, however, it is a film that has to do from beginning to end to collect all the details, understand it and enjoy it to the fullest. <br /> <br />
