I saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes. I read somewhere that Oz and Rudnick wanted to make fun of the liberal message movies, but the climax ends up being one of those movies. Also, part of the humor is a bit cloying, Joan Cusack was too over the top for me, and someone has a strange timeline regarding the Oscars. Still, there were more than enough fun moments, like the kissing scene, the wedding that is not, and the scene with the director, to enjoy this. Kline, as always, is good, but for me, the real surprise was Selleck, of whom I am not a big fan, but he makes fun of himself very well here.
