How this movie is not considered more broadly is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I picked it up for Â£ 1, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best pound I've ever spent on a movie. <br /> <br /> What usually allows the films on the club scene to be the music or the actual scenes filmed in the clubland. <br /> <br /> Here, the music and club scenes are completely believable, with some important tunes of the time and filmed in real clubs, with people who really look like they want to be there. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are of a high level in every way, although Jason Donovan, in particular for me, stands out (he played Frank N Furter at The Rocky Horror Show in London approximately at the the moment he should have been filming, so his drag phase was in full swing), and of course Tim Curry, who is eloquent drug land boss, is convincing. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are a fan of the British movie, you should see this, it does not matter if you like clubbing, because the movie is strong. ugh like a story anyway. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
