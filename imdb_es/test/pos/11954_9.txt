The comedies of the 80s (especially those of John Cusak) are incredible. Almost all are hilarious and instant classics and this movie is no exception. Many winks to other movies (ie, Godzilla and Jaws) through the movie that are so funny that you will laugh for hours. Some may complain that the movie is a bit corny at times, but hey, it was the '80s and things were always a little cheesy. Add a young Demi Moore and an even stronger Bob Cat and you'll have a laugh for your fans. If you have not seen this, better than soon !!!
