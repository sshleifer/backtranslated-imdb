It is now clear that the true golden age of the American movie was from the mid-60s until shortly before the release of Star Wars. Before that, there were too many Hays Code-constricted papers. With Star Wars, the green light went on so that most of the films were directed at children and imbeciles, a practice that continues to this day. The SEVEN-UPS, in fact, contains a couple of lines of dialogue trite: "We can do it in the easiest way, or we can do it the hard way" is one, but I'm damned if I can find something. otherwise bad. (In fact, it is possible that that line has not even been passed when this movie was made). THE SEVEN-UPS shows everything that was right with the best films of the golden era: the sparse dialogue, the realistic acting, the real locations (the winter in a dirty place). New York has never looked better / worse), impulsive stories and, yes, the best car chase ever filmed. Bill Hickman is the driver that Scheider is chasing (you'll recognize him from Bullitt), and the structure of the chase is quite similar to McQueen's, but I prefer Scheider's facial intensity here, the rhythm, the terrible close-ups of the schoolboys. , and the overwhelming conclusion. (That VW error of about 2 miles per hour always bothers me in the pursuit of Bullitt). A squeaky, screeching score from Don Ellis sets the perfect mood. THE SEVEN UPS: somber, somber, action-oriented, adult. This is a movie that could not be done today; There is no "trick" for children or absurd ending. Thank you, Philip D'Antoni, Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco: while watching the police movies, THE SEVEN-UPS and their brothers of the 1970s (for example, THE FRENCH CONNECTION), will set the standard.
