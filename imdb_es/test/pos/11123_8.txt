We enjoy a movie like "Fame" because we imagine that we are there ourselves: students of music, dance and theater, enjoying our self-expression. This film had humor, entertainment and should be an inspiration for young people to have an opportunity in the performing arts. Bravo "Fama". Certainly worth 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Chris
