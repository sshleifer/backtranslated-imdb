While it's not the first movie I've bought for myself, this is almost the one I've seen the most. The animation is well drawn by the experts of Tokyo Movie Shinsa, and the animators frequently used intelligent techniques such as causing the sun to cause a "lens flare", the camera to be soaked (and the "hand of the camera operator"). clean the lens!) etc. While the film avoided becoming a "festival of animator gadgets," the judicious but generous application of such techniques gave the film a much more "realistic" feel than the typical caricature. <br /> <br /> History has many interwoven plots that do not seem to have much to do with each other until they come together in the end, in a way that even writers admit effusively that it is invented. Each of the lines of the main plot has its own musical theme, which goes from "Pop goes the weasel" [Hamton & Plucky], to the love theme of "Romeo and Juliet" [Fifi & Johnny]. The transitions between arguments are slightly varied, but consistent. <br /> <br /> Truly a wonderful movie; There is not much original music, although the new lyrics of "Spinning Song" is smart and nice. VERY RECOMMENDED.
