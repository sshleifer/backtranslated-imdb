Based on "A Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking, this incredible film by Eroll Morris documents the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy. He has contributed more to science, despite his debilitating illness, ALS, than a capable scientist could only dream of. <br /> <br /> The film begins by telling Hawking's childhood and how he was a poor student. recognizably bright. He loosened up in the university and in the university, where he was diagnosed with a disease that would take away the normal functions of his body, but would allow him to continue living and thinking perfectly. <br /> <br /> Morris explains how the brilliant Stephen's mind developed from childhood to the present; At one point, her mother tells how, when she was pregnant, she bought prophetically an astronomical atlas to read in the hospital. Hawking himself narrates the timeline of his discoveries, while Morris interviews close friends and colleagues who have been lucky enough to make friends with the magnificent man. <br /> <br /> He tells how he was intrigued by the discovery that the Universe was expanding in a similar way to how a star would expand. We also know that the stars eventually die and become what is now known as "black holes", if this is the case, will the universe not begin to contract and will be reversed until we reach the "big crunch"? as Hawking says. And when the universe begins to recede, will time not be "reversed"? When this question was asked, I began to think that death might not be the end, maybe one day it will recede, and our death will become our rebirth and our birth, our death. The universe is a great cycle like everything else in life. <br /> <br /> This is what Hawking is telling us, everything in the universe is recycled. This is completely logical and can make your mind wonder in a million directions reflecting on it. This is the reason why I love this movie and why it is a must see. An 11 out of 10 ... Morris never ceases to be surprising!
