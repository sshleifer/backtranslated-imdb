The film is based on a book by Jules Verne that I really read once, about ten years ago. I remember that I really liked the book, and this movie does a good job of telling the story. However, the most important thing in this film is not the story, but the very original visual aspect that it has. <br /> <br /> The images are absolutely beautiful and, apparently, they are achieved with a clever combination of cartoons. combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted to look like an animated movie. Combined by Jules Verne's unique versions of aircraft and submarines and the good results of Karel Zeman in a very well-made and compelling visual style that manages to keep one's attention until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> There are some problems too, for example, one of the underwater scenes takes an unnecessarily long time, since the story in the first part of the movie is rushing quickly. None of this matters much, since the movie is always very nice. A jewel that also deserves to be better known by the public today. A film recommended for the whole family.
