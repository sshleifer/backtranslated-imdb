This is a film based on the plot and very entertaining. Nothing surprising or original within the plot, but crucially, it moves at great speed and, therefore, maintains its attention. I really did not realize the performance that I think is a good thing. John Mills was fine, but he seemed to take everything at his own pace considering how his life was crumbling around him. It would pile up in his head, he would get up 20 seconds later, he would shake and he would continue as if nothing had happened. A small objection in a movie with a strong story, authentic locations and a plot that continually keeps you guessing until its conclusion.
