This dramatic drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African citizens who decide to temporarily abandon their families by staying on an outgoing ship. They think that if they manage to make the trip successfully, they can improve their lives by earning enough money in New York to send their families. Unfortunately for them, the boat they select is a Russian freighter that has already been fined in a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first officer are determined not to let this happen again since their jobs are on the line. The group of blacks begins its heart-rending journey in the cargo hold and is finally discovered, forced to hide and killed by the ruthless companion (an outstanding performance by Sean Pertwee). Some (the convincingly terrified leader Omar Epps among them) temporarily escape and be ruthlessly chased through the ship with their lost lives if captured. Altogether, a fascinating film that will have the public biting the nails and clenching the teeth, wondering how these terrible events could happen in the modern civilization.
