I watched this episode of Masterpiece Theater and immediately went to IMDb to look for it. I was greeted by a comment from another user, who thought it was nothing special, 6 out of 10, and disappointing. I would be morally negligent if I did not disagree. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm an avid Masterpiece Theater fan, but often stories can be a bit silly on TV, for example, "He Knew He Was Right" was absolutely terrible. "Carrie's War", however, is probably the best I've seen so far. The whole cast does an excellent job, and kept my interest more than any other piece I've seen recently. The character of Mr. Evans is of particular interest, and through subtle images of, say, an intact birthday cake or a garnet ring, my opinion of him went from bad to truly good. Truly. His definitive disappearance, and the story of how everyone around him left him as a hard, cold man, is what brought out the bittersweet flavor of this story for me. <br /> <br /> The ending is rewarding in every way except one; that not everyone got what they deserved, but in general things worked. I absolutely recommend this to everyone.
