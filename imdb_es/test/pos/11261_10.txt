This film is about three teenagers who have been best friends for a longer time, and make the most messy trip of their lives. When heroin becomes the drug of choice in their city, these three teenagers are involved in everything. This movie describes heroin addiction very well, and it's something you can not miss. MTV has never been the best at making movies for television, but it has a very good content to not see it. I enjoyed this movie, at first I thought it would be the worst movie I had seen, but then, as it progressed, it got better and I could not turn around.
