I was involved to see many other people who also enjoyed this movie. I first saw it when I was in my early teens and then again several times late at night a few times later. Then, unfortunately, no more. Now I am almost 49 years old and I would like it to be available on DVD. Why not? Anthony Quinn's best role, no one could have been more suitable for the part or parts he plays, I've mentioned it to other moviegoers of similar ages and, unfortunately, no one I know will remember it. As the daughter of a generation that went through World War II and its aftermath (and I was deeply fascinated by what that generation endured), I think that this movie at that time gave me a wonderful cinematic vision of some of the heartbreaking problems of the day. For the classic final scenes this movie is a highlight.
