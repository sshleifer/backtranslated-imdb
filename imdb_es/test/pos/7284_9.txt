Sometimes, when looking for a movie, nothing will do except a good thriller. Dead Line certainly fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> However, a little warning: if you are going to watch this movie, it is better that you do not know much about the plot. <br /> <br /> The plot gets complicated as the movie progresses. A very remarkably well-constructed tension mounts. <br /> <br /> It's deep and horrifying. It extends to the darkest places of the human mind. <br /> <br /> The plot also has some very surprising changes. <br /> <br /> Just wait until nightfall, turn off the light and watch this movie.
