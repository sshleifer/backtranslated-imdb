I am a person of the next generation ... I have never seen the original doctor who, but I have heard about the series that sparked a large fan base in the past and still leaves its mark on the 21st century; the new "Doctor who" started in 2005, but for those who live here in states like me, we see it as new episodes in the science fiction channel or BBC America; From the first season, we introduce a new player, Rose Tyler (Billie piper) and a new and excellent doctor played by Christopher Eccelson (excuse the last name). these two go to many incredible and extremely dangerous missions to save the world ... from time to time they have companions from Rose's ex-boyfriend, Mickey, to the ever present Jack Harkness (who can now be seen in the spin off "Wood of torch "). From the first season to the second, the rhythm is right ... the stories can be from the most extravagantly strange to the most action-packed, but in any case it's a walk from the beginning of the subject, which is very catchy. <br /> <br /> in the second season it becomes different and changes and now the new doctor (David Tennant) continues the fight to save the world with rose and from this point there may be some who say that part of the season is not It was so good, but I have to disagree and it was sad to see Rose and the doctor in part, but it leaves the role of "partner" to Martha (played by the very sexy Freema Agyeman) that helps to continue the fight to save to humanity ... the third season is now more at the level of action / adventure and, sometimes, emotionally, but not as much as the first two seasons; Here the relationship between the doctor and Martha is adequate, but the attractiveness MAY be hurried at times and the objection comes into play that he did NOT get up, Tyler is that he experienced his company in the first two seasons and not in the third season. A little strange was for me because you get used to Rose and her habits and now to see someone who sometimes does not really question the doctor emotionally, but at the same time makes the rhythm very exciting for the viewers, what keep up The edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an exciting journey of a television show. I would give more, but there are some flaws in this program that I can not mention because sometimes difficult to learn, but only one does, that is, the relationship between the doctor and Martha is hasty and not level to know their base; I've seen good shows on British television, but this is by far one of the most great sci-fi adventures for the old and new generation, but you do not have to risk my world for that ... come in the afternoon and Join the adventure.
