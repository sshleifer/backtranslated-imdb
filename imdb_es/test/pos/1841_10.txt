I saw this movie a few years ago and was literally dragged by it. So charming and so romantic. David Duchovny and Miss Driver have a chemistry that is so hot that you will have to take off a layer of clothes. The cast of support is 100% first class. The mere fact of seeing Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia face each other is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the most charming moments of the movies are when they are on the screen. Like Jim Belushi yelling at his children to go to sleep "FOREVER!" or him dancing in the kitchen. This movie made us wish we had met people like that in my life. Not to mention, what woman does not want David Duchovny as a boyfriend?
