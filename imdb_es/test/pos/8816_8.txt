Feisty Dianna Jackson (a winning performance by Playboy's magnificent former playmate Jeanne Bell, "Playboy") goes to Hong Kong to get the heroin ring that killed her brother. Dianna has the help of sympathetic karate teacher Joe (kind Chiquito), faces the opposition of covert narcotic agent Elaine (the charming and busty blonde Pat Anderson) and Romances, cocky, ruthlessly ambitious, Charlie (rehearsed with a Stan Shaw's extremely arrogant aplomb) as he plans his revenge. against the nefarious capo of the drug Sid (a Ken Metcalfe effectively slobbering). Director Cirio H. Santiago, working from a cheerfully trash script co-written by Dick Miller (!), Grabs the lively and hectic 72-minute time with a plethora of free nudity and lots of martial arts fighting scenes badly organized (Bell is clearly bent by a plump guy who wears a giant afro wig!). The definite resentment comes when a topless Bell hits a group of thugs in his hotel room. The raw, grainy, scratched cinematography of Felipe Sacdalan, the clumsy use of strenuous slow motion, the funky-groovin 'score, the ridiculously inept choreography of the fight, and the startlingly shocking conclusion add immeasurably to the unbridled fun of this exploitation terribly delicious and indifferent. hoot.
