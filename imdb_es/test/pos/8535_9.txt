Honestly, at first I did not think that this movie would make me laugh like hell and admire the great bloody effects, I was wrong! From the beginning to the end, the film showed some great gore effects accompanied by parodies of other titles like "Evil Dead" and "Gremlins". This movie could be compared to the works of art of Peter Jackson, although this movie is not as bloody as "Braindead", but I hope these guys make another splash movie.
