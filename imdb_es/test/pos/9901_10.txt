'Checking Out' is an extraordinary film that dominates most of the film production. His refreshing and witty humor is never an excuse to stay shallow. On the contrary, the film explores multiple facets of the human spirit and human relationships. Its warm approach promotes tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition of what unites all people. The characters are charming and fun, reflecting those idiosyncrasies that we can all laugh at ourselves. The quick dialogue and witty jokes will keep you alert and you may try to contain your own laughter, since you will not want to miss a single sentence! You will probably want to see it at the movies and then again (several times more) on video, and each time you will discover something new. After each observation, you will feel warm and elevated.
