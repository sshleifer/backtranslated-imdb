I agree with "johnlewis", who said there are many things between the lines in this movie. Although I think the pace of this film could be improved, I do believe that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating. <br /> <br /> Examples: <br /> <br /> Pierre is going to marry his cousin, even though his love for her seems very cousin-y? <br /> <br /> Pierre and his stepmother have a pretty ... curious relationship. <br /> <br /> Pierre, Lucie and Thibault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the real points to the triangle are not entirely sure ... <br /> <br /> Lucie's brother is a little eunuch, or not? <br /> <br /> And Isabelle, who is she really? <br /> <br /> In general, I think it was worth my time. An interesting movie, and one that makes me want to read Melville.
