Nightbreed perplexed me the first time I saw it. And it has been quite good in recent years. The sets and effects of monsters work, they are some of the best I've seen. No one I know seems to have seen this movie, which I believe sank at the box office, due to lack of interest in horror, in the early nineties. It is played like a horrible and dark fairy tale, and it is much deeper, then one would think, with a strong message against fanaticism, presented by a rich mystical past, which created Clive Barker. What sucks is that the movie ends with a really great sequel note, which we will probably never see. My only minor complaint is that Craig Sheffer is, in the best of cases, a passable actor, and the project could have benefited from a better actor in the role. Only one minor complaint, although Sheffer does it well. I had a similar problem with Scott Bakula in The Lord of Barker's illusions, it was not really a terrible performance, but I just did not like it on paper as much as I would with other people.
