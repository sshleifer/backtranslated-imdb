This is the kind of film that one chooses initially to complete the video rental numbers ... just to discover an entertaining and enjoyable movie underestimated! The opening sequence of the police that arrives at a dark and rainy house in which the "wife" has committed a murder ....... or is ... and the rest of the film seeks to unravel what really happened . ... OK ... the movie is a little "corny" ... but it has a good editing and dialogue ... professional acting ... often humorous ... and the last scene with the facial expression is one of the best of its kind ... it's definitely worth seeing ... it deserves at least a 7 or an 8!
