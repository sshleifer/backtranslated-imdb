I will start with a disclaimer: this movie is NOT recommended for anyone who is not interested or who has never played FF7 the game before watching it. The film is based on the knowledge of the audience of each character in the game to convey elements of the plot of the story. And it does it very subtly. Do your homework before seeing this wonderful piece of CG film and I promise you it will be much better. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, this movie has some of the most spectacular CG sequences I've seen. The whole experience felt like an extra long FMV sequence of the game, on steroids. Yes. The attention to detail in each scene, especially the action-oriented heavy ones, is so impeccable that it left me with a sense of wonder. <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack is simplified to help the audience focus on the quality of the animation rather than the music. Again, for those who are familiar with the history and background of FF7, music should not surprise anyone (although the timing and location of each soundtrack accompany each scene and mood to the point where music simply improves the animation). br /> <br /> Once again, I've only played through FF7 once, I really enjoyed this piece of art from Square Enix. And that is the feeling in most scenes, choreographed and organized. Like a dance. <br /> <br /> In short, if you enjoyed the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this movie will take you out of the water. If you are in the unfortunate majority that has not experienced the kindness known as FF7 on Playstation or PC, doing so before watching the movie will allow an exponentially greater experience. <br /> <br /> Finally, I just want to Take note of the quality in the animation of this movie. The characters move with fluidity. Each stage background comes to life and tells its own story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependence of the plot of the story, I urge you to reexamine the animation. Facial reactions, subtle clues that provoke another level of entertainment above the narrative method typical of the plot of the story. <br /> <br /> Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura have set a new standard for animation and quality storytelling. Advent Children has ushered in a new era for CG animations, allowing the subtleties found in each character to speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Thanks Square Enix. It was worth the wait.
