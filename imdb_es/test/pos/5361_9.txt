I saw it in a German press screening. Without revealing too much: most critics really liked it. There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. From my point of view and until now, it was the most fun movie of the year. It maintains the charm and ingenuity of the three short films of W + G and expands with many references to these and other films. Of course, there are obvious allusions to the films of monsters and werewolves, especially "An American werewolf in London", "Jaws", "King Kong" and even "Braindead" / "Dead Alive" by Peter Jackson, but also to other genres. <br /> <br /> The characterization was made better in "Chicken Run", but that movie had a new complete "cast" where the introduction was necessary. Here, you can already meet the two main characters. Therefore, the new movie "Wallace and Gromit" is best enjoyed if you already saw (and liked) the shorts, but it also works on its own. "Chicken Run" had the most convenient plot, but also the most "narrative". Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that feeling crazier and somehow more "isolated" from the W + G shorts. Kids should also enjoy it a lot, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love bunnies) cute, this is something you should see for yourself) and because Gromit has a lot to do and really steals the show (kids also love dogs ... :-)). But many jokes are intended for a more adult audience (there are even mild sexual allusions). The film manages, like "Shrek 1 + 2" and "The Incredibles", to offer entertainment of high level for the whole family, with a British touch and at least a little darker to the humor of the American animated films. <Br /> <br /> The animation is ?? as expected ?? excellent, and they remained faithful to the style of Aardman because they did not incorporate too many digital effects; I noticed a few when it came to Wallace's inventions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score works well in the film, although one of the main themes is definitely "borrowed" by the score of "Dragonheart" by Randy Edelman. <br /> <br /> The trouble is that it will probably take another six years until we can see a new animation. gem by Nick Park & ​​Co.
