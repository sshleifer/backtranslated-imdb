Beyond Rangoon is one of the most moving and intense films ever made. Superbly directed by John Boorman, and acted intensely by Patricia Arquette, this film can easily be described as one of the best movies of the 90s. The story and the vivid characters only attract the audience from the beginning, and never let go. After watching the film, the viewer can never forget "Beyond Rangoon". The film won little money at the box office, and is little known, but it should be high profile. By observing it, it can be said that it was meant to be seen by a large audience. It is a very important and moving film, and must be seen by all. <br /> <br />
