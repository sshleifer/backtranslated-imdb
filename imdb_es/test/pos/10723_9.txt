Life was great for the publicity artist of New York City, Ted Kramer. He had a great job and a loving wife. No, actually, his wife was not so loving, because when Ted came home late for work that night, his wife, Joanna, had a packed briefcase and was heading for the door. He tried to stop her, but she just got into the elevator and out of Ted's life. Well, now, in addition to his job, now he has to take care of the house and his 6-year-old son, Billy; Ted assured his boss that his wife's departure would not affect his job performance in any way. However, it did affect his performance as a father. It exploded when Billy spilled a blow on his client's artwork! Well, sometime later, Ted and Billy receive a letter from Joanna, and it was obvious from her letter that she would not return. Ted was distressed. Well, he was late home from work on Billy's birthday, which made Billy hurt. <br /> <br /> One day, Ted was late for work and his boss yelled at him because he missed a very important meeting with a client. When he got home, he yelled at Billy for eating ice cream during dinner. Then, later, he sincerely told Billy that the break between him and Joanna may have been his fault, not Billy's; Ted invited a good friend, Phyllis Bernard, that night, and well, Billy saw a naked woman for the first time. When Ted took Billy to the park the next day, he fell out of the jungle gym and landed face-down on his toy plane. Ted literally took him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches. After that, life began to take a downward spiral for Ted. Then, one day out of the blue, he received a phone call from Joanna! They met at a cafe on the corner. At first they have a pleasant conversation, but then Joanna informs her that she has returned to pick up her son and take him with her. Ted would not have any of that and ran away. Life got worse for Ted when his boss, Jim O'Connor, took him to lunch and dismissed him abruptly. Not only that, but Joanna was choosing to sue for Billy's custody, and without a job, Ted did not have a chance in hell to win. He hired a lawyer, John Shaunessy, who charged a nice penny: $ 15,000 exact change. And that's if they win. <br /> <br /> Ted could also find a new job. In fact, it was a step below what he used to do with a considerable salary cut, but he accepted with great determination. Finally the court date came, January 9, 1980. Judge Atkins presides. Joanna took the stand and Shaunessy proceeded to ask him why he had left Ted and about his other relationships and how they had failed. The next day, Ted took the stand and Joanna's lawyer really roasted it like a cheeseburger. Ted's good friend, Margaret, also took the stand and she really did not help at all. Well, the judge took some time to think about it and, indeed, one day Shaunessy informs Ted that he lost. Joanna has sole custody of Billy. How typical! Governing always in favor of the mother. Well, Ted and Billy were devastated by the separations. They said goodbye with tears when, suddenly, Joanna stopped. She and Ted have a little talk and well, instead of just giving away the ending, let me assure everyone that everything is going well for everyone! <br /> <br /> This was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He got that Academy Award. I've also seen him in Hook, Meet the Fockers and Rain Man, for which he also won an Oscar. Meryl Streep was fine. She also has an Oscar. Justin Henry was also good, so where was his nomination? I guess the Academy had a rule against giving the Oscars to the children, but the rule was lifted when Haley Joel Osment arrived. This movie has great drama, light comedy, and it's very subtle. It does a good job of keeping your attention. The other night I was watching Rain Man in TCM and then it happened and I could not help looking. And that is what you should do. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or movies of this genre, I recommend Kramer vs. Kramer! An exciting movie about the pains of two divorced parents fighting for their son. I liked Ted's little speech about the decision in favor of mothers all the time. What was it about sex that makes good parents? Actually, that's how they have the child. But seriously, he's right. Why always govern in favor of the mother because she is a woman? Also in the cast, George Coe, Howard Duff, who passed away in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain, who passed away in 1984. Watch for a promising JoBeth Williams in nudity in the hallway scene. Anyway, see Kramer vs. Kramer today !!! Good movie !! <br /> <br /> -
