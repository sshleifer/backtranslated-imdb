I just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week. What is the problem here? People admit that the performances are great, I mean, Lange is stellar! And that the movie is attractive, but it has less than a '6'! I do not understand. Come! Writing is not so bad! <br /> <br /> Having read many Pulitzer winning novels and having seen many of the films based on them, I think that a better than decent job was done by taking the script together. I thought that reducing all dialogue in the novel was executed almost perfectly. This story had a lot of dialogues, and the story really appeared on the screen despite the fact that only one part was used. <br /> <br /> ** BOOK SPOILER PART ** I was, however, a bit disappointed by the fact that Ginny's argument-try-kill-Rose was omitted. I thought it was one of the most emotionally discordant parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to put it aside. Fans of avid movies, more than avid readers, I think, tend to be less tolerant of the protagonists who pull antagonistic things. They are likely to confuse Johnny Lunchpail and Joe Sixpack. <br /> <br /> If you loved the book, you will like the movie. If you hated the book, you probably hate the movie. <br /> <br /> ******** <br /> <br /> Rog
