Both the book and the film are excellent in their own right. They differ slightly but that improves and does not detract from what is an excellent script and performance. The historical atmosphere, the young woman who seeks love, the incredible background of the music room and the trip to the lesbian world of London at the beginning of the 20th century make this an exceptional film. Andrew Davies as a screenwriter highlights himself as he writes this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are excellent actresses and give the best of these pieces. The rest of the cast is very good. If there were more than 10 out of 10, I would give it!
