This film is a mixture of a dark comedy and a drama, about two guys who worked in a butcher shop and wanted to build their own. When they finally fulfilled that dream, they faced a new problem: there were no customers! One day, by accident, a guy dies in the refrigerator room and starts a new type of butcher shop business. They start selling human flesh, telling customers that it's just chicken. and your business begins to improve: Human flesh sells well! Oh! I forgot to say something ?? These guys are not normal! There really is something missing in their brains! <br /> <br /> The movie has some nice scenes of dark humor, but it is, in my opinion, mainly a drama. One that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath, what are his motivations for what he does. I must confess that I was a little surprised at the end of the film, because I never expected that they would be able to achieve it without being discovered, but is it probably because I see too many Hollywood movies? What I mean by this is that in the Hollywood cinema we always expect the punishment of those who do the "bad things". There is always a morality that protects "good values", even though we all know that in "real life" this does not happen many times. And I liked this movie mainly because of that, because it fits into a film class that is true, frontal, without false moralities, and that "sees" what is on the other side, behind "conventional morality". It just happens in independent cinema (especially in Europe)! <br /> <br /> In addition, there are excellent performances by Nikolaj Lie Kass and Mads Mikkelsen (especially the first one) in the roles of the "disturbed types"? <br /> <br /> Very nice Danish movie!
