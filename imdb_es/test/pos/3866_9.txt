AristoCats is a fantastic Disney classic that I loved when I was a kid. Still today I can not resist to see it, it is a wonderful and charming movie with a great animation and beautiful songs. I really miss animation movies like AristoCats, they had perfect voices without mentioning the hand-drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family. AristoCats is also very clever and intelligent, the story was so wonderful. This film is more than irresistible, I think the most memorable moment for me were the cats playing the piano learning the application, hahaha, it was very nice with the piano playing and painting. <br /> <br /> Douchess and her kittens are very spoiled in their huge mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them as if they were their children. But when the lady feels it is time to do her will, she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler. The butler gets angry and takes the kittens to the road and leaves them in the middle of nowhere. Douchess and kittens wake up and with the help of a soft stray cat named Thomas O'Malley, they return home with their lady, but they learn the coldness of being a boorish cat. <br /> <br /> AristoCats is just a perfect Disney movie that I think has been revised a bit. I would always highly recommend this film for children or families, it could be enjoyed by anyone. The songs and the story are memorable. I will always join the best movie song "Everyone wants to be a cat", a great melody. I also love those dogs that guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned, they were so cute. This is a fantastic movie, please watch it, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
