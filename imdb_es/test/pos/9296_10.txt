For comedy to work, there are many factors involved: <br /> <br /> 1. Do not be afraid to take risks. 2. If someone or something deserves to be bothered, do it and continue doing it, <br /> <br /> ... but above all: <br /> <br /> 3. BE FUN! <br /> <br /> "The War of the Hunters in Everything" succeeds in those three things. In fact, the show proved so popular and so much fun that a few months after its first episode, a DVD of the first season was released. I picked it up a few days after it was launched and I hit the floor laughing and had so many tears full of life in my eyes. It's fine! <br /> <br /> In a few words and to save me talking about the show: watch it, buy it, make a podcast, ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ THE CHASER !!!!!!
