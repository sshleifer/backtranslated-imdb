I can not believe that the Bostock Cup is not available on a suitable video or DVD yet. I've only seen it once, in an unreliable copy taken from television and, despite not being a football fan (at all), I thought it was one of the funniest things I've seen. <br /> <br /> The famous inclined tone of wherever you are, the carefree trainer ("Ponty-this, Ponty-that", "I'll take the next exit"), the nonsensical plot; everything added to the painful aspects. <br /> <br /> Being trapped in the United States. I'm desperate for British humor, but not enough to spend the amount the production company is asking for. Come on, take it out on a kosher DVD soon.
