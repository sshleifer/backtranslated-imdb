I really enjoyed the fierce people. I discovered the movie by accident, looking through my lists of On-Demand movies trying to find something interesting to watch. The film is mostly about class in the United States and quickly catches your attention. The characters are intelligent and articulate, and the story does not adhere to the usual rules of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The main character is Finn, a precocious but disadvantaged young man of 15 who spends his summer with the Osbourne family. Donald Sutherland plays the patriarch, Ogden C. Osborne, the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays the mother of Finn, a friend of Ogden who is also a regular user of cocaine and a whore. The Osbournes own a large estate and seem to live according to their own rules. At first they seem charming and sophisticated, but the super rich are different. They are used to getting away with it. The film is pleasant mainly because it has a clear and intelligent dialogue, an excellent performance and a story that turns unexpectedly. It is also a film with R rating, so it is not entirely healthy. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Anton Yelchin is credible and sympathetic in the demanding role of Finn. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. Chris Evans is impressive as Osbourne's cunning grandson. Kristen Stewart is good like the pretty granddaughter. High quality film
