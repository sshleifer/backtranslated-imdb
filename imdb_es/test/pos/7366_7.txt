Good (not excellent) small horror movie with a high "creep" factor (not to be confused with a 1991 movie of the same name, or the most recent (2001) Campfire STORIES). The central tale of stranded teenagers who tell ghost stories about a campfire in a spooky forest leads very well, and unites the different stories that make up most of the movie (Watch out for Ron Livingston (Office Space, Band of Brothers) and Jennifer MacDonald in an energetic, sexy segment ("The Honeymoon")). Solid performance and a few truly "frightening" moments make this a cooler than average. Good example of interesting plot, together with a performance of quality set that results in a whole greater than the sum of its parts. The final "surprise" of the main story adds a pretty spooky twist, although some may see it coming. The movie is not available on DVD, but can be found on VHS.
