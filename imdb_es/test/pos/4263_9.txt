Jarl and Moodysson are part of a dying race of political filmmakers. The Swedish population should appreciate that they try to discover the truth when the government and the media actively distort and cover up the events surrounding the EU meeting in Gothenburg. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see how the Swedish police abused and drugged these innocent children and condemned them to prison in political trials for sending text messages and as revenge for other actions. The only unfortunate thing about this film is that it will not reach the great masses in Sweden, since it will only be shown in theaters and will not be broadcast on video or broadcast on television. <br /> <br /> The political film is important because it can bring new perspectives and knowledge on complex issues and has a role to play as an educator of the masses.
