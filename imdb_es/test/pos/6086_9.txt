It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see "The English Patient" again after the death of Anthony Minghella. Most of his body of work is dedicated to a breaking point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In "The Talented Mr Ripley", Minghella moves away from the amoral Tom Ripley of Patricia Highsmith to raise awareness of the murderer. In "Breaking And Entering" Minghella gives the character of Jude Law the need to confess and the rewards are moving in a chilling way. Here, in "The English Patient," the enamored characters are never too far away from their corrupted sense of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters of all pretensions in a convincing complicity with us, the public. Juliette Binoche is simply spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are full of a sensual innocence "minghelliana". Anthony Minghella gave us films that were, in one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself, but he thought of his audience. He knew how to press our buttons without betraying hers. There is something clear, honest and surprising about Minghella's work. I miss him already, but I am grateful for the reflection of his soul that he left behind.
