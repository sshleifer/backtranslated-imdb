I like movies about extravagant people. "Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest" is perhaps my favorite of all time, so one can imagine that I had a great time with this one. Definitely not one to look at if you want to get away smiling. This movie is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are downright frightening, even after several visualizations (because this kind of thing can really happen). It will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire trip. And after you see the end, if you are not deeply disturbed, you should check your pulse. <br /> <br /> The performance was phenomenal. Marcy, with her rather extreme case of Tourette, changes from extravagantly cute to absolutely terrifying, sometimes it seems so out of control that it looks like the undead. Seth was great too. The focus of the film is definitely not as important to him as it is to Marcy, although he is the one who gains more momentum than a character in bloom. <br /> <br /> It's a classic love story. with some unconventional twists, and it's also my favorite love story with "True Romance". Here there are two negative criticisms, but one of the people who issued it did not take into account their facts and admitted that he did not see the whole movie, while the other only looked for Hollywood emotions without the deep characters. (and maybe he was a little disconcerted by the apparent superficiality of the plot, since the ultimate goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store). The point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "happy". This is messy and indie as it may be, and it will not let you go until the heavy climax.
