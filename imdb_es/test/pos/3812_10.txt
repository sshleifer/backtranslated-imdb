Let's start from this point: this is not a film intended for the common audience. Absolutely strange, somehow incomprehensible, totally unpredictable, just keeps him drugged looking at the screen trying to figure out what will happen next. If that does not make you agree that it's an excellent movie, then go back to your "family" movies and forget MOTORAMA. It has material to be considered a cult movie, it can be placed in the same category with films that win prizes at Cannes or other intellectual film festivals, but unfortunately, Hollywood has stopped falling into oblivion, simply because it is not commercial. The performance of young Jordan Christopher Michael may not be Oscar material, but he gives the right touch to the story. Even the genre is difficult to describe; It is not a comedy in the correct sense, you do not know if you are supposed to laugh at the strange situations in which Gus gets involved. It's more like an impossible adventure that some children would like to have, but do not let them see it ... it's not a children's movie. So, if you like Disney movies or you're looking for a "Home only" style, this is definitely not for you. But if you like to read Edgar Alan Poe or the works of Tim Burton, then you will like Motorama. So, get on your red Mustang, get a tattoo that says "Tora" and travel Strangeland with Gus. I would like that...
