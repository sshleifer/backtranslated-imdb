Minnie and Moskowitz is the most pathetic and ungrateful love story I have ever seen. Between Minnie, a disillusioned museum curator whose abusive married boyfriend leaves her and leaves her even more tense and confused than she already was, and Seymour Moskowitz, a parking attendant so desperate for attention that she spends her nights going to bars and restaurants aggravating people. There is a chaotic and disenchanted party from the beginning. Like so many couples we see every day. <br /> <br /> In almost all love stories, there is a man and a woman, the confident, amusing man, whether classic or attractive in his way, whose defects are charming, and the woman is a wounded soul I could have any man who wants and choose this guy because there is something in him. These films make everyone feel so good because the characters embody what every man and woman wants to be, not what they are. Minnie and Moskowitz, instead of getting carried away by any fantasy clues in the field of romance, represent people who may be more common than attractive and confident people with so much experience in the field. What is the story behind the love affairs of an ugly man, alarmingly clumsy, lifeless or work where we all meet, or the woman so paralyzed by insecurity that it is difficult to talk to her? <br /> <br /> This movie is not as fascinating as the faces of Cassavetes or the opening Night, but it has that fascinating quality that Cassavetes always struggled to interpret, which is a rampant representation of people below the ego that is He hides behind himself in almost every other movie. Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, delivering surprisingly pitiful people, are not nice. Moskowitz almost drives us crazy, let alone Minnie. It is imposed with such force in his life, the dates are an explosion of our internal voices that respond to the disturbing restlessness in the dates in which we have all been, the rejections that we have all swallowed, and the arguments that we have all had. That we know our own faults were. I admire a movie like Minnie and Moskowitz because, as the registered trademark is in the films that Cassavetes made to himself, he identifies with us in 100% honesty. Our egos do not play any role in the company of their characters, therefore, a tremendous achievement for the performance of the actor.
