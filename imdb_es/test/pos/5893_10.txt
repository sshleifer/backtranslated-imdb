Sometimes, but very rarely, a film tells a story so well that it almost becomes difficult. This movie tells several stories so well simultaneously that it was the first time I could not watch a full movie. It was too real ... and the characters so strong that seeing it became a personal struggle. Seeing these three men and their families deal with their difficulties, one in particular, often hits me too much. Now, I have seen it in its entirety without interruption several times, and I realize what I always suspected. This movie is a masterpiece. The writing, the acting, the mixture of several stories without being even a bit choppy, everything about this film is exceptional. Seven Academy Awards? No wonder, it must have deserved them.
