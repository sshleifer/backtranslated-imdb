I love this movie, although I do not like how they imagine the Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why he earns eight out of 10. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is uncomfortable, and of course, due to the solitude and living in that cave for so long, develops a kind of madness. and the passion of that leopard. <br /> <br /> A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction ... <br /> <br /> In general, I find it pleasant and I am looking forward to reading Balzac's story.
