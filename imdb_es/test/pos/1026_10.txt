As a reminder to anyone who has read the comments on this excellent BBC miniseries, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD until recent years. Since then, it has been available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an 'international' DVD player, which has to hack - I suspect, illegally, to see it), but the series is now available. through amazon.com - 3 discs - for between $ 19-21, to watch them on DVD in the US format. UU., Without piracy. There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars. This miniseries is one of the best in Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project or virtually anything produced by the BBC.
