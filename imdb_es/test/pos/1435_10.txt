I saw this movie about 12 years ago and I can still remember it as if I had just seen it recently. That's how much this movie has affected me. <br /> <br /> Considering that this is a movie from the 50s, I think it was ahead of its time. I was surprised, since the way he maintains his integrity on this issue, some might have considered it taboo back then. Very realistic in showing the tumultuous and heartbreaking journey that an addict chooses to undertake. One can only imagine how audiences were affected by the realism of this movie in those days. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it was one of the top five performances of Frank Sinatra on the big screen. <br /> <br /> When others are discussing movies about mental illness and / or addictions, I always recommend The Man with the Golden Arm as one of the top five to watch.
