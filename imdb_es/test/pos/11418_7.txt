Having seen the original when I was 13 years old (and, yes, I was stupid enough to see it while babysitting!), I was excited to see this remake. <br /> <br /> Camilla Bell did a great job as Jill Johnson. And the fact that a horror movie for teenagers could be made in 2006 without a tremendous vulgarity and gore, made it even stronger than a movie. I had a great time trying not to chew my nails! <br /> <br /> This movie will not win an Oscar to anyone, but it's entertaining and worth the matinee price ticket I bought to watch it. I think girls from all over the world should see the original and the remake ... and then decide not to take care of the children again. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that I'm glad I'm too old to take care of children. There is something about being in a dark and spooky house with sleeping children that makes this movie classic. No blood, no blood ... just good psychological fun! WINNER!
