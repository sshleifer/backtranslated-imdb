Well, this movie was certainly in line with current times. There are no happy endings, superheroes, or miracles here. Only realistic fiction to stimulate our minds along the lines of terrorism, and what happens if. Congratulations to Percival and Mickery for an excellent script and an excellent Percival address. Movies like this are needed to keep us aware of what's out there. If all men and women who love peace on earth report suspicious activities, I believe that terrorism could not prosper. This movie showed how difficult it is to really subvert these terrorists, even with good intelligence. Although the film is a bit propagandist against Islam (the use of a Muslim police officer as the main character), I think it was completely realistic. There was supposed to be a shock value in the incident of the attack. As a very intelligent tool to convey the humility and the indignity of people caught in an attack like this, they showed a total nakedness of women decontaminated after the attack. It did not take me long to realize that this was meant to inculcate even more in the viewer that thought, that is, we do not have control of everything in a situation like this. Although this took place in London, with the usual high-level British performance, it makes a statement to any part of the world. Great movies do not have to be great epic productions, and this movie is very worth seeing.
