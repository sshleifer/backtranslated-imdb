[IT CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!] <br /> <br /> Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. Basically they had no life at all. All they did was lie down and count the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. I needed a life. So consult a book on the subject that tells you to know a woman. A singles bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon came to the dance floor, we see what made the club die: Jon killed her. Next, Jon tried to pick up girls in the video store. He ended up feeling down in his mouth. Literally. The laundry was not a prize either when Jon and his possible date glimpse each other's underwear. Jon tried to act like a beach fan, but he soon infuriated a real fan, which left Jon feeling, once again, in his mouth. Literally. Jon then tried to pick up the girls walking and jogging. Without result. Jon took out a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately, when he mentioned that his cat was fat, a fat man came over and stomped on Jon's guitar. It was useless. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Jon, an advertisement appeared on television: an announcement from the Lorenzo School for people with disabilities. Guaranteed a lifeless person to obtain a life in a few simple steps. Jon and Garfield attend the class. The building did not look exactly the same as on television, nor did Lorenzo act as animated as he did on television. Jon sat next to a pretty girl named Mona. Then, while Lorenzo taught his lessons of introducing himself, controlling his pulse and pretending to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona know each other. They go together, forgetting everything about Garfield. At home, Jon and Mona sat on the porch and talked. Garfield was jealous of Mona for fear she would take Jon away. Garfield imagined the future: Jon and Mona get married, she moves out and soon gives birth to a little Arbuckle who is happy to tell Garfield's story. Back to the present, Garfield could not stand it. He tried to get Jon to get rid of Mona, until she started scratching behind his ears. But then Jon learned that Mona was allergic to cats. So that was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other from time to time, and Garfield was sure to be with them. <br /> <br /> Another hilarious special from Garfield TV! This was done during the Garfield and Friends TV career. Garfield thinned a bit. Something. From his early eighties cartoons. The scenes of Jon that try to pick up chicks are fun, this is where the fat man steps on Jon's guitar. Good ol 'Lorenzo Music has returned as Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (The third man of 1,000 voices) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (The Woman of 1,000 Voices) is Mona. If you like Garfield, then I recommend you see Garfield Gets A Life today. Along with Here Comes Garfield and Garfield on the Town, they were released on DVD! So check them all today! We guarantee you a good time. Hey, did Garfield disappoint you before? <br /> <br /> -
