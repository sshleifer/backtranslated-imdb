This film is a disturbing story about the life of the author and poet, Mishima. Jump through your past, through your last day and some of your stories, but it's built by experts as you move from one section to another. Capture the flavor of man, his work and his time ... the difficult decade of 1960. <br /> <br /> I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the extracts of his works . . The sets (specially designed to work with the camera) are incredible ... stylized, beautiful and effective. They could be used as examples for any set designer. I woke up at night dreaming of the Golden Pagoda. <br /> <br /> The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and art. After watching this movie, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics or Japanese history.
