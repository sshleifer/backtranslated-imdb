"Two Hands" is a hilarious Australian gangster movie that takes place in Sydney really sensual. I bet tourists never imagine that Sydney and Bondi look the way they did in this movie: all the sweaty bodies, the oppressive night and the gangsters with nylon shorts and jandalos. Heath Ledger plays an amateur boxer with an eye on being part of the gang of the local boss of King's Cross. She looked pretty magnificent in her green wife beater and parakeets smuggler with blue drawings. A sweaty tattooed body becomes him. I always had it as a "Home and Visitor" child, and it has been in that soap, which is a little more sweaty than Weetbix's insipid "Neighbors". It is worth watching the movie for its combination of sardonic humor and unpleasant violence: the drowning scene is expected to give me nightmares soon. Totty awards: Country girl love interest brother of the city and tattooed streetkid.
