Crackerjack is another classic Australian movie.

Crackerjack is a much slower-paced sports movie than many will find, such as Remember the Titans or Million Dollar Baby, but the characters involved are athletes in their own right. This film is an example of a large area of ​​Australian culture and presents a sport that is popular and growing in popularity in Australia. Mick Molloy presents a classic, unforgettable character. It really is a must see.
