It was probably watching this television movie that interested me in the debate over whether "Anna" was really Anastasia, the daughter of Tsar Nicholas. Since I saw it, I set out to watch several documentaries and I also bought a book. Despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released, sometimes I still think it was. Such is the power of Amy Irving's performance in this 2-part game, which is somewhat liberal with historical facts, but replete with dramas and Irving's totally compelling interpretation. <br /> <br /> I was not conscious. I was aware of Irving before this, although I must have seen her without realizing it in "Carrie" (another favorite movie). In "Anasasia", I never felt for a moment that "it's just a movie". For me, this woman was Anastasia, and when the first part ended with her in a train car that met with members of the royal family, I knew that, in hell or in the water, I had to see the second part. I just wanted to see how it would show that she was who she claimed to be, and as the story progressed I felt an intense hatred towards the character of Rex Harrison, although I admire him a lot as an actor. <br /> <br /> When I saw the film again in the TV guide, I convinced my mother that we should see her, and then she thanked me for doing it, since she was as interested as I was in seeing part 2. Then I bought the video and I totally recommend it. "Anastasia" is one of those rare television movies that you simply have to watch to enjoy the best performance I've seen on television, and it does not matter if you believe in the legend or not.
