I really liked this movie. One thing I have noticed is that the drama of Korean television is much better, in terms of telling the whole story. I watch movies when I do not have time or I want to go from 16 to 30 episodes. Movies seem to be rushed and if you do not watch them carefully, you may miss something. <br /> <br /> I feel like this was rushed and I had to rewind some parts to try to find what I missed, especially towards the end. If you like good love stories, I still think this is nice, and if you have extra time, I still think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> It's always good to come back, follow the actors in different films as we can not follow them from when they start, as we do the producing actors and directors in our own countries.
