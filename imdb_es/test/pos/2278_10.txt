You have to like baseball and, at least, something like Tom Selleck, but if you meet those criteria you should enjoy this movie. Selleck plays the former Major League star, who is traded (?) With Japan as his career ends. Really well thought out and fascinating look at Japanese customs and behavior. Great performances of support from the manager of Selleck ("Clint Eastwood of Japan"), his girlfriend Takanashi and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie, apart from baseball. Look for Haysbert as a playmate long before he becomes a persistent shilling for Allstate. The film concludes very well. Easily in my best fifty movies of all time and maybe my favorite in baseball.
