As a social satire, Idiocracy is as good as Office Space, but with a broader scope. Criticizing this movie as too childish because of the insignificant humor is a kind of mistake, I think. Certainly there are jokes, etc., but in reality they do not pretend to be fun for the audience, they exist to define the state of "culture" in the world of 2500 AD visited by Joe, as background of the strange state of affairs in which he awakes. The real humor of the film lies in the many gags and attitudes present in this future society that are only a shadow of what we find in our daily lives and that should serve as a warning. My personal favorite is the Fox News representation. The subtle brightness of the film lies in the fact that it also investigates the "smart" people and the average Joes as the protagonists. Consider the moments in the movie in which Joe and Rita almost unconsciously conform to the idiots around them, and realize that Idiocracy is not created to attack any particular group of people, but rather the culture of idiocy in general. I do not know what to say about Fox's behavior "made for conspiracy theory" when this film is released, but if it is not in your local theater, demand it. We all need to see this movie, if it is not for the social comment, at least for the fart jokes ...
