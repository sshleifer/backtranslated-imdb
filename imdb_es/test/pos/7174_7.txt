On June 22, 1941, the city of Przemysl, Poland, is divided between German and Russian. When the Germans invaded the city, the Nazis sent the Jews to a ghetto. The young Catholic Fusia Podgorska (Kellie Martin), alone with her little sister, shelters and hides many Jews in the attic of her home for two and a half years until the end of the war. "Hidden in silence" is another good story of human sympathy in World War II. This movie looks like "Rescuers: Stories of Courage", and is also based on a true story. Unfortunately, the actress Kellie Martin plays a strong and powerful main character, but is very weak for such a role. In many dramatic situations, the expression on his face is not convincing. I've noticed that many IMDb users liked their performance, but I'm not sure they like their wonderful character or their performance. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hidden not Medo" ("Hidden in fear")
