I fired this movie. I'm very proud of the movie. It was a great experience that is shown on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the film in the exact way we imagined while preparing the film. The sets are incredible and well made for each character. John York and his team created sets that not only adapted to the characters, but also worked well in the filming of the film, allowing us to move smoothly through the walls and from one set to another. Each character has an incredible arc, which makes it a great story. I feel that all the actors gave excellent performances. I do not agree with some of the other comments that say the performance was not good. Look at it and decide for yourself.
