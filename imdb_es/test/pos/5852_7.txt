Sandra Bullock paints a credible image as the troubled detective, although seeing her as a cynical victim of man-eating persecution becomes a persecutor requires a leap of faith (or two). The two children with spooky problems are adequately represented by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. <br /> <br /> I have some problems to get Ben Chaplin to join the equation (the same problem arose when he saw 'The truth about cats and dogs' (http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117979 /) I mean, when you put an Englishman in a totally American movie, should not there be at least one reason to put him there? Should not there be any story that leads to the fact that an Englishman serves as a detective in a American police force? Should not there be some dialogue that points out and explains that pretty obvious fact? Or even some jokes about him being that Englishman? <br /> <br /> It seems out of place here, as it seemed outside of place in 'The truth about cats and dogs.' Producers really should pay attention, distract and annoy the audience (at least to me.) There's nothing wrong with Chaplin's performance, it's just a matter of making a actor be credible "out of place" and not put in a place without a good reason or a story <br /> <br /> The movie itself: well, the thrillers, especially the ones that try. G To solve a complicated crime, a certain suspension of disbelief is required. This is not different; Actually, it requires a little more effort than usual. In order to make Bullock smart enough to settle the case despite all the pressures that require her to leave him, some unrealistic assumptions about the evidence are being made, and I'm sure many people who saw it. They had a moment. of 'Come on, this is very unlikely in the circumstances' or even 'Hey, you can not ignore the evidence in this way to wrap this movie!'. <br /> <br /> As I said: reasonably entertaining and visible. Just do not use this as a required visualization for the detective exams. There are no shortcuts there.
