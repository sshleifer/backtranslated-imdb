Essential visualization for anyone watching TV news, as it can help them become a little more skeptical, or even cynical. On a personal note, I remember taking a course some years ago about being interviewed for television: what to do, what not to do. The instructors of the course impressed us that the television news was a "branch of the show biz". That depressing vision, which is probably even more valid today than when it was made, is reinforced by this film. No matter journalistic integrity, what counts is the ability to look good and smile kindly. And make sure you do not sweat in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The interactions between the three main characters form the centerpiece, each with its own ambitions, abilities and beliefs. Brooks takes these differences and establishes them in the volatile configuration of a television news studio, and adds more than a hint of amorous interest to the mix. The result is a complex, albeit somewhat lengthy, representation of how we commit ourselves every day to fulfill our ambitions and bring others with us. It is always entertaining, although the final scene was, perhaps, unnecessary given everything that had happened before.
