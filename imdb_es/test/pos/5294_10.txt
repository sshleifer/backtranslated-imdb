I had heard news about this film from the anime legend, Hayao Miyazaki, and I HAVE wanted to see it. But I was lucky enough to watch the movie online on YouTube; After watching the movie, I knew it's another Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli classic. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by my favorite fairy tale "The Little Mermaid", is about a 5 year old boy. called Sosuke, and his relationship with a princess of goldfish, which he called Ponyo, who longs to become human and be with Sosuke. I will not give you more details, you'll have to watch the movie for yourself. So, in general, one of the best animated films that have been made, with a lot of fantasy, adventure and humor ... I loved it!
