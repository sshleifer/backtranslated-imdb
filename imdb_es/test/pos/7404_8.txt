Sometimes, good things happen by accident. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of "Silverwing" until the end of 2005: I was changing channels and by chance I saw something in Toon Disney with bats in a sawmill being attacked by owls. I had no idea what it was, but I was motivated to stay tuned. It was difficult to wait for a commercial to find out what it was called. <br /> <br /> Part of what intrigued me was the appearance of the bats: first, they did not use the popular convention of giving "extra fingers" to the bats where their claws are supposed to be. Rather, they have palms like human hands, but the fingers are longer and have bands of skin between them. <br /> <br /> Also the faces: they look like human beings (in fact, at one point I wondered if they were once human but were transformed into bats.) I do not usually like this in cartoon animals, but it worked here.The story is a human story, although it is about bats and other animals (not unlike the Lion King). <br /> <br /> What I saw on TV were the last two parts of the "trilogy." I missed the beginning of the first, "Towers of Fire" (the second in general), but for the most part I saw each of them, however, I found myself wanting to understand what was happening, since the first part had not appeared and anyway I would not have picked it up. <br /> <br /> But I saw it was based on a book by Kenneth Oppel. How lucky I was to pay attention and write it down I was very disappointed when I found out that the series was NOT AVAILABLE, it was not even what I recently It made sense that it was not available yet. <br /> <br /> However, I found not only the book Silverwing, but also the two sequels Sunwing and Firewing. When I read the first book, I kept wondering "Is that it?" Not only because so much of what is in the series is not in that book, but even if you had not seen the animated version, the Silverwing book (otherwise, a good story) does not end as much as it stops. Only one loose end is tied: Shade and Marina meet the Silverwing colony in Hibernaculum. <br /> <br /> In fact, Silverwing and Sunwing should (in my opinion) have been published in a single volume, because they do for a complete story together, but not separately. <br /> <br /> Actually, the animated version takes some elements of Sunwing (for example, Orestes, lifting the ban on seeing the sun) and some were completely original. It's not perfect, but it's definitely very nice. I enjoy the two versions of the Silverwing saga. <br /> <br /> That's why I'm glad it's finally available in June. It has taken a long time to arrive and it is worth waiting for.
