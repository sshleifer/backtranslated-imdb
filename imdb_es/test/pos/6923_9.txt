This movie is a joy to watch and should do well on DVD and video. I guess you really have to be Irish to appreciate some of the subtleties like the accent, the colloquialisms and the sense of dress of some of the characters, but let me assure you that when Dylan Moran pretends to be 'Barreler', the impersonation is quite familiar for most people. of Dublin because we have many characters in our beautiful city that look, act and talk like that. The simple comedy used and the genius of Michael Caines acting alone are worth it, but in addition to this, the plot is excellent, the script is fantastic and the dialogue is fast and catchy. A perfect light entertainment movie without the crazy humor of Jim Carrey.
