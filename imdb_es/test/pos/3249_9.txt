Two hands restored my faith in Australian films. He took an old premise and made it fresh. I enjoyed this movie without end. I recommend it to those people who like Guy Ritchie movies. Bryan Brown was fantastic and almost perfect on a paper made to measure for him. Ledger was suitably stupid and his performance gave me a very satisfying movie.
