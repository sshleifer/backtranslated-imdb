I never expected such an old movie to be as impressive as this 1930s western turned out to be. The scenes of the pioneers heading west in their covered wagons, encountering storms and mud, river crossings, Indian attacks and all kinds of tests and dangers, they are amazing in their sheer credibility. Much of the film was shot outdoors, and the film has a really epic feel about it. The actors must have experienced the same conditions that the original pioneers had, and the results are surprising. The cars, the clothes, every detail looks and feels good. The characters are simple but believable, with a simple story, which travels like the wagon train to its destination. <br /> <br /> John Wayne is thin and youthful in one of his first roles, as the scout who runs the cars, and he does a good job as the young idealist frontier. He faces a wonderful trio of villains with scurvy, including Ian Keith as an astute player, Charles Stevens as a Mexican companion and Tyrone Power, Senior, as the cheat and trapped bear. The bearded, growling, and larger portrait of life is both comical and threatening. I still imagine him with a handkerchief, a gold ring and a black eye patch, with a parrot on his shoulder, while grunting and growling several threats and insults. Your character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship without any difficulty. The whole image is almost stolen. <br /> <br /> Tully Marshall is charming as a cunning old woman from the frontiers who is Wayne's best friend. The lovely Marguerite Churchill becomes an energetic heroine, whose first encounter with Wayne is a hilarious confusion, resulting in a long-lasting courtship consisting of insults and feigned indifference on his part, to a great persistence in him. The results are quite comical and one is happy to see them finally meet at the end. <br /> <br /> The scenery is amazing, with the wagons crossing real meadows and having to be lowered by ropes that go down the cliffs. Indians who are clearly the genuine article, and not white actors in makeup, appear as friends and enemies, and are treated with dignity. The character of Wayne tells a group of young fans that the Indians are his friends, who taught him everything he knows about survival in the desert. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is a hassle-free story told by a talented cast. personal. It is likely to seem naive to many modern viewers, but there is a quiet dignity that never allows it to become corny. There is a lot of intentional humor, including a rogue prank from a pioneer, who makes the noisy sounds of animals hide, each time the soft player Ian Keith tries to trick the beautiful heroine into marrying him. His flowery speeches about the plantation that he supposedly possesses are interrupted by very realistic imitations of howling cats and healing ducks, which caused the seducer to look around annoyed by the invisible creatures. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, both western fans and lovers of old movies in general. This is truly a classic movie for ages.
