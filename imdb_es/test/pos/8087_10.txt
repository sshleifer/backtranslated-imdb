I just saw this movie in the Children's Program of the Berlin Film Festival and it killed me (and almost everyone else in the audience)! And make no mistake, this movie belongs to the 250 of all time! Let me tell you that I am not in any way associated with the creators of this film if that is what you believe in reading this. No, but this is really! No matter the "children's movie" label, "Klatretösen" ("Climber Girl") is in almost every account a classic (as in "biblical"). The story refers to Ida, 12 years old (magnetic: Julie Zangenberg), who is devastated to learn of her father's terminal illness. Special surgery in the USA UU It would cost 1.5 million and, of course, no one could afford it. So Ida and her friends Jonas and Sebastian do what every good kid would do, and they rob a bank! Sound corny? Do not forget: this is not America and "Klatretösen" is by no means the fact that the tears Robin-Williams-multiplex-plat-du-jour nobody take seriously anyway. Director Fabian Wullenweber set out to make an action comedy and big budget for children and, boy, he succeeded! Let me put it this way: this movie is like no other children's movie and some others did it before. And there is much more than just "action". After about 20 minutes of exposure by-the-numbers (well, granted), it accelerates to become a monster that: <br /> <br /> - tests "mission impossible" to embarrass (the numerous sequences of action are masterfully organized and it seems really expensive - take that, mom!) <br /> <br /> - dwarfs almost all the other movies in suspense (it's not easy, they are only for children, antics here) <br / > <br /> - easily link a dense story with enough laughs to make Jim Carrey look for career alternatives <br /> <br /> - nod to Damon Runyon and Karate Kid in the same seconds <br /> <br /> - there is so much evil humor that pc side that I can hear the American classification board wetting his pants from here <br /> <br /> - manages to be really tender, serious and sexy at the same time (ohmygod, What am I saying? They are children! They are children! It does not matter, look at the last scene!) <br /> <br /> - the stars Stafan Pagels Anderson, who since last year "Mirakel" is the favorite child actor of all <br /> <br /> What a ride!
