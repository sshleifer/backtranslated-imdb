WrestleMania 6 took place on April 1, 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. <br /> <br /> Match 1: Rick Martel against Koko B. Ware - For what it was, a very solid opening match. Koko was always quite popular among the fans, and at this point, Martel was still outperforming as a high-heeled talent. In the end, Martel is able to get the victory in a rather unmemorable match. <br /> <br /> Match 2: The colossal connection (Andre The Giant & Haku) (c) (with Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan) vs Demolition (Ax & Smash) for the WWF Tag Team Championship: at this point , Andre's health was really horrible, so his performance was not anything special. The crowd is 100% pro Demolition in this match. In the end, Haku is anchored and we have New Tag Team Champions. After the game, Andre introduces Haku and Heenan and turns to face what would turn out to be his last WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> Match 3: Earthquack vs. Hercules - Very short match. The big and dominant heels were really a popular thing at that time. D.E.P. To both men in the match. John Tenta (Earthquake) happened recently and the same with Hercules. In the end, Earthquake traps Hercules for victory. <br /> <br /> Match 4: Mr. Perfect vs Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake - The first really good match of the night. D.E.P. to Curt Henning (Mr. Perfect). A truly solid action of both types with talent. In the end, Brutus gets the victory thanks to the large amount of support from his fans during the match. <br /> <br /> Match 5: 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper against Bad News Brown - It's not a technical classic, but it's quite a decent fight for WrestleMania. Piper comes out half black / half white in what is considerably a classic moment. In the end, both fight for a double count without a clear winner. <br /> <br /> Match 6: The Hart Foundation vs The Bolsheviks - Complete squash game. The Hart Foundation gets an easy victory. Surprising that WWE used to have a team division. <br /> <br /> Match 7: The Barbarian vs. Tito Santana: the "Heenan Family" fairs of Bobby Heenan are better in this match, as The Barbarian takes the victory over Tito Santana. It is not memorable, but it is good to go back and see years later. <br /> <br /> Match 8: Randy Savage and Sensational Sherri against Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire: great tag team match between genres. Dusty Rhodes wears the uncomfortable polka-dot outfit in the ring. In the end, Rhodes and Sapphire get the victory over "The Macho King" and Sensational Queen Sherri. <br /> <br /> Match 9: The Rockers vs. The Orient Express: Surprisingly, another tag team match. The tag struggle used to be much better during this period of time. A young Shawn Michaels and his partner Marty Jannetty are lost by having this Orient Express match. <br /> <br /> Match 10: Dino Bravo vs. Jim Duggan: Duggan has a decent reaction, despite his American patriot. trick. Bravo, a member of Jimmy Hart's group, arrives in the ring with Hart and Earthquake. Although he has support, Duggan takes the victory. <br /> <br /> Match 11: "The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase (c) against Jake 'The Snake' Roberts for the Million Dollar Championship - The first major event of the night. Roberts was extremely finished with the fans. The match was considerably good for what it was. DiBiase is able to win a victory account at Roberts. But Roberts ends up owning DiBiase's money and giving it away. <br /> <br /> Match 12: The Big Boss Man vs Akeem (with Slick): One Man Gang's sad attempt to be an African dream called Akeem. A really short match that needed more time to develop as a match. Boss Man wins with a punch. <br /> <br /> Match 13: Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka vs. Rick Rude - Heenan comes to the ring with Rude for this game. Snuka, I never understood it well at WrestleMania. He always seemed to be on the losing end. After about 5 minutes, Rude gets the victory over Snuka. <br /> <br /> Match 14: WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior - Nicknamed as "The Last Challenge" we get some interesting promotions from both men early in the evening. The match was really good, since people tend to think that Hogan can not fight. Many nearby falls that really attracted the crowd and the people who watch her at home. In the end, Warrior gets the victory over Hogan and wins the two titles. A stunned crowd watches as Hulk Hogan suffers his first defeat at WrestleMania.
