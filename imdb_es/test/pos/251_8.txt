A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on Broadway, which means he would have to leave the small theater dinner where he works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. The three of them are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them). The story line offers numerous opportunities for songs and dancing. The film has two questions that Rusty must answer: is fame all that is believed? And is it really less if you're happy? Answering those questions makes the movie. The film also does a good job of showing the talents that the three directors had. Never a dull moment!
