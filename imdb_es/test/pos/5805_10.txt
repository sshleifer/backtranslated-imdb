The show was incredible and very professional. Madonna is an endless one, dancing and singing for 2 hours. The opening was pretty good when it came out of the disco ball and also the jump was a very good performance. The whole show was full of energy, so it's hard to say which were the highlights because each song had something special and unique. I saw a couple of their previous tours (World drowned and reinvention tour) that were good, but you can not compare to this one. The dancers were fantastic, the lights and the whole show were just perfect. Madonna still looks very good. If you have not seen it yet, I recommend you see it. You will enjoy the show from the beginning to the end. Madonna is still the queen of the dance.
