"House of Dracula" is a good sequel to "House of Frankenstein". There is not so much action but the acting is just as good. Onslow Stevens is the benevolent doctor who becomes bad after receiving blood from Dracula through a transfusion (Dracula was receiving the transfusion to overcome his "affliction", but he cast a spell on a hunchback nurse and then transfused his blood into the bloodstream. Doctor). It turns out that Dracula did not really come for a cure, but drained the blood of a beautiful nurse. Dracula is destroyed and the Werewolf is next in line with a cure (which is successful). Meanwhile, the Frankenstein monster is briefly discovered and revived before it burns to death (do not worry, the same trio returned in "Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein"). John Carradine again plays a sinister Dracula (Baron Latos is his alias at the beginning of the film and in "House of Frankenstein"). Lon Chaney is the sympathetic Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as the monster Frankenstein. Lionel Atwill again plays an inspector, which he often does in the monster movies of Universal Studios. A guardian for your collection.
