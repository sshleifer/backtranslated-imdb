This movie is so different from anything you've seen before. It is an honest and chilling account of the battle of a whole family with a terminal illness. <br /> <br /> 'The Closer She Gets' is filmed in a unique style. Craig Oulette films the movies in a very different way ... using different angles and points of view, in what I find is a very striking way (maybe due to his experience with photographic works). <br /> <br /> Your style offers such a clear image not only of what the patient is facing, but also of what loved ones close to her have to face. <br /> <br /> A very sad movie, but extremely interesting and unique. I would definitely like to suggest an observation.
