David Lynch filmed his first film, 'Erasurehead', for several years, adding new scenes every time he managed to raise a little more money. Kevin Smith did 'Clerks' at work, while working as an employee, and Robert Rodriguez boasted that 'From Dusk Till Dawn' cost precisely $ 30,000. But $ 30,000 is still a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery. And what would happen if an aspiring filmmaker not only had a job like that, but also had all the ambitions of such luminaries and all the nonsense of Smith, but absolutely none of the talents? Such figure is Mark Borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary that narrates his attempt to make a couple of films for many years. Borchardt combines his lunatic dreams with flights of depression and a fatal inability to call it a day; one feels that he almost prefers the endless labors of seeking an impossible perfection for an adaptation to the reality that simply (according to the evidence presented in 'American Movie') is not very good. And like a modern Ed Wood, he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of fellow losers, his genuine affection for who is his greatest redemption feature. The collection includes his warring parents, his best friends (one criminal, the other a reformed drug addict), his own unfortunate children and, best of all, his elderly uncle Bill. Bill can live in a trailer park, and has almost given up on life, but he owns a small fortune ($ 280,000 to be exact) and the touching but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men is in the heart of the movie. . Borchardt manages to recruit some actors to act (along with him, of course) but, in general, depends entirely on friends and family to complete their work (even Bill has a role in the camera). On British television, the BBC brilliantly programmed a screening of 'American Movie' alongside 'Lost in La Mancha', the story of Terry Gilliam's failed attempt to film 'Don Quixote'. In that film, one was impressed by the great amount of professionalism that was exhibited (how inappropriate it was for the task at hand), and how difficult it is even for the experts with millions of people to dedicate themselves to making a film; while Borschadt not only does not have a penny, but he is also a clown who can not even correctly pronounce the name of his own work ('Coven'). Ultimately, Borschadt is human enough for you to want it to succeed, but horrible enough that the viewer can still laugh at his failures. If this movie were fiction, I would dismiss it as incredible; but as it is, it's one of the funniest documentaries you'll probably see.
