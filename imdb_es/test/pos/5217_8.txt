He is very good at this role as a disaffected and bored husband, a decorated air force officer, who gets bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change. <br /> <br /> One afternoon he meets Karen Chairs. , an attractive woman younger than his current wife. A relationship develops, and Cole decides to take it to the next level. <br /> <br /> Not only does he have a romance, but he fakes his death to escape his family obligations. The lies increasingly become a pattern as he begins to steal banks to keep his new wife (Chairs) happy, and to project the image that he is a success. A fictitious deception, apparently. <br /> <br /> This was also based on a true story that makes it even more intriguing. Cole is credible and excellent in these roles. Recommended. 8/10.
