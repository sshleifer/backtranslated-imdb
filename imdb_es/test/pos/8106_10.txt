Before watching this movie, I really did not expect much from her, although my friend advised me otherwise. Due to this request from my friend, I decided that I was really going to see this movie. The moment I sat down to watch the movie, I was absolutely impressed. Of the credits I fell from my seat; I just could not contain myself. The film is about Hitler in all the glory of comedy. Hynkel is the absolute double for the Jewish barber, who returns from fighting in the war. Due to the heroism of the barber, he manages to save one of the Germans and in doing so, gets a member of the enemy on board, which helps in the struggle that the Jews had. But things went wrong and Stolz was arrested, but only then escaped to the confines of the Jewish suburb, 'El Gueto'. Due to this flight, the German army began to search, which meant that Barber and Stolz were arrested, but again escaped, only to be confused with Hynkel and, consequently, take their position. ***** THE SPEECH THAT CHAPLIN MAKES AT THE END IS FANTASTIC, MEETS THE MORALS THAT THE SOCIETY COULD DREAM ONLY. IN THE SPEECH ALL THE MEANING OF THE FILM CONTRIBUTES FOR THE SERIOUSNESS AND THE SINCERENITY THAT WERE DELIVERED, AND IT FUNCTIONS DEFINITELY, BECAUSE I JUMP TO CELEBRATE TO THE CELEBALIZATION OF THE LIVES IN THE LIFE OF OUR LIVES. SOMEBODY TO THE LARGEST AND PROMINENT THINGS, LIKE THE WAR.
