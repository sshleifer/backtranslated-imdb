It took years for cult icon Bruce Campbell to take off this project, but finally he has it, he's here, and what a great entertainment that entertainment is! Looking at the plot; sounds like two things An ideal basis for a very silly B movie, and a blatant excuse for Bruce Campbell about what he does best: the slapstick humor of the Evil Dead II style, and this film offers what counts. The Man With the Screaming Brain is a silly comic book until the end, but there are some really cool scenes and it is almost impossible to get bored with this movie. Bruce Campbell wrote, directs, produces and stars in this film, and although he is not quite citizen Kane, it must be said that this is an achievement for the man most famous for fighting his own hand in a cabin in the woods. The plot follows American businessman William Cole on a business trip to Bulgaria with his girlfriend. The trip goes wrong, however, when he, his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up dead; Thanks to the same woman. The mad scientist Stacy Keach is on hand to unite Cole and the taxi driver's brains into one; and we have a cult movie in our hands. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is entertaining and presents some laughs; but once the main point of the plot has been executed; The movie really takes over. Bruce makes better use of the stage in all kinds of silly situations, from changing his clothes in a garbage can, to deciding (with the taxi driver in his brain) what to eat in a restaurant. The humor is mainly of the slapstick variety, and anyone who has enjoyed Evil Dead II (which should be anyone who has seen it), will certainly enjoy this as well. It seems that Campbell is playing too much of his strengths with this project, but if you connect and DO NOT HAVE Bruce doing what he does best, there would be a disappointment. Besides that, there is no lack of respect for man; But he has never been the actor with the highest rank. Despite being very funny; The movie is not great, since sometimes it's too silly; and there is a secondary plot with a robot that I did not like; but in general, The man with the brain that screams is a film that, unfortunately, we do not see much of today. The movie is a series B movie; and he deserves respect for that if nothing else.
