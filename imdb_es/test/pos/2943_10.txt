Normally I do not like watching movies when they are still in theaters due to the high ticket prices, but I saw a poster of Some Things That Stay and I thought: "that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual teenybopper teen. BS ". So I decided to take the step and see this movie on its opening night. <br /> <br /> I must tell you that I was pleasantly surprised. I went to this movie without expectations. I really did not know what it was about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland made me feel quite satisfied with my decision. Alberta Watson also did a fantastic job as the role of the mother affected by Tamara's disease and I must also add that I was quite impressed by Megan Park's comedic style as Tamara's friend, Brenda. <br /> <br /> The film was beautifully directed by Gail Harvey, and met in the kitsch style of the 50s that makes you feel warm and happy, even if the story was not so uplifting. I also thought that the film was well filmed, many of the beautiful images of a 1950 field will remain in my mind for the next few weeks. <br /> <br /> This movie as a whole was peculiar and great. I discovered that it was unpredictable and, although the story ends in a somewhat open manner, I was still satisfied. Whether you're looking for a fun, but powerful story of coming of age, or just want to remember life in the 1950s, I guarantee that this movie is for you. Even if you do not have expectations, it is very likely that you will be very impressed. Give this one a shot!
