This movie was fun! Especially if you are between 8 and 15 years old. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes form a credible team of 8th graders who return with an adult who truly deserves it. Paul Giamatti is a great adult that you really want to "catch". My 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it. Parents: There are no really bad words or sex to worry about. I recommend it for the 'right' crowd. AP
