If you enjoy riddles and suspense, you will enjoy this movie. The truth is that it was mainly the part of Adrian Paul that made me pick it up, I knew almost nothing about the film beforehand. The plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, begins to play a mysterious game of riddles trying to discover "the reason" and get involved in "the game" solving riddles. Vern (Adrian Paul) owns a store, is also a fan of enigmas, and also gets entangled in the game. The myth says that if you solve the game, the meaning of existence is revealed (called "The design"). The character of Brendan Fehr is an "idiot of the people" who walks around the store and turns out to be more than he seems. In general, I thought the movie was pretty well done. And it's definitely an original concept, a rare find these days! I personally like riddles and word games, so even though most of them were not very difficult, it was still a fun movie. Well worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Then, if you have not seen it, get it! :-D <br /> <br />
