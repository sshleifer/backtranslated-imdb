I saw this on television more years ago than I can remember, but I never forgot the performance of Sammy Davis, Jr. I just happened to look for it in a video. This version of Porgy and Bess is a treasure. I would love to see him again and present him to my son too. I just can not imagine why it is not advertised as one of the best performances that Sammy Davis, Jr. gave. Whoever is responsible for not bringing this to the audience should be ashamed of their ignorance. Although I will continue looking for it. Perhaps the executives responsible for such things realize the forgotten work of so many African-American actors.
