One of the advantages of my work is that when things are slow, I can watch the movie in our theater below (I work in a small 2-screen cinema) in the crying room and keep watching the food stand. I've seen Italian Job probably 20 times, and I'm still not tired of it. The atmosphere reminds me of Ocean's Eleven, although the performance is not so good. Mark Wahlberg is fine, Charlize Theron attracts the guys, but Seth Green is AWESOME in this movie. I thought Edward Norton did a very good job of touching a garbage bag, although many people do not agree. I also enjoyed Mos Def as the explosives expert who is afraid of dogs. I recommend this movie, and I'll keep watching it whenever I can.
