Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are excellent at this representation of a Vietnam veteran in the war, but they are still obsessed by it. Bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a "family". Sheen is great as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through, but he is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize. The stage is Thanksgiving and family members come to dinner. Estevez, who plays the returning vet, does not want to participate in the family tradition and insists on wearing his combat uniform to dinner, explaining "This is what I used on the last Thanksgiving." Disputes and family arguments are priceless, particularly the "fragile peanut crisis", but the end is both exciting and terrifying. You have to see it to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the best movies I've seen in my life.
