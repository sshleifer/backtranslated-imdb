Are you looking for a comedy drama with suspense and a cast? Well look for this little sleeper. John Lithgow and Billy Bob Thorton are great in this little tornado of the plot. Do not forget the Jamie Lee Curtis cameo. A touch of the 60s, a touch of "The prince and the beggar," and a hint of that homegrown gold makes it a little story.
