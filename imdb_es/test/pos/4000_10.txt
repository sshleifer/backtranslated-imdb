Fire gives everything ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most masterful meditations on cinema art. Set in nineteenth-century Korea, it tells the story of the famous painter Ohwon, but instead of sticking to the anecdote, the melodrama or the psychological hunt for eggs, he presents a whole series of episodes throughout his life, all of which They are beautiful works of art in themselves. . He does not give any interpretation of these episodes, but he leaves them for the viewer to reflect together with the paintings of Ohwon himself. In this way, the viewer enters into the same kind of contemplation as Ohwon, and less his talent can "feel" in the inspiration of his paintings. <br /> <br /> Part of why this is so effective is the completely masterful evocation of nineteenth-century Korea and the musical / artistic world in which Ohwon moved. There are so many magnificent images of the world outside the paintings that we get a mirror effect where we see the beautiful world that inspires Ohwon, Ohwon lives and looks inside that world, and the works of art that he creates, all reflect each other. <br /> <br /> The story is told with an extreme economy. An evoked feeling almost never stays with or is explained, it simply appears quickly and then disappears so that the next one appears. As an analogy, it is a kind of Mozartian work of art (endless and rapid succession of great ideas) instead of Beethovinian (persistent obsessive in a great idea). It has a classic restriction, like Ohwon's paintings. There really is no music to suggest how to feel, except some classic Korean pieces used with great effectiveness in various scenes (and mostly played by characters in the film). A disturbing image, if I remember correctly, is that of a flock of birds flying over the blue mountains while a singer sings. <br /> <br /> "This life is like a dream, and only death will wake us up" <br /> <br /> A revealing advice in the film, from one of Ohwon's teachers, is that "the paint is between the strokes. " The film follows that attitude since there is a lot of material between what is spoken and described in the film. I've seen it twice and it was very rewarding at the second visit. A very smooth film, with little obvious explanation, you could see what the 96th Im film looks like. It is an artistic masterpiece. As the great friend and mentor of Ohwon says when describing one of his paintings, "Not a single stroke is wasted". <br /> <br /> I compare it with Andrei Rubylev in quality, although in style it is very different. It is much easier and more direct to see, but in a classic way, where Andrei is Gothic. <br /> <br /> In general, highly recommended for almost everyone, except for those addicted to appetite. The two times I left the movie I felt a wonderful spiritual renewal. <br /> <br /> One point in Ohwon's life that intrigued me was that his crazy drinking and the commotion suddenly started after visiting the nobleman who told him that "good art can." they come only from great knowledge and learning. "The next brief scene, Ohwon, was very angry, and the next one was a drunk, since he often stayed the rest of the movie, I'm curious to know why the words of the Nobles affected him so much and took him to the drink that dominated the rest of his life, or was it just a coincidence?
