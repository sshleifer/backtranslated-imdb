As an adult, I am grateful to have captured this film by chance as a teenager. During the time, I was experiencing family problems. This particular film managed to capture what I was seeing from a closed world. How much group pressure is too much? In fact, I had to buy this movie because it reached me on a different level than most of the films that try to reach the public. How far can an individual go for social acceptance? Who is the "bad" crowd? Teens struggle trying to find the answers to these questions, but ultimately ... who is the "package leader" if there has to be one? Is it the strong one? The beautiful? Maybe the person that we all seem to like? Could it be the moral character? In regards to the film, the cast worked together as if it were predestined. I just hope that more directors and producers try to create a work that reaches us all as this particular film has reached us. I would like to be able to vote more than ten because this particular title deserves much more.
