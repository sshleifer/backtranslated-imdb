This second pair of Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner is excellent as the first. Maybe it's predictable, but I do not care and I keep laughing a lot every time I see it. The Wile E./Road shorts always had the most special place in my heart. Then, knowing that the second album of the Golden Collection would not only include 11 of this, but would be in chronological order (from 2 to 12, the first episode was in Volume 1), it made me have hazy eyes. I LOVE these things This animated short can be seen on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 2. It also includes an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My rating: A +
