I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. Jack Black and Kyle Gass definitely brought the thunder in this epic story of friendship, hard rocking and destiny. <br /> <br /> Filled to the brim with unnecessary oaths in every sentence, bath humor and the general attitude of breaking the rules, This movie is a must-see for the tenacious fanatics of the world's hard core. <br /> <br /> We continue the journey of the young Jables (Jack Black) and Kage (Kyle Gass) as they try to recover the target selection, win the open mic night and become the best band on the planet. The duo has to overcome obstacles like a room full of lasers, a man with one leg and the devil to accomplish his task. I'll let you see if they succeed or not. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack itself is impressive enough, and now we see the D in person, which makes the experience even more magical. A must for anyone who calls himself a tenacious D fan. Beware of the inner jokes of the first album!
