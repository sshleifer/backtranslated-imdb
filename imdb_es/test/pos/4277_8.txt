My husband and I saw this last night ... It was wonderful ... For once, he was wrong to guess in advance the end of suspense. It moved very fast and the performance was excellent ... I love Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The previous description of his performance hits the nail in the head ... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque landscape is impressive. We just finished watching all the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience. There is no doubt that I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a few hours of entertainment.
