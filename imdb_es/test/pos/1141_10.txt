I went to this movie with no idea what to expect. In fact, I took it out in theaters when it first came out. We both enjoyed it and it helped us to have someone to talk to after seeing it. <br /> <br /> I only recommend watching this movie if you appreciate movies that are not mainstream. He is not as disconnected as Liquid Sky or as fanciful as Forbidden Zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There is VERY subtle humor. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot if it is completely lost: an older brother-type government controls everyone in society. Suddenly, a new person appears and there is no data about him (it seems crazy). He may or may not be the second coming of Christ. The government too cautious enters a frenzy to find it and discover its true motives. The ruler is also obsessed with immortality. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are frantic, while others are completely discreet. We follow the main character when he meets different types of people in society. <br /> <br /> I did not need to change my conscience to enjoy the movie, but I know some of my friends felt that helped. <br /> <br /> Split was also filmed around Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
