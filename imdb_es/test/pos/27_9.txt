Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are brilliant as Sir and his Dresser. Of course, the work is brilliant to start with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of the theater, and I think you listen better in the theater; but on the screen we feel more intimate, we are 'closer' more than in the theater, we witness subtle changes in the expression, we "see" better and listen. Both the work and the film are marvelous: moving, intelligent, enlightening, of the story behind the scenes of the company, the historical context, the two main characters and the parallel characters in "Lear". If you can not see it in a theater (I do not think there has been much in these days), do yourself a favor and get the video.
