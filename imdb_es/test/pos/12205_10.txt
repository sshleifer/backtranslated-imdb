I regret to see that SURFACE has not been selected for the 2006-2007 NBC season. I suppose that the market demand for games of madness and reality shows on open television, a reflection on our sense of culture, has conquered a good story. I hope and pray that some network will pick it up so that it can continue, just like STARGATE and its spin-offs. <br /> <br /> I also hope that producers find a place where they can produce the level of post production. Desired in a TV Guide interview. At this moment the repetitions in science fiction, marathons, will have to do. For my part, I would love to see where the story goes after the tsunami that ended with Episode 15. I would like to discover the brain of efficient effort to obfuscate the true identity of creatures. <br /> <br /> FYC Morningbear
