This review contains what could be a spoiler if you never read the book or saw the cover of the video box. So, if you want to approach the film without knowing anything about it, except that I like it a lot, stop here ... <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not first class, but the performance between the candidates is , and give romance more life than Shute in his novel (although I generally prefer the novel). My very weak objections to the film compared to the book is that the film moderates some of the relationships with the supporting characters, and between the main characters in a scene towards the end of the film, to provide something that is not at all realistic . Dramatic tension and as a general plot device. All this is handled much better in the book, with the result that I find the end of the book a little more poignant than the end of the film.
