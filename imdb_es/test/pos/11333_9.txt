How is perfection described? In the mood for love! Maggie Cheung and Tony Leong practically dance on the screen and offer stellar performances that remain with you hours after leaving the theater. Each scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of excellent photography and a selection of shots, a first-rate performance and a sensual soundtrack. The singing of Nat King Cole in French marks the tone of the whole movie. Maggie and Tony look wonderful, with Maggie sneaking into some truly glorious cheongsams and Tony always looks very elegant. I have already seen this movie several times, and every time I see it, I find something new to talk about. Love it!
