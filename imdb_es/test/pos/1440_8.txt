Since the collapse of the opening theme, "The man with the golden arm" is the classic entertainment of 1950. Without any subtlety, Frank comes home from prison with a monkey on his back and returns directly to the old neighborhood, where he still the old drosses are hidden. This is a story of his dark journey with all his emotional baggage intact. The performances are all a bit too mature, but that's part of the fun of watching. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable, and they almost steal the show. This and the "Manchurian Candidate" are, in my humble opinion, the two best films of Chairman of the Board. Do not miss any of them.
