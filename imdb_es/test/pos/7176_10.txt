This is a documentary different from any other. It has so many layers and shows us so much that trying to analyze everything at once is almost impossible. The documentalist William Greaves shows us the process of making films from a different perspective. We see the struggles of the actors, the director, the sound team and everyone else who tries to hold on and make this film successful. If it were a movie, it would be normal. What Greaves does is make it more complex by having a team film the actors, and then it will be filmed by another team, only for another team to film everything. Three cameras, each with a different objective. It has an almost dizzying effect on you, but at the same time it is exciting. I like the parts where the crew organizes and discusses what is happening. Even they are somewhat in the dark as to what Greaves is trying to do. Half see this as an experiment, while the other half sees it as a chaotic and confusing failure. No matter which side you choose, you can not argue that Greaves does not involve you in this process.
