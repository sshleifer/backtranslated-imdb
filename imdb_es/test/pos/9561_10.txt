This movie was even better than "Waiting for Guffman." The great strength of these two films lies in the brilliant character that acts on behalf of the small and second company of the city of Guest and Levy. If you find this movie boring or meaningless, God help you, you just did not understand it. It's a fake documentary, something for which Guest and Levy have a genius. At the end of the film, where the dog lover in the south of the Guest House tells us that to relax after the show, he went to Israel to work in a "caboose", or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyph. <br /> <br /> of an ancient Egyptian with a small ancient Egyptian in his hand, I realized that it is moments like this that make life worthwhile. Thank you, Mr.Guest and Mr.Levy, and may God bless you.
