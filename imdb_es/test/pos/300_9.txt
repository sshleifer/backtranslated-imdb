First of all, I think that this movie is much more appreciated by the viewers who have read "Heart Of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad, the book that was the literary basis of the film. Having said that, I think this movie is amazing. It is an excellent war film that focuses not so much on the blood and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict, but rather on the psychological cost it caused to the young and inexperienced "children" who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed a true genius in the art of making movies, and he used many images to help tell the story. The performance I felt was definitely complete at the same time. The role of Marlon Brando in the film is what really made me act. His explanation to Willard at the end of the film makes him stumble, and reveals the emptiness of a man he has heard and wanted to see throughout the film. Those who consider this just like another war movie should give a detailed look at all the literary elements that are intertwined with this film, because there is a lot of meaning behind all this. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculpted and best-made films of all time.
