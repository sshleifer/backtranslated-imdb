"Twin Peaks" and "Blue Velvet" have always been two of my favorite pieces to make movies, and although Lynch's previous films have been a little disappointing to me, they have always been worth seeing several times. To be pretentious, lynching can be like a good wine: it must be tasted and meditated. But in the end, you must make a decision about what you have seen, since Lynch never gives you the full answers. <br /> <br /> Many people will leave the "Mulholland Drive" possibly wanting to accelerate. the amazing visual puzzle that has just been unfolded before them. But there is a crooked logic in this movie, you just have to look for the clues. Betty (Naomi Watts) arrives in Hollywood, with her eyes open and in search of stardom. then he finds an amnesiac in his bathroom who has escaped an assassination attempt on Mulholland Drive. Together they try to discover the secrets behind the life of the amnesiac. all this leads to a club called silence, where a blue box will reveal everything. And that's when the movie throws everything out the window. people that we thought we knew are completely different people ... is it a dream? A reminiscence about the previous adventures of life? You will love this movie or you will hate it. David Lynch always attracts such extreme reactions from his viewers. but as your universe itself always has to do with extremes, it is appropriate that your movies provoke such reactions. <br /> <br /> It is better to watch this movie thematically, instead of a direct narrative. and appreciate the fact that Lynch is a filmmaker who will still allow him to draw his own conclusions. Lately he has had many imitators, especially in the "vanilla sky", where an amazing movie decides to give you all the answers in the last five minutes, and you will probably forget that movie as soon as you leave. of the cinema. Mulholland Drive will chase you.
