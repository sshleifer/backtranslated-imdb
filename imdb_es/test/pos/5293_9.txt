Ponyo is a beautiful animated film with some dark tones. It presents a children's story of longing and love with ecological implications, but it is not a preacher. Hayao Miyazaki has merged the Little Mermaid of Andersen with the native myths of Japan and his exclusive steam punk style flights, and the result is very rewarding. There are some frightening moments of ocean storms and floods, but they are exciting, not horrible. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wanted to run with the waves along the coast, ride a jellyfish like an elevator. Transform completely or become a friend for life, Ponyo is a fable for you.
