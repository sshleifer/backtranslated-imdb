This is the true story of the great pianist and jazz singer / legend Ray Charles (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winner Jamie Foxx). He was born in a poor African-American city, and he became blind at the age of 7, but with his skills to play and listen, this is what later in his life would lead him to stardom. By the 1960s, he had achieved his dream and sold records in the millions, and he led the charts with songs and albums. But the story also showed its disadvantages, including the separation of his wife and son, due to his relationship with a gang member, his drug and alcohol use, and incarceration because of this. Also starring Regina King as Margie Hendricks, Kerry Washington as Della Bea Robinson, Clifton Powell as Jeff Brown, Harry J. Lennix as Joe Adams, Bokeem Woodbine as Fathead Newman, Aunjanue Ellis as Mary Ann Fisher, Sharon Warren as Aretha Robinson, CJ Sanders as the young Ray Robinson, Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun and Richard Schiff as Jerry Wexler. It's a great story with a great singer's impression, the songs, including Hit the Road Jack, are the highlights.

It was number 99 in 100 years, 100 greetings. Very well!
