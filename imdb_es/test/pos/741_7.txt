Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey), director of an institute for people with severe disabilities, takes a 'progressive' approach to treating his patients, even allowing his insane the total freedom of the building, day and night; however, he pays the price for his vision of the future when, stupidly enough, he prescribes to cut wood with an ax as therapy for one of his patients and, therefore, his neck is confused with a trunk (it is used to do not suggest the weaving of baskets). <br /> <br /> Shortly after this tragic incident, nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to take over as assistant doctor, and discovers that the facility is now under the care of the severe Dr. Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick). Despite not being aware of her deceased predecessor's decision to hire Ms. Beale and not being particularly anxious to hire new staff, Dr. Masters agrees to let the pretty nurse begin work, but after several experiences Anguished in the hospital, Charlotte begins to wonder if this is so. It could have been better if they had rejected her. <br /> <br /> It does not take a genius to discover what is really happening in the hospital, the 'lunatics have taken over the asylum' as a premise. That should be familiar to most seasoned horror fans, but Brown's Do not Look In The Basement remains an entertaining entertainer thanks to his well-defined collection of madmen: Sam (Bill McGhee), lobotomized and suck paddles; Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), who continually murmurs phrases of the court; old Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams), who recites William Allingham's spooky poem The Fairies and warns Charlotte of the imminent death; Danny (Jessie Kirby), who delights in making fun of other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr), who thinks that her doll is a real baby; Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and best of all, Allyson King (Betty Chandler), whose rejection by a number of men has left her with a craving for love (ie, try to jump to any man who comes close to her). <br /> <br /> This convincingly crazy set of characters, plus a bit of blood and nudity, reasonable direction from Brownrigg (who also gave us the awesome white trash from Scum of the Earth), and a solid twist of the covergirl of Playboy Holotik, everyone is going to turn otherwise quite predictable, a piece of low budget exploitation into a very visible shocking psychopath.
