This show has everything you could want from a prison drama. There are twists and turns until the end of the season. The characters are very strong and give a lot of power to the show. When you watch the program, you feel not only for the prisoners, but also for the prison staff. The actors who play the prisoners in this program have done a very good job portraying a prisoner. Also, if you like the law and order svu or law and criminal order, there are many actors of this program that appear in those programs. The only problem with Oz is that it was not long enough. This show could easily have nine to ten seasons without getting old. Even after the end of the season, I still see myself watching Oz all the time on DVD. This show is easily one of the best television shows. Do not be silly, go see Oz.
