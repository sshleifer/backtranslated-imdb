I have always been fascinated by silent films. There is something about watching actors and actresses from 100 years ago. Stung by today's high-tech special effects, I always try to imagine what it was like to see a particular movie at the time of its original release. It helps to appreciate the rawness of primitive cinema. <br /> <br /> "The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ" is a very charming production of Pathe, originally filmed in 1902, but expanded and finally launched in 1905. Imagine a series of famous religious paintings that come to life, separated by titles, and you will have a pretty clear idea of ​​how this movie is. For example, the scene in which Mary and Joseph rest while they escape to Egypt, is almost identical to the 1879 painting by Luc Olivier Merson "Rest in flight to Egypt", to Mary, sitting in the famous Sphinx. While some might find these "living paintings" as a strange imagination, I found them very charming and very nostalgic. <br /> <br /> The sets and the costumes seem to have come from a theatrical production of the life of Christ Possibly of and more elaborate game of the passion of the day. The makeup in the cast is very theatrical, so much so that a close-up of Jesus is almost comical. Again, where others can be bothered by the rudeness of them, I loved it enough. <br /> <br /> Having been filmed for a period of 3 years, continuity is not so bad. The biggest flaws are foundry changes made during that time. The characters of John the Apostle and the boy of 12 years change in the middle scene, to the surprise of the audience! <br /> <br /> The best non-intentional humor of the film is in the scene of the birth of Jesus. The baby appears LITERALLY, as if by magic, in the manger between Mary and Joseph. Maybe it was just my state of mind the moment I saw it, but I laughed out loud! If only the delivery was that easy! To make matters worse, the actress who plays Mary is bored through the whole scene (actually, throughout the film), as if this kind of thing happened every day! Oh, how times have changed! <br /> <br /> As simple as this movie, compared to today, it's really a wonderful window into the past. I recommend it! <br /> <br />
