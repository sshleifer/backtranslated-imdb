I enjoyed this movie immensely, due to spicy scenes (both humorous and ironic, some even "tragic"), credible interpretations, witty dialogues and a sincere representation of what it is, or rather it can be, being hetero- and / or homosexual and in search of fulfillment of your wishes. I am aware of the paradox here: homo and heterosexual ... this is something that the film deals with, but it is never used for caricature. If you are as open as the people who made that movie seem to be, in the end you will not mind if those who are in the other's arms are of the same sex or not. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Smith" of the Matrix gives an admirable turn as a seller of gay homes with "strange" appetites here, but that is not the only thing to admire. enjoy.....
