Based on the novel The Dismissal by Ermanno Rea, in essence the story about the slow friendship that develops between an Italian maintenance technician Vincenzo Buonavolonta (Sergio Castellitto, who can be seen as the villain Rey in Prince Caspian, and was the protagonist in Bella Martha) and a Chinese translator Liu Hua (Ling Tai). They really started with the wrong foot, while the first reprimanded the latter for its inaccuracy, and the slow translations of what he wanted to say to a Chinese delegate who had bought defective equipment. Vincenzo wants to do the right thing, which is rare these days, and is to tell prospective buyers ahead of time the flaws, as well as the complexities that his purchase will bring, and given that he is upset by the fact that the agreement still occurred . Go ahead, take some time to elaborate a component that could fix things. <br /> <br /> But that also means traveling to China in search of the elusive machine, which is revealed well hidden, and apparently has vanished. without a trace. With the initial help of Liu Hua, they set out on this treasure hunt from city to city, which takes us to China's less-watched places, away from Beijings and Shanghais, to cities like Wuhan, with industrial backgrounds as backdrops, Like steel mills and nuclear plants with their smoke chimneys splashing the landscape. The powerful Yangtze River also makes an appearance. Along the way, the usual trappings of travel-style movies come into play, such as learning culture, ideals, food and, basically, the understanding that the world is without strangers, if only one makes an effort to try to connect While hints of a bit of romance between the two protagonists are suggested, it rarely became a moot point, until maybe at the end of the movie (hey, opposites attract, right?) And factories, we can see various cottage industries, such as seamstresses who work in sweat store environments, and I think cotton also, along with making noodles. Like a movie, it gave me the opportunity to travel without leaving my seat to observe, and I give credit for not issuing judgments from a high moral level on exploitation and things like that. And also congratulations for the film to participate in a dialogue based on the native languages ​​of the characters, instead of (and I will not name names here) any other cinematographic / intercultural collaboration where the dialogue is forcibly bent and it is not natural and really annoying. Some may consider the supporting characters too friendly, as long as they open their arms and doors to a foreigner, but I would like to imagine that maybe in the more rural areas, people in general tend to be more sincere, friendly and, Basically, do not get stuck in the rat race to trample others, or be trampled. <br /> <br /> If there is a message to be removed from the film, besides the fact that I mentioned that the world is without strangers, it is a reminder that some of the things that I consider important may not be so for others. Importance is something that one places on something else, and its basis really depends on how we define the limits we establish. So, given our finite life, I think I should lighten up a bit more, live and let live, and sometimes enjoy the illusion that ignorance could be a blessing.
