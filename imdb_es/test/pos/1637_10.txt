This is definitely the most stressful X-Files episode of the first season. This episode is what I think when I listen to "X-Files". The plot is simple but exciting. Our main cast, plus some scientists, are going to investigate an Alskan outpost in which their research team seems to have killed each other. It turns out that a small parasite that was extracted from the ice, had infected the research team. The parasite adheres to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity. Soon, no one can say who they can trust, or who is infected or not. <br /> <br /> This episode was a direct tribute to John Carpenter's great horror film, "THE THING". The thing is set in Antarctica and a team of scientists finds a destroyed outpost in which its occupant has been killed or killed himself. An extraterrestrial that had been buried in the ice for 10,000 years had been thawed. It has the ability to imitate any way of life. therefore, the main characters can no longer distinguish friends from enemies. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the THING is one of the most exciting and stressful horror movies you'll ever see. If you liked the ICE episode I advise you to see it. Or if you have only seen the THING, I advise you to see ICE. <br /> <br /> ICE is the best homage / homage to John Carpenter. The THING that I have seen, and lives up to its inspiration as one. Of the best episodes of X-Files. I give it a 10/10.
