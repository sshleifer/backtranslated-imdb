I have always been fascinated by the ninjistsu, who would know that he will go further than beyond. In "Ninja III", it is creepy and intriguing fun. A ninja is shot by the police and uses his spirit to take revenge. The victim, a lovely young woman named Christie (Lucinda Dickey). She falls in love with the policeman who was involved in the shooting. The love scene where he pours the V8 into his body left me unconscious! The death of the ninja attracts the attention of another in Japan called Yamada (Sho Kosugi). He comes to the United States not only to save Christie, but to return the ninja to the grave. Simply because he pulled out Yamada's left eye with a shuriken (throwing star). The fight scenes were excellent. I liked the part when the plywood falls on Yamada, and he divides it with his foot. And when they caught him, he tells the officer with whom Christie was involved that everything will be fine. Golden Rule: Never underestimate a ninja. He pulled the other cops without killing them. And he did his thing without worrying. Of course, Chirstie did everything possible to put the ninja in his place by using it as a tool of revenge. It was a good movie, great for lovers of martial arts. 3 out of 5 stars!
