I bought this a while ago, during a massive phase of martial arts movies. Although this is certainly not the best, I love this type of filming, and there was a lot to entertain me in this. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, I always appreciate the fact that, although he lacked formal training in martial arts, he usually gave a fighting performance more than capable. He also has a good beard. This movie has him in a good heroic role and, although he does not give him as many kicks as in some of his other films, he still defends himself well. The first appearances of Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are also nice, especially because of the fact that Chow Yun Fat confronts the bad guys without his gun brand. He may not be a great fighter, but he does it well. Eddy Ko is a guy as bad as ever, he plays the same villain as in many of his other movies and he does it very well, as usual. The guy who plays Bu is also good, I do not remember his name, but he's also in Magnificent Butcher. Although the fight is not as good as that of other films of the time, The postman ftles back makes up for it with a lot of imagination, a quality cinematography and a nice and peculiar atmosphere. There are some very ingenious scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mix of Hong Kong talents that come together to achieve a decent effect. All in all, I would recommend it to fans of kung fu action and Hong Kong in general. It may not be a stylized classic like the Shaw Brothers movies, or as pleasing to the public as Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it's rock-solid entertainment.
