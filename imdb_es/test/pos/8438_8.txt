I rented "The China Syndrome" recently, mainly because I read that it was this film that inspired ABC to do "The day after". "Syndrome", however, is more of a thriller than a drama. The film is quite political, but I very much agree with its message: nuclear energy, although extremely efficient, is too dangerous for common use. The risks are simply too high. With luck, those responsible for the actual nuclear plants are much more responsible and ethical than those shown in the film. However, given that the near-real-life disaster on Three Mile Island came just a few months after the movie was released, that puts it in doubt. (To be fair, that case was probably more incompetent than corruption). <br /> <br /> The "Syndrome" is not only critical of nuclear energy, but also of modern means of communication, similar in vein to the "Network". , only that much more serious. Being a print journalist, I am very familiar with the way people perceive the media; but it was a little scary to see that even in the 70s, the television news was already running out. When the character of Jane Fonda tries to convince her boss to allow her to make real news instead of lint, she is advised not to try the change, since the "research" finds that people prefer a pretty girl to fuzz, no hard news. <Br /> <br /> What really makes the film memorable, however, is the incredible suspense generated in its last third. During this period, the viewer constantly fears for the lives of the protagonists, whether the danger comes from hired thugs or the possible merger of the nuclear plant. And that last scene, I will not reveal it, of course, but it will keep you guessing. <br /> <br /> On a final note, I had a clear feeling when I saw the movie that it seemed at times more like a television movie than a real theatrical movie. However, this could be due more to the fact that the rental tape I was looking at was quite old and was not formatted to fit TV screens, as videos and DVDs are today.
