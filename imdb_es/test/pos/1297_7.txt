This film was made only 48 years after the end of the Civil War, probably in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the film there are recreations of battles and people of the time that seem quite impressive and realistic. It also offers a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary, BIRTH OF A NATION: a patently absurd and racist film. Because of this, this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man who flees to enlist as a drummer. The boy does good and is a hero, although the film ends in a rather melodramatic way, a definitive convention of the day. It's not a great movie, but a decent plot, a decent performance and little of the exaggerated acting that I used to see in other films of the time. <br /> <br /> One annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for things that were really obvious. He got upset from time to time.
