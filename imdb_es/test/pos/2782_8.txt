A very charming representation of the European Union begins to operate among the young generation when the representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, ​​where everyone studies for international scholarships. The center of the story is Xavier (Romain Duris), who may have lived a fairly conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a group leader, helping them deal with the owners and other problems. Learn about life and love quickly. Duris looks healthy and gives a good performance. The rest of the cast also plays well. Every once in a while, they all switch to English when they want to make sure they are communicating, unsure about the ability of their roommates to understand French or Danish or whatever the language. Its cinematography stands out, which includes beautiful views of Barcelona and its famous Gaudí towers.
