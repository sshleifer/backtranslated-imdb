It's bad for you, it really shows more talents than George Carlin. It really is still as sharp as a tack. It's a shame we lost him last year, but his comedy will last forever. This standing special is literally one of the funniest I've ever heard a comedian. Even though he is making fun of young children, it only makes you laugh the way he says some of the things. It is true that Carlin can, literally, do something that seems unfashionable and turn it into one of the funniest things he has heard and will hear. I really enjoyed this stand-up particularly from Carlin and I recommend that those who have enjoyed more review the George Carlin stand-up.
