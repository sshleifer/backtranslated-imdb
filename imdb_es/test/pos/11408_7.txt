One hundred miles from the scene of a grizzly murder in a small town in the United States, Jill Johnson (Belle) settles for a night of babysitting. With the children asleep and a beautiful house to relax, she closes the door and sets the alarm. But when a series of strange phone calls from a stranger says that she "controls the children", Jill panics. Fear of terror when the calls are drawn. And what the police find makes perfect nanny work in the worst nightmare of a 16-year-old girl. There are no other main actors in this movie. Camilla Belle is the main star with a pretty face. The day he comes to take care of the children, he really has no idea what the hell he really expects. <br /> <br /> If you were in a house like Jill's. I would explore everything around. The fridge would be the first person to look, but I am a man and I do not care for children. But what I found funny was the size of the house. I was thinking, would the movie be the same if the house was not so big? Anyone could get lost in that huge house, but this movie needed a house with a huge size. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle has a pretty face, a perfect smile, but it's like for a movie like this, the main actress. You need someone with experience. I did not find Camilla so good. I do not know, maybe she thought that this could be her breakthrough. I like her, she's a pretty girl, but someone who has a role in this movie has to be someone, so it's different. <br /> <br /> This movie was not scary. I also found this movie more like a "movie for girls". I think the only reason why it was released this weekend during the SuperBowl weekend was that the kids stay home and watch the game and the girls go out to see this. It also seems like a type of movie in which girls will enjoy more than boys. But I liked this movie but because of how it is. Girls only like tog et scared or scream. This was just a pretty decent movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might like this movie. There are many PG-13 horror movies that never succeed. This was at its own level. So I kind of liked this movie. I give it a 7/10.
