The work of Cam Archer, Bobbycrush, boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is the desire of adolescents with an exuberant representation (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt) that is more vibrant than narrative. Trapped somewhere between the documentary and the dream, Bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of Todd Haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of Gus van Sant. With guts, glamor and lack of love, it's like the equivalent of the Sonic Youth movie playing chewing gum.
