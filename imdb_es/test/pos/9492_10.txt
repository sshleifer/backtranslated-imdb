Some people do not like Led Zeppelin, but fortunately, the number of people compared to the number of people who do not is not balanced. I am the proud converter of 2 or 3 fans of Led Zeppelin and the only reason I could do this was due to this DVD. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, how someone can listen to "Stairway to Heaven" or "Immigrant's Song" without falling in love with Zeppelin surpasses me, but playing the guitar and not like Page ... That's like being Christian and not like Jesus. My friend was like "Led Zeppelin stinks!" and I was like, "Oh yeah, look at this!" After about 2 minutes of seeing the selection of Page through "White Summer / Black Mountain Side", he stuck to the screen and has never said anything bad about Zeppelin since then. <br /> <br /> In case you have not been following the running metaphor I call this DVD the Led Zeppelin Bible. Maintained high by the followers and used as a converter for unwashed pagans. <br /> <br /> Of course, some things like "Over the Hills and Far Away" are missing, a good version of "Immigrant Song" and I really did not need version 2 of "Whole Lotta Love", but what the hell, I will take them <br /> <br /> Because there is nothing but "The song is still the same" to compare this too. I gave it a 10 and even if there were more to compare it I would have given it a 10 too.
