Heya Denver fans! Animation is a classic cartoon and one of my favorites as well (and yes, it was also broadcast in Europe, including my little Central European country, Slovenia!) :) Oh, how I miss the cartoons of the 80s! Honestly, they were much better than today's children's shows. More imaginative, creative, full of fun, with good morals, more substance, a great story and excellent character voices. Today's animated computer shows lack all of these features. So all of you, who agree and want to recover all the shows so that the children of today's generation can see the entertainment that these cartoons give us, please log on to the side shown below and sign a petition for a repeat of the 80. best cartoons! <br /> <br /> http://www.thepetitionsite.com / 1 / we-want-an-80s-cartoon-kids-kids-show-channel <br /> <br /> Carpe Denver! =) <br /> <br /> Lejla
