Well, I would say that this is a very nice movie and something touching despite its flaws. I did not believe for a minute that Matthau knew the first thing about being a dentist. In addition, the character of Hawn seemed to recover from suicidal depression fairly quickly at the beginning of the film. Not to mention that the whole thing seemed pretty ridiculous. However, the film is successful because of the good rhythm, the mood and its stars. Matthau may not have been a dentist, but it was as much fun as it used to be. Bergman brought a lot of sensitivity to the film (especially during the scene where she and Matthau go out for a drink after work) and also a lot of humor. I think it was his performance that made my brother realize this movie after listening to a couple of scenes. Hawn's performance is remarkable, although an Oscar may have been doing it a bit. Basically, do not take this movie too seriously and you'll have fun.
