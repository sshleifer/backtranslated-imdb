I was one of the lucky ones to be invited to see this movie in New York. It is a compelling story of how a group of extremely close friends dealt with the tragedy of September 11. This movie made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit, through love and friendship, can withstand and create wonderful things from one of our darkest days. The filmmakers really captured the emotions of the individuals involved. It was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people. That day I left the theater wanting to call all my friends to say hello. I would recommend everyone to watch this documentary. I would rate this movie with an A +++++++++++++. See it if you have the opportunity.
