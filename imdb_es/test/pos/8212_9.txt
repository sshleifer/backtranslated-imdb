When this movie premiered in 1995, I found it incredibly cool. Especially with Sandra Bullock. After seeing her brilliant performance in Speed, she was ready to enjoy any of her films. <br /> <br /> Back to the net, it was a movie that keeps you in suspense. All in all, I enjoyed it, so I give it a fucking *****.
