"Death Wish 3" brings Charles Bronson as a watchman Paul Kersey, now retired. Yeah sure. Kersey returns to his old ways. But this time, it's not just a few Muggers at the same time, it's a gang. who have taken over part of the city (New York, by the way) this time is the war, so Kersy takes out the big guns (literally) for this. The body counts as the only rival for anything: Stallone or Schwarzenegger. I have found this movie. Actually, it's a fun thing to watch, particularly for some of them and, of course, bad guys die or get badly hurt in creative ways, which is always good. Violence is not so personal in this. one, obviously, on a much larger scale, like bombarding your victims from afar, instead of one by one. This movie is clearer in tone than the 1st. 2, which makes it easier to see. The film is more escapist than anything else. It's also cheesy at times and pseudo-inspiring, but the hose scenes fade away. they should have left the original "Desire of Death" without sequels, but since they did not, they should have stopped here. 8/10
