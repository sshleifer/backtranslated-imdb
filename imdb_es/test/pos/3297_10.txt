When I see a short film like Boy-Next-Door, I find a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm seeing something that has been well thought out, executed to perfection and bold enough to be interesting. On the other hand, I find myself lamenting the level of comedy that generally occurs. Television and movies are so consistently filled with easy and condescending trash that we find ourselves judging excellence on a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the "benefit" of the study notes or the substantial budget; You can create a really cool little comic gem. The producers and the demands of the network must turn to Travis Davis to obtain material and stop granting agreements to people simply because their curriculum or agent can demand that they do so. Boy-Next-Door, with luck, has drawn the attention of the right people to make Davis's job easier. It is very fun and very well done!
