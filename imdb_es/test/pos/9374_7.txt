I have not read the source, Richard Brooks' novel, "The Brick Foxhole," which I hope will not be as unhappy as its title, but I understand that the original villain was a homophobe, not an anti-Semite. (And to be honest, Sam Levene is written as a gay man picking up a drunken soldier.) But, well, you have to go with the flow. Consider 1947. Even anti-Semitism has not been treated on the screen yet. Many of the people responsible for contemporary films were themselves Jewish, but anti-Semitism had been verboten for years because it was considered unpleasant. Therefore, we can not blame the creators of this film for not leaving the victim homosexual. Now that's REALLY unpleasant, and in addition, there could be many among the audience encouraging Robert Ryan to get away with it. We are not free from prejudice, but we have come a long way since 1947. <br /> <br /> Seeing this again for the first time in years, I was impressed by the rather slow pace of the first half of The Movie, the many shots of two people talking, the shadows, the time between the question and the answer, the uninspired edition. But I could live with that for the theme of the movie and for some other things. <br /> <br /> One of the things that keeps me stuck to the events as they develop so deliberately is the performance of Robert Ryan. The boy does a splendid job. Sometimes it may seem thoughtful, cheerfully subordinate and useful to the police: "Any way I can help, yes sir." Then, alone or with another soldier, hatred over a low flame rises to the top, not so much through what he says but in the way he LOOKS. That frown, that penetrating gaze, those dark eyes shining. Wow <br /> <br /> The film has suffered much heat due to Robert Young's speech about the murder of his grandfather. That does not bother me at all, although I think Dmytryk did not have to make Young put his face in the camera while talking about "MICKS and PAPISTS". Still, taking into account the context, it is one of the most striking moments of the film. Part of its impact is due to the almost casual delivery of the message by Young, and another part is because the message was not heard on the screen before. <br /> <br /> Another feature of the film that almost transforms it into the surreal is the character of Paul Kelly and his relationship with the whore Gloria Grahame. Santo Guacamole, what elliptical conversation Kelly is giving him. "Do you know what I told you, all those things that I just told you? They are all lies." His character neatly crosses the pathos with chilling. It is impossible to know what to do with it. He practically adds nothing to the plot, but the movie would be much less without his presence. <br /> <br /> It's a bad-tempered, murky movie. His people live in darkness. And there is a murder going on. Virtually no one screams or screams. The horror that these men have experienced and that some of them still carry with them like malaria seems to be just below the surface. <br /> <br /> See it if you have an opportunity.
