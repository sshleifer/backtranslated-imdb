"Mr. Bug Goes To Town" was the last great achievement that the Fleischer studios produced. The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with the assistance of Flieshcer veteran Sammy Timberg) are quite good, but not as good as the score of the Leigh Harline image that also obtained Snow White for Disney The "atmospheric music" of Harline is excellent and a delight for the ears. <br /> <br /> The design and the staging of the image was years before its time, and a Once again, the Fleischer's background artists surpassed themselves The beauty of the film's colors can not be denied, and while Hoppity the grasshopper is the star, the characters of Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito are stolen The voice of Jack Mercer (from Popeye) is priceless ... Kenny Gardner (brother-in-law) of Guy Lombardo ... and a featured vocalist in his band ... does his nice job in the role of Dick Dickinsen. > <br /> The film has been criticized for all the wrong complements The Fleischer Studios they were animation experts par excellence and this is very clearly shown in the final product. The film is melodious, the story is great for all ages, and the final scenes of the insects fighting for their lives in a rising skyscraper are some of the best representations and animations of any animated film past and present. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this wonderful film drawn by hand. Also, do not miss the sequence of the title with the most elaborate example of Max Fleischer's extraordinary 3D sterilization process, which took four months to build and employ 16,000 small glass panels in Manhattan's "electrified" buildings. <br /> <br /> Do not miss Mr. Bug Goes To Town ... also known as Hoppity Goes To Town. I'll bet you'll be attentive to the results!
