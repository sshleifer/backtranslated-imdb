An unusual movie for an audience outside the United States. Lena Horne looks fabulous and also Ralph Cooper. There is not an added background of tap steps like in other musicals, so you do not listen to the rhythm of the touches, which is a great realism. The music is muted to listen to the dance steps there. The acting is a bit forced and the models speak slowly, so you think the movie is older than it is. The costumes are daring for the moment in the dance routines at the end. You often feel like you are part of an audience at a theatrical show. The furniture you see is very modern, which adds to the cinema of other mundanes. A must for all moviegoers.
