I have to say it. Gary Busey saved this movie. If it were not for his talents of good acting, this movie would have been below average. I recommend the movie, but hardly. <br /> <br /> The biggest difficulty with the film is its great disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and mountainous? How is it that Buddy's producer, Petty, ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico study? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp to destroy Holly's sound? Why was Buddy's two-week courtship of Maria treated as a complex, taboo, racially mixed stereotype? Why are Buddy's tile boxes as light as feathers? Finally, why are the Crickets presented as problems to hinder Holly's talent? <br /> <br /> Taken in your face, these inaccuracies should spell the fate of any self-proclaimed movie, "The Buddy Holly Story." However, Busey offers a poignant image as the man whose death eventually led to the day that music died.
