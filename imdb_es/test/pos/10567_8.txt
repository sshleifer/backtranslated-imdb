This movie is definitely one of the best of its kind. A story from the time of Victrion's love, and, rough. The depth of its storyline is one that will shake most of the internal emotions of love and hate, with some very interesting twists, this is a must-have movie not only for the lesbian audience, but also for all viewers. I can not say much more or I will ruin the experience for a new and young audience that could be coming out. Another good job for Sarah Waters. It's also a great way for Sally Hawkins to win over audiences who only have a brief glimpse of her talent in another Sarah Waters work, in "Tilt the Velvet." It is also a must see ...
