A great performance by Emily Grace! I came across this movie while I was browsing my satellite lists and was curious about the plot summary of my satellite service provider. He was entertained and had a lot of compassion for the character "Alice" played by Emily Grace. The story made me guess what would happen to Alice and it was not predictable. The overall story was refreshing and had some great twists for the supporting characters. The end of the story ended in a fairly fair way. I will buy this DVD to add to my library. I am a new fan of Emily Grace and I am very much anticipated to see more of her performances.
