I can not believe the low scores of this movie. The probable reason has to do with the low number of votes, which means that few people have seen it. This is simply a fantastic movie! There are so many stories intertwined inside but it's not complicated. Each character grows with the film and we experience with them the changes in life. The stage is simply amazing and the final credits are the best of all the movies I've seen (as in a Shakespeare play). Yes, it's a little outdated (filmed in 1982) but the problems faced by the characters are very current. It could have been filmed in 2002 without modifications to the story line. Raul Julia is amazing, the best role in a movie, this is her signature piece. A young Molly Ringwald is excellent, as she matures from girl to boy. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a carefree young woman and John Cassavetes is the force that unites all this. Do yourself a favor, find this movie, look at it and enjoy it. Go back to IMDb and write this movie in the top 250 of all the times where it really belongs.
