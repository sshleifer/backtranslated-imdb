After seeing recently, Cry Uncle, from the same director, I decided to look for it and I'm glad I did! This is an extraordinarily good movie. Much, much better than it seems likely given the ingredients. How many times have we had to suffer the shame that someone who plays a middle-class dad mixes it with the children of the aagh flower? And yet, here, thanks to a perfect script, it becomes credible. Not ideal, neither good nor bad but credible. Peter Boyle, like the working class, the hippie and the babysitter, and Dennis Patrick as the tight suit, interpret their respective parts impeccably and I do not remember seeing the two classes gathered in this way without making things feel sentimental. Susan Sarandon is effective as a hippie girl but does not have much to do in her first movie. This is a true, must see the capture of the film as it does that very short period in the West and particularly in the times of the United States, when the culture of the counterculture was about to break.
