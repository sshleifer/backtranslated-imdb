... I can not believe that I got hooked on this show instantly, after seeing the first scene I was in deep. <br /> <br /> Anyway, first of all the boys are hot, Cappy, Evan, Calvin, Fischer, Cappy, Heath, Cappy, etc. <br /> <br /> Second, the girls are cute, sexy, intelligent and not afraid of being called bitches. I like that. Which, at the same time, does not make them bad and greedy, just realistic. <br /> <br /> Third, relationships are very good, especially Casey and Cappy. Lately, each program is far from its original path and people end up with someone who was not even in the first season. The relationship of Cappy and Casey is true love, a type that lasts. They loved each other over the years and it did not end when a guest star appeared. <br /> <br /> In today's world, it may be incredible that two people love each other for a long time, but it happens. And people define themselves in the university, so I knew exactly who I wanted to be in college. Like Casey and Cappy. <br /> <br /> I HOPE THAT THERE ARE MANY MORE SEASONS OF THIS SHOW AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN SEE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CASEY AND CAPPY NOW THAT WILL LIKELY BE TOGETHER, in Thanksgiving ... I love this show
