One day, a red stray cat is sick of being kicked by people and attacked by dogs and muses that life would be better if he were a skunk. Then it is painted black with a white stripe on the back and adds a bit of Limburger cheese to stink. At first, life could not be better for him, the dog flees and the butcher leaves his tent leaving the cat to go with a lot of meat. Just when you think that everything is perfect, you can see it with a real skunk, not only with any skunk, but with the overly amorous Pepé Le Pew. Pepé confuses the poor cat with a skunk and pursues him thinking that his protests are only shyness. Our poor cat thinks he has escaped when he throws a skunk skin from a tall building so that Pepé thinks he is dead. At first it seems to work, but when it escapes, Pepé sees it and instantly forgets the dead skunk. In the end, the cat realizes that it was better to be kicked and attacked instead of being coveted by a randy bitch ... there is also a good ending to the bitch when his wife discovers what he has been doing. <br /> <br /> This was a rather fun introduction for Pepé Le Pew, who at the time was too loving, but now looks like a sexually aggressive stalker stalker, although in the end he was punished for his behavior.
