I had never heard of this movie, but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown, and I found the story interesting, so I thought I would try. I found it very nice. Heath Ledger plays a 19-year-old who works like some kind of shitty job and wants to start making some serious money, so he goes and asks for the job of mobster Bryan Brown. I will not go into details, but things go very badly for Ledger and they get in big trouble with Bryan Brown. From the movie, the movie gets better and better, with a scene involving Ledger and a couple of bank robbers. And let's not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, who plays Ledger's love interest. I would definitely recommend this movie.
