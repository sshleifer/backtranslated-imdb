I have not seen this in years, but when I was about 6 years old, I saw it for the first time on VHS and I must have seen it at least 10 times. Now, as I said, it's been a while so I could ruin the plot, but I remember that some Colombian terrorists took a high school hostage with the demands of the main terrorist father (the "master of desires") to free him from the jail. Now I could only review the plot here in IMDb, but I'm pretty sure that's right. In any case, a group of children in the school decides that they will not stay seated and will wait to die so that they decide to counterattack. This movie has always been stuck in my mind. There are so many images that I have not forgotten, like the scene of Joey's death (I think?) or Billy spitting on terrorist sandwiches or the children's fake asthma attack (no idea of ​​his name). Only a great movie. It may be that movies like this have given me my tolerance for film violence because if I remember correctly, this movie is quite graphic. guys who are cut by machine gun helicopters, a special force guys who are ripped off by a grenade (I'm not sure about that, but I seem to remember something like that towards the end) and the bloodiest is the main terrorist who is covered in the head in bloody detail. Great action, great humor, good acting, wonderful cinematic experience. I have to see this again after all these years!
