I was surprised at how good this movie really is because when I saw it for the first time, I just had a little fun! However, I must say that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor was not given a bigger and better role. It was a huge talent. <br /> <br /> There is a great chemistry between all the members of the main cast and Matthau has never been more fun. <br /> <br /> I am extremely happy that this photo was taken because we can see Lemmon and Matthau forming a team for the last time; In a vehicle that gives great use to his talent. Brent Spiner demonstrates that the "data" of Star Trek the Next Geeration is not the only good character he can play. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple, but the comedy and the characters work very well and I laughed heartily. Throughout this film and I highly recommend it.
