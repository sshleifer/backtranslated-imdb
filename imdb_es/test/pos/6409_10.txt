This movie is like a skull. UNTIL it reaches musical numbers that are like MIND F * CK, but softer, like a mental caress. MIND FOREPLAY. The depressing vibe given by the speed and desperation of the characters can be quite impressive, impressive, until you get to the musical numbers. It's a great movie. Optimistic. Strange. Manic-depressive (bipolar). That's! THIS MOVIE IS BIPOLAR. Anyway, you see it. IT IS A MUSICAL !!! WITH DEPTH !! If you like existential scum like The Stranger, or Waiting for Godot, then you're likely to get a real kick out of it. I had to get the DVD through Amazon.com for about $ 12. OH and the rock songs. Well, they are rock, but they are not rock, like calypso, jazz, Broadway, but by Grace Chung, and I can not find the soundtrack NOW, but I want the songs to be great and the dances to be very fun.
