He had heard about the case, but he had not really paid attention during all the fuss of Fuhrman writing the book, arresting Skakel, etc. However, this movie did an excellent job of detailing Martha, the Skakel brothers, the murder. The involvement of Mark Fuhrman and the results of his research. I especially liked the flashback scenes with Martha talking about her last summer. The actress who interpreted it literally shone with life and made it even more poignant that the real Martha was probably like that. It made Martha look like a real person instead of a victim. I definitely recommend seeing this.
