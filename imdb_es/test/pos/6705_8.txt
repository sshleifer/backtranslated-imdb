Something that I think some people miss about the great science fiction is that it predicts a part of the future. No other theatrical movie I can remember predicted that when the space shuttle went to study Halley's comet, disaster would occur! Some differences were: the "Churchill" (the shuttle in the movie) actually went to the comet, the "Challenger" was only in low Earth orbit; The "Churchill" simply burned inside, while the "Challenger" exploded: the vampires had to return to Earth. A great similarity (and this is always bad luck!) They had mixed crews between men and women: the legend of Halley's comet and the disaster continues! <br /> <br /> Apart from this, there is not much more to say about this movie that has not been said before. As outer space / science fiction / horror / sex movie, it did not provide anything really new, but as with all great dishes, what counts is the combination. And overall, this was a very original and satisfying combination. <br /> <br /> I just want Mathilda May to drain her victims through another part of her body!
