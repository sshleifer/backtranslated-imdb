A lovely little movie about the introduction of films in China. It captures the amazement of the first audiences of the movie more or less as it is described as global, and uses the real Lumiere films for most realities. I do not agree with other people about the bad performance on the part of the British. I thought it was fine, but the Chinese leader really stole the show. In any case, I found a smile on my face for most of the movie. People who fear subtitles may notice that much of the film is in English (which for some reason receives subtitles as well as Chinese on the DVD).
