I am in a vast minority here. Nor did I care much about the original caddyshack, other than the scene of the Chase / Murray duo and Rodney's select jokes. It's okay, analyze it: Rodney vs. Jackie, both Jews and have a similar mood. Rodney is a bigger and more different name. Jackie has an incidental and more observational approach to her jokes and is more 'yours' in this sequel. Jackie's attitude towards everything is memorable and, in a way, inspiring! His quick lines and his excessive confidence made me want to wish I could express myself in that way. Rodney was good, but it was not enough, and he was more "in your face" and disdainful. Jackie, in a weird movie, makes a perfect substitute for Rodney (Come on, a gun-shaped hair dryer?!?!) Actually, look at the little things! Play snup yuppies very well. Ted Knight, despite his wonderful career in television / film, shows something of his age. but, he does remove the snobbish demands of the part and we want to see it fall. Ted looks a bit weak and is quite upset, since his anger and frustration are too slapstick, while the stack is incidentally more sarcastic and vengeful; You really hate it and enjoy watching it fail constantly. the pile wins with me. <br /> <br /> murray vs. aykroyd- well, both had great SNL style scenes with the chevy chase (ty webb) always present and pleasurable. I liked the Murray / Chase one better. Murray plays his big, annoying and talkative character with an obvious ability to improvise and is adorable, but annoying. and the same can be said of aykroyd. Both become annoying after a while, but it is a draw. <br /> <br /> I really loved part 2 about the first one. They are 2 totally different humor movies. The first part is more drug / bath / sex humor with a cast full of big names. Part 2 uses golf as a backdrop for a kind of "catchy to the rich" comedy that makes you feel better about being a working class. Screenplay of the 80? yes. a little exaggerated? Yes, but it was not the first. An insult to the sport of golf? Is it a thin story movie? Yes, it's a comedy with real humor, not 'dances with wolves'! In addition, part 2 has a much better soundtrack! PLEASE- DO NOT WAIT FOR THIS TO BE A SEQUENCE TO THE FIRST PART! IS 98% OF YOUR OWN MOVIE AND SHOULD NOT HAVE THE NAME "CADDYSHACK" IN IT. Having said that, I am a big fan of caddyshack 2 and is a great exponent of the 80s entertainment with a quality mood. LIVE JACKIE MASON !!! To all reducers - lighten! It's a great comedy of its own. Randy Quaid was wonderful, Jonathan Silverman was wonderful, heck, everyone was! All this chat and now I want to see it! I believe i do it
