It is always a pleasure to see characters in a movie who are good-hearted and well-meaning, even when they are surrounded by those who are not. The moderately silly premise of the film is that Franklin's conservative and religious family (mother, father, teenager and child) is involved in an accident in which the parents and brother have a near-death experience during which they find themselves with Jesus, a pleasant but somewhat exasperated soul experience that removes from them the burden of 'original sin'. When they return to their lives, many of their views and attitudes have changed, much to the daughter's dismay, who did not share the experience. The religious side is presented, I believe, with a good balance, from the good (Jesus) to the absolutely horrible (those of its 'followers' who are obsessed with the sins of others and completely alien to their own). It's a movie to make you think, give you some good laughs on the way and leave you with the pleasant feeling that the world could be a nicer place than you think.
