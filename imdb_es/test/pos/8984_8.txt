This film stars Peter Lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who emigrates to the United States. Unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he is in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned. Because he looks so bad, nobody wants to hire him and, out of sheer desperation, he resorts to a criminal life to earn the money to buy a mask to hide his ugliness. Where exactly the movie goes from there, you'll just have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie with an 8 because, for the money that is spent to make it, it's an excellent movie with a lot of good plot twists to keep it interesting. The film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film, but it goes far beyond this and offers some genuine surprises. In addition, Lorre's excellent performance shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles. This is an excellent movie and offers more than most of the "A-pictures" of the day.
