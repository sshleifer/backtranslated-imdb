The third and last film of Female Prisoner, Scorpion, directed by Shunya Ito. The star of the series, Meiko Kaji, would complete the series in the fourth installment, Grudge Song, directed by the able Yasuhara Hasebe (who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The original female prisoner # 701: Scorpion is one of my favorites of all time. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is almost as good. In general, it is considered the best of the series, and I could agree, I think, if you ever get a better DVD release (the original, from Image, is very poor). Beast Stable, in my opinion, is almost as good as FP701. It is much slower, much more contemplative. It has its share of violence and evil, but there is more focus on the story and the characters. Sasori (Kaji) eludes the detectives in the first scene (she is handcuffed to one, releases her arm and escapes with him, what must be seen to be believed!) And hooks up with an independent prostitute, Yuki. Yuki is being harassed by a local prostitution network, which includes a ridiculous looking lady with a cage full of crows. What really surprised me is how sad the movie is. The story of Yuki, which is never resolved, is heartbreaking. The images are amazing, and the direction of Ito is masterful. It is a pity that he has never gone anywhere after leaving the FP701 series. This is an awesome movie.
