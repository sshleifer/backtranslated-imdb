This is one of those films in which you must put aside some of its obvious deficiencies (result of the date and location of your production) and accentuate the positive. In many ways, this is a truly magnificent movie. <br /> <br /> Forgive the parody in the one-line summary, but the most serious flaw for an English speaker like me was the horrible subtitle. The impression I saw had subtitles from Soviet "Exports of Films" from 1982, which constantly used inverted grammar, probably to give the impression of a thirteenth-century speech. The real impact of this nonsense is making it harder to follow the subtitles, which means you spend less time looking at the images. Since the cinematographic image is a great strength of this film, this is a real problem. <br /> <br /> Other IMDB niks have written a lot about the Stalinist propaganda elements of this film (in case the viewer does not realize it for themselves.) They have also written a lot about the battle in the scene of the ice, which is excellent from my point of view. <br /> <br /> The love interest almost totally lacks subtlety and, however, in a strange way ... it is almost totally lacking in charm as well. from time to time. <br /> <br /> I was familiar with the music of Prokofiev in this movie long before I saw it, the images and the music complement each other beautifully, and it is the images that will remain in the mind for a long time. Bergman clearly learned a lot from these images: the images of his medieval pieces (for example, The Seventh Seal, The Virgin Spring) that are based on and enhance the ideas of Eisenstein, this film was made in 1938 in the USSR. that context, e It's a masterpiece, although defective. <br /> <br /> For the modern viewer, I suggest you go with the flow and enjoy the many delights that are displayed.
