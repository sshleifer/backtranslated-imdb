It's hard to put into words the devastating beauty of Traffik, in part because I'm still trying to understand it, several hours after my second visit. First, it must be said that Traffik contains some of the most unforgettable and unforgettable scenes I have seen in a film or television production. The performance is excellent, particularly that of Bill Paterson as a British minister fighting with his daughter addicted to heroin and an agreement to help Pakistan that depends on the problems of drugs. Another plot describes these soil-level drug problems in Pakistan, and revolves around a struggling poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. The third main plot involves the prosecution of a Hamburg drug importer and the conflicting efforts of his wife and two German detectives while he is under trial. It is a profound achievement that the interaction between these stories feels natural, transcending the entanglement of the plot that is often found in Hollywood movies. It is an even greater achievement than a work distributed in three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so concentrated and captivating, without having to simplify too much. It is devastating, devastating and brutal, but never apathetic. In short, Traffik is an uncommon cinematographic work that deals with challenging subjects with unparalleled compassion and clarity.
