Originally I saw this movie in a movie theater in Times Square in the late eighties. Who would have thought that this film would engender two sequels and have this cult. Night of the Demons was like most of the other movies that appeared at that time. A group of horny teens find themselves trapped in an isolated place and then murdered. at the same time in several horrible ways. Now that I think about it, the formula is still used and it seems to work as Saw II shows that I saw recently. <br /> <br /> I saw Mimi Kinkade at a Fangoria convention about six years ago, and she had such a kind heart! I guess that makes her a good actress if she could make a career of playing this demon-possessed woman in all these horror movies. Anyway, I just saw this movie on the VHS cassette. The movie still remains. A bit slow at first, as I remembered when I saw it for the first time, but then it accelerates. One of the horror classics of the eighties and worth seeing!
