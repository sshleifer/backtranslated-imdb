Someone once defined what is the definition of INTELLECTUAL ANTEL as "a person who can hear" William Tell's overture "without thinking about the LONE RANGER". In this, we wholeheartedly agree! Surely it would be a difficult task to achieve this, and a task that Leopold Stokowski, Arturo Toscanini or .Leonard Bernstein would find almost impossible to accomplish. <br /> <br /> And in this there is no misfortune. The radio series and the television series, along with some series of films, feature films, comic strips from syndicated newspapers and comics, did their part to make "the masked man of the plains and his faithful Indian companion, Silly" an element deeply sown of our collective psyche and our literary folklore. <br /> <br /> As with most legends, everything started gradually, first with a series of Radio Plays, written for local use in Detroit on Radio Station WXYZ. The creator was one George W. Trendle and the main writer of the series was Mr. Trendle's brother-in-law, Mr. Fran Striker. The year was 1933 when the Ranger headed for the first time to "The Plains of the Western United States!" The Lone Ranger, Fool and the Radio Series successfully guided Depression-era Americans in the mid-to-late 1930s and into World War II. But the post-war era found the country in the midst of an explosion of inventions and technology from Super-Nova. There was a new media ready in the wings, but unable to move forward until both VE Day and VJ Day had been achieved. Once they were achieved, the World and America were ready to settle in both Peace and Prosperity. The "New Technology" was, of course, TELEVISION! And surely we would need something more than "Roller Derby" and "Wrestling From Marigold Arena" to fill the broadcast hours. And while at the beginning, the TV station had something turned on, except the portrait of that Mohican Chief (Test Pattern, Schultz!). Very soon and with great haste, the Networks began to take advantage of their existing natural resources, their existing programming ! Practically everyone would be ready to adapt to the television screen. <br /> <br /> Then, the people of Lone Ranger, Incorporated were very interested when producers Jack Chertok, Harry Poppe, Sherman Harris and Jack Wrather approached them. an agreement to put The Masked Man and Tonto on television, as well as Radio. <br /> <br /> They immediately went to work and gave us the first season, which made use of the considerable Radio record. Dramas, all of them potentially adaptable to television dramas. They chose Clayton Moore, an excellent supporting actor in many feature films, and with a dozen years of experience. I had also done some work in Serials in Republic Pictures' "Thrill Factory", which would be an invaluable experience when doing "THE LONE RANGER". Chosen as his "faithful Indian companion" and partner in bringing justice to various parts of the border, we had great perfection in the actor who supports the character, Jay Silverheels. ** We must mention that there was a gap in '53, when Clayton Moore walked and was replaced by John Hart. After a season or so, Mr. Moore was back in the position of having lost so much! Now back to our history !! The first years of filming gave the episodes their own appearance and sound. They made good use of Narrator off-screen, which gave these shows a sense of authenticity and an individual and outstanding series. The actors employed were all veterans of the films of the late silent era until the 1930s and 1940s. Many of them had been exclusively from "Cowboy Movie" players. A good example of this is the casting of Glenn Strange (Bartender Sam in "GUNSMOKE") as the vicious and murderous gang leader, Butch Cavandish. And it was the Cavendish Gang massacre of the Texas Rangers that led to the origin of John Reid (believed to have been killed with the other Texas Rangers) as the "LONE RANGER". <br /> <br /> Besides the old ones in the cast, you'll find a lot of new and promising talent (then) in the cast. We see people like Phyllis Coates, Dwayne Hickman, Denver Pyle and others in the cast from week to week. All this, along with a constant appeal to fair play, justice and peace in a Western world. <br /> <br /> The last couple of seasons brought great changes. First was the use of color filming. That did not make any difference, since a color television was still far away for our house. The second was a new set of musical themes and tails. (Aside from Rossini's ending of "U NO Wutt!") The new music was never a big problem for us, as we preferred the "Old Radio" actions. <br /> <br /> With this series and two feature films made during this period, THE LONE RANGER (Warner Brothers, 1956) and THE LONE RANGER AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (United Artists, 1958), the character has been impressed permanently and indelibly in our identity as a People, we, the Americans!
