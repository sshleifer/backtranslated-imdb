I thought that this movie was very underestimated. The theme seems like it would be a bit strange, and at first they left me, but once I was watching the movie, it did not seem strange to me. I was intrigued with all the different possibilities that history had to offer, and I could not wait to discover how it would end. Once it was over ... I thought about it for a long time afterwards. I was pleased with everything related to K-Pax, from the acting and the history and the scientific elements and the psychological problems, to the end. It is not a particularly happy or happy movie, although it makes you laugh from time to time, but I found it especially entertaining and stimulating. I own it now, and I intend to see it many times.
