So, I'm not going to disagree with the critics, but I really was not very touched by this movie. I was a little hesitant to rent it, since I'm going through some of the same things that the protagonist is supposed to be experiencing. however, I rented it thinking that I might experience some catharsis, or at least understand that I am not alone. While I understood the irritation of the protagonist with his careless cousin, I did not feel his inner struggle against isolation as much as I would have liked. I felt that much more emphasis was placed on his disruptive cousin who stayed at another moment of his welcome. It's a beautifully filmed movie, and I really appreciate the use of silence to get the feeling of isolation.
