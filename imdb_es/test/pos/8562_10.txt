I watched this movie with my family during a long weekend of Thanksgiving. I am grateful that someone insisted that we see it, although I did not pay much attention until the end of the film when a short circuit seemed promised, but, unfortunately, it does not happen. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I saw this movie a few years later and I loved its vivacity, absurdity, brightness and simply fun. I think the movie has a feminine tone. Women are not exploited in it, although I'm sure someone might think that the movie is pure exploitation. I think the movie plays with the tropes of the time. <br /> <br /> I still think someone should redo it. And specify some of the implications in the original.
