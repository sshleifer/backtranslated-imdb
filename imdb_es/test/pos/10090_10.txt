In general, a film can have factors such as "awakening", "feeling good", "sense of purpose", "plot", etc. There is always something that can be taken out of the movies, it's just a matter of how convincing the reason is, so that I own it in my collection. "Tale of two sisters", as they call it when it was launched in my country, has a tremendous sensation and an eventually self-explanatory argument (I love it). I love horror movies that revolve around a house. The titles that come to my mind are "The Others", "The Haunting", "The Haunting of Hell House". This movie will be another great example that I will remember. The film had an extremely rich color, in the way it was decorated, with the clothes it wore. the characters used, in the daylight scenes, in contrast to most horror films, which usually use desaturated tones and somber environments (think of Honogurai mizu no soko kara, Dark Water, which is another program that I like) . This film has a sense of aesthetics and joy when it was not in its most exciting moments. The characters are extremely credible. This can be attributed in part to the familiar surroundings of this movie. Maybe domestic problems are easier for me too. as the actors with whom to identify themselves, and the actors Their characters with exceptional delicacy. The director plays with timelines, in order to give the audience the story in fragments, which allows them to come up with their own terms of interpretation, instead of presenting everything in a linear way. This is a positive aspect of this film, in my opinion, and, perhaps, it is my interpretation of this film that allows me to enjoy it. I will definitely look for this on DVD.
