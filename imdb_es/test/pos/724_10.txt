I have seen many movies and this totally amazed me. The trauma, the suspense is simply incredible. I ended up so wrapped up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it, and relating it to reality. The movies that play and challenge your mind are movies that you do not forget, those that make you doubt your reality. A problem could be quality, but that does not reduce the essence of the film. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is brilliant and the ending leaves you completely surprised and with the question you must seek the answer. I totally loved it! So many clues and contractions and riddles. One of the best movies of all time, without a doubt.
