In 1982, two films were released to each other that dealt with extraterrestrials. The film by Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter, The Thing. Of the two, ET was the one that won the hearts of people around the world, although The Thing debuted first. Because people were so fascinated by Spielberg's warm and confused alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing en masse. <br /> <br /> It's not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the heart that still beats. The other is a hard and uncompromising film that depicts extraterrestrial life as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt that the ET was a much prettier prospect than The Thing's tentacles and the slime-covered saliva! <br /> <br /> It has taken some time, but The Thing has been winning a substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare example of a new superior version. It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic and reinvents them in a surprising and imaginative way. In fact, Carpenter does his job so well that he actually manages to make a film that is, in every inch, equal to the showrunner of the genre, Alien. And that's even weirder! <br /> <br /> Carpenter's film follows its original material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World. Keep the cold waste of Antarctica as a backdrop, because it is the perfect backdrop when you try to establish a greater sense of isolation. But although it is a little lacking in the characterization, the remake adapts to the mentality of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that surrounds them slowly. <br /> <br /> Frequent Carpenter collaborator, Kurt Russell, returns, with all the success of Escape From New York, cast once more as one of Carpenter's perpetual antiheroes. Play MacReady, the helicopter pilot in an Antarctic research station (what they are investigating is what nobody can imagine). The problem begins when a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to shoot a Siberian Husky from the air. <br /> <br /> They end up dying because of their problems, and while the camp tries to solve the problem. Mystery of what happened, take the Husky and add it to yours. Except that this Husky is not a Husky at all. But an alien that changes shape. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when it was thawed, they massacred their crew. Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being down to the smallest detail. Soon, paranoia and suspicion make their way through the 12-man team, until no one is sure who is human and who is not. <br /> <br /> The Thing is one of the best films by John Carpenter. In fact, I'm tempted to say it's the best movie he's ever done. Even beating the classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I put The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like his last movie that could really be called a classic. Everyone else since then has felt as if Carpenter was dragging him. Films that did not flow with the sophisticated sophistication and irregular intensity so prevalent in his previous works. <br /> <br /> But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. It has never generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the fierce Assault on Precinct 13. From the moment the alien is present, Carpenter increases the level of tension relentlessly. And when he delivers his blows, they come with an agonizing shake. <br /> <br /> The film is a mixture of pure atmospheres and visceral horror. An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in the hands of Carpenter it fuses perfectly. Bringing Rob Bottin from The Howling fame, he faces some of the most amazing transformation effects he's ever seen in a horror movie. Amorphous forms Human traits semi-formally contrasted with open jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. In fact, the effects of the film are so amazing that they cause writhing, The Thing was criticized for being too realistic! <br /> <br /> That kind of thinking loses its meaning completely. It only reduces the values ​​of the movie. And there are many. Carpenter only plays an effects set when he needs it. It is in the quieter moments of the film, where it seems to be especially in tune with the story. The Thing is a often bewildering story of shadows, whispers and implications. Characterization has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works in his favor in The Thing. Because we know almost nothing about the cast, it only makes the current situation much more confusing. We are never sure, from one moment to the next, who is who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and keeps its mystery in subsequent presentations. <br /> <br /> A special mention should go to the excellent score of the Ennio Morricone movie. A dull thud every two seconds. It creates a mysterious and spooky feeling that is very difficult to shake. The whole movie is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene in which a blood test is done to see who the human is is hurt so skillfully by Carpenter, you may bite your nails without realizing it. <br /> <br /> The Thing is a pure and unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is solved. An underestimated film, well worth the reassessment received. And much better than ET!
