I was looking in the TV Guide for movies that came from Germany and I found a call The Bunnyguards, so I saw it and I laughed dumb. I wanted the DVD, but it is not available here (I could order it from Germany but it does not have subtitles) It was played again, so I recorded it and saw it from time to time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I looked for information about him and found out that his real name is Erkan & Stefan, but I know from his Australian title: The Bunnyguards. <br /> <br /> Some people I know from Germany do not like Erkan & Stefan Because of their accents, but not being German, I did not notice anything. The jokes are good, but some Germans can find their accents unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is fun and if the DVD has subtitles in English in all the extras (it has a 2 disc edition with only the feature of having subtitles it would be bad) I would buy it in an instant ! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story.
