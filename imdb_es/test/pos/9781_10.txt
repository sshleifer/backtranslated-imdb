My family and I enjoyed this show and found it in a fair outline of what happened to the people. <br /> <br /> My own father spent some time in Changi before going to the Thailand-Burma Railway in "F" Force. As much as it has been said about the treatment that prisoners of war received, I will only say that my father was 6 feet and 1 inch and 196 pounds when Singapore fell, at the end of the war he was 5 feet and 11 inches tall and 91 lbs. > <br /> No program could really transmit what the prisoners of war went through, but this is closer than most. <br /> <br /> As the former prisoners of war say, "if you did not have companions you did not survive." This program manages to convey this message.
