The story begins with a soldier being transported to a desert city and then back in time to tell the story of how he came to this place. He began as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt, but separated from his unit. After almost starving and / or dying of thirst, he found a leopard that somehow became his chest mate. He brought him food and in a short time the soldier became almost totally wild, so sharp was his bond with the animal. However, all things end and the man decided that it was necessary for him to leave the creature. A very strange movie, well written and portrayed. Beautiful landscapes of Jordan and Utah that did not always match perfectly, but who cares.
