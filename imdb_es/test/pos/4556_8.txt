A remake of TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILE PLANS in many ways. I think it's a coincidence so bad and sad that John Candy and Chris Farley left us when they still had a lot to do. God bless you both. I think that the plots of 2 movies are really similar, road trips of two different poles of characters and many unfortunate consequences due to the Chubbies. This movie can not be about airplanes and cars, but it's a really entertaining movie, especially with a great performance by Chris Farley. The missing part in this movie is the delicate thing when compared to Candy & Martin Classic, but I think it's better that way.
