I only have praise for this movie. From start to finish, he captured the brightness of Stephen Sondheim's musical. I'm not a big fan of musicals, most of them are very exaggerated. This however changed my mind. I am also an actor and I have played Sweeney and I know how difficult this role is. George Hearn gave an impressive performance, masterful and rounded, worthy of the highest awards we can give him (he won an Emmy and that's something). Everything he does becomes gold. It is so good that it will leave you amazed why it is not in the Oscar winning films. Lansbury is also very good and very funny. Sara Woods is as creepy and wonderful as the beggar woman. In general, a great video. Pick it up if you can.
