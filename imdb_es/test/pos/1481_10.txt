I liked this movie too much. My only problem is that I thought that the actor who played the villain was a low rent, Michael Ironside. Corsican Ironside is just a rental under Jack Nicholson. I guess Mike was busy that year with "Highlander 2: The Quickening." Unfortunately, "Beastmaster 2" would have been a much better career change. It is undoubtedly the best of the Beastmaster series and in many ways it is reminiscent of that great classic of the big screen "Masters of the Universe". Not only is the star of the incomparable Mark Singer, but also has an incredible cast of support, specifically the second girl of "Sliders", Uncle Phil of "Fresh Prince of Belair" and the evil girl of "Superman 2". It shook my world and is definitely a must for anyone without social or physical exits. BEAST FOREVER! ROCK AND ROLL!!!
