I have not been a fan of Madonna for quite some time, however, I thought about commenting on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was wrong. One of them, like Madonna, was criticized by critics. They were very wrong and many potential spectators were rejected by bad reviews. <br /> <br /> First, Madonna does an excellent job in this movie, which was one of the first. She plays a blonde ditsy in the movie, she is far from being a ditsy blonde in real life. Most of the critics were somewhat prejudiced by his reputation as a singer and did not give him a fair deal. When you see this movie, I hope you understand that accent and stupidity are just acting. She was absolutely hysterical like the movie. <br /> <br /> Griffen Dunne is another person who was not given a fair critique in the movie. If you take a look at his filmography, you will see that he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, this is something like a pretty woman, but it came 3 years earlier than Roberts. Gere the success. It is a silly comedy with many site gags, slapstick and a line. Part of the comedy is expressionless and takes a comedy buff to really appreciate the more subtle humor. <br /> <br /> I know this does not say much about the movie, however, I hope this helps to dispel any belief that This is a bad movie. It's worth renting for a nice and fun night. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Gary
