This is a beautiful, but simple film about a man, who seeks an answer, an answer that does not necessarily need, but has structured his whole life. It is heartbreaking, hilarious, glorious, tormenting, delicate and dynamic, I say it's great. <br /> <br /> I read Jonathan Safran Foer's book Everything is illuminated (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood starred in the movie adaptation, and the characters fascinated me.) I laughed out loud more than once. that someone talks about what is involved, I hear the same trite answer, almost as if it were a long and long word: "It's about buying it for the woman who saved her grandmother from the Nazis." However, this story is So philosophical, it goes deeper than that, that conversation about the ring and "in case." It really makes you think: Suddenly, this story is combined from a simple search to an internal metamorphosis, and now I find myself looking at the things of way a little different. <br /> <br /> I recommend renting this before, if you do, reading it, because the book had a lot of obscene and totally perverted stories that were not included in the film, mainly the story of the family from Jonathan that was not necessary for the movie. <br /> <br /> A little trivial, I heard, is that Wood's current girlfriend has a cameo in this movie as the band's drummer that Alex arranges to perform while Jonathan gets off the train to Ukraine. <br /> <br /> You spend half of the movie trying to find out what it is, exactly, and what Jonathan is about, because his character is so withdrawn, like a turtle with a shell. <br /> <br /> It is magnificent, and in my opinion, one of Elijah Wood's best films.
