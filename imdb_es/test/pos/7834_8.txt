Forget everything you've read about the direct video release of "Makeschi Brothers," "Snakes on a Train," especially if it was a negative review. This movie is much more fun than the movie that obviously starts: "Snakes on an airplane". Frankly, I'm surprised that more people are not doing rapsodization on this low budget asylum publication. On the other hand, most of the reviews I've read are not friendly or worth anything, except the usual idiocy of the pack's stupidity, like the fact that the performance was amateur, the action did not correspond numerically to advertising , and all this was a horrible waste of time. Of course, it does not help that the title is an indication of the obvious nature of this film. Actually, I felt that "Snakes on a Train" surpassed "Snakes on a Plane" for several reasons. <br /> <br /> First, the producers used real and real snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they replaced them. False giant snake heads or computer generated a super giant snake that consumed an entire train Amtrak type. How many movies does a snake swallow a train? As a result, "Snakes on a Train" ranks as the first movie to scale that height. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this low budget movie employs some frightening effects. The woman who coughs baby snakes - the real ones - was fantastic! The special effects that his forearms would break later in the movie were visually appealing! In addition, you can see a small white girl being devoured alive by a snake. She was as pretty as she could be, she was no more than 10 years old or older, and she died screaming all the time as the nasty giant snake head swallows her. Not only children in danger, but children eaten! This is exactly the kind of graphic material that you will not find in 99% of all Hollywood theatrical releases. Of course, it was not eaten by a real snake, but what counts is subversive thought. <br /> <br /> Third, it's one of those curses about the movies where Alma (Julia Ruiz from "That Guy") The main female character, no heroine, has a curse that her parents imposed on her because she did not He married the man they recommended. As a result, it fills with snakes, coughs up amounts of green liquid from the radiator and then swallows a baby snake. Imagine Medusa, the mythical characters who had snakes by hair, only with snakes in their belly. Her psycho-shaman boyfriend picks up all the snakes that come out of her because they are going to L.A. in a train to see a relative of yours who can put all the snakes inside her and return it to normal. Talk about a character out of combat who performs stomach agitation routines. Get ready for a lot of silt, blood and blood. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the train had only about twenty passengers, not hundreds. However, it seemed that the Mallachi Brothers filmed this above-average terror movie aboard a real train with real snakes and played the rolling movement of the train on the tracks. <br /> <br /> Fifth, snakes Slide for the first hour, silently infiltrating the train before they become rare and attack everyone. In other words, it is suspense, suspense, suspense, before people start dying from snake bites. <br /> <br /> Until the last five minutes, when the snake grows more than the train out of control and swallows "Snakes on a Train" it is deformed, wonderful, and out. He does not have the attention deficit edition of a major league Hollywood movie. It is a fantasy about an unfortunate Hispanic woman victim of her feminist attitude, in disagreement with society. <br /> <br /> Together, you have bloody fantasy type things; suspense snakes that crawl around the train, and I am the gigantic serpent on top at the end. Incidentally, they get on the train because many other Mexicans have bribed a train attendant and the Mexicans on board think that the girl is so cute that they left her and her boyfriend free. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than "Snakes on a Plane" if you want a tough, small and independent production horror movie.
