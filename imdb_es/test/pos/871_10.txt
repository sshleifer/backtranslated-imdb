It is a joy to see the film, not only for the plot, which is exciting, but also for the excellent performances of the actors, Deneuve and Belmondo. Although it is considered a "failure" in its first release, it has become a critical success, and it is clear why. Deneuve's acting style matched perfectly with the film. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding or hiding something, and her character in this movie is. I will not spoil it by saying what, although it is reported fairly soon. Belmondo is adorable as the watertight, quite naive but in love. I would recommend this movie to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans. It's a brilliant Hitchcockian-style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that unfold like the movie does. The movie is about 2 hours, so you feel you have not sold very little. Deneuve steals the program in this film, and it is clear that when making the film, Truffaut was very much in love with her. A must for any filmmaker or moviefan. 10/10
