But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that is just the beginning. <br /> <br /> I'm not entirely sure that any description of the movie and the plot motivates you to look at this one. Suffice to say that it has something for virtually everyone: death, singing, a bright suit, cell phones, a small person (actually, a pretty woman), a drawbridge (modern, not medieval), a boombox and a crossbow . Oh, and a psychotic. And Barry Manilow. <br /> <br /> You will have to trust me when I tell you that 50% of you will hate this movie because of the lack of the absurd gene in your DNA composition. It's not your fault; it is hereditary The other 50% of you will probably want to change the channel after 20 minutes, but you MUST KEEP OBSERVATION. <br /> <br /> Even so, in the end you may wonder why you saw ... but keep in mind that absurd thing. I should grow in you. It's a test.
