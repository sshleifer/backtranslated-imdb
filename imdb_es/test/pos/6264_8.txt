A beautiful film about the arrival of early silent movies in China. SHADOW MAGIC skillfully combines a love story with the drama of cultural clash between ancient Chinese traditions and modern western culture in film form. An incredible first film by Chinese director Ann Hu. If I correctly understood Ms. Hu's comments at the 2000 Sundance festival, this film was produced as an American film with co-financing from the Chinese government and was filmed in China. SHADOW MAGIC reminds me of films like IL POSTINO and CINEMA PARADISO, not necessarily in the theme or the plot, but it has a similar feeling.
