Fantastic documentary A movie inside a movie. I am so happy that Block was forged after his mother's death. It makes one wonder about the time and money spent on therapy. What could have happened if she did not have that way out? Did the therapist help you or did you simply promote a dependency that kept the color of your bank account? The hearing needs to understand that divorce was one less option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or to job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation. I wonder if the therapist ever tried to make her think about what she could have done to change her situation and free herself. Meanwhile, wife # 2 was the opposite. She was there, working with her dad; She ended her bad marriage, she supported herself and she seems to be a very safe and generous person. Whatever the state of the marriage, the Blocks did something right by raising 3 children who could see their parents' story, agree with us and share it with us and perhaps lead us to start conversations with our parents and spouses.
