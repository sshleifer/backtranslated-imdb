I'm not a big fan of Lucio Fulci's movies. Most of his 80's gore movies had their moments, but they were often found as imitations of second-rate Dario Argento. With the exception of the entertaining "Zombie" (which was an imitation of George Romero), I did not really enjoy them. I know that Italian horror often does not take into account the plot, but the plot and characters of his films were too simple even by standards. That's why I was surprised "Do not torture a duckling". It's actually a very well made movie with a fascinating murder mystery. Possibly it is the best giallo that has been made, only rivaled seriously by the entries of Dario Argento in the genre. And unlike Fulci's previous giallo "A lizard on the skin of a woman", this never goes on. <br /> <br /> Fulci's address here is pretty good. Keeps the story moving at a good pace and keeps the interest of the viewer at all times. In addition, the conclusion of the mystery is a complete surprise to the public. In addition, he adds some clever touches, such as optimistic soul music during a particularly disturbing sequence of cemetery beats. In general, the violence here is restricted and only used when necessary for the story. The performance is also good for the most part, full of familiar faces from the Italian exploitation cinema of the 70s. Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are super cool in everything. The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan, whose performance is too high. It's the only ridiculous aspect of the movie. "Do not Torture a Duckling" definitely comes with my recommendation and can be a good introduction to the subgenre Giallo as a whole. (8/10)
