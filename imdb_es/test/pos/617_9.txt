This is one of the movies that one has to start seeing with an open mind. One knows that it is a silence, one can wait or be afraid because of many feelings. <br /> <br /> Well, forget it. The movie starts with a bit of black humor, and then it starts. From then on, it will take you on an always terrifying journey through the dark centers of Moscow. It is well, it must be said: unexpected turns are expected, and silence is mainly used as a tracing tool or generator of fear. But this movie does not let you go. <br /> <br /> It's like the old gangster movies, but without any glamor and in Russia. And that is one of the most important aspects of this film: it is located in Russia. This has a great impact on the film, in my opinion it makes it better. Everything becomes simple and basic, life has no meaning. This could be a great potential for more movies in the future, gangster films about the Russian mafia. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful and terrifying movie. It's horror, but you can not feel anything but sympathy for the little mute. One last tip: do not see it too late at night if you want to sleep well.
