One of the best comedies to run on Indian television along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar. The good acting, the good rhythm and an extremely fun script made this a truly memorable series. The fun opening montage (sung by none other than the inimitable Kishore Kumar) gave a very accurate picture of what one might expect. I used to borrow it from my local video library years after Doordarshan had stopped broadcasting it. I would like Indian television to return to serials like these instead of the tele-saras-bahu and the reality shows, which are so good for these days. Anyone who has found a really good comedy should go and get this series. You can also enjoy a couple of Pakistani comedies, such as ups and downs and aik aur aik, which are undoubtedly comparable to the best ones in India.
