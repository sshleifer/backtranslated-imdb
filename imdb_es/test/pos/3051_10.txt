If you are a fan of the first Duke movies, this old man from Lone Star is good. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak and Gabby? A lot of good walks and shooting! I thought it was incredible that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, which is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill could also have been. Anyway, if you like good, clean and early western movies, do not miss it. We do not have to wonder about hidden meanings or try to figure out the underlying issues. Just sit back, relax and enjoy a western movie from a simpler day and hour. It's called entertainment people!
