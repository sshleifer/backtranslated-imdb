"Seeing other people" is a bold romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice (Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson) who are engaged and plan to get married soon. They live together but both have doubts about their relationship. Alice realizes that she has had very little sex in the past, she could be marrying Ed because she has never felt anything else. So they agree to start playing with other people for a while to prove their own relationship. <br /> <br /> The film balances a question of conscience: focusing too much on the "What if?" Aspects of life, can you actually do the opposite and just make you feel more constricted? When Ed starts having sex with a college girl, he starts to become addicted and almost forgets Alice: when he realizes this, it scares him. <br /> <br /> I had not heard anything about this movie beforehand, but I enjoyed it. It's not extremely well done and definitely has that low-budget indie feel, but it's much better than most of the romantic comedies that exist today in the mainstream. <br /> <br /> Take a look if you get an opportunity.
