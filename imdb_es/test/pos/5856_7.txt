Now, I know that Sandra Bullock produced this movie, but she needs to learn that sometimes you need to make certain sacrifices to advance the story ... like not trying to make the whole movie about her character! <br /> <br /> The story is about two high school students (one rich and popular, the other intelligent and antisocial) who formulate a plan to commit murder and follow it by number ... just to see if they can get away with it. that. Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case. The boys planted evidence, created alibis and cleaned themselves so well that the policemen fell in love with the whole event. But Sandra has the feeling that everything is not as it seems. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a great Hitchcock-style thriller, but the film takes too much time to get to know Sandra's character rather than focusing on the actual crime itself. You see, something happened in her past that pursues her throughout the movie. And we got to know everything ... EVERYTHING about that. It just gets pretty tedious after a while, especially when you're in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then you have to stop that investigation to find out what happened to it in the past. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the real winners of this movie. They play their characters convincingly and with the right amount of malice. If the script had spent more time concentrating on these characters and had kept the detectives there just to do their job, this could have been an immensely entertaining thriller. With the way it is, most of the emotion is lost. They should have eliminated all things with Sandra's character and made a separate TV movie for the Lifetime channel. But I digress. It is still an entertaining movie, however. I recommend this movie ... but I wait for the video / DVD.
