The film is more a simulacrum of corruption throughout the American system. The correlations of those who vote that do not matter are shown in the machines that end up voting for a comedian for the oval position. Politicians are so funny that we almost need a comic book to represent us, as they have made us laugh for years all over the world. Bushism has become a way of life for Americans and will be the only thing that will remain after I leave office to anyone soon. Interestingly, the only honest person is someone who has not even been elected to the position and tells the truth in the end. The story is very subtle and if you look at it to laugh, it is not happening. Leave a lot to think. In general I enjoyed it.
