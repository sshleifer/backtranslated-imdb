I just saw a very original movie that I would recommend to everyone, including "the young and the restless". However, I think some of the bad words, violence and sexual advances in the film are not suitable for "all your children". Anyway, before the sand fills the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the movie: "Nurse Betty." Renee Zellweger plays Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls into a trance, and believes that she is a real-life character from her favorite soap opera. Because of this, he goes on a trip to Los Angeles to meet with his supposed lover of the telenovela character, Dr. Rubell. To add fuel to the fire, she is also being persecuted by assassins who believe she has stolen her drugs. You could say that this is how Nurse Betty spends "the days of her life" throughout the film. This situation "so little general" finally leads to the whole "hospital" of his beloved telenovela. However, the only problem is that Betty thinks that all this is real. It's as if your mind is in "another world". In agreement! Enough! I will clean my mouth with soap and I will not mention more names of soaps. I have already registered my vote for Renee as the best Oscar-nominated actress. In addition, the performance of Greg Kinnear as Dr. Rubell was as good as seen in his biography as an actress. To summarize, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call "Nurse Betty". ***** Excellent
