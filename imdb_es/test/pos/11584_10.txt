As I expected, many critics of this film (both professionals and amateurs) have focused as much if not more on the ideology of the film. That's because The Sea Inside (also known as Sea Inside) is a film about euthanasia. Specifically, it is a true story about an infamous Galician called Ramón Sampedro, who fought for many years for the right to assisted suicide, to whom the Spanish constitutional court denied that right and, well, I do not want to ruin it. The end of the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Real life Sampedro catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in Spain. Now with the biopic of the producer / director / writer / composer / editor Alejandro Amenábar (Abre Los Ojos, 1997, and The Others, 2001), The Sea Inside, another rhetorical aid has been offered in the international debate on this hot topic. <br /> <br /> But as I continue to say (for deaf ears?), your opinion, for or against, about the ideology of the film should not affect your rating of the film. You are not supposed to qualify the philosophical or political messages that Amenábar wants to make. You're supposed to be rating the movie, like a movie. It may be too idealistic, since none of us can completely separate our evaluations from our ideological prejudices, but that is the goal, idealistic or not. <br /> <br /> So forget for a moment about philosophical and political issues. . As a film, Amenábar has become one of his most elegant and mature works to date. It does not focus on social debates. It does not focus on Sampedro's legal / political struggles. He focuses on Sampedro as a man, living his days in a bed in his brother's house. <br /> <br /> Sampedro, played here in an incredible performance by Javier Bardem, was a quadriplegic. When the film begins, it has been quadriplegic for 26 years. That condition occurred, as Amenábar shows through wonderfully filmed flashbacks, by a diving accident. Sampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman, miscalculated the water, dived, broke his neck and almost drowned. As a quadriplegic, he finally began writing poetry, part of which was published in a book entitled Letters From Hell ("Letters from Hell"); In real life, Sampedro's book became a bestseller in Spain. Perhaps taking as reference the artistic work of Sampedro, Amenábar has created an elegant and poetic film. <br /> <br /> Most of The Sea Inside is located inside Sampedro's bedroom. The focus in these scenes is the complex and sublime performance of Bardem. As a quadriplegic, Bardem is limited to moving his head and talking. He has mastered the subtle changes of expression and inflection to convey a deep character with a multifaceted and intellectual approach to life. Bardem and Amenábar have made Sampedro often a philosophical subject in discrete language, but there is always a combination of a perverse sense of humor, a passion for aesthetics, including music and women, and a sadness and even occasional bitterness. well below the surface. Different underlying emotions occasionally break like waves on the skin of the ocean. <br /> <br /> The people Sampedro interacts with most often facilitate this in a complex way. These others include his sister-in-law, Manuela (Mabel Rivera), who has been her primary carer since the Sampedro accident; his brother, José (Celso Bugallo), who is one of the vocal objectors to Sampedro's desire to die, and with whom there is an underlying unresolved problem (it seems that José was the one who saved Sampedro from drowning). his nephew, Javier (Tamar Novas), who is perhaps the most sympathetic to him; an advocate of the right to die, Gené (Clara Segura); a pro bono lawyer, Julia (Belén Rueda), whom she wanted because she suffered from a degenerative disease, CADASIL (autosomal dominant cerebral arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), and therefore more empathic and from whom she falls in love; and Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a local woman who works in a canning and lunar factory as a DJ, who knew about him in the media, who wants to convince him that he wants to live and that he falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> The bulk of the film consists of these characters who interact with Sampedro in his room. There are also some other auxiliary characters, including Sampedro's father, who remains strangely distant, and a notorious and media-conscious priest, Father Francisco (José María Pou), who does everything possible to change Sampedro's mind through of philosophy / theology (in a scene often erroneously characterized as "comic" - has an accompanying comic element, but the scene is mainly very serious). <br /> <br /> That most of the film takes place in the Sampedro room ingeniously gives the couple significant changes in establishing greater impact. Sampedro's room has a nice big window with which he says he is satisfied as a world observation point. Perhaps even more important, he regularly imagines the window as a launching pad through which he flies across the slopes to the ocean, which he has always loved and which has been the most influential force in his life: he provided his life when I was younger and took away his mobility. Amenábar gives us a fantastic sequence of Sampedro imagining one of his flights to the sea. It is beautifully shot, with low angles (probably from a helicopter) of the hills that run, until we follow a current to the open ocean, which in this film represents freedom, infinite and natural forces. <br /> <br /> The other significant change in configuration comes with Sampedro finally taking a wheelchair (otherwise, he refused to say that he "made fun of his immobility") to appear in court and help defend your case. Amenábar gives us a moving and melancholic travel notebook, photographed subjectively, Sampedro seeing life and the world in action from the window of the car. <br /> <br /> Whether you agree with the legalization of euthanasia or not, it is difficult to deny that this is the case. A well-acted, scripted and well-constructed film. You may not think it's a ten (and that's even more unlikely if you do not agree with the legalization of euthanasia), but it's worth seeing as a good example of artistic and sophisticated film making.
