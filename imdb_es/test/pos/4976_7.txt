It is always interesting to capture a line in a film that ends up being something prophetic for the future of an actor. In this case, I was intrigued by Edward G. Robinson's statement to Barbara Stanwyck: "I promised you the Valley", while analyzing the limitations on his attempt to control the entire land in Logasa. Ten years later, Stanwyck would star in the matriarch of the Barkley family in "The Big Valley." Somehow, I thought it might have seemed bigger in the previous image; I guess all those bright dresses and fancy riding suits have a way of highlighting the youthful side. <br /> <br /> As for my summary of the previous line, that is the assessment of Lee Wilkison of John Parrish (Glenn Ford), one of those detentions mentioned above, shortly after Parrish used his knowledge of military tactics to get rid of several hands of Wilkison after they attacked his ranch and burned down his house. I liked the way the film explored his character, starting with the way he dealt with foreman Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel) in a calculated showdown. The setup for the ambush was also an intelligent maneuver, diametrically opposed to the strategy of rushing the bad guys with both sides fighting to the last man standing. Therefore, Parrish also had something to say: "Never meet the enemy on your terms." <br /> <br /> "Violent Men" is a good title for this film, and probably was at the head of his class. in the mid-1950s, although by today's standards it does not approach blood letting one find oneself in a "Tombstone" or "Open Range", where bullets demand unpleasant savagery. But it is conformed by the excellent performances of the directors, with a secondary plot that explores the infidelity that seems almost ironic considering that it was the character of Stanwyck who was cheating.
