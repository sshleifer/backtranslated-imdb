Have you ever seen yourself watching a movie or a documentary and having to abstain from shouting things like "No, do not do it!"? Do not? Well, it's time for you to do it. And, without a doubt, DEEP WATER is the one that will help you get started. <br /> <br /> The story is based on that of Donald Crowhurst and his entry into the first world yacht race to be held in 1968. That word "individuals" is important, as the men who undertook this adventure almost suicidal they go alone. <br /> <br /> Most of the men are known in the marine communities of England (where they throw from), but one of them is the "unknown dark horse", and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Struggling financially, Crowhurst recruits a sponsor who can snatch everything if he fails to at least try to overcome a large part of the race. He could take his house, his property, everything. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst is now between a rock and ... well ... deep water: try the race with an unproven ship and an untested captain, or lose everything you have (which was significant since Crowhurst had a wife and several children). You will notice the term "untested captain" there too. Not only was it not tested, it had never been in the open sea! Did I mention suicide? Going through the archival images of the pre- and post-race, and those of friends, family and friends of today's Crowhurst, Deep Water is masterfully prepared. Initially, seen as a poor sap that passed over his head, the film gradually shows him the limited options that Crowhurst had after months and months in the water. Your ship drips. Equipment breaks. Psyche stretched to the point of rupture (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself lost in an internal struggle without a successful exit. It is also interesting to see the psychological breaks that other runners have while dealing with their solitary confinement aboard their respective boats. <br /> <br /> The wave emotions you will feel while observing. This amazing documentary can make you feel a little bad (not very different from trying to get your sea legs). And you will probably be frustrated by the decisions that are made; perhaps as frustrated as poor Mr. Crowhurst. <br /> <br /> The ending is also amazing, since we can see the real ship that Crowhurst sailed, sitting deserted and rotting on a Caribbean beach ... not unlike other things that felt deserted and rotten towards the end of this badly planned race. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
