If you need that instant buzz that only the Euro sex movies of the late '60s and early' 70s can broadcast, then look no further, you've just tripped over the mother's vein! The subsequent exercise of the television director Schivazappa in psychedelic pornography (of the soft core variety) can not generally be considered a classic of its kind, but includes many more well-known titles by artists such as Tinto Brass, Jess Franco and Joe D ' Amato. . Radley Metzger was safe this way before anyone else when he picked up this wonderfully twisted little number for distribution in the United States through his Audubon company. The magnificent cinematography (that favors the symmetrical compositions) can provoke shouts of "pretension" of those who swear by films of skin of bad quality taken in the backyard of somebody. Hey, as far as I'm concerned, your loss for this is an exciting journey of a movie with twists, so, well, I can not believe it after I've seen them on the screen. Dagmar Lassander (immortalized as the heiress of Lucio Fulci's house THE HOUSE FOR THE CEMETERY) has never looked more exquisite than her here, subtly portraying the innocent investigator (?) Kidnapped by the mad doctor Philippe Leroy (with the entire house of favorite art of his name, he wonders if he has the good humor to mention this in his curriculum vitae) when his initially violent "relationship" becomes a love story tinged with S & M. Nothing is what it seems, however, in this sickly and imaginative gem of a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity. For my part, I was completely disconcerted and delighted by the way Schivazappa chose to suggest oral sex during a scene (I'll make you discover one for yourselves) and Lassander's gauzy gauze boogie to an incredible 60s melody should have become in an icon in a similar way to the image of Sylvia Kristel reclining in that wicker chair in her EMMANUELLE days. You may not know this movie yet, but trust me, once you've seen it, you'll never forget it!
