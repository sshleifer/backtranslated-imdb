This is a really cool series. I love the show and I'm very happy that it has not been canceled yet. She has a good sense of humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. or yes for the Gilmore girls! It is very impressive They are such a sarcastic comic group. They do everything together like my mother and me. Already for the Gilmore girls. um, I'm running out of lines. but I love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship finally shapes up. They needed to be together. And I love Sookie St. James! she is so awesome and the show would not be anywhere without Michel. The whole show is dry humor, sarcasm and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other ... especially the Gilmore Girls.
