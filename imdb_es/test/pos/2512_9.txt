This movie appears on premium cable channels quite often and I think I see it again and again. The performances are wonderful, and the material is happening so much that there is always something new to remove from the film. <br /> <br /> Maybe I get too distracted when I watch movies at home, you know the exercise. The dogs bark, the phone rings, the popcorn ends during the credits. But this film is about people and what motivates us, what encourages us, what causes divisions between us and what inspires us. <br /> <br /> For me, it's movies like The Love Letter that keep me on one occasion. in new movies. Frankly, I'm surprised that the movie is not better known. I would love to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan in many other roles. They are a delight to see. Kate Capshaw is wonderful and I had no idea that she was. Ellen DeGeneres plays a role that is much more complex than the simple fact of being comical. <br /> <br /> This movie provides interesting images as an appropriate background for the characters and their interactions. I find it refreshing every time I take the time to see it.
