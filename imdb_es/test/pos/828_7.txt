It's really good to see that Van Damme's film is improving slowly lately and especially compared to the "Decarrilated" and "Second in command" C grade failures, which were tragic and not in a good way. The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action movie with some really cool action / fight sequences. It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick, since his last movie "Hasta la muerte" did not have any kind of martial arts. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie is significantly inferior to "Until Death" which was a very good turn for Van Damme. "Until Death" lacked the exaggerated action of most of Van Damme's films, but it was dark and harsh and Van Damme's acting role was surprisingly good in that film. Still, The Shepherd is definitely a movie worth watching, especially for fans of Van Damme or just for fans of action movies in general, but if you're looking for a movie with a little more history ... maybe you want to skip this one ! <br /> <br /> I think this movie was done well enough, especially about the low budget on which it would have been filmed. The only real problem I have with this movie is the title; "The Shepherd"? I do not understand. I guess "Border Patrol" just does not have the same tone without the word "Shepherd" in front of her. <br /> <br /> My rating for this movie is 7 out of 10, but that's it. The standards of the movie Van Damme can not be found in any other movie category. <br /> <br /> That is, It's good for a Van Damme movie.
