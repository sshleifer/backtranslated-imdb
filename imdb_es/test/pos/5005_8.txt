Talkshow with Spike Feresten is one of those shows that will definitely polarize audiences. Either you like it or you do not like it Personally, most bits seem fun to me, but they have some "huh?" moments <br /> <br /> Staples like "Idiot Paparazzi" are always good to laugh at, but my favorite part of all times has to be the only "Hollywood Douchebag". "Comedy for Stoners" is the only regular part that usually leaves me confused (which is part of the point!) Spike and his team of writers manage to produce a lot of cool comedy over and over again, so the show never becomes obsolete. The Feresten brand of humor may not be for everyone, but it is definitely worth a try. <br /> <br /> The masses have spoken! We like this show and we want more. Please note that I am not a friend nor am I affiliated in any way with Spike Feresten, the staff of "Talkshow with Spike Feresten", or the network of Fox and its affiliates. It's just funny!
