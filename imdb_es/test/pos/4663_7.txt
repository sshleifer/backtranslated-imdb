**Warning! Spoilers of the light plot ahead! ** <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job" is not the best movie you'll see throughout the year, or probably even this summer. But they are worth two hours because they color within the lines, knowing their limits and without trying to overcome them. <br /> <br /> What the film takes is the work of the cast. In a movie about a group of thieves, individuals must have a good relationship with each other. Without that sense of cohesion, the public does not believe in the characters collectively or individually, and the film never has a chance. But from the first scenes, in which men joke and fight while infiltrating a Venetian palace, there is adequate chemistry. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are nothing new; They are your basic delinquent band, which contains about half a dozen players, each with a specific and defining ability. But each actor brings the right goods to the table for his part. Mark Wahlberg's discreet acting and humor fit well with his part as an intellectual planner. Edward Norton provides attitude and turns his mustache well in his dark paper. Donald Sutherland is the father figure of the crew, and looks like the part of the soft and old-fashioned thief, who is still mentally spying. Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def do not do much beyond the abilities of their character, but each of them adheres to those parts. Statham as the smooth operation controller; Green as the tech-savvy genius with a chip on his shoulder; and Def as the man of the demolitions. Charlize Theron slips well in a part that does not ask too much. You are mainly asked to drive fast and look good. What she does None of the characters is so deep or three-dimensional, but in this type of family film, all that is required are two dimensions. <br /> <br /> As the title indicates, the film has a European twist, to "The Bourne Identity", partly because it was filmed in Venice, along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. It also contributes to the European style rhythmic and dynamic music, which adds to the optimistic nature of the film and complements the relationship of the cast. The appearance of the film is also a perfect combination. The bright colors of all the locations improve the mood and increase the attitude. The Minis not only provide a fun variation in the pursuit of the car, but also function as a necessary tracing device. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less simple. There are some surprises, but they are more of the fast and smooth spin variety, as opposed to the hairpin bend of the jaw drop. Even with those, the movie accelerates along. Once the first act lays the foundation, everything progresses continuously. Fortunately, there are no interruptions in the action for a romance, something that the film wisely avoided. There are not even breaks for 'real life'. History has its purpose and follows that course without distractions. The lack of depth of the character prevents "The Italian Job" from being more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of the planning of the robbery, such superfluities would have reduced the pace and quality of the film. <br /> <br /> There are a number of implausibilities that I thought both during and after seeing. But the movie is so nice that I did not like it or care. In the real world, most of the movie probably could not have been so clean. But "The Italian Job" has no place in the real world. It happens in an elegant and cheerful criminal world that attracts rebels in all of us. <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job" is a movie, in the true sense of the word. It has no pretensions to Oscar and does not contain a deep moral message. It provides entertainment of pure escapism and does it quite well. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: maybe the best popcorn movie of the year so far. 7 out of 10
