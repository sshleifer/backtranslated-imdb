I am continually surprised by the United States networks. What's wrong with them? Another very promising series disappeared after only 15 episodes and we were left without knowing what the hell is happening to everyone. I really enjoyed this show and I am so upset that we will never discover what happens with the characters and the "monsters" from the depths. This show had everything. Humor, suspense, action. What more could you want. Why, oh, why did you pull the plug on this? It just does not make sense. Buffy continued with 7 series, as they did Charmed and more kind as they were, Surface, Invasion and Dead Like Me were even better. The fact that a program does not get ratings that are too high does not mean that it is a rubbish, and if they gave it a little more time, probably more people will catch it and end up with a big blow on their hands. A season simply does not give you enough time to catch up and networks are very anxious to disconnect. They must learn that, like fine wines and cheeses, they take their time to mature. <br /> <br /> Recover the surface and the invasion - P L E A S E !!!!!!!
