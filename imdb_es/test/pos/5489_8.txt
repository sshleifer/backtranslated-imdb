In the Line of Fire, by Wolfgang Peterson, he is cunning and, occasionally, a trip with white knuckles, even if once or twice we feel that we have been on similar roads before. How is it possible that not when Clint Eastwood, just after (supposedly) closing the book on his Western legacy, will probably close the one on his detective images (do not count on the blood work there)? But there is something more than that because Eastwood's character, here a hardened secret agent, besieged by demons and hard as a nail, has a slightly charming side, even the most romantic side that one could never see in the photos where you spouted your brand lines. Here are some complexities that are not based only on the usual arrogance, and it is noteworthy for the way in which such a story possibly invented (did not save Kennedy from being murdered in 63) becomes something credible among the rest of his person, that most likely hid his wounds most of the time. However, Eastwood goes to the city to make a great presence in the film and, given the circumstances, the character seems to be tailor made for him. <br /> <br /> But there is a risk that your participation in the film will be slightly higher. conventional (we still have 'Harry' scenes that he is smarter, and like a smart ass over everyone else in the room, and that the chief of staff scolded him and told him to back off, here a chief of staff ), including Here we protect a president that (wisely) we never see or really know. Even the romantic side story, which is undercooked if there is any machismo laughter, would make the image a bit scant if the other aspect of Harry almost dirty did not enter the scene: an indelible villain. This time there is a bit of Hollywood suspense, however, a brilliant suspense (almost smarter than the rest of the film deserves), with the character "John Booth", played in an Oscar-nominated performance by John Malkovich, as someone who is described more as a predator. a murderer There are ways in which this could go wrong with the character of Eastwood, but Malkovich possibly mocks some of his villainous counterparts by being extremely cool and not collected (there is a devastating and cruel scene in which he kills the cashier of the bank and his roommate), and as his past is revealed, there is still the 'what the hell is this guy' element that keeps the audience and Eastwood's agent guessing and extra paranoid. It's a classic Malkovich performance, essentially spooky and always measured at the level of madness and professionalism. <br /> <br /> It is also, apart from conventional points, just an elegant image made by Peterson and company, and they are beautiful. Close to Don Siegel's pulpy realism. But Peterson also has a couple of movie tricks up his sleeve that made me smile sometimes; Every time someone makes such a cheeky but exciting homage to Vertigo: jumping from roof to roof, the hero hanging from the ledge, the 'turn', I still shiver with the chills. There are also phone conversations between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we see the depths of the cat and mouse game, probably another kick in the ribs at Hithcock. But in the end, even with all the excitement and the brutal danger and the sharp formalism at the climax, it is also an image of the characters in some way, and everything is quite done to give the audience a good amount to reflect, at least in the sense of the thriller. Eastwod is a great advantage, Russo plays the woman with a possible sincere and mature love, and Malkovich is one of the best. There are also some notable supporting roles as well, and a good study score there. One of the best movies of 1993.
