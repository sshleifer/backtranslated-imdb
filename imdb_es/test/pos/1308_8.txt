This movie is titled "Junior Pilot" here on IMDb, but "Final Approach" on Netflix. Go figure! The film is a delight for both the target audience and adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to see this film through the eyes of their own youth. For the adult, the story is quite predictable, and perhaps trite and melodramatic; While the story may seem new and creative for young people who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such an argument. <br /> <br /> In any case, credit must be given to the creators of the film, particularly director James Becket and director of photography Denis Maloney, for making this film more entertaining and visually interesting. The fantasy thoughts of the young protagonist of Ricky are fun and, at the same time, deliciously filmed. <br /> <br /> Young actors give uniformly credible performances, apparently very dedicated to their roles, no matter how stupid many scenes are. Jordan Garrett plays the protagonist "Ricky" with quite a good camera presence. Jeffrey Tedmori creates a deliciously smooth and sensitive "Shashi" that, out of all the ridiculous things, thrives on hot sauce. Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley also offer solid performances. <br /> <br /> As is typical of his excellent performance, Larry Miller creates a solid father figure around which the world of children revolves, part real and part fantasy. Compared to his father figure, the other main roles of adults seem to be superficial and one-dimensional, in an intentional and quite humorous way, without a doubt. <br /> <br /> This movie is a simplistic story aimed at young people, of course, however, it is quite entertaining, maybe on several occasions for the target crowd, but also for at least one visit from adults who retain the ability to see a film of this type from their youth perspective.
