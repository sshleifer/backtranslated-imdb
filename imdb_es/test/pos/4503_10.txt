This is absolutely one of our favorites of 2007. <br /> <br /> The tale of two children who come from different worlds but are as close as brothers is told brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot, and scripted: from childhood to adulthood, it never falters. <br /> <br /> A brilliant idea of ​​a lost culture and a very good way of understanding Farsi cultures and traditions is also an exceptional story in its own right. It is compassionate and exciting, stimulating and full of immense sadness, joyful and depressing. <br /> <br /> With excellent casting performances and excellent technical skills behind the camera, this is really a movie at its best. <Br /> <br /> The highest recommendation: a true portion of life that elevates and informs.
