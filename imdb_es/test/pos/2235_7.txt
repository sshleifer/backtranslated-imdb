Is this a good movie? No, certainly not. But for lovers of Jolie it is imperative. His unpolished performance and his half-naked scene will please his fans for years. However, the current rating (3.2) is too low. The film may lack a good story, and it's not a great science fiction movie, but the acting is good enough (and as mentioned above, Jolie's performance is good and raw), the film is shot very direct, with a lot of detail. -UPS The landscape is strange. And last but not least, leaving Van Damme out was a very good choice. Presumably, none of Jolie's lovers would like to see her having sex with him. This movie has the potential to become a cult movie.
