Dr. Bock teaches in the hospital and he's pretty good at that. What happens with him is that he is depressed. Dr. Bock and his wife separated, their children are diverted, they can not act in the bedroom and they feel that they are not doing a good job of healing people. She commits suicide, but she knows Barbara, who changes her ideas for the better. All around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outside. <br /> <br /> The film is well made and the character of Dr. Bock is well represented. It's a bit sad, something fun and something like a drama. It was good to see a couple of stories wrapped around the hospital, even if they were not related to what Dr. Bock was doing. Great movie.
