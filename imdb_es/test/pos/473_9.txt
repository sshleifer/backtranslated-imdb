You Are Alone is a beautiful film, almost delicate, directed in an intelligent way, well written, with two complex and fascinating interpretations, and a turn of an end that nobody will see, but it will make you want to see the movie a second time to come back and get up to date with all the clues that you misunderstood. <br /> <br /> The story, about a high school girl who drowns her depression and discomfort by working a few hours a week as an escort for "schoolgirls" of $ 500 an hour, and the depressed neighbor next door she discovers her secret and hires her for an afternoon visit to a hotel in downtown New Haven, which features impressive performances by Jessica Bohl, as well as the girl, as well as Richard Brundage, as her neighbor. <br /> <br /> Bohl as Daphne makes a breakthrough on par with Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary. It captures the anguish of an adolescent to grow in his own skin, and when he talks about being always in control, you begin to realize that he has no control at all, but is in danger of going further, which I suppose Somehow She does it. <br /> <br /> Brundage when Buddy is depressed, angry, with a broken heart, a man's shell. But it is not until the surprising conclusion of the film that it captures a complete understanding of his pain. <br /> <br /> After a brief opening segment, which will hook most independent film lovers, and will have the religious in the right direction. The exits, take us to the hotel room. At first you are not sure of these people, or the style of making movies. Trembling, annoying ... like the characters. Until you realize your background story, told in short flashbacks. They are confrontative at the beginning for a reason, and so is the camera. But as they open, as the story sets, so does the camera. And, I do not know, in 20 minutes, more or less, you're unable to take your eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> Having seen the world premiere at the Brooklyn Film Fest - - where the director asked the audience if anyone expected the end and no one answered yes? I almost wish that the film was already on video to be able to see it again. As I thought of some of the conversations in the film, particularly in a very candid dialogue about fantasy and climax, I really thought things were going in a very different direction. But now I realize that a lot of their conversation meant something completely different from what I imagined. I need to see it again !!! But as dark and sexual as most of the conversation is, however much it seems clear, I found myself laughing more than I could have hoped for in something of its frankness, which definitely falls into the "things we think, but I'm missing courage to say them aloud "category. It is very forceful, especially when you realize that much of it has a completely different meaning. Some of that will make you feel uncomfortable, especially if you are watching "You Are Alone" with a partner. You will definitely have something to talk about. maybe discuss about ?? after. Maybe I should come with a warning: YOU MUST be alone when you look! The music is amazing I would have come home and bought the soundtrack at my favorite online music store if I could. The movie looks as good as anything filmed. After the screening, the director of projections, Gorman Bechard, was asked what kind of process he used to do to make the digital image look so good. Your answer: none. They could not pay it. <br /> <br /> I have to give credit to Bechard. I'm a huge fan of his two shorts, The Pretty Girl and Objects in the Mirror, but even they could not have prepared me for the complexities and surprises of this movie. <br /> <br /> To all involved: bravo.
