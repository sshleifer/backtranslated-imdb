This is a very strange movie for Harold Lloyd, at least as far as the sweet character he played in the movies of the 20s and 30s. Instead of being a good guy, he and Snib Pollard are swindlers, to steal everyone The blind. In a particularly successful scam, Chester pretends to have lost a "very valuable ring" and a little later, Harold finds him as a puppet who is also looking for the ring. The ring, of course, is cheap and then Harold found it, but the greed of the puppet is so great that it "convinces" Harold not to say anything and sell him the "valuable" ring and then flee to enjoy. your luck (?) Again and again they find patsies until they meet a woman who is herself a scammer (who works with a boy who performs fake sessions). She organizes an ingenious swindler and takes all the money they stole, and has a policeman ready to make sure they give her the money. <br /> <br /> Luckily, the two scammers stumble into the dark business of the lady when there is no one at home. Soon, the lady returns and messes with their minds, throwing many dirty tricks to punish them for their mistreatment. <br /> <br /> All around, this is a completely strange and artificial movie, but it is also extremely funny, since the jokes work very well and Lloyd and Pollard form an excellent team. Besides, in spite of being strange and strange, I liked to see Pollard dressed like a lady.
