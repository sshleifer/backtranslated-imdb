Duck_of_Death needs to see this movie again, since its main criticisms are completely unfounded. The film never forgot the delay, and was explicitly mentioned in a couple of places. The crew was never shown to have conversations with the control of the mission that did not obey the rules of delay. <br /> <br /> One thing I thought was a bit of an exaggeration was the amount of risk involved, would a crew land? On a planet where pressure suits would only last two hours? I doubt it. Would a manned spacecraft go to the crown of a star? I doubt it. Would humans land on a moon that was being bombarded with huge amounts of radiation? I doubt it. In addition, the ship seemed too robust. Would a ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to stop it? I doubt it. Would I survive being hit by the debris of comets? I doubt it. I think that in both cases the tensions in the structure would be too much. But in general, the unlikely scenarios were offset by some well-done special effects, good editing and production, and good acting, especially by the actors portraying the ship's commander and the Russian cosmonaut.
