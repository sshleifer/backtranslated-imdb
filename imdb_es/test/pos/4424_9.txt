I've been a Rachael fan since the beginning of the 30MM on the Food Network, so I've seen it grow over the years. The moment I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show was going to happen, because I saw how much admiration Oprah has with her, and for good reason: she appears as very natural and willing to laugh at herself, which is very attractive. . The set is attractive and there are some new ideas (I love the lazy Susan in which the audience sits). There's enough celebrity segment, and she stays away from the controversy and the debate (there's enough of that on daytime television). The show is a happy escape, and she has not moved away from her strength (cooking), which is very good planning. I know there are people who hate her and hate her show; that's fine, you can not please everyone. And somehow, I think Rachael knows and accepts that. So just turn the channel; I do not think she cares.
