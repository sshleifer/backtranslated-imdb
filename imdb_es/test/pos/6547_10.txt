I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and I was fascinated. The only Japanese horror movie I had seen before was KWAIDAN (which, by the way, I own on DVD), excellent! The idea that a city is absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like something taken from Lovecraft. Certainly, remember SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, the inhabitants that slowly become monstrosities (in this case, giant snails). And who can forget the sequence of the washing machine? I hope that soon we can see this available on the Region 1 DVD (I see that Sundance has recently screened it on US television, I hope they do it again very soon) so we can all see it. VERY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
