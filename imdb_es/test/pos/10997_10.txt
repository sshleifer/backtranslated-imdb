This movie is not the typical Hollywood food, although the choices are so bad that I often tend to get away from the movies instead of disappointing myself. However, this little gem of a low budget is completely adorable, nice and definitely a keeper. The actors are as varied as the characters they represent, the Buffalo stage is charming (what a beautiful city) and the story shines. The lack of gratuitous violence, sex and the word "f" do not diminish in the least! Take the kids, take the grandmother, take a break from Hollywood! I give it an 11 out of 10!
