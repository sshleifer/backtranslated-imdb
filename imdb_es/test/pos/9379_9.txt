Intense and organically moving, Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinctive thriller of suspense, an unlikely "message" movie that uses the appearance and devices of the noir cycle. <br /> <br /> Resuscitated in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers faces their concern by hanging out in bars. Three of them end up in the apartment of a stranger where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, hits his host (Sam Levene) to death because he is Jewish. Police Detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who is assigned to Ryan's attire. The suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has disappeared. Ryan kills the third friend (Steve Brodie) to ensure his silence before Young approaches. <br /> <br /> Accustomed to a script by John Paxton, Dmytryk gets precise performances from his three stars starring Bobs. Ryan, naturally, makes his prototype of Angry White Male (and even the hilt), while Mitchum underestimates with his characteristic alert indifference (his role, however, is not central); Young can never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first complete version of the intelligent tramp and intelligent mouth, and, like a sad sack that has been put into his life, Paul Kelly pursues us in a small peripheral role that makes memorable. <br /> The political commitment Dmytryk may inevitably succumb to sermons, but is quite limited to Young's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of fanatics a century earlier (hence, incidentally, take the chronology to the limit). At least there is no attempt to give an explanation, however, simplistic, why Ryan hates the Jews (and the locals and ...). <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the crossfire survives even the most important change that occurred: the novel is based on (The Brick Foxhole, by Richard Brooks), grappled with a murder of homosexuals. But homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond paleness. However, the news of the Holocaust began to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood was encouraged to register its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always trembled at the possibility of offending any potential buyer of tickets). But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the details do not fit so well. The fact that the victim talks to a lonely, drunken young soldier, then invites him to come home seems strange, although (or especially since) there is a girlfriend behind. It raises the question of whether this scenario was inadvertently withheld or left as a discreet warning to the original engine that generates Ryan's murderous rage.
