I just can not see this a little too many times, it's full of true enthusiasm and intelligence that Mickey Mouse had in his first 30 years. Today, 'Mickey is a smart imbecile when you compare him. Steamboat Willie always makes me smile, at least the ending where Mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato. The animation is very nice and, although Steamboat Willie has no dialogue, the music is enough for that. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, if this bit does not deserve 10/10, any drawing does not do it just because it is a true classic, but also because it is so full of joy and it is always fun to watch it.
