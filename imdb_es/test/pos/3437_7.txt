"Jaded" should not be considered as an erotic thriller because sex scenes are not to see pleasure unlike movies like "Indecent Behavior" or "Friend Of The Family". <br /> <br /> "Jaded" is not an easy watch because its history is difficult to conceive and it is not so common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect stronger scenes. <br /> <br /> The rape scene was not (in my opinion) a well-created scene. I think the director did not use the proper camera techniques in general in the movie. That's why sometimes it seems boring and it gets boring almost at the end. <br /> <br /> The performances are extremely good of the five female characters. These women gave strong, intense, but credible performances that demonstrate the dramatic abilities of the actresses. <br /> <br /> Legal concepts helped a lot to understand the difficulty of the plot because the legal term of sodomy is different from a simple violation. From the point of view of Meg's defense, sodomy must be penalized as a violation (a huge crime rate B) although it is a different crime. The defense of Pat and Alex affirms that Meg enjoyed it and asked for it. This is where the movie becomes interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. The only sure thing is that the sex scene fits a legal definition of crime. <br /> <br /> Watch "Jaded" if you like legal problems that are not very common in your society. If not, try it because it's a very good and strong drama.
