I read the book written by Bill Carter on which this film is based many years ago. The book is certainly stronger than the movie. It provides more details than a movie can provide, and the end result was that I thought the movie seemed a bit imprecise in a handful of articles. However, considering all things, and given the limitations of the medium, the film offers an entirely entertaining and informative account of the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 1990s to present "The Tonight Show" after the retirement of Johnny Carson <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly the performances. I can not think of a harder performance for an actor than to play a character who is still alive and well known, and on television on a regular basis. John Michael Higgins fitted the role of Letterman perfectly. Seeing him really was like seeing Letterman. Daniel Roebuck tried valiantly to be Jay Leno, but somehow he did not achieve it so effectively. All his "look" seemed fake, and he just did not seem natural on paper. In a less central role, Rich Little did not surprise Carson's voice, although the appearance was a bit strange. In the book, the most interesting of the central figures was probably Leno's agent, Helen Kushnick. In the film, Kathy Bates was perfect on paper, though not as out of control as Carter's portrayal of women in writing. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a light and entertaining vision. The theme is not particularly important in the general scheme of things, but it is a fun behind the scenes, at a memorable moment in the entertainment industry. 7/10
