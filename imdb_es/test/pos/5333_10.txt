After the great success of Nick Park and the Aardman team with the short animations of Wallace and Gromit, we now have the first feature (hopefully many) with the plasticine characters they love so much. The DVD of the film has proved to be the most durable and best used of the many Christmas gifts of my two children. The plot of the film is quite simple, but for me the beauty of the W & G movies are the background gags. There are a lot of front gags and slapstick for children and adults to enjoy, but the background is the killer for me. All in one elegant addition to an already classic filmography for Nick Park and others, and I would recommend fans and new viewers to watch this movie ... often.
