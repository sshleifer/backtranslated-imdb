The American expatriate Jules Dassin makes an award-winning film of French gangsters. The plot involves Tony the Stephanois, a bully who just got out of jail, who leads his gang of thieves to a $ 240 million jewelry robbery. Unfortunately, his ex-wife's relationship with a notorious gangster named Grutter, a security Italian named Cesar with a weakness for women, and the false steps of his own friend Jo make the successful robbery a bloody race against time, as Grutter maintains. The son of Jo's hostage for the cash in the typical "crime never pays" the tragedy. <br /> <br /> The "rififi" in the title is explained in a song to mean the jargon basically of violence and sex, and the full title, "Du rififi chez les hommes" means more or less "Some naughty in the house of men ", which is practically where the fatal flaw of the characters occurs. Let a gangster movie put most of the emphasis on women's missteps, but this time Jo's wife has the last laugh (if she could call it a laugh) when she predicts "You're all just going to kill each one another. " The characters are not the most understanding and the women are mostly weak, but Dassin still builds an extremely well developed suspense film from them when they perform a robbery that requires the greatest silence, hides the goods and then tries to survive. What basically becomes a game of cat and mouse in the background. In the mix there is a very surprising photography and an excellent attention to detail in the edition, which leads to a visual and rhythmic experience that exaggerates the generic plot. Not only is it easy to see why this is considered a classic, it is also easy to see why it is among the 250 best in the IMDb: it is suspense, visually magnificent, full of sex and violence, and maintains that classy gangster attitude that we filmed . I like very much.
