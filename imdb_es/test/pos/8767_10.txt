The subject is banal, even in 1942. It is war propaganda. The fascists are among us and are doing everything possible to sabotage the war effort and prepare their victory and their taking power at that time and their establishment of an effective totalitarian state. But Hitchcock has to turn it into a real thriller. So he invents a first sabotage that succeeds, but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies in it, becomes the main suspect and flees from sabotage. That allows him, so to speak, to visit the country and discover the complicated organization of the local Nazis who have acquaintances and support in the most important benevolent society and use the small and small dissatisfied whites to do the dirty work. The persecution of the true saboteur leads our young and false suspect from Los Angeles to New York and to the maximum of the organization. He meets a blind pianist who believes that his senses know that the guy is not guilty, his niece, who is a star on the billboard, but also a frenzied and fanatical patriot who only thinks about going to the police. Then the rich rancher and his nest of conspirators. Then, on the way, a nice and friendly truck driver, and the long caravan of a circling circus and its dwarf, bearded woman, Siamese sisters, and some other grotesque of that kind. And discover the goal in Soda City, an electrical dam that provides Los Angeles and its war industry with the energy they need. It participates as gravel in the organization in the sabotage of a USS Alaska military ship when it is launched. And finally, with a little inventiveness, creativity and elbowing, he and the pianist's niece manage to clean the whole lot, most of them arrested and the first saboteur, one Fry, falls off the torch of the Statue of Liberty . That will not be fried in the old electric sparking chair. But Hitchcock still does not have the habit of having a personal appearance in his own films, so do not look for it. It is well constructed and well interpreted, but it is only a propaganda movie with an extra style. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris 1 Sorbonne University and Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines
