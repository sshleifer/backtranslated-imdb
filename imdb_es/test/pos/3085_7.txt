This is definitely one of the best films of Mel Brooks, along with Spaceballs (although I will admit openly that I have not seen many others, at least yet). It is very silly and completely fun, there are only a few minutes throughout the two hours of operation, in which you are not entertained. Almost all the gags have a great comic effect, some of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after watching and reviewing Spy Hard, and by comparing these two fake movies, I realize exactly how high the quality of this movie is. It's funny from beginning to end, no comedy is exaggerated or boring. The music is wonderful, as is the choreography of dancing and fighting. The acting is more or less what you would normally expect from this kind of movie ... Elwes is a great comedian and is a good Robin. The plot is typical of Robin Hood, more or less everything that is in the legend fits this movie (and, for the most part, is faked). If you like Mel Brooks, or you're just a fan of humor, or you're just dying to see a good parody of the Robin Hood legend, this is definitely the movie for you. The HBO special First Look in the movie is also worth watching, and in that, you may want to keep looking through the credits, too. I would recommend it to any fan of Mel Brooks movies, and to people who enjoy silly humor. 7/10
