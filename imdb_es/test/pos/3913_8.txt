I think that anyone who is foolish enough to risk being a wax doll to go to a football game or who do not want to leave their car "to be stripped" deserves whatever happens to them. <br /> <br /> The boy, Wade who "went to a hairdresser and asked for He-Man's haircut" was not my type, but there is a very nice scene in which his eyebrows are waxed and the facial hair. That's too much maintenance for me. <br /> <br /> It's also fun, but not my type is the fat man in the big sunglasses who looks "like Elton John's gay, but that plot does not lead anywhere". <br /> <br /> Blake was sexy, I could see him if he did not like his girlfriend so much, that he's a fake Paris Hilton with a bad wig (there's no Chihuahaua in his purse, but yes, it was really lovely ). I do not think girls who look like that go to football matches anyway. Nick the car thief is the sexiest! One of the best parts is where a soccer ball lands next to him, and instead of throwing it, he throws the cigarette and burns it. Look, that's the kind of person he is. He has a sister who looks silly borrowing her white kicker. The straps of her bra are shown for, like half of the movie! <br /> <br /> Most of the time you just want to wax your legs and never go to football matches after seeing this.
