I went to the cinema in 1973, when the movie was released, I was 11 years old at that time. I remember how much I enjoyed it and wanted to live in Shangri-la, as naive and young as I was. I recently came across a video of the movie I had recorded off TV a few years ago. I saw it again and I'm not ashamed to admit that I still enjoy it as much as it did 29 years ago. I also enjoy listening to the words of the songs, because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of guns does not hit our ears and if we look at our reflection, we should be happy with what we see. This is what I call a "feel good" movie because I feel happy after watching it. Maybe it's still naive, but it makes me happy and I'm sure it will make you happy if you look at it with an open mind and enjoy what it is: a good family movie. I must be one of the few people who has this movie on VHS PAL video and on DVD (self-made). I recorded it on a DVD while the recording of the TV tape was running out. I still see it from time to time.
