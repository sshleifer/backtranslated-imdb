I have seen this movie twice, both times in Cinemax. The first time in its unrated version, which is the best soft porn, and the second time in a cropped version (cuts all sex and most of the nudity) that was entertained in a typical beach movie so No rating has a scene of tremendous sex with Nikki Fritz, a guy and a bottle of oil that is out of this world (no pun). Unfortunately, in the cut-out version that scene is almost completely cut off, as are all the other sex scenes. With qualification or without qualification, it is still fun to see all the brothers of bigger stars (Stallone, Sheen, Travolta, etc;) trying to act. We also have appearances by Queen B Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin from the old Batman series).
