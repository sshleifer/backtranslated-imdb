I really like this movie. I like it not only because it's a great movie from the early 80's with a GREAT soundtrack, but I discovered that it has some moments that make me think. They are only moments; Not the whole movie. Definitely not like "Less than zero". <br /> <br /> The scenes deal with the typical peer pressure and also with more difficult problems, such as the betrayal of trust. These problems are not easily solved or forgotten by the characters. Certain scenes will highlight and invite reflection on one's adolescent experiences and how those experiences may have affected one's character and perspective as an adult. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and think about the problems that young adults have to face. , and about your own experiences. Or you can simply pay attention to the children's quest to despair themselves! :) Either way is a good movie.
