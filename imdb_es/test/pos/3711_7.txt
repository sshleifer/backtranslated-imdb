This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a story by William Faulkner, takes us back to the small town of Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one of about 18 and another of about 8, look for bird eggs ( obviously a great collectors item for children in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decide to enlist. He gives his award-winning egg to his little brother, Willie, and goes to want to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte. Well, Willie is not going to have any of that, if Pete can be a soldier, he can too. He heads to Memphis, demonstrating his stubbornness and determination as he gets the best out of several adults along the way. After finding the enlistment center in Memphis, he demands to see his brother, pull a knife to a lieutenant and injure him in the process. We are shown the devotion and love of a little brother (Jonathan Furr). It offers an impeccable performance as a stubborn child and strong will in the milder times of yesteryear. The film is about and, for the most part, manages to show how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in youth. When the two brothers meet shortly, the film launches a cathartic scream while fraternal love envelops us all. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a bottle of cold water. Maybe Dasani or Aquafina, good and clear water with a tasty mineral package, but not pure natural spring water like Evian. Even so, quench your thirst and do not doubt its purity and its effects of extinction. It is more functional and less expensive than some, but it does the job and leaves it refreshed and detoxified afterwards. 7/10
