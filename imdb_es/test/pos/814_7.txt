The story is about a working girl (Ann Sothern) who has a rather inconsiderate boyfriend (Paul Kelly). This boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that time and again he forgets dates or is late. The last straw is when Sothern turns years and Kelly says he is too busy to take her to celebrate. So, not wanting to stay at home, he has a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). The sparks fly, but it also becomes apparent after Sothern breaks off his relationship with Kelly that the new boyfriend Hamilton is the kind of person who wants to "leave them and leave them." The way in which all this is finally solved is not too difficult to predict, it is enough to say that everything works perfectly in the end. <br /> <br /> This is a very modest little movie by Columbia Pictures, with a relatively small budget, as well as second-tier stars. It is clearly a "B movie" despite the fact that Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell play small roles, since both have not yet become famous. Now, this is NOT to say that these are bad actors or the production is not good. In fact, given the production values, this is a pretty amazing movie, since everything seems to work so well despite having a fairly common and somewhat predictable plot scheme. That's because the actors and the director did a very good job of conveying the story. In addition, the writers did a good job humanizing the characters and making you worry about them. The end, in particular, is very sweet and practically my tear ducts flow! Due to these factors, the movie gains a 7 out of 10.
