Two young friends grow up together in Afghanistan. The events of their lives distance them and one of them lives in the United States for many years. When you receive a phone call, it is clear that you have to return, since there are problems in the air. <br /> <br /> This is a film about life, lasting friendships, mistakes and recovery again. But also a film about darkness, pain and resistance. From the pleasant days of growing up and playing games until the fall, return to the game. This is a slow movie, but not too slow. <br /> <br /> It's based on emotions and that's the right thing for a drama, but it's too much for my taste. This makes it a game of tears too, losing a bit of the quality it carries. It's still good, but not fantastic. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 comets ran aground
