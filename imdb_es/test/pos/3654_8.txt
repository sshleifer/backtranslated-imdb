I saw this movie at the Seattle International Film Festival in a house full of avid moviegoers and Indian ex-pats. The movie is incredibly beautiful and fluid for a first movie. The management is self-confident, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and line of the story is elementary to non-existent, the pleasures of seeing the performances and the landscape compensate for the lack. The soundtrack of this film is a great attraction for lovers of world music. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location each day, visit Hari Om to get inspired. It was not released in the Questions and Answers, but I imagine that Hollywood could learn a lesson about making budget movies by learning from this director.
