Yes!! Finally they got it perfectly. What a great idea, an epic of refreshing exploitation for the X-Generation, whether they know it or not. After disasters like the sergeant. The New York Police Department of Kabukiman, and after being destroyed by Blockbuster, our hero, Lloyd Kaufman, decided to go for it, stop attending to the distributors and let Troma be all that Troma can be. Lloyd would make this the most extravagant, extravagant and frankly funny Troma movie. This time, Lloyd takes Shakespeare's love story, spins it, spins it, and adds that value of long, lost, and always lacking entertainment. Entertainment value, such as Lemmy Kilmister (the narrator), Debbie Rochon (the cook), Joe Fleishaker (the fat one) and, of course, brutal mutilations and toilet humor. Tromeo And Juliet is the definitive edition of a rather tarnished story, and the jewel in the crown of the Troma universe. <br /> <br /> Years ago, in Tromaville, the business partners of New Jersey, Monty Que and Cap Capulet start a film company called Silky Films, which would produce supposedly good taste, soft core movies. Monty considers Cap to be his friend, but Cap is willing to take the poor out of his side of the company. On paper and in books, it seems that Monty gave away the work of his life for free. Advancing in the mid-90s in Manhattan, we have two families who are extremely upset with each other, it is to the point that they are just looking for a reason to risk, or preferably, a life. Monty has a son, Tromeo, nephew, Benny, they, with his friend, Murray Martini, who is too excited about all the carnage, he wages war on the incestuous Capulets, except Monty, who is too drunk to worry. As in the original, there is a confusing situation, which leads Tromeo to fall on the daughter of Cap, whom he has never met, or never met. Unfortunately, Cap is a sadistic pervert, who, unlike Tromeo's father, has something for the bottle, and this, of course, would lead to Daddy's little chenshaw melon being physically and emotionally abused, and annoyed, and saved in a plexiglas cage. , from time to time, depending on the bad mood of Cap. Cap is also forcing his vegetarian daughter to marry London Arbuckle, a multi-millionaire butcher, who would make anyone feel uncomfortable, with or without raisin bread. With all these drawbacks, young lovers feel that eloping would be the best decision, but how will this affect the great dispute? It may or may not go something like the original, but discovering how this ends is simply not going to happen, you will never see it coming. <br /> <br /> "The one with Leo" is completely inductive for sleep compared to Tromeo and Juliet, but if it's diluted, overdrawn, with big budget, Hollywood, Garbage is what you have programmed to do, then , of course, do it. ", but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful, something that really has a big impact, and does not follow the" normal "movie pattern, and if you have a pretty abnormal sense of humor, then I may not hate this movie, Tromeo and Juliet give the finger to everything that is common, exploding at full volume with a humor as petty as a young John Waters, along with some rude performances, Tromeo and Juliet show off. from a thunderous score that includes the legendary Motorhead, and not to mention the many comments from James Gunn, who really joined in. For more information on James Gunn, check out Lollilove, and for more Lloyd's excellence Ka Ufman, take a look at your next vision, Terror Firmer. Tromeo and Julieta are amazingly incredible. Exploitation for the 90s that brought us the only king of series movies. Thanks, Lloyd. 10/10
