The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, excused from serving in active duty, is doing his part for the war effort that produces prose fragments for a government propaganda branch in Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Thomas is portrayed as a freethinker who believes in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and also with a penchant for extramarital romance. Thomas writing and reciting his poetry in a systematic domestic chaos the whole time he becomes a bit sneaky towards the end, resting somewhat uncomfortable in the relations of his society and pulling rank to a war veteran, who had shot at home, and that I was casually married to the woman I had I had an affair with. <br /> <br /> The real story of this movie is the love of two women, one (Keira Knightley) whose first love was Thomas (Matthew Rhys), the second (Sienna Miller) who is The wife of shots Sometimes remember The Singing Detective, as in a very good television with slightly sinister nuances placed on scenes of absurd surrealist camp.
