This is easily the best film version of William Faulkner's fiction I've seen, and I've seen some of the most prominent. Filmed in the hometown of Faulkner, Oxford, Mississippi, it really captures the feeling of Jefferson and the county of Yoknapatawpha. Intruder in the Dust is not one of Faulkner's best novels, but, even if it is a cliché to say this, it would be the jewel in the crown of anyone else's career. Defeat the good, but simplistic Harper Lee, Kill a Mockingbird, which is fifty feet on the ground (I read it in ninth grade, and that's exactly what corresponds). Two of Faulkner's most prominent characters play an important role in the film, Gavin Stevens and Lucas Beauchamp. Stevens is probably the most common character in all of Faulkner's fiction. He is a lawyer and works easily as a storyteller, because, unlike many of his other characters, Stevens is a man of logic, not emotion (at least when he is older). Lucas Beauchamp can be the most prominent of all the black characters of Faulkner (plays an important role in one of the masterpieces of Faulkner, Go Down, Moses); unlike all the other black people in Yoknapatawpha, he refuses to bow to any white man. He has pride, and many in the white population find that execrable quality in a black man. One day, Lucas is standing on a dead white man with a freshly lit gun in his possession. Most of Jefferson and the surrounding areas do not see the need for a trial, and everyone is fairly certain that Beauchamp will be lynched before the evening is over, or at least the next day, since the murder and arrest occurred on a Sunday . Beauchamp, on the other hand, declares his innocence and tries to get Stevens to help him. Stevens refuses; The case seems open and closed. But his young nephew, Chick Mallison, because Lucas had helped him in the past, is willing to help him now. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, no Hollywood film of this period deals with racism so openly. this. Hollywood movies rarely pursue the black population, preferring to relegate them to servant roles. If you are an African-American actor, you should surrender and accept that role, be it as mom, maid, servant or doorman, because that is the only way you will work. In Intruder in the Dust, you will find one of the most memorable non-bearer roles a black actor ever had, Lucas Beauchamp. And Beauchamp, as I described earlier, is not a stereotyped character, and could have been difficult to accept for the public. Even today, black characters are usually simple, magical and kind. The recent hit of arthouse Far from Heaven is a great example of that. Beauchamp is a bit of an idiot, and he's very stubborn. Although it may be a little less here than in the novel, it is not any kind of stereotype. He is a complex human being. Juano Hernández plays Beauchamp extraordinarily well. I have not seen the film in a long time, but it also appears in Robert Aldrich's 1955 film, Kiss Me Deadly, as well as in the film adaptation of Faulkner's final novel, The Reivers. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great in the movie. I must also praise Claude Jarman Jr., who has the great role of Chick Mallison. The novel takes place from his point of view, and he is the conventional hero of the image. Jarman is quite an actor; capture the character (which also appears in other parts of Faulkner's fiction, narrating, for example, events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel The Town) to perfection. It would appear in another great role next year in John Ford's underestimated film, Rio Grande. The only other Clarence Brown movie I've seen is National Velvet, a rather different image to Intruder in the Dust. Your work here is exceptional; I really have to give him credit for capturing Faulkner perfectly. Other famous adaptations of Faulkner are too melodramatic (The Long Hot Summer, filmed in 1958, what I really like despite that) or too cold (Tomorrow, filmed in 1972, which I do not like, that coldness is a misunderstanding by Faulkner ). The other that really works well according to its original material is the great 1958 Pylon shoot by Douglas Sirk (really a completely different type of Faulkner novel), Tarnished Angels. 10/10.
