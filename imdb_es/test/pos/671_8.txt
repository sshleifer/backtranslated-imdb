Be careful, My Lovely appeared on television on BBC2 recently during the first hours, so I set up the video to record it and was pleased that it did. <br /> <br /> A man finds a dead woman and runs away so he does not. he gets the blame for his murder and gets a job as an assistant in a widow's house, but she does not know what he's doing here. It turns out that this man is a psychopath and a possible killer. He begins to torment her and locks her in the basement. Then she cuts the phone line so she can not get help from abroad. A child who regularly makes purchases for her realizes that something is not right when it comes to leaving her shopping. Eventually, the man leaves, acting as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> I can see why Beware, My Lovely received an X certificate when it was released in theaters. Some of the scenes are quite unpleasant for this time. I also thought that the man was also going to do something to the young man. <br /> <br /> The cast presents an excellent performance of Robert Ryan as a psychopath, Ida Lupino as a widow and we are joined by Barbara Whiting and Dee. Pollock as the child. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the most spooky performance of Robert Ryan I've seen. A must see <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
