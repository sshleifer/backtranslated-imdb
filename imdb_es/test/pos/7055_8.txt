Wildman's chief advisor, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray at his best in his first lead role) presides over several of the extravagant hippocampi in the North Star summer camp. Tripper befriends the sad and lonely maladjusted Kid Rudy (a good and impressive performance of Chris Makepeace). The director Ivan Reitman tells the funny comic cartoons on the wall at a fast and incessant pace and maintains an attractive and friendly tone at all times. This film astutely faces the breeze and the breeze of the essence of summer: making friends, first love, making jokes, competing in sports with a rival camp, singing in bonfires and, of course, the inevitable terrifying urban legend about the psychopathic killer who He escaped with the hook of his hand. The joyfully scandalously fun feeling that this image generates is positively contagious. In addition, humor is always ridiculous and, sometimes, rude, but never too unpleasant or mean. The best of all is that there is a pure heart winner surplus to accompany that humor (the warm relationship between Tripper and Rudy in particular is really moving). The cast has an obvious ball that plays its cute characters: the glorious presence of Murray and his galvanization keep things in constant buzz (his crazy PA ads are absolutely choppy), plus Harvey Atkin is an unfortunate owner of the camp, Kate Lynch as the brazen of Tripper. the old flame Roxanne, Russ Banham as the kind Crockett, Kristine DeBell as the sweet and cunning AL, Sarah Torgov as the fighter Candace, Jack Blum as the wicked born with Spaz glasses, Keith Knight as the silly slug Larry Finkelstein, Cindy Girling as Vacuum cleaner Wendy and Matt Craven as the Hardware of the hip. The cinematography of Donald Wilder gives the film an attractive sunny appearance and makes clever use of wipes. The animated and melodic score of Elmer Bernstein also works. A real fuss.
