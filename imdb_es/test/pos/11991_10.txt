I have no idea why everyone hates this movie and describes it as trash a parody an inexplicable sequel. It is simply unfair. I mean, what else could they have done for a sequel? Cause seriously, I think I should have had a sequel (Rodney Dangerfield) says: hey, everyone was going to have sex and then a little bofet dancing and that's the end of Caddyshack even though the rating of the movie in the first one was (R) and the second one was (PG) that was still very funny. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
