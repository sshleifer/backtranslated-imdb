I do not support people who comment on this program or other HBO programs as "too graphic" or "unnecessarily graphic" or that contain "nude / violence / free sodomy, etc.". <br /> <br /> Guess what? Life in prison is not PG-13. The "free" graphic content is TRUE FOR LIFE of this situation. The prison contains violations / murders / drug deals and showers. If you do not like it, then do not look at the program. Certainly I am not a fan of rape in prison, but if I were left out of the program I would be surprised and less credible. If the prisoners did not curse, it would be foolish. Of course it is a free language, but that is REALISTIC. <br /> <br /> The show is good, some of the spectators ... not so much, I suppose.
