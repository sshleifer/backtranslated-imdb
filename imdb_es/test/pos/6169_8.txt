Being advertised as the most expensive film ever made in the Czech Republic, it automatically makes you think it will be over glorified and clich√© (for fear of budget). However, with a budget of 8 million and half of the film in English, it was not exactly a high-risk, big-budget movie. <br /> <br /> What we have is a great epic tale centered on the friendship of two people, the youngest Karel and the old Frantisek. As pilots in the Czech air force, when the Germans invade before the start of World War II, they escape from the country to England to join the RAF. <br /> <br /> Their friendship is strained by the love of the same woman. However, there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond simply being friends. Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the Czech people and their country. Remember that it was not the winners, the Germans defeated only to be invaded by the Russians. <br /> <br /> Fun, exciting, intriguing, beautiful, sad and enlightening. This movie is one of my favorite war movies. Above all, I like the way they mock the British in an amazingly affectionate way and that it offers an amazing insight into the way the British military fought in World War II. , Saving Private Ryan), this is the best movie of World War II for a long time.
