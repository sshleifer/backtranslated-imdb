I recently saw House of Wax and I must say that I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It has been one of the best Horror / Thriller films in recent years, if not one of the best and most entertaining. <Br /> <br /> I've heard many people attack the so-called slow start and character development, which occupies the beginning of Films for 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, if the film was directly immersed in the deaths, the public and critics would have criticized the film for not having decent characters that could not be worried about. <br /> <br /> As well as the development of the character, I think it worked surprisingly well. <br /> <Taking my own response and others (after reading forum posts), many people ended up wanting the characters to live, one of which I have noticed that many people mention being Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton). considering warner. Bros. have been promoting her death, it's a surprise change that many audiences ended up encouraging her to survive. <br /> <br /> talking about the scenes of persecution / death, they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful people. I have witnessed it for a long time and I enjoyed each one very much. <br /> <br /> The acting in the movie was absolutely good, I could not blame any of them, especially Paris Hilton, I thought it was very good. and I expected her to get more than 25 minutes of screen time in a 120 minute movie, but her chase scene made up for it, and believe me when I say that Paris can act scared, (see the scene where Vincent's car is hidden and he passes by her ... the expression of terror on his face is presented as VERY real). <br /> <br /> In general, I give House of Wax the maximum number of stars, for its entertainment value, suspense and even gore ...... the only criticism is that I would like it during the marketing of the film, they would not have revealed the list of dead and who dies and who survives, since it would have been ten times better without knowing if the persecuted character was going to live or die and a horrible death. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the DVD, but go see it in the cinema while you can. It will not be the same in your own room, but if you wait for the DVD, watch the movie in the dark without interruptions, trust me, you will not be disappointed.
