The movie is really cool, I thought. It adheres pretty well to the original game, and some of the battle scenes are displayed in such detail, it's amazing. I thought the movie could have been a little better if they gave you a little more information before the end, but trying to figure out what's going on is what hooks you into this movie. <br /> <br /> The CG It's beautiful, I do not think they could have done a better job in terms of graphics. Every little detail, the way they move, the look of their swords, everything is perfect. The way they make the characters look is almost as if they were real people. <br /> <br /> The music was great, and I found it entertaining to listen to the amount of remixes of the original game, with New instruments and effects. <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys fast action and a good story. I would definitely play the game before watching the movie.
