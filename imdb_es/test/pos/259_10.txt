I saw Love Life on vacation, when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida. It was a pleasant surprise to find a British film that was not derivative or exploitative. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will captivate audiences of the audience prepared to sit and enjoy the smooth rhythm of the film. The transitions between scenes seemed a little annoying, but in general I think that Love Life is a winner, a ruby ​​in the dust. One for the whole family. A nice change to watch a British movie for the teenage audience that is not full of four-letter words. Try to see it
