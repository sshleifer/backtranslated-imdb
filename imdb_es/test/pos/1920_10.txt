The filmmakers made the story of a rather boring man seem interesting and complex by focusing on his wife at home. At the same time, we are exposed to a truly original and existential French solitaire. <br /> <br /> The film is more than a documentary. I almost never feel that I have experienced something that is accidentally profound, which makes it even deeper. <br /> <br /> The movie has visually interesting inner moments. I loved the trip that the filmmakers made. (Enough European in the credits). Hopefully, PBS will review it to reach a wider audience in the US. UU
