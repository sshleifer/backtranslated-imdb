I liked Dracula's house much better than Frankenstein's house. Carradine is much more passable and his performance is not as ridiculous and exaggerated as in HOF. The actors offer sufficiently solid performances. The secondary plots (for example, the monster, the mobsters of the village, the village idiot, the humpback nurse, etc.) mix well, so that none becomes a strange splinter as in HOF. Better run than the HOF stitched. The humpback nurse is as friendly as the hunchback in HOF. The doctor is very good. In addition, Lon Chaney adds an elegant touch to his werewolf. It's worth seeing twice. A classic universal horror with that style typical of 1940, lost a long time ago. Especially good is the doctor's performance before / after his blood has been contaminated with Dracula.
