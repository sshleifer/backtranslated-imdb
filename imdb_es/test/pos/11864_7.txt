Good. Here is the thing. I have read the comments of other viewers: some trashean the film and others say that it is the funniest, darkest and blackest comedy in history. Odors of Tarantino, etc. Well, not exactly. But guess that? It's still a fun and, ultimately, fun movie. It's not bright, it's not garbage. Liv Tyler gives a great performance and you absolutely can not take your eyes off her. She is a woman with very strong decorating ideas ... Matt Dillon, a very underestimated and underutilized actor, is wonderful, as always. He always manages to walk that delicate line between scruff and soul, and brings comedy to perfection. The same John Goodman (although the religious nuances, probably funny in the script, really do not work). Paul Reiser is very good, definitely better than what was on television. <br /> <br /> The generally unbearable Michael Douglas is really excellent in this role. As for your cap, well, watch the movie. Between this and "Wonder Boys", it really reminds you of the fact that Douglas can act. The movie will make you laugh in parts. Well, not exactly laughing at the belly, but definitely in the category. I'm fun, I'm very funny. If you are renting this hoping to see another "Pulp Fiction", forget it. But if you want something a little modern and fun, this is a very good choice.
