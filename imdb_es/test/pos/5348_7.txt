"Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" is the same type of animation and the same creators of "Chicken run", but the story is now another: Wallace, an inventor who loves cheese and his intelligent dog Gromit, who is always helping Wallace with his problems, is trying to keep the rabbits away from everyone's vegetables, since there is an annual giant vegetable competition in his city. But when Wallace tries an invention he made, to make the rabbits avoid the vegetables, the one that is going to be cursed is him. Before watching this movie, I did not know that these two characters already existed and were famous. I loved Gromit, and I think he's one of the coolest dogs I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> also known as "Wallace & Gromit -A Batalha dos Vegetais" - Brazil
