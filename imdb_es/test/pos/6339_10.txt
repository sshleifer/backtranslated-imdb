Excellent episode, showed that Dean not only has good taste in choosing Cassie for his girlfriend, but also shows that he has a heart and can love only a woman, and not only is a guy who loves them and leaves them! Aweso and episode. Applaud them in this case. I just hope that they somehow return to Cassie's relationship next season (if there's a next season?) I'd like to see her return to her "supernatural" lives, especially Dean's. I also like the fact that he chose an African-American woman to be the special lady in his life who escaped in some way. I hope you do not ruin it and finish it when your episode ends. The girl who played Cassie was really a spectator and it was good to see that the WB branched out into what we all see in everyday life: the interactive coupling that has become commonplace and acceptable (finally!)
