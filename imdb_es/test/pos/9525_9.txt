The Railway Children, at least this version of the 1970 film written and directed by that British actor, Lionel Jeffries, is a classic without mitigation. Tells a story of childhood with great simplicity and charm; sentimentality is mute; The evocation of children's adventures is immersive; and Jeffries brings intelligence and style to their production. <br /> <br /> The Waterbury family is leading an idyllic life in Edwardian London. The father is prosperous, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are polite and affectionate, their home is warm and welcoming. Then, one night, during the Christmas holidays, two men appear at the door, speak quietly with the father and then take him away. At one point, the lives of Mrs. Waterbury (Dinah Sheridan) and Bobbie, 14 (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 (Sally Thomsett) and young Peter (Gary Warren) have been changed. Only their strength and good spirit will overcome them. Now in poverty, Mrs. Waterbury takes her children to live in an old brick house in the countryside near a railway line, not far from a small town with a train station. The children discover the railing and regularly sit on a small hill to greet the passengers as the train advances. One day, an old gentleman, going to his business in the city, looks up from his newspaper and finds himself returning his greeting. It is not long before he plays an important role in the story. <br /> <br /> As time goes by, Mrs. Waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to her children. She starts writing stories to earn money. She teaches their lessons and provides them with a home of warmth and safety. The story, however, is about these three children, especially Bobbie. At 14, he is old enough to share his mother's worries, but young enough to enjoy the adventures he has with his sister and brother. They find a poor man in the station who can not speak English. They discover that he is a Russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and son are. They insist that he must come home with them, and his mother takes him inside. In a short time, the children have written a big sign to the old gentlemen on the train asking for their help. They help a young man who participates in an obstacle course that breaks his leg in a train tunnel. Soon, he is at home recovering. They decide to celebrate a birthday party for the head of the station, a man with few friends and several children who is an assailant for his dignity. It is not long before the children help him to realize the difference between friendship and charity. In other words, the three children find all kinds of problems in their childhood adventures and manage to be instrumental in seeing that all problems have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> But what about their own problems? Bobbie finally learned from his mother that they took his father because he had been accused of treason, of giving state secrets to the Russians. Can Bobbie find a way to help? Is the old gentleman something more than a simple gentleman on a passing train? Will his father's case be reopened? Will there be a happy ending? <br /> <br /> Jenny Agutter was almost 18 when she filmed her part; She plays the 14-year-old Bobbie with great naturalness and charm. As important as the other players, especially Dinah Sheridan as a mother, Agutter is the heart of the story. For me, it is the talent of Jenny Agutter and the style and moderation of Lionel Jeffries that makes this film so memorable. The problems of history have no doubt, but they will be solved. And Jeffries not only gives us a film directed and adapted by experts, but adds touches that are barely noticeable, but that we love. This could include only a fraction of a second of a frozen frame when two people talk; or a slow approach of a small wild yellow flower in the grass outside of Bobbie's house, then a slow recoil of a yellow oil lamp that ignites inside; or the understanding that a charming interior picture or a view of the green countryside or a view of the train station from a hill ... all suddenly recall those lovely hand-dyed Edwardian drawings of a perfect past tense. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this mild story can not compete for the time children need today to hone their skills for splashing Nintendo monsters. I'm pretty sure he would never get the attention of most of his parents, especially those weaned in Batman and Leone. Even so, it is a perfectly armed film and should not be forgotten. As a side note, 19 years later, the story was re-told as a television show. This time, Jenny Agutter played the mother.
