Being a little knowledgeable about garbage, I have run into this little treasure. Action, romance, twisted police, violence. Everything is here and not a single one has been taken from the right. I fell in love immediately. Then, something funny happened about the second time. I became addicted. I thought it was going to be an income movie and laugh. <br /> <br /> Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. He did not have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. That is very commendable. It also shows that he was making the film for himself. I do not know how many of you have listened to the music of Rudy Ray, but if you have not done so, he has a lot of albums that reach fifty.
