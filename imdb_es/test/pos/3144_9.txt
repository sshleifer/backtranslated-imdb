I saw this movie on the same night that I saw another 6 shorts. This was a great leap ahead of the others in terms of acting quality, direction, filming and originality of the story. It joins a professionalism that often lacks short films. <br /> <br /> This is a great short film for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Amazing performances The 2 actresses are convincing and believable instantly. Its chemistry is palpable; The depth of your relationship is transmitted, even if the movie lasts 10 minutes. The acting and the direction are very powerful. <br /> <br /> 2. Beautifully shot Lighting, framing and shooting in general are amazing. The 35 mm film sets this film apart from other shorts. And what difference does it make? Filming is worthy of this movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Strong story Often short films try to do little or too much over time. Or they are trying to tell a predictable story. This is a good balance between telling an interesting story, without drawing too much time or leaving it unsatisfied. He wonders what will happen next, while at the same time, he feels that he saw something happen. <br /> <br /> Good score, too. Congratulations without dominating. <br /> <br /> If you can find this at a festival, make an effort to see it.
