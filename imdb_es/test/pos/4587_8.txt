You can read all kinds of references in the world of idiocracy. A futuristic world populated by imbeciles and indulgent idiots fed by the technology of a bygone era: this idea has its precedent in "The Time Machine" by HG Wells and "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley, among other satires. <Br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, a narrator explains the rapid degradation of humanity over five hundred years, but it does not fill the gaps of where all futuristic technology comes from. Most criticism of this funny (and fun) movie seems to surround this omission, and the resulting complaint that the world is not "realistic". As if "realism" has ever been a necessary quality of satire. Is "Brazil" realistic? How about "Futurama" or "Transmetropolitan"? Hell, what about "Gulliver's Travels"? I did not think. "Idiocracy", although perhaps not as notorious as the best of the genre, plays the same notes and generally does it successfully. <br /> <br /> Also, I did not think futuristic technology was a problem. It's easy enough to realize that Mike Judge is satirizing the current trend toward automation and simple product interfaces, so even idiots can use them. As in "Brave New World," the society in the film seems to have reached a point of automated self-sufficiency at some time in the past (seemingly created by "intelligent people", now extinct, to appease an increasingly stupid population) , leaving the rest of humanity at liberty to please all the worst selfish impulses they can create, and become even more stupid. It turns out that the film takes place during the last gasp of humanity, as everything begins to fall apart forever. It may still be "unrealistic", but if so, it is a mark of unrealism very well presented. <br /> <br /> Stupid people spend most of their time on the screen, of course, but they are only the victims - they do not know any better. Mike Judge keeps his true hatred for intelligent people in power who are dead at the moment the movie starts, but who are very alive at this moment, in the 21st century. People like scientists who pursue "hair growth and prolonged erections" for no other reason than the possibility of obtaining benefits with their snake oil treatments. People like politicians who allow corporations to simply buy the FDA and the FCC. People as media executives and their yuppie puppets that promote stupidity, which allow the destruction of all culture, morality and health to make money quickly. <br /> <br /> After all, who is the real culprit, the Morlocks or the eloi? The Paris Hiltons in the world, or the brilliant executives and publicists who put her on television and lowered our cultural standards enough to leave her there? However, all this is implicit in "Idiocracy". One line here, one track there (witness the hilarious auto doctor who literally does all the work in the health care system). It is one of the few aspects of the film that is NOT hit by the unnecessary narrator. It is only there for the viewer to capture, or not, but it is one of the most interesting topics in a movie that is much smarter than any other comedy of the year. <br /> <br /> Too bad that so many people do it. leave the film thinking that it is just an excuse to show the back tips and people hit in the groin. It's not that those things are not funny too, and maybe I'm a little complacent. But in "Idiocracy", it's not as simple as it seems.
