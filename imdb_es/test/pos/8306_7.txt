Due to the fact that in 1976 there was no CGI, I felt that the film was quite visible. The studio productions were very good and very elaborate. The background effects were very credible and always appeared as if they were part of the whole. The actors were satisfied with the premise that the film was developed in a type of Jules Verne atmosphere where the imagination and the possibilities of future explorations were, in most cases, improbable. If I had seen this film in 1976, I would probably have been surprised by man's ability to build a machine that could travel to the core of the Earth. Still today I wonder why we are not all flying in our cars, but I am rambling. McClure and Cushing have their fun moments, especially for their facial expressions, which, of course, makes the film a little cheesy that I loved. The "monsters" left something to be desired, but the story had a good premise, although I believe that some other kind of "thing" could have been more credible in those circumstances. In general, quite visible for your time and fun now.
