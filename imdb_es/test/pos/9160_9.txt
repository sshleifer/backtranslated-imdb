Fans of American war movies might be bored with their skulls for this movie, but that boredom is born of ignorance. Guerrilla suppression operations are always like this. Sit and wait, get some prostitutes, get drunk at the base, wheel and deal with the businessman, kick a prisoner, cover up the street soldier's murder by the green soldier. Then, boom, two fuel trucks go, and for 10 minutes a small-arms battle with a high-caliber machine gun. Then, wait for the brass to plan a way to destroy their fortress, and then end up killing a few civilians in the process of doing so. If reality does not work for Western viewers, there is always Top Gun or Rambo (Realistic Top Gun? Nop) <br /> <br /> The best part of Afganskiy Izlom realism was the way all the planes launched flares as confetti. They had to do that because Carter and Reagan gave the Mujahidin so many missiles. In addition, the wave of Mi-24 was excellent, a better attack I have even now that the Apocalypse. The image of their missiles falling and firing was a scene of imminent "death from above" for whoever they were going. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the Soviets could make an honest film of Afghanistan a year later. His departure, but it took the United States six years. Afganskiy Izlom is just as real if you apply it to the occupation of NATO as well. Someone will always raise the gun and shoot you because he cares more about the land. It is a film that Westerners should see. Unfortunately, I do not think anyone has done English subtitles; You may have to do some.
