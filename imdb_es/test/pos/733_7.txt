This movie, also known as "do not look in the basement", is not really bad. It's a little known movie, even for fans of horror, but I found this movie quite entertaining. Do not get me wrong, it's certainly not without problems, but I think more people should take a look. The story of a hot nurse who goes to work in a sanatorium is certainly attractive to me. I thought the performance, which seemed forced at first, somehow improved as the film progressed. It seems that the actors really got into their roles. There are some good and colorful characters, among them a guy who thinks he's still a soldier, one who thinks he's a judge, an adult with a child's brain and an attractive girl who wants so much attention that he takes off his clothes when any man about. its. The title "do not look in the basement" has as much relevance to history as "the last house on the left" in that film. If you like movies with spooky characters in a mental room like I do, look at this.
