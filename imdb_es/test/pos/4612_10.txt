A powerful debut film by Murali K. Thalluri that explores events in the life of a group of high school students, each of them in crisis in one way or another. The film begins with the discovery of the body of one of the students, then tracks the lives of the group during the previous hours, leaving the audience on hold until the last minute as to the identity of the deceased. Each of the main characters faces significant stressors that we could see as potentially precipitating a suicide. The cast of strangers offers performances full of power and emotion. Fantastically well done, especially considering the youth of the writer / director who was 19 when he wrote the script.
