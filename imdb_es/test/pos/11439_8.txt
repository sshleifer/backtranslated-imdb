"The Gig" is a small, funny and moving film about a group of friends who have met regularly to play Dixieland for fun. The group unexpectedly gets a real paid job, in the language of the musician; a concert". <br /> <br /> They travel to New York for a two-week concert at a summer resort, minus one member, who retires due to a contracting cancer. At the last minute, they hire a professional to take their place. Things get sticky as a guy from Frankie Valli on the hill tries to get back to the complex and tries to use the group as his band. <br /> <br /> The attitude that the professional bassist gave to the boys sounded true. By signing up for the two-week concert, they were taking the bread out of their mouths to someone who needed work to feed their family. While Pop, Rock, Rap, Country and Western, and R & B stars make money with the albums. Jazz musicians have to travel abroad to make a living. Almost nobody becomes rich. Boys who live their dream also cost others a necessary income. <br /> <br /> I think that almost everyone who can play a musical instrument with a bit of skill dreams of playing a paid "performance" at some point, Woody Allen and Kevin Bacon are two popular examples of this crossover of amateur to professional. I especially recommend this movie to anyone who has played music professionally. My mother, who was a musician, LOVED it.
