This is my favorite movie of all time. And I always consider it a challenge from John Huston. <br /> <br /> I must have seen it at least 20 times and I have never tired of doing it. The mood, the script, the singing, the dinner, it's like being invited to someone's house and watching the events and not being able to participate even if you want to ... It's a weird treasure, this movie and I can not write enough praise thus. <br /> <br /> He performs incredibly well, with quite a few faces from Abbey Theater and also the wonderful tenor voice of Frank Patterson. Lady Gregory's poem recited in the film is one of the most poignant ever written. The scene of Anjelica going down the stairs while listening to the song is one of the best performances that have been seen in the film. I cry every time I see it ... for all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> We have all lost love at an early age and we mourn for our young and hopeful. <br /> <br /> Donal McCann performed in very few films for my taste, he loved the work on stage and he clung to it, and it is our loss that we do not have more of his performances in the film, since long ago with this delicate role for expression and the portrait of a deep love for his wife that will never be reciprocal and transmits so much inner sadness to know this. <br /> <br /> If you want your movies and your plot to be full, avoid this, there really is no beginning, half. Or take a look at the characters at a dinner in Dublin 80 years ago and all the little nuances and nuances of the personalities portrayed so beautifully. <br /> <br /> I congratulate all those who participated in this production. 10 out of 10
