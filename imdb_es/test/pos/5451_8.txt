Good movie, great story, great characters, I enjoyed it immensely, enough to buy the DVD when it came out. <br /> <br /> The story of the real life that he pretends to tell is more fascinating and fascinating than anything else that the fictitious can invent. My friend who is in the media business said that they should not show this kind of privileged information, since that gives him a bad name. Like. <br /> <br /> However, there are some problems with the DVD: First, the volume of the sound is very low, so you must turn up the TV volume to watch it. I noticed that this is also the case when HBO executes it, so it is in the original production copy. Second, for about the first five minutes, the left side of the video is cut, that is, the image is cut approximately one inch below the left side. After five minutes it fills the screen correctly, from left to right. A careless technical production like this is very unprofessional and I do not know why the director and the producer let that careless one go by. <br /> <br /> Even so, even with technical flaws, it's a nice story, one of the best HBO I think.
