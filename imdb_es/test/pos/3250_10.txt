Two years ago I saw Two Hands in Sydney and it instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time. It has action, adventure, comedy and romance, all in one (and a little bit of Zen included, in good measure). Like much of the Australian film, the plot is easy to follow but it is wonderfully appealing, and Jordan should be proud of his work. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was on TV right now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favorite comedy scenes not only from this movie, but from all the movies, have been cut! So if you watch this movie, make sure it's the original version.
