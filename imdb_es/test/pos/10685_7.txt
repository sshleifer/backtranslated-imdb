Okay, I'll grant you that part of the science in "Doppelganger" (or "Journey to the other side of the Sun") is a bit silly. The idea of ​​an entire planet exists undetected (because we can not see on the other side of our sun) does not hold at all, any student of Astronomy 101 knows that another planet the size of the Earth would cause gravitational disturbances in the movements of Another planets. This is how astronomers deduced the existence of Pluto, after all, and that is how they find comets, asteroids and moons on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> And the idea that a mirror image of the Earth somehow evolved in almost perfect parallel to our Earth, to English-speaking scientists and human counterparts to every human born on our Earth ... that takes the things of the fiction of "hard science" and takes them to the territory of the "Twilight Zone". That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it requires a great suspension of critical thinking to accept and enjoy. <br /> <br /> But man, this movie took off my teenage socks. He was still used to fairly cheerful and optimistic sci-fi movies when the hero finally won, even "2001" could be interpreted as having an "optimistic" ending. <br /> <br /> But in this case: Thinnes tried to dock with his mother ship in orbit so that he could return to his own Earth, only to be returned from his berth (Something about "the polarities are not Reverting because his 'doppelganger' was not doing the same, Apparently, Thinnes 'doppelganger had decided he was happy in his new home.) Thinnes' ship began the descent back to the launch site of CounterEarth, and was sure that somehow make the damaged ship land safely and try again, armed with new information that would allow him and his supporters to succeed.He was the hero after all, and the hero always wins the In the end, Thinnes could not maintain control of the crippled ship, and the subsequent collision of the ship at the launch site was so horrible and devastating that it killed everyone (except the head of the ship). project) and destroyed all Records of the project and existence of Thinnes. Thinnes never had to go home, and he died uselessly, his secrets were never revealed. <br /> <br /> Except for the Planet Of the Apes series, I had never seen such a sad and depressing ending, and it always remained in my mind, especially the fierce devastation of the accident scene near the beginning of the movement (! you knew that the spaceship was NEVER going to fly again!) and the one that was at the end. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this movie again and see how well it stayed over the years.
