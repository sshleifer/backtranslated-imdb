This movie is a tapestry, a series of portraits of rom communities woven by music. It is very much a film of musicians, due to the scarcity of spoken dialogue, and the dialogue that exists is not important for the structure of the narrative. Some might expect a National Geographic story about "customs, dress and music" or a plot line that orbits some central characters; do not look for that here. <br /> <br /> This is because he paints a portrait. of a family of peoples, instead of telling a story of individuals. The plot is the history through space (India to Andalusia) and / or / time (we can not say) of a town. There is no need for narration. It gives you the feeling of being a happy people, strongly linked in small communities where social interaction is very important. And a great feeling of sadness in some parts, before its rejection by society in general. <br /> <br /> So it's a song of Roman culture, very beautifully filmed, with a broad spectrum of Roman music, and a sting in the world. tail that is the oppression that these people have faced, and still face.
