Of all the leading star actresses of the 30s, Miriam Hopkins has been the most strangely ignored and belittled. His series of excellent films from the 30s and 40s is quite impressive, but is often referred to as theatrical or brittle. However, he had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies, including this film, Old Fooking (with Bette Davis) and The Smiling Lieutenant (with Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert). Hopkins was famous for his aversion to Hollywood, and the results have been bad, not deserved. <br /> <br /> In Wise Girl, she plays an heiress who tries to rescue the children of her dead sister from her guardian: sister's brother-in-law (Ray Milland). The film offers several fun scenes, such as Hopkins bathing is a warehouse, Hopkins joins Milland and Guinn Williams in a restaurant in Greenwich Village for $ 3 each to act as "bohemians", and Hopkins goes in the front row during a of Williams' fights. Milland is also excellent and very funny. <br /> <br /> Hopkins and Milland make a great couple. The film also has strong support from Williams, Walter Abel, Henry Stephenson, James Finlayson, Margaret Dumont, Grace Hayle, Leonid Kinskey and Inez Palange. The two girls are fine. <br /> <br /> But Hopkins, drunk with a "slice of wine" and a puncture dress that is twice as big as her size is hilarious as she blows loose hairs while smoking .... A shout.
