Mishima is one of the best movies ever made. Now I think Paul Schrader is the best screenwriter of all time, but I really do not like the films he directs from what I've seen (with the exception of this and Affliction), but this is surprising, disturbing and highly . Follow the life of Yukio Mishima, the most famous writer in Japan, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and their stories. I do not know how, but Paul Schrader manages to combine all of that in a very artistic way. The acting is great, so is photography, and a perfect score by Philip Glass. Although it confuses the first visualization, this is one of the few films that is enriched with each visualization. Truly an underestimated gem of a movie.
