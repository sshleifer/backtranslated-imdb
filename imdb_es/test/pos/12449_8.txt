This is one of the nicest teen movies I've ever seen (and I wanted to be released to the video). It premiered the same year as another great comedy in which Tim Matheson played the role of "House of Animals" (which is probably why it was overlooked). <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable parts of this movie would definitely be the soundtrack, which could and should have been a formal release of the label. The soundtrack features a lesser-known act from the 70s called High Inergy, whose song "We are the future", played an important role in the Prom scene of the film. I remember buying the album of the group "Steppin 'Out" when I was a child, mainly because of the appearance of the girls and not necessarily because of their musical talent. <br /> <br /> The closing song is one of the best ballads I've ever heard, and I can still hear it in my head. I wish I knew the name of the group so I could look for it somewhere in cyberspace. <br /> <br /> If you liked movies like "Over the edge" and "Rich Kids", I think this is one of the ones you like the most. I will enjoy it too.
