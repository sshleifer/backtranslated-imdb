My sisters and my cousin (woman) forced me to watch this girls movie. It's not the kind of movie I'd rather watch, but it was not really that bad. I would not want to see this movie, but after watching it I could not say it was bad, just that it was not my kind of movie. He was very precise in interpreting what women really talk and do in certain situations. As a man, jokes did not amuse ME TOO, but surely women were. They related to the movie and yes, it was fun to see themselves on the big screen. "OH EM GEE I DO IT TO HAHA" I have never seen the original, nor would I care. If you're a girl, this is something you should see, but maybe the girls would say that this movie sucks, probably. I do not see a 13-year-old boy saying, "Wow, I remember throwing that away when I was 30 years old." <br /> <br /> No man would have this collection there, but I can not say it was horrible, then meh
