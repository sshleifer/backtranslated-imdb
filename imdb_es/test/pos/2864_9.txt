Well, I marked this spoiler, so do not be upset when this is over. Now I entered the movie hoping to see a very predictable movie. And he was right, since almost all the horror movies I've seen are predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a "WHY" in Kane's madness. But there was and although a little foggy you still have the idea and you understand the madness. Now, of course, if you like something that scares you during the nights to come, this is not the movie you're looking for. But if you're a fan of Saw, or other movies that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content, this is a movie to watch. Now where I really throw a spoiler for a second warning. I give this movie a 9 maybe because I'm a WWE fan and a Kane fan, but who does not like the movie a little better when he stars in someone we love. However, this movie could have scored a 10 for me YES. . . (spoiler) ----> at the end of the movie when he showed Kane dead on the pavement. While a dog urinating on his eye was "CUTE", it could have been classic with the Kane / Undertaker sitting and turning his head quickly. A perfect 10 would have been granted if that had happened. It was a perfect opportunity, but either WWE did not think about it or a future continuation will start with that sequence that I mentioned. That is all. (9)
