First, let me say that this is probably, in my opinion, one of the 10 most undervalued movies since it came out in 72. I loved this movie, it's very urban, rough, no real Hollywood glamor has been added to it. I feel for all the characters here, I love the blood, the splashes abound here. Joe Pesci was pretty good here, but for me, it seems he was definitely outdone by the main character, Joe Cortese, now I do not know anything about him, but he can really act. I think this movie is probably true Because living in New Jersey, living near Philadelphia, you're here all this time. I think if the movie had a larger budget, and I say that Robert Deniro, as Jerry's boss, would have a perfect movie, but hey who I am to argue, this movie absorbed me so much that it was already in my mind. , with Mean Streets. I wish Hollywood would return to this film exhibition, urbanized and gritty: it would serve them well to do so. This movie is a great drama with great actors in it. And I highly recommend it to anyone.
