After watching this DVD, I was shot down. It's so wonderful. Not only does it capture Led Zeppelin during convent performances, it also spans a few years. This only shows the growth of the band and the growth of its GREAT music. This DVD is a must have! The DVD is more than 5 hours long, with extras. The extras are also great pieces, some are from the band that plays in Denmark and other promotional places. This contains footage that was once thought to be lost, fortunately recovered and carefully restored to 5.1 Dolby Digital, under the direct supervision of Jimmy Page! It includes many timeless classics, such as Stairway to Heaven, Going To California, What Is And What Never Never, Moby Dick and many more. Great acoustic songs are also included. This will correct any prediction that Jimmy Page is not a supreme legend of the guitar!
