Cassie (Sandra Bullock) is a hyper-serious police detective. As an ex-boyfriend once tried to kill her and, in fact, left her severely wounded, she is determined to bring those who harm others to justice. As a result of her near-death experience, too, Cassie prefers one night's adventures and does not trust anyone. One day, a woman is found dead in the woods near the Cassie community. She has been murdered in a terrible way, severely beaten and left to die alone. Naturally, Cassie will stop at nothing to find the killers. Assigned to help her is his official partner, Sam (Ben Chaplin). She soon discovers Cassie's relentless attitude and devouring instincts when she asks him to collect a sample of the vomit that has been left on the scene for analysis, among other actions. The trail soon takes them to two high school students, Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Could these teenagers really be responsible for planning and executing the perfect kill? This is an intriguing movie, but viewers should be warned that the subject is really bleak. Killing for the "sport" of it is rarely the theme of the films that are of the variety "all sweetness and light" and this is no different. That said, the cast is great. Bullock, without a hint of his talent for comedy, is great as the police officer whose own past forces her to lock up the evil people of the world. Chaplin, too, is quite nice as the detective who is attracted and rejected by the powerful Cassie. As for Gosling, it offers a memorable performance as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. The production values ​​of the film are also good, with suits, adjustments and appropriately fine photographs. If you are a Bullock fan who is looking for a laugh, this is not for you. But, if you love mysteries, even those with the most terrible plots, you will find this story fascinating.
