There are two ways to convert a television series into a movie. <br /> <br /> The first, the most common and the least successful, is basically doing a long-duration television episode: watch the disasters of Steptoe & Son film. The second is to do something else, something very different, Ã  la Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the creators of the cult series have opted for the second option and have found something unique. Smart and fun, I could not feel less like a television episode. <br /> <br /> Try to understand this: the writers, interpreting themselves, face their alter-egos of Royston Vasey, interpreted, of course, by them, and they said to continue writing the series, of what otherwise the apocalypse will fall on the village. <br /> <br /> A high concept, designed and easy to fuck? Yes, but somehow they managed to achieve it. Not for all tastes, perhaps, and the end drags, but the fans will be delighted, and could even beat the uninitiated.
