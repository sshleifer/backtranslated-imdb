I am pleased that this was the work of foreign filmmakers because it can not be accused of unfair bias. Without any cause, the Jacksonville policemen rush to make a decision in this case and choose the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a foreign white tourist. They chose a 15 years. an old child who is almost as close to a saint as you could find at random and then make the fools of themselves try to pose an improbable case against him. In addition to the injustice that results from brazen prejudice, there is the issue of 6 months of unjust incarceration of a completely innocent young black teenager. It asks a question if, as a society, we must compensate the accused, imprisoned and, subsequently, declared innocent. This docudrama is well produced, professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package that you will not want to take a break of 1 minute. If you care about social justice, do not miss it. He certainly deserved his Oscar.
