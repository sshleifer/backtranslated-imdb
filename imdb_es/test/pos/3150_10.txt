I saw the short film "The Reader" recently and discovered that the film was well planned and executed. I really felt for both characters that Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz portray in this film. Elizabeth was able to show great variety with her blind character and left me feeling emotionally connected. Morgan was able to sell me who was totally committed to keeping "Sissy" or Franz protected from the pain of losing their sister who had been living in Copenhagen. The good thing about the film was that the short time and budget of only ten thousand dollars, Duncan Rodgers could make a very well made film that kept the interest of the viewer. Rodgers has a great vision of the actor's skill and the transition of great camera angles to show his talent. I always feel that if a director can make a big movie with a small budget, then what can he do with a bigger one? Good job, Duncan!
