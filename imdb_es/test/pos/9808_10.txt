Even people who do not like the film, usually because they find the ending confused, should appreciate the good performance of Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello, who played the two young protagonists of this film. <br /> <br /> Spoiler WARNING: At literal level, the end does not make sense. People who think that the ending makes sense at other levels are divided between those who 1) think that the stepfather killed the younger brother, or the only time that Mike (the eldest son) was dealing with the neighborhood gang, or the place of desires was flying in his car to escape the situation through death and those 2) who think that the younger brother is imaginary and that flying in the car transformed into a flying machine indicates that he will overcome the situation of abuse. <br /> <br /> I prefer 2). It makes a lot of sense in terms of the way many children face situations of abuse. It is not uncommon for an abused child to divide his psyche and project the abused ego into something else; A stuffed animal, even an imaginary friend. In this way, it makes much more sense that it is always the youngest child who abuses and never Mike. In fact, it is unlikely that one of the two brothers receives all the abuses, even if that happens. In addition, it is Bobby, the younger brother who is also encouraging, who insists that they can overcome the situation. In addition, the death of a real-life brother through abuse would have been too devastating for an adult with this in his story to transform into such an optimistic fantasy ending.
