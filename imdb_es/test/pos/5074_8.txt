Think of it as an extreme form of detention without trial. Without commenting or taking part in the United States Foreign Policy, the process of Extraordinary Rendition involves bringing people suspected of terrorist activities to a foreign country, as opposed to extradition if you wish, to a place where torture does not occur. It is a crime but a means. To the illicit information. Instead of dyeing the soil with blood from potentially innocent parties, it does so in foreign lands where such interrogation techniques are accepted. <br /> <br /> Naturally, given the seriousness of the tactics and the attempts to destroy a person, sometimes you will get what you want once you overcome the resistance, or you do not get anything, or worst of all, you get a confession simply because the mind has been broken to the point that the subject will agree with what you say. It is an ugly process, and what better way to do it when you are the defender of human rights, giving the go-ahead to use any means necessary to protect more lives, at a time when information is key to the battle against terrorism. and doing it in a country where the rights record is likely to be questionable. <br /> <br /> The surrender is this year's Syriana, although in the run-up to the new year we have several aspiring political thrillers to take that crown, with Rendition in the first place, followed by the Robert Redford movie , Lions for Lambs, starring Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep (again, but now it's on the other side of the fence), and The Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, although this would probably prove to be more driven by the action. Directed by Gavin Hood, who made Tsotsi and will direct the new split of Wolverine, Rendition is a decent thriller with a first class cast, in a narrative that has proven to be quite popular these days: the division, which offers a wide differential. perspectives that will be presented through a joint distribution. <br /> <br /> Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a chemical engineer, appears on the road to go home under the orders of CIA principal Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep). In a detention center outside the US UU., CIA analyst Jake Gyllenhaal, Douglas Freeman (so prophetic), embarks on his first interrogation session, no doubt being pushed into a position where he did not sign up. At home, Reese Whitherspoon, very pregnant, frantically searches for answers to the disappearance of her husband and sought the help of a former flame of Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard), as he works for Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin). Throw in J.K. Sinmmons, an investigation of a terrorist plot and a budding forbidden love story between Fatima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas), is happening pretty much in a busy image. <br /> <br /> Given a number of launches, locations, timelines and the like, Rendition was not confusing at all, and developed with the skillful handling of the material, it is never easy to judge, presenting ideas and thoughts of both sides of the equation. Each character has its own agenda, and the revelation of this agenda is committed enough so as not to bore you or confuse you. And the best part of all this is how, quite frankly, they lean towards self-preservation in different ways and, ultimately, in various loss-loss situations, unfortunately. It also kept you guessing, did or did not, and played constantly with your mind to know if Anwar deserved what he was receiving. He used an extremely intelligent sleight of hand that I did not see coming until it was too late (so there is the credit), although he succumbed to the usual stereotype of terrorist militants, and without spending much time in depth to explore his motivations. . <br /> <br /> Maybe you did not find the need, since there are many movies that are already playing the basis of this theme (Paradise Now, Day Night Night Night, Syriana even). Although it turned out to be rather one-dimensional (a personal tragedy to tie bombs to becoming a suicide bomber), I felt that Rendition did the right thing by not providing any sweet saccharine end, that this fight against negative and destructive ideology is not something that can to be addressed in a two-hour movie, and I'm glad you've avoided those unlikeliness fairy tales. <br /> <br /> What we have in place is a well-designed story that puts its sights on the subject of Rendition, and probably capable enough to ignite a discussion once the lights are turned on, in which camp it belongs , true? Support to inflict severe pain in the interrogation? Yes or no? This is the question par excellence of our time. Yes or no? (OK, I'm ready for Lions for Lambs!)
