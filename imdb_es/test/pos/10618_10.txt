This movie is absolutely incredible. From the performances of Huppert, Girardot and Magimel, to the script and direction of Haneke, there is not a single mistake. The movie can annoy some people with their difficult sexual themes and their slower tempo, but it's actually a movie masterpiece ... so do not let the challenging forms keep you away! <br /> <br /> Powerful and worthy of all the awards he won at Cannes!
