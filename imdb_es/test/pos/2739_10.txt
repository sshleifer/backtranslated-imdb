MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and, finally, decided to study them, I was pleasantly surprised and also surprised the people involved in the production. If I remember correctly, we had to see it in a UHF station and this meant that using a converter in those UHF days is not part of normal television to tune in to the local station to see the caricature heavily in those days, which made the program was even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk about. A great memory of more than 50 years ago. I'll have to see what other memories might be hidden on the web. By the way, I try to make a computer animation that is where the johnl3d comes on the scene.
