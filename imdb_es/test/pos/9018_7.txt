It's pretty good, considering all things. A must for anyone who is perplexed about the opposite sex (that is, all of us!). The trailer does not reveal any part of the plot FOR GOOD REASON. <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd, so it's good to see that it is not taken seriously. It's as if someone from the children's department of the BBC decided to make a film for adults. That's not a bad thing, IMO. <br /> <br /> 7/10
