Apart from the low budget, there never seems to be more than 50 Germans in one scene at a time, plus the same 2 half tracks, this film is absolute first class. Everything is accurate. That's the point, I think, from uniforms to horror and disappointment. All are as gray as the gray field uniforms. Gray men with life drained of them. Forget that the United States made garbage of Gung ho as Blackhawk and Private Ryan. This is one of the best war movies of all time. Only Cross of Iron overcomes this by tension and history. Could we have a non-doubled German language with English subtitles in the UK? Without having to pay ridiculous import charges from Europe. Most of the other DVDs are multilingual. Because it is not?
