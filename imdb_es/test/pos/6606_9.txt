A dozen bored surfers, mostly children in Venice, California, not only reinvent the skateboard but remake a suburban fad of the 1950s that was forgotten in an action sports revolution. <br /> <br /> Narrarated by Sean Penn, Dogtown Represents life in the most-damaged "Locals Only" beach communities around 1974, which consisted mainly of surfing on the morning tides and loitering. Team Zephyr (or Z-boys as they are called) spend a summer fighting boredom building their own boards with the help of a local that owns a surf shop. After they enter skating competitions at SoCal, they transfigure everything in their own scene; one that awakens a generation of skaters consisting of greats like Tony Hawk, Shaun White and the creators of the X-Games. <br /> <br /> Dogtown puts the chronological perspective on skateboarding, and the latest in what can be done. story that you never knew I had. <br /> <br /> by Andy Frye at MySportsComplex.blogspot.com
