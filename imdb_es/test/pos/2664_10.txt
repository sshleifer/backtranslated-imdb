I spent many sleepless nights after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity in the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once more inspired (as a writer) by the level of imagination. <br /> <br /> The Space Odyssey is not something you can simply "go and see". One has to be ready for it, or one can not understand. In fact, I do not think it can be understood at all, at least not all at the same time. It is a philosophical journey to infinity and beyond, a masterpiece of its kind and even after 32 years technically quite impressive until the powerful musical soundtrack that presents "Also Spracht Zarathustra" by Richard Strauss and "Blue Danube" by Johann Strauss. <br /> <br /> Take all the time you want, but eventually you will have to watch this movie. If you can bring some order and understanding to the universe of an artist with difficulties like me, he can certainly do it for you too. <br /> <br /> Or maybe I'm just crazy ...
