Excellence seems to be rare in Hollwood today. Many consider that only two of the best nominees a year to show the meaning to the film industry. And in 'Everything is Illuminated', the brand is hit directly. <br /> <br /> The movie starts its brilliance with the beautiful setting input of the scene. From the beginning, you get a sense of warmth and true family connections and relationships between one and the other. And in addition, the cast is introduced perfectly. For the character of Elijah Wood, Jonathon, his sensitivity is expressed through the hand of his dying grandmother. And for the character named Alex, it's easy to see his life in his perspective: the real Ukrainian rock star. With the cast lit at the beginning, the story slowly comes to mind when Jonathon decides to venture to Ukraine to meet the woman who is believed to save her grandfather, and therefore the whole family. And from there, the films of the story slowly, although they were maintained at a rapid pace thanks to the contrast between the drama of tears and the humor of laughter to laughter included in each scene. <br /> <br /> The film itself is rather awarded, there are several complaints from other sources commenting on the incorrect adaptation of Liev Schrieber of the novel Jonathon Safron Foer. Personally, I have never read the novel. But any film, especially this particular film, should not be classified according to whether the storyboard of the film coincides with the history of the book, but rather how the main concepts of the novel were expressed and exploited through the film. The fact that it is far from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a must see, it still is. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, new information floods the mind of the public very slowly. Some of these thoughts are never answered; and, in fact, the second half of the film refocuses its entire theme and the reason for traveling through Ukraine to something different, but quite similar to the original intentions of this film. However, the movie leaves you satisfied, but for souls with weak hearts, a tear may fall. And throughout the movie. For sensible people with a common sense of humor, they may just have to laugh at Alex and John's ongoing conversations. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to different types of people: those who enjoy movies that share the drama-comedy genre, for those who have an interest in family relationships, and for those who have an interest in the themes of Holocaustic. And for those crazy people who consider slapstick as hilarious comedy, this movie is not for you. And for you who think that this is a seriously funny and absolutely ingeniously funny movie, they are wrong; This movie shares comic moments and dramatic sequences. And for those who judge a movie based on its similarity to its corresponding novel, you may or may not enjoy this movie, but this movie should be taken for much more than being near the book or not. <br /> <br /> In short, 'Everything is illuminated' is an ingenious work that will illuminate the hearts of others.
