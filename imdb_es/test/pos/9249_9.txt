I have a partial bias because I appear in this film, but I loved it and I'm only in about seven scattered minutes and I'm not the most interesting part. The film is an honest and intriguing account of a noble group of independent filmmakers trying to make an adorable film. It is also a story of swollen expectations and fallen heroes. The interviews are well patched in the edition. Different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of a person. In addition, the interviews are recorded in a very interesting way keeping the film visually satisfactory. Definitely a movie that is worth it. I hope it moves.
