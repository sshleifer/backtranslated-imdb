Oh the outer limits. I love that show It was surprisingly spooky or mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I should have started looking long after it was canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as reps or played marathons. It was a very good program, I do not know everything about the stations and everything, but I do remember that every time I saw the screen gone crazy and the voice of the television said: "There is nothing wrong with your TV. image "I would shriek with joy. It was a good show, and I enjoy seeing it if it will come out. I give you a healthy 8 out of 10.
