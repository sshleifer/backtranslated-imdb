The DVD jacket in which this film came is described as "edifying and humorous". Those are not the words I would have chosen, far from it. I would choose a word like "gloomy", sometimes even "depressing". Which does not mean it's a bad movie. Actually, it's a pretty good movie, with good performances from potential customers, with enough uncertainty about what will happen at the end that you keep seeing. The uncertainty comes from the structure of the film: it seems to revolve around Ellen's reminiscences of her mother's slow death from cancer, according to the district attorney's interview. So, we know from the beginning that something suspicious happened at the end: the questions are "what?" And who? "<br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger was very good like Ellen, the somewhat resentful daughter who has to give up her life and work in New York to return home and take care of her sick mother. Throughout the film, more than any other character, as he learns to deal with the strengths and weaknesses of his parents, his relationship with his father (William Hurt) is quite interesting, my initial impression was that they were quite close, but the warts in the relationship begin to show themselves after a while, Hurt was effective as the detached husband, not detached in an indifferent way, but in the sense of not being able to face what is happening to his wife and seek to escape from him Finally, Meryl Streep, the Kate harassed by cancer, was very convincing on paper, looking to live what remains of her life in the most satisfactory way possible, and then deal with the anger she feels for her growing debilitation. In a way, seeing a familiar treatment with this kind of crisis reminded me a little of "Gente com√∫n," although this movie was much less emotionally intense. Therefore, it is not "edifying and fun" (with due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis in the DVD case), but it is very good in its own way. 7/10
