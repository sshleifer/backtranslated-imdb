The worker Kitty (Sothern) is engaged to Bill (Kelly), who neglects her by working long hours in her garage to save money for her marriage. After getting up on her birthday, Kitty has a double date / blind date, where she meets the heir to department store Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). She falls in love, but leaves him when his protests of love seem to cover the desire that she be his mistress, instead of his wife. Faithful Bill meets to comfort her, and finally she surrenders to her repeated requests to reestablish her commitment, pressed in part by Bill's support of his family after she lost her job. However, when Bob returns, convinced that he wants to get married, will Kitty follow his heart or conscience? <br /> <br /> This movie was much better than I expected. The character of Bill at first appears as the kind of comical Irish guy Jack Carson played so often. But Kelly (and the script) infuses the character with true compassion and love, and Bill turns out to be the best person in the whole group. Spectators can find themselves supporting him by the irresponsible Hartwell! The tone of the film oscillates, however, between a happy romance and a much darker side, especially in the representation of a dance marathon and a quite horrible accident in Bill's garage. <br /> <br /> The deal is complete. by reliable Jane Darwell as Kitty's mother, a rogue but not yet totally detestable Mickey Rooney as Kitty's younger brother, and Spencer Charters as Kitty's father.
