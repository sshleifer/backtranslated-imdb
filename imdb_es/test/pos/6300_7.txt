The film is very well made, it's great, it looks and goes passionately. It can be said that each shot is thought and executed perfectly. For movie lovers this is especially a great watch and they should be able to appreciate its beauty and passion for cinema. <br /> <br /> It's hard to put this movie under it. a label It's not really a drama, it's not really a thriller and it's not really a comedy. Instead, it is more a film with its own style, which does things their way. It does not necessarily follow the rules of cinema and presents many different elements of many different genres combined. <br /> <br /> But just as the movie is its main character, the movie becomes somewhat slow and boring in some places. The artistic style of management tries to hide that the story is actually quite simple and it is more as if the film was based solely on its style and the general atmosphere created by the film. It does not make the movie horrible or anything like that, but it just prevents it from being a true absolute that has to be seen. In parts, the film also feels like it tries to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for themselves. It just feels a bit exaggerated in parts, although in most of the movie it still works very well. <br /> <br /> It presents a great camera work and some unique stories, which makes this an original and original. A great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
