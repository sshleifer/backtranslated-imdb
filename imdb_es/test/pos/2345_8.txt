One Life Stand is a successful film piece that has not been given the credit it deserves. Its IMDB rating of 1.7 does not do it justice and is, perhaps, due to the few projections it has had rather than the quality of the film itself. Shot in digital black and white, the film is well directed with production values ​​that belie your reduced budget. The performances are excellent, particularly Gary Lewis, who improves with each role. My only criticism is that it is a bit long and I could have done it with a little more humor to make up for the darkest moments. In general, however, it is a good job.
