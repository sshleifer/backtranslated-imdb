I'm originally from Brazil ... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation they did to that boy. They told him the story of his life and he never received a "penny" (Brazilian penny) from that movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that lifestyle in Brazil. Sad ... but that is the world in which we live. It's about making money, not saving lives. The question is: Where is Fernando today? Probably ... dead. We tend to want to live in this "life full of fantasy and Disney bubbles". When someone comes to the plate to help ... comes the higher power and says: "What do I get from this? Where is my part?" - I wish the conscience of the people spoke!
