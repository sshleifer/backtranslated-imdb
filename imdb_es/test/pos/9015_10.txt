I had the privilege of attending a regional premiere for this, this is one of the funniest British films in history, the plot is fantastic, it focuses on a girl who, without knowing it, becomes her ideal man at a fair of computers, at the same time you create a copy. of herself, that falls in love with him, the film is full of jokes, both visual and auditory, and has a bright and fresh look, and the performance is of great quality, launched in the UK on July 2. This movie is a must, go see it !!!
