Guilt and redemption are two of the basic emotions and elements of the plot of the heavy and powerful dramas that the Oscars love so much (which is quite funny since "The Kite Runner" was only nominated for Best Original Score) the lack of nominations was perhaps unfair). While most of the film adaptations of books (or any other medium) are often inferior to their literary counterparts (and "The Kite Runner" is NOT an exception), the film adaptation of Marc Forster is good. <br /> <br /> Most people are familiar with the story, the book has been read by millions of people, so I will not go into the plot except to say that the book remains fairly true to its source. That said, if you do not know the plot, watch the movie or, better yet, read the book. <br /> <br /> The best that "The Kite Runner" has in its favor (apart from its history). ) is the director Marc Forster. Forster is a director with an epic scope and a unique vision that is perfectly used to bring Khaled Hosseini's book to the screen. A small part of me worried that he would use the same dream images that were included in one of Forster's previous features, "Finding Neverland." Do not get me wrong, "Finding Neverland" is a wonderful movie, one of my favorites actually, but the visual trick you used there has no place here. Fortunately, Forster understands that, and the brightness of his address proves his versatility. Although the lack of a Best Director nomination for his work here is not exactly a farce, I see several statuettes in the store for him in the future. <br /> <br /> It is also worth noting the adaptation to the script. It remains faithful to the source, but leaves room for Forster's vision to interpret the material. The dialogue is not silent, and that. Along with Forster's direction, it moves at a solid pace. Like Forster, the lack of recognition at the time of the awards for the script was not outrage, but I would not have complained if I had been nominated. <br /> <br /> The dividing line between this movie is great and the lies stand out with the acting. Most of the performances are solid, but there are some that do not reach the cut, and that hurts the movie. The most notable weak performance comes from Zekeria Ebrahimi, who plays the young Amir. It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's not as effective as it could be. He simply can not translate Amir's guilt into the audience. In fact, I think I might have missed a bit in this moment of the movie at this time if I had not read the book because of this. He seems somber and, at times, resentful, but we can not feel his emotions. This is a difficult part to portray and, for the most part, young Ebrahimi has his own, which is especially surprising since it is his first film role. <br /> <br /> The best performances come from Khalid Abdalla, who plays the adult Amir and Shaun Toub, who plays the wise Rahim Kahn. Abdalla may not be a well-known name (although he was in "United 93" by Paul Greengrass), but his work here is incredible. He is a quiet and modest man, and he emotes perfectly when necessary. An actor with lesser ability could have turned the character of Rahim Khan into a cliché, but Shaun Toub uses enough subtlety and care in his performance to create what the clichés are trying to represent. <br /> <br /> Forgive me if I do a rant here, but this is something I must address, and that is the PG-13 rating of the movie. The fact that this movie has received such a low rating is outrageous. There is no justification for it. Some might argue that the rating doubled due to the need for everyone to see it, such as the gore in "Saving Private Ryan," which some say should have won the film with an NC-17 rating. But that exception can not be applied here. The only purpose that the scene serves is to tell the story. Forster (probably at the behest of the producers) did everything possible to tame the most painful and disturbing scene of the film to allow the film to be filtered with a PG-13 rating, but the subject material is too disturbing to represent it in in any way and get less than an R rating, regardless of whether "good taste" can be represented. Worse yet, this edition robs the scene of much of its power and, by trying, making it less annoying to get the lowest rating is an insult. Also, some scenes of violence are incredibly disturbing as well. In terms of how long these scenes take from the movie, it does not add up to much, but what's there deserves a grade of R at least. The MPAA, whose movie rating system has always been corrupt, has sunk to a new low by giving this film such a low rating. <br /> <br /> But you should not blame the movie for this. The movie is a solid movie that is worth watching, especially if they are book fans.
