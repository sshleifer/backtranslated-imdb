The title is a reference to the destruction of remnants of a crop, such as rice husks, by farmers who burn them and set fires on the plains. This is a devastating account of the destruction of the Japanese soldier. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in the last days of the Philippine campaign as a soldier with tuberculosis who returns from a hospital because, as he can walk, they do not have room for him. His superior officers do not want it because he is very sick to work or fight. Abused by his officer, he is sent back to the hospital with orders to be admitted or commit suicide. They will not take him yet and soon he will wander through the landscape devastated by the war, trying to find help or a place to stay or even food. It is a dark journey, without hope in sight and only the death and inhumanity of man for man at all times. <br /> <br /> Announced as a heart-rending trip to the dark heart of man and war, it is also a very funny movie. This does not mean that it is not horrible, it is sometimes, but it is also comically dark. How could I not be? Here is a movie in which madness and madness run rampant, people are constantly trying to steal tobacco leaves for food, trying to get even a bit better shoes, trying to remain a Japanese soldier in front of the absurdity to march constantly but never reach. Anywhere and you can not stop laughing. To make sure that things get dark, it becomes clear that cannibalism can be, literally and figuratively, the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something uncomfortably funny in human comedy. <br /> <br /> Acclaimed as a great anti-war film, his stark photographic style makes clear the madness of war even as it dazzles our eye with its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian. in the midst of fields, forests and trees that would otherwise be, and to a certain extent still, very beautiful. It is a discordant feeling. <br /> <br /> The intriguing thing is that I read that this is based on a novel about the redeeming power of Christianity. The director removed all religious references to hope and salvation and instead used it to show that life sucks, war sucks worse and that, ultimately, there is no hope. <br /> <br /> Intellectually, I admire the film emotionally. I do not. Part of this is a shrill downbeat score that, for me, accentuates what we are seeing on the screen. The lily is almost golden, because the images are so strong that it is not necessary for music to force you to feel one way or another. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, that you must decide. By the way, it is different from any other war movie, bloody, horrible and real in ways that the big budgeted movies claim to be, but never are. This is not for those who are adverse to blood and blood, since it is here in spades. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth checking out.
