I saw Bon voyage 2 days ago and I thought it was an excellent production. The movie is supposed to entertain, and it does! It emulates the style of the American comedies of the 30s, but Von voyage is more refined. Adjani and Depardieu are simply excellent in their roles. The plot is simple. The film begins with people involved in many situations that, apparently, should not have anything to do with each other. It's very funny how those situations are linked during the movie. It's good to see a French movie with this kind of sense of humor. I find it, mainly, a movie in which love is the main theme. Peter Coyote as the German spy in France proves once again to be an excellent actor, too.
