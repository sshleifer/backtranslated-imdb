Unfortunately, this original mix of action and laughter keeps away from film fans, as they rot in Columbia's vaults for all eternity. A shame, since this may be the strongest film of Jack Starrett and has an ingenious script by a young Terrence Malick and fully complete performances of its two protagonists, Stacey Keach and Frederic Forrest, who resort to a life of crime so that can get the money to open a shellfish. restaurant. Many prominent scenes include the interrogation for the tub and the electric razor, and an intense shooting in an abandoned building while being knocked down by a wrecking ball.
