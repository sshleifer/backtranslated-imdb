I caught this movie late at night on TV, and I was expecting a low-budget "masterpiece", I was surprised by a pretty decent movie. Angelina Jolie's unique acting abilities (or should I say they lack them?) Make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, though terribly average, at least are not terrible. <br /> <br /> There is a plot; a plot quite intricate in that, involving conspiracies and the length of a couple (a human, an android) will go to pursue their illegal romance, with a figure of type "big brother" and an android killer in the mix. Production and sets, too, were much better than I expected. I have not seen the original Cyborg, so I can not compare it to much more; Granted this movie is not Blade Runner, but as a last minute futuristic guilty pleasure, it's worth seeing.
