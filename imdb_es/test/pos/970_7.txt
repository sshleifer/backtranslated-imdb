SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> We've all heard the legend "Boy Who Cried Wolf". But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. Well, it could be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd (Frankie Muniz of "Malcolm in the Middle") is always lying to stay out of trouble. One day they press him to write an essay in English, but it ends up in the hands of the filmmaker Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. Nobody believes Jason when, for once, he tells the truth and ends up at summer school. However, Jason is determined to prove his parents the truth and travels to L.A. with her friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes). When Wolf refuses to admit that he cheated his story, Jason plans to make Wolf's life hell. B.F.L. It is not a masterpiece, but it is a good way to spend 90 minutes of your time. I wished they could have done it a little more and that there are not many jokes, although they are smart enough (I like the dye of the pool better). I may not have liked this as much as I did if it were not for Paul Giamatti. He is simply hilarious in this. If you have 90 minutes to kill, try this. You could simply enjoy it.
