I am a boy, so I was very hesitant to see the movie because I know that Richard Gear likes to be in jerker movies. I prefer to see action / adventure / science fiction. He was right, the movie is definitely a tearful tear. Diane tended to act in excess a few times, like Richard, but they took him and made him work. The daughter was a repressed teenager with a great attitude, so you started hating her. The film is too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece. Go rent it, see if you do not shed a tear. Hahaha. If you like the notebook, you will love it. The scenes of the beach were immaculately shot. Even though the hurricane scenes were a little out of place, it was still a bit irritable to see them react to them.
