What some Hollywood films try and practically never succeed, creating metaphysical connections between people (without becoming unrealistic), manages this beautiful film perfectly (it resembles a bit the wonderful "Veronique's double life" by the same director and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL movie, which changes a bit the perspective of life: an intelligent and beautiful story, masterfully directed, excellent main actors, masterful cinematography. I just watched the movie for the third or fourth time, and I still think it's one of the best I've seen. And if he is not satisfied with the end of 'Blanco', 'Rojo' puts a happy ending to the whole trilogy.
