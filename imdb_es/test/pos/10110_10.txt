"A tale of two sisters" is a brilliant psychological horror of South Korea that left me speechless. The film offers some delicious moments of frightening horror and is extremely spooky. The small cast of actors is really excellent, with the protagonist of Im Soo-jung especially memorable in the lead role. The direction of Kim Ji-woon is well managed and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The plot is a bit confusing, but some scenes are wonderfully strange. The action is quite slow, but I was not bored in the least; I was extremely curious and intrigued. The house, where the film takes place, seems incredibly threatening and isolated. "A tale of two sisters" is together with "Ringu" and "Kairo" one of the most original horror films of Asia. never seen. Watch this masterpiece as soon as possible. My rating: 10 out of 10.
