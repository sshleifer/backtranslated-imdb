This film has to be as close to perfecting a film as John Ford did. The movie is magical, a masterpiece, the reason why Ford was, well, Ford. If you want to know why Ford was great, he explains it. <br /> <br /> Photography, of course, is magnificent, black and white as black and white should be, wonderful shots, not a conversation over the shoulder. Pure Ford, great moments, big and small. The famous broken pants of Ward Bond. Apparently, two dogs were still invading the set and fighting, so Ford wanted to use them at the scene of the fight, but instead of fighting, one dog ran away and the other attacked Ward Bond and tore his pants, which caused Ford had no choice. A whole scene around braiding a rope. The way Ben Johnson burns and then removes his rope, wonderful omen and anticipation of the final. The naive courtship of Harry Carey of Prudence. The usual ford line about being scared and not showing it. Bond's horse accidentally falls into him and stays in the movie. Johnson and Bond are fantastic in that scene. Lord, help any Ford actor who does not hold on to the character while the camera is rolling, even when a horse falls on top of you. <br /> <br /> A couple of very sweet romances, which do not interfere with the whole approach, two very nice prospects, not to mention the girls, the amount of times the cameras focus on the rather charming butt of Ben Johnson <br /> <br /> Many double stunt acrobatics of years that have lines and roles, Cliff Lyons, Frank McGrath. Some wonderful characters study, mostly, faces, all the villains and main stars A set of villains to rival any group in any western area. <br /> <br /> Many shots of faces, groups, children, women, little Fordian things, small things happen, foals in the background (Ford seems to love images of foals), women in aprons, allowing the moment when the wagons cross the rivers and the camera persists. <br /> <br /> It is probably not a western as much as the image of an artist in the west. <br /> <br /> Luckily, the film was made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine that a film like this can be done again, but it is a work of art that would be sacrilegious to try.
