Film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults. Incapable overwhelming impossibility to deal with life and the means to which children come to try to live. Just live. Stay alive in a cruel world. A nightmarish world, we are afraid to see it because we are seeing the truth and we are afraid to see it. See a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complain about what we do not have when it is so trivial compared to someone else. They, the children of the film, are desensitized. They are more than insensitive to what surrounds them. They see sex as an act, as if they were watching a television program. When the child is with the prostitute, Pixote is sitting on the bed looking with a blank look, without feelings. He wants to be a small child and have a family, but the prostitute does not have compassion either and moves him away. A "human" film, with "human" relationships and moral judgment in an ugly, frightened and cruel world. It reminds us that life is not fair, but you can still have a human connection.
