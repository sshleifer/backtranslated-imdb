Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it being a terror adventure much less frightening than I expected. Instead, director Jeff Lieberman evokes a wonderfully evocative and disturbing atmosphere during large portions of the film, building suspense constantly until he was not really sure of what was about to happen, but ended up as a spring waiting for him. The lack of action in many parts gave it a bit of atmosphere mixed with the environment of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and when the action is really active, it is really shocking and dramatic, without even having to be really bloody. The characters are on par with this type of movie, although they are more understanding than some and the bad guy is memorable. Photography and suspense are the true winners of this film and prevent it from becoming boring (as has been suggested). I strongly recommend it to terror fans. Do not wait to gore, wait for a spooky story with several incredible moments and a great dream atmosphere.
