I experienced Nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. <br /> <br /> It is said that Clive Barker has revitalized the horror with Hellraiser, but this is a film that stagnated his film career. something. What an unfortunate thing happened because, like the inhabitants of Midian, this movie seems to be misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Barker has created a mestiza of basic genres in this story: it begins like a traditional horror movie. But soon it becomes a fable about the inhumanity of man for man. Evoke sympathy for the devil is difficult at best, but when the characters are as demonic as they are in this movie, it becomes almost impossible (give it to the child!). The human insurgency practically similar to the Klan (the gallows and holy wrath) at the conclusion of the film becomes doubly upset by what happened before. As a parable of ethnic tension and white supremacy, this film can be quite evocative. <br /> <br /> I regret those who will not see the film from this angle and will think that Barker's fantastic indulgence has gone too far. We have an authentic jewel forgotten here, and as soon as the studio and Mr. Barker do well and dedicate some time, the better.
