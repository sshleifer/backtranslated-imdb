This movie was exciting and fun to watch. Since I'm a fan of this kind of movies, I enjoyed this. The premise is a little scary, but the fact that I did not rate this with a 10 was because the movie was a little exaggerated in some areas. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Cmon: NO ONE could identify this girl? I understand the concept of isolating myself, but I can hardly believe that SOMEONE-ANYONE could not identify this girl as Angela Bennet. That was exaggerated and so was the scene in which she walked to someone's desk and started writing. In general, this was a really good movie, suspense and keeps his interest. Dennis Miller was great as Allen, REALLY credible, Bullock was good as the lonely computer worker reserved, and all the bad guys underestimated. <br /> <br /> I think the PREMISSION of the film was really different and terrifying. In today's times, who knows what could happen? But some of the most important scenes prevented this movie from being an 10. 8 out of 10.
