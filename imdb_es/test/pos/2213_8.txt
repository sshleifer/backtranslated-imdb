I really enjoyed this movie and I think most of Lauren Ambrose fans will do it too. His character is much softer than his role in Six Feet Under and all the performances are strong. I especially enjoyed the way Emily was handled, a wise woman with mental problems. Despite the criticism of other misinformed users, the paper was made with precision and without clich√© by the actress, Taylor Roberts. Fran Kranz also stood out, whose natural facility complemented the most veteran actors of the season. Although the address came to an obstacle here or there, it seemed that the only problems were with an underdeveloped script. What perhaps worked well as a play did not stay as well on the screen. However, the beautiful picture of Paul Ryan definitely makes up for that, as well as the pace of the movie, which surprisingly is not slow. I recommend this movie to six foot deep fans and also to fans of good acting and cinematography.
