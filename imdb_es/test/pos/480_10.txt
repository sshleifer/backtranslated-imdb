If you are tired of the same repetitive and unintelligent material published by the general film industry, you will enjoy "You Are Alone". It's stimulating, it's well filmed and it's fascinating. <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything that you do not discover in the first minutes of the film, this is the story of a white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who works as a companion and is discovered by her neighbor. The vast majority of the film occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come. <br /> <br /> Through their discussion, you explore two changing views of prostitution, depression, loneliness. However, the movie is not depressing. Talk about dark things without being depressing. <br /> <br /> As a spectator, your emotions and preconceived notions move from one place to another, but gently. You come out of this with a lot to think about. I like that in a movie.
