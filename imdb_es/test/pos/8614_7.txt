As selected during the Quinzaine des réalisateurs, this year 2002, Catherine Breillat is divided in the middle of her autobiographical film, where her main actress, Anne Parillaud (La Femme NIKITA, Luc Besson), admirably represents the Director of "Intimate Scenes" . <br /> <br /> This is a comedy of actor manners. Making-of? Movie genre? Pornography or exhibitionism? Sex Is Comedy is a postmodern film, with its script based on a movie within the film. Like an implosive story of a minimalist love scene, the film is built with a constant solidarity of forms and spirit, in which Breillat continues to break and analyze the taboos. Using visual codes and a certain sense of the formula, Catherine Breillat implements her clinical analysis of sexuality as an isolated problem outside of society to communicate through the door of the heart. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Grégoire Colin (Good Job, Nénette and Boni, Claire Denis, The Dreamlife of Angels, Eric Zonca) in the role of Actor and Roxanne Mesquida (La gorda, Catherine Breillat, Marie de the Bay of Angels, Manuel Prada), the actress, are actors that Ella invents, clarifies in an interview. Breillat watches the man in front of him even, a chaste man. Then, Breillat films shame and sexual mutilation, but also a great hope, a disturbing dimension of ecstasy, the nakedness of feelings, the reduction in half of the exhibitionism, playing to be one to be one. Finally, the Director is expected to lead the actors to express their feelings, their body and their soul. Thus willing, faced with the problem of the order of "who I am", the actors of Breillat acquired an inorganic vitality to merge in their work in progress. But, for what is an incredible form of exorcism, for an actor, Breillat puts many questions. At the same time enduring great suffering, the actors seem to be those who seek this loving transport to be part of the eternity of their work. <br /> <br /> Breillat's Art is a researcher, to know it. how to undertake a dialogue that aims to push the limits of intimate scenes. The makeup, the prosthesis in the erection and the unions do not stop remembering what images and scenes of Jan Steen's and Rembrandt could be in the anecdotal and in the diary of the characters in a film set. While the moral categories disappear from the background of Sex is Comedy, Breillat manages to reveal the power of loving imitation of the actors in a landscape of formidable and dramatic humanity.
