I had the great pleasure of recently seeing this beautifully filmed wide-screen adaptation of the resurgence of the 1943 stage (unlike the original 1935 production) that included extensive spoken recitative. This was the fashion at that time, so I blame the film for a tradition of 16 years. The film should be seen only for Sammy Davis Jrs, a brilliant cat performance like Sportin 'Life, which crawls in and out of the shadows. His seduction of Dorothy Dadridge's BESS "There is a departure date for a ship that is leaving soon to New York", is one of the most outstanding. Almost all the main music is intact and beautifully sung. Certainly never bores what the recent versions of PBS and MET did. It was a pleasure to see that time had not diminished the film, and I hope it will be available in the near future for generations that have not had the opportunity to experience it.
