Captain Corelli's "mandolin" is an old romance of the Hollywood War but with sex and nudes, and supposedly no Americans. The story takes place on a Greek island during World War II. The Italians arrive to seize the island, but with German supervision. There is a romantic triangle formed by a Greek couple and the Italian captain. Nice performances by all the actors; The best work of Penelope Cruz still.
