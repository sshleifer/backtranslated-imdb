Imagine the scene: a bored student with an empty day ahead, a video store with a special offer of 5 videos for a week's rent. This former student usually only took a stack of videos of dubious quality for the most arbitrary reasons (The Turning someone?). Occasionally, a strange undiscovered gem became his VCR, this being the case with this movie. Everything about the film is good, but much more than that, all parts combine to provide something very rare: a good cracking film. Why this never had a premiere in the UK cinema surpasses me, especially when we consider the shit we have to wade through the multiplex week by week. While I will happily accept that this is not Oscar material (but neither was the Titanic, which is a very nice movie). I tried to think of a way to describe the best way to appreciate / accept this movie: the perfect movie to watch while you bond with your father, after a trip home for the holidays, after a great Sunday lunch.
