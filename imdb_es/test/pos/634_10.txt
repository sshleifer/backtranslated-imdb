In the current world of advertising and the horror and sensationalism of teenagers, it is very rare to see a movie and not see anything about it. Movies like Psycho and Blair Witch, although they are big in suspense (both with great improvements) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before watching them. With Mute Witness, a strange whim, I came across this movie and I saw it, scared, in the middle of the night. I was frightened by the menacing Russian atmosphere, the theme of "snuff" and the claustrophobic situation of the molting and the fact that the characters (fun, which always lead to be nice) could reach the end at any time. Since this is a rare and low budget movie, we see it without any expectation. You also have Fay Ripley in a rare role in a movie, look and prepare to be excited, scared and excited in totally unexpected ways.
