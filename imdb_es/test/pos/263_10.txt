We really liked this movie. I was not trying to be outrageous, controversial, intelligent or profound. It was simply entertaining and it was what a lovely romantic comedy said in the box. All the other British filmmakers seem to want to change the world, it is good to see one that only concentrates on having a good thread with an elegant style.
