The film begins with three people on a play by ear holiday who decide to visit a crocodile farm first and then continue with a lighter activity, a "fishing" tour. <br /> <br /> Interesting information about the crocodiles during their visit to the farm and the information is added just enough to increase the suspense later during the film, as it recalls what was said above. <br /> <br /> The action in the film is well programmed and no more done The suspense is built through the "what if", the "unknown", and sometimes heartbreaking decisions that the characters take in the movie. <br /> <br /> I wondered what I would do if I were in the same situation. boat, there is no word game. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film was really good and the effects were realistic, credible and not exaggerated or cartoon, and are out of place, as sometimes you get with CGI. <br /> <br /> As a fan of horror movies, I see almost every horror movie I can have in each genre, and this is one of the best "crocodile" horror movies, if not the best I have. viewed. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not be disappointed.
