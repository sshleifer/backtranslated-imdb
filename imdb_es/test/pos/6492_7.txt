In August Days / Dies d'Agost, Marc Recha gave us a road movie of Catalan documentary style, saturated with the sun, consisting mainly of a meandering improvised meditation on fraternity and the recovery of the dead. The beautiful sometimes large-scale, 35 mm richly atmospheric. The images of landscapes, the good soundtrack and the narration in Catalan are charming as a piece of humor, if one is happy with a trajectory that does not have much momentum and does not lead anywhere in particular. The filmmaker Marc Recha and his non-identical twin David are the stars and the narrative is expressed by his younger sister. Marc had been investigating the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who had been a friend of the family. He felt that he was saturated with information and had to take a break. The break became to make this film, which seeks to capture the atmosphere of the interviews with the associates of Barnils, thoughts about the Spanish Civil War, the dry season they were experiencing, the steep landscape, the affection of the brothers Recha the one on the other, swimming. and they tanned the nudity and the characters or stories they met when they camped out of their truck. This leads to the search for a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. In the end, David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc has to go back to his project, and that's where it ends. I found it fascinating to hear an extended narration in Catalan with its combination of words in Spanish and French (maybe related to Proven√ßal?). This is not an important film, but it gets attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing with genres and mixing autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh way and stimulating. <br /> <br /> An official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.
