THE ANTENNA (Esteban Sapir - Argentina 2005). <br /> <br /> A completely unique version of the silent cinema in this fairytale story by Esteban Sapir, beautifully shot in black and white and practically without dialogue. "La Antena" is a feast for the eyes and a visit forced for lovers of German expressionist cinema, with most of the winks to the works of Fritz Lang and Friedrich Murnau. <br /> <br /> 'The city without a voice', 'The City without a Voice', is governed by Mr. TV. He has taken the voices of the inhabitants and has total control of all spoken words and images, forcing everyone to eat their own brand of TV food. Mr TV is not only a monopolist, it is the personification of evil and totalitarianism, even the swastika appears as a symbol several times. He secretly works on a hypnotizing device to control the minds of all citizens through his television broadcasts. For this purpose, he abducts the only one left with The Voice, a beautiful singer, but a television technician witnesses the kidnapping and flees to an old television antenna in the mountains to stop Mr. TV's evil plans. <br /> <br /> The production design is impressive with beautiful sets and images. Although filmed mainly with the basic language of silent movies, Esteban Sapir also adds a series of new techniques of his own, such as a combination of typographic and animation techniques. All talk to each other through balloons (usually floating near their mouths), the louder they talk, the bigger the characters are. The texts themselves can be pushed or crushed. In the opening sequence, we see a book, entitled "La Antena", which opens and a paper city emerges from the pages. There are hardly any references to Argentina. It's snowing constantly, which gives the film a very un-Argenine feel, while the surreal atmosphere suggests any big city in the northern hemisphere, with only some of the songs that reveal the Argentine background of the film. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast and there are many things happening on the screen, it is difficult to keep track of the film's surreal narrative. Not only surprisingly beautiful in sight, we also receive some messages about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are very well packaged. One of the most original movies I've seen in years. A delight <br /> <br /> The film was shown as the opening film at the IFF Rotterdam 2007. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
