Well done melodrama that tells the story of Sally, Tomboy dancer in the circus, raised by McGargle (played by WC Fields), top hat, mustache, checkered trousers and skill as a juggler, pickpocket and carnival Games runner like Three Card Monte and Old Shell Game. McGargle raised Sally, who adores him as his "true father" since Sally's mother (expelled from her home by her father, a judge, when she married a "circus man") died and left Sally an orphan. Sally is a fighter and loyal to McGargle no matter what she does, but McGargle seems to feel a little guilty about keeping her at the circus instead of being with her own family all these years. When they end up performing at a carnival in the city where their wealthy grandparents live, McGargle takes the opportunity to "investigate" Sally's real family, with the idea that he can give it back to her. But the grandfather, the judge, immediately dislikes Sally, because he does not like a "girl show": what a serious and narrow-minded man he is, a real job for that guy! And meanwhile, Sally is busy being chased by a handsome, wealthy young man, the son of the man who helped grandpa get his riches. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie with some laughs here and there and a kind of odd editing style (I do not know how to describe this except that it shows long shots, then it jumps a few seconds or changes from angle suddenly when a close-up is shown). Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is charming here, quite cute and funny in her performance. BATHROOM. Fields, even without his famous voice, is very funny; As he moves and his funny and funny reactions to things (like a small dog seen in a funny scene), we even see him juggling this briefly. I love the few looks at the old circus and carnival that is shown here. The printing of this content on the DVD is very beautiful, stained in a clear sepia tone, and the piano score is really excellent, made by Philip Carli based on the original reference sheets.
