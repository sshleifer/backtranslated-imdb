The first time I saw this movie on an Alaska Airlines flight, and since then I've seen it twice more. It simply is, and is simply, one of the best movies in years. I realized that I had enjoyed it after my first visit, but a little cloudy about what had happened. After seeing him again a few weeks later, things started to fit together. It was not confusing, only profound. In fact, the depth of the film may not be appreciated for long. For example, it occurred to me only after seeing for the third time that Sammy Davis Jr Jr (the grandfather's dog) is more than a pet, maybe he is the substitute for his dead wife. Witness how ferociously it protects you. There is a symbolism in abundance, and none of that is sad or forgiving, just real. The adventure of your trip keeps the story line in a perpetual movement, and even when they arrive, you're not sure if it was really destiny. As the movie continues, so does the adventure and I have the feeling that destiny was simply a point of reference. The sound track is fun, the scenery is convincing, and both are decidedly from the eastern block. I could continue talking about the deeper meanings within the movie, but I'm not completely sure I've discovered all the nuances yet. Also, it's more fun to take them out of yourself. As much as any movie can be, "Everything Is Illuminated" has proven to be a good wine that sweetens over time. I recommend seeing it - twice.
