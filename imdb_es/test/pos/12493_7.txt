Quai des Orfevres takes too long to get going, with Clouzot so in love with his surroundings in the back that he almost runs the risk of forgetting history. However, once it does, it's Clouzot at its best. Bertrand Blier (father of Bertrand Blier and co-star of his Buffet Froid) is the pianist of the world who married under himself and who plans to kill the sordid studio mogul with his wife's designs only to discover that someone has beaten him . Not only that, but his carefully planned but clumsily executed alibi shatters, especially when a thief steals his car at the scene of the murder. The film really comes alive with the arrival of Luis Jouvet. Inspector of police, a quite wonderful creation, half of Alistair Sim in green for Danger and half tired of Maigret with a better dialogue. In a neat joke, his research is constantly conducted out loud against the chaos and noise, be it the noisy typewriters of the police station or a noisy rehearsal. The police station itself is a marvelously realistic creation, a lot of chaotic and revealing details that make the once revolutionary police show of the 80s by Steve Bocchco in the United States look like old-fashioned museum pieces in comparison. <br /> <br /> If Suzy Delair is a rather unconvincing fatal woman, the cast of support is more than compensated, with the beautiful Simone Renant as prominent as the lesbian photographer in love with her from afar and constantly confused with the mistress of Blier by Delair and other interested parties (only Jouvet, equally unlucky with women, genuinely understands and sympathizes). With a large black-and-white photograph of Armand Thirard, this is a thrilling little thriller with a nice twist ending and a lovely scene with a taxi driver who reluctantly identifies Renant at a police station. (Note of triviality: Pierre Larquey, who played Dr. Vorzet in Le Corbeau, appears in smaller roles as a taxi driver in both Quai and Les Espions). <br /> <br /> The Criterion DVD is quite magnificent - excellent picture quality plus an illuminating excerpt from a French television show featuring interviews with Clouzot, Blier and Renant.
