I found this movie pretty bright. Initially I wanted a "when animals attack" movie along the lines of "frankenfish" or even "rogue", but they gave me a really horrible test that was not devoid of humanity. Having been in the areas where this was done (including the crocodile farm at the beginning of the film, even sharing the same guide!), It added to the fear factor. Those crocodiles really are everywhere up there, although I do not think they had the "attitude" of this beast. Yes, there were some melodramatic moments, but they contributed a lot to distract from the whole atmosphere. I genuinely took care of the characters and I shuddered when I contemplated "what would I do?" on your boat. Not knowing where your enemy was lurking or the sound of the crocodile that was being cut in the night was really scary. I would say that this movie is one of the best horrors I've seen in years (approaching the descent). I give him four crocodile bags.
