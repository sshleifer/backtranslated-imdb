This is Clive Barker's masterpiece in my opinion. The movie has a great story and incredible makeup and effects. The only thing I would love to see happen is a sequel. The film was prepared for a sequel and with improved technology, the second movie could be amazing. David Cronenberg must appear in a sequel, as well as Craig Sheffer. But this particular movie was a great original idea, creative and entertaining, and I was able to watch it again and again. Cronenberg was perfect in this film and Sheffer added an interesting spice to the film.
