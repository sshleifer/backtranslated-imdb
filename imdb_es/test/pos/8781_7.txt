Cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and starts up, looking for the real culprit. Hitchcock's family theme of a man wrongly accused of a crime is very well represented in this entertaining fare that has elements of "The Thirty Nine Steps" and "North by Northwest", although it is not as good as any of those classics. There are some impressive pieces, including the end in the Statue of Liberty. The plot is implausible and unconvincing and, after an excellent start, seems to have run out of steam. Cummings is nice if something rigid in the lead. Lane is the blonde variety but not the genius of the director's later films. The supporting roles are generally well played.
