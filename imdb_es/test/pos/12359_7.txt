There was once, in Sweden, a poor sister of the Salvation Army. At the door of death, she asks: "Send David Holm!" But, Victor Sjöström (as David Holm) can not be located, because he is spending New Year's Eve in a cemetery, with his drinking friends. The dying sister Astrid Holm (as Edit) wants to see if praying for Mr. Sjöström's soul, during the past year, has produced some result; It could be said that he has not done it. In the cemetery, Sjöström tells the story of "The Phantom Carriage", which he heard from his dead friend, Tore Svennberg (as Georges). According to legend, the last person to die each year must collect the souls of all the dead, until the next New Year is released ... <br /> <br /> Director Sjöström, whose main performance is very strong , he combines with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually appealing film. The great effect of "double exposure" is frequently used, but never seems exaggerated; and, it does not make the other dramatic moments of the film less memorable (for example, the Sjöström tear of his sewn coat and the shaving of the door). A story by Selma Lagerlöf was probably not one you could or would like to manipulate in the 1920s, which may or may not be the reason why the ending of this film is a disappointment. And, unlike similar spiritual stories, it is difficult to suspend your disbelief, if you think too much about what is really happening in "Körkarlen". <br /> <br /> ******* Körkarlen (1/1/21) Victor Sjöström ~ Victor Sjöström, Hilda Borgström, Tore Svennberg
