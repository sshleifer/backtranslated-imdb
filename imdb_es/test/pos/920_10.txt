The greatest movie in history. <br /> <br /> What do you think of a fight? However, if we see it through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that Three Colors Red is a masterpiece. It is not enough to say this: Three Colors Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not really good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi have to go back one step, Three Colors Red is the most important masterpiece of all time. As a discussion of human morality, Three Colors Red works on an intensely metaphysical level, with a depth that no one can match. Blue was almost that far in the human psyche, but he stopped because he was going to take the rabbit out of the hat. White forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality; this, in retrospect, was even better, but it still was not quite there. Red, however, is the real thing. What he expresses in this film is an expression of what it is to be human. In fact, what it expresses is how the human being feels. It forces us to examine, to the smallest detail, the very nature of our souls, of our ethical being. In Red, one can find meaning in one of its various levels. On the first level, Red reaches a high level of plausibility: we can not have any problem in calling Red an exceptionally entertaining story. However, the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceptions force us to examine the film as a film. It's as if Kieslowski was saying: "Ceci n'est pas la réalité". Indeed, in pursuing a humanistic goal, Kieslowski can also challenge reality. It is a trick that Kieslowski has been trying since Le Double Vie de Véronique, but it was not until this, his last film, that he finally managed to reach this divine interrelation of fate, philosophy and circumstances. The actors and actresses, too, seem to be at the mercy of a greater power. Valentine (Irène Jacob), is a successful name, since it seems to represent an almost pure love. Meanwhile, the idea of ​​first impressions is questioned by Judge Kern of Jean-Louis Tritignant, a stubborn man who, in the end, becomes an observer of events that knows everything, a character that symbolically seems to possess the power to unite the characters. - a power to make people happy, a power that he alone could achieve through Valentine. <br /> <br /> We have the ability to see movies as something more than a series of images. In fact, movies have the potential to have more meaning than literature. It will not happen, of course, but at least we have the power to see this movie, knowing that it gives us the power to achieve something that we can not define, but that we all possess. A synopsis of this film read: "A movie about a woman who runs over a dog". Well, it is. <br /> <br /> Is not it? <br /> <br /> -Simon Huxtable <br /> <br />
