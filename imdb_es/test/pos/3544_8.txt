I guess some top-level filmmakers were sitting around drinking their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice one night in the 80s during the Cannes Film Festival or another and one said, "Hey, let's make a movie where each one of us creates a segment around a world-class aria. " Welllll ... kind of work. Clearly, someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the chosen arias, for example, Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD, it has more value than the value of your money. Not all directors were successful, but more than not, and the film seems to improve with each presentation over the years. My favorite is the incredibly beautiful love duo of Die Todt Statd; Ok, a naked young woman, Elizabeth Hurley, is very attractive, but her husband, who sings to her, the ghost of his wife, is incredibly beautiful, with love music, only surpassed by Otello and Desdemona "Gia nella Notte Densa "throughout the operatic repertoire. The movie could have been better, of course, what could not have been, but it's worth seeing, especially if you're in a very romantic mood.
