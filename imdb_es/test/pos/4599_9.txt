Shame on Fox for leaving this movie. It was a total riot and I just hope he finds a second life on DVD and cable. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious satire. Take the situation of "What if" to one end and do not throw any blow (or kicks to the groin). It makes you think ... what will become of this empire once we have become totally lazy and stupid? Everyone is beaten in this esp. a series of large corporations, and even Fox News gets a hit (which is probably why the film never had an adequate release, apart from the marketing department for thinking about the campaign and not knowing how to market it), so that we will surrender! ") Some may find the movie sophisticated, due to kicks in the groin and farts, but the movie is much more than that. Or you understand what Mike Judge says, or not. Most of the negative reviews I have read seem to come from people who just do not understand it or are movie snobs. <br /> <br /> It will probably play for a week in the selected markets, so if you get lost, it's like that, do not lose sight of the DVD, it will be worth it to rent it and eventually I will have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> Good job Mike Judge, it's a pity that you were wrong, but you made me laugh out loud and I look forward to the next movie you do.
