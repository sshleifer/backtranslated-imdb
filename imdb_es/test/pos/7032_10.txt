Last night I saw this movie for the first time and enjoyed every aspect of it: the dance, the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the script and the whole atmosphere that created this movie. I would highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray offers an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as Frances (Baby) Houseman. She has a natural ability and a talent for dancing and is beautiful and charming on the dance floor. But the wonderful thing about Baby is that it has such a wonderful depth and dimension for her character. This is not just a movie about dance, but the writers have also given us the opportunity to see Baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that he is experiencing throughout the film and allow us to know how his interaction with others changes in the camp. his life. Gray portrays his character with such realism and commotion that you end up feeling deeply for Baby while experiencing everything he does in this movie. <br /> <br /> Patrick Swayze is magnificent in his role as Johnny and really manages to make his character come alive. He gives his character an integral personality, strong appeal and great depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Gray is charming and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this film. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Rhodes is excellent in her role as Penny and her interpretation of the ordeal she experiences is truly powerful and brings a terrifying dimension to the movie. The other supporting cast members, Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve special mention here, they also provide wonderful and imaginative presentations that give this film an additional dimension of high-quality performance and credibility that is wonderful to experience. The dance is magnificent and first class by all involved. <br /> <br /> The script and the interaction between all the main characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful way. The plot, although highly predictable, receives more than enough life and vitality for this film to be successful. <br /> <br /> In addition, the wonderful selection of music contained in this film creates a truly magical atmosphere and a very nostalgic atmosphere that improves the quality and success of all the scenes. <br /> <br /> `Dirty Dancing 'is a truly powerful, magnificent and very attractive film that leaves you deeply moved and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance.
