If you are going to see this movie, do not get into this movie with the expectation that this movie will be absolutely fun because you will be disappointed. Yes, it sure is fun at times, but I would consider it a political thriller disguised as a comedy. The performances are very good, especially by jeff goldblum as head of the electoral company. Although it has a limited screen time, it leaves a lasting impression. Of course, Robin Williams is excellent. lala linney is also very good, what a surprise. She is one of the best actresses in Hollywood and a particular scene proves it. This movie makes you think. What happens if a comedian ran for president and actually won? Would the country be better or would it break into a million pieces?
