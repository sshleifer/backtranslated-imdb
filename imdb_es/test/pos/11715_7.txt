Burt Reynolds plays an undercover cop who is behind a crime boss ... Rachel Ward, the high-priced girl he falls for ... Burt does well in this role and I think he would have done well in more roles like this ... <br /> <br /> Rachel Ward is beautiful and sexy on her part ... good rhythm and story but something is missing in the equation ... on a scale of one to ten ...
