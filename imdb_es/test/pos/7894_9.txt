I was surprised at how emotionally inverted I became in this movie. Peter Boyle is a tour de force like the socially conservative mustache of the working class, Joe. Actually, he sympathized with some of his complaints. Of course, he does not mention the historical socio-economic reasons underlying many of his prejudices. The film also provides interesting information about the rapid change that American society was experiencing at this time. Recreational drugs, casual sex and the challenge of parental authority became fashionable and replaced the most respected traditions of respect for God, country and antiquity. The fans of Susan Sarandon will be delighted. Joe is his film debut. She also provides the viewers with a visual gift near the beginning of the movie. Recommended, 8/10.
