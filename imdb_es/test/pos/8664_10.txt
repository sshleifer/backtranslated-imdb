Den Brysomme Mannen is one of the best films of all time and is about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses, no feelings, no love, no truth, and definitely no freedom. A world where people get scared when someone says what they think, expresses or shows affection, a world where no one is free and nobody has any idea what the meaning of all this is. Like the world in which we live, the world in Den Brysomme Mannen is a world of lost souls that try to realize themselves, but they focus on the opposite of what satisfies them: materialism, social acceptance and mediocre satisfactions. <br /> <br /> Den Brysomme Mannen deserves all the attention of every human soul, because we could all use a new wake-up call.
