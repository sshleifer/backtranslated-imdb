For the cheese of the late 80's, this really is not so bad. There are a lot of simple very funny phrases ("That was a great steal!" - "Thanks!")

I'm curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular speaking voice (with British influence) instead of the hyper-Bronxy accent used in her place. Oh good. As a side note, I was able to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle policemen in my work; He said it was a fun movie to work on, but he gave me the sad news that the actor who played Buck, the UPS delivery boy, died about a year after Who's That Girl
