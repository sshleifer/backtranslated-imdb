Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Once addicted heroine Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) is released from jail by his clumsy asshole partner Sparrow (Arnold Stang), a disabled man in need of a wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and Molly (Kim Novak). He's trying to succeed as a drummer in a band, but until his big break. Throughout, he is stuck doing the only other thing he was good at, in addition to being a gambler addicted to cards in high stakes games. And no matter how hard he tries, not even prison has cured him of his addiction to the devil's drug, which leads him to lie and deceive all those around him and leads him to take desperate measures to feed his habit. His longing to leave is his only motivation towards a happy ending. <br /> <br /> When people think of Frank Sinatra, they usually think of classic songs like Under My Skin, New York New York and It Had to Se Tu But for anyone to forget that he was actually an actor as well. Renown and, if his performance in the acclaimed From Here to Eternity was not enough, he will also be remembered for this avant-garde drama, which deals with what was then the ultra taboo subject. of drug abuse. <br /> <br /> Often, the film appears as one of the first to show the graphic use of heroin (probably the reason behind the 15 certificate) at a time when it was a subject that was still heavily understory. In his portrait of the main character, Sinatra is fine, perfectly transmitting the desperation, despair and sincerity of a man who loses every second opportunity that is being given. His cold turkey scene is much more intense than that of Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting. The first co-star that impresses Parker is the demanding and needy disabled woman of a wife of Machine, who uses her husband's guilt and duty in everything she can. Novak as his secret lover still achieves some strong moments, but is less a star than Parker. Stang makes his usual comic relief, as the clumsy fellow who drags the protagonist with his New York accent. <br /> <br /> Director Otto Preminger allows the rhythm to creep a bit at times, but this is still a problem. A powerfully absorbing film to the end, with many twists and turns and that must be admired for being one of the first films to bring such a somber theme so powerfully to life. ****
