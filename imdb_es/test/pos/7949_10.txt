I was lucky enough to see this movie in the recently concluded international film festival here. In fact, I was able to see another film from South Korea (The Power of Kangwon Province), but Christmas in August caught my attention. The story is quite simple, the usual boy meets the girl (or should we say girl with the boy?). What made it special to me was how it was represented. We can say that the film was calm and endearing. Here we do not have a flashy and artificial romance, only two common beings are made wonderful by their friendship and love not expressed for each other. I also loved how the film used images as expressions of past and present relationships. I wanted this to be shown here as a regular movie. I'm sure I'd call a larger audience.
