I just finished seeing it and it seemed great. I rated it with an 8 out of 10. I plan to see it again with the director's comment and then again in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because of my fascination with the most recent film by Christopher Nolan, Memento. The following has some similarities; This movie was probably the shot for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar. <br /> <br /> Recording the film in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and the dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is credible. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan made this movie on a very low budget. I await your next release, Insomnia, a big budget movie with my favorite actor Al Pacino.
