This BBC series is surprisingly good fun. I had only seen a few minutes before I knew I had to recognize it and see it again with all my friends. I would not recommend it to anyone who is prudent, but almost everyone else will enjoy it, from the movie snob to the hungry masses of entertainment. The main character is a lesbian, but it's still worth seeing if that's not your thing. <br /> <br /> Rachael Stirling is amazing in a leading role that extends her into a dazzling variety of emotions and situations, some of them from a stranger. nature. No one who has seen this series would say that he can not act. She makes us laugh, cry, turn on and slap us in amazement. <br /> <br /> You really can not compare this story with anything else. It is not a rehash of style or plot. It is completely a comedy, historical drama, erotic, tale of coming of age, musical and much more. <br /> <br /> I have to praise the BBC for making this story. I can not imagine anyone in the (extremely prudent and formulated) United States ever doing it. Then, stop reading about that and go buy it.
