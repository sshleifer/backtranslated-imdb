Compared to the acclaimed Hollywood remake, this film is less flashy but much stronger in providing a general picture of the drug problem. The remake loses the most interesting of the three threads of the plot, that of a farmer whose poor livelihood depends on drugs as a commercial cash crop and whose greater involvement with drug trafficking in an effort to improve himself is destroyed himself and his family. In addition, the story of the daughter's addiction focuses on the problems not only of abstinence, but also of the high probability of relapse. This original miniseries makes good use of the additional time to address the issues more thoroughly and remains a more important topic in this controversial issue.
