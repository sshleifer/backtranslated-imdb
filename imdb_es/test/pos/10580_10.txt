After reading all of Sarah Waters' books, I was anxious for an adaptation of Fingersmith by the BBC. Especially since the old relative Andrew Davies had done Tipping the Velvet. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the results, in fact I think this could be on par with TTV; Romantic and entertaining. And not like so many ignorant people would make you believe, a game of meaningless lesbians. Having been a fan of Elaine Cassidy since she saw her guiltless turn in Felicia's Journey, I thought that she embodied both the hard deception and Maud's growing fragility. His transformation was credible and impressive to watch. I recognized Sally Hawkins as Zena Blake from Tipping the Velvet, a small role primarily, so I did not have many expectations, but she was amazing in the role of Sue Trinder. His eyes were fascinating and conveyed everything from rage to absolute despair. The two acting together, combining these talents made this drama could not be lost. Of course, Imelda Staunton was amazing as usual, she is unmistakably a national treasure and the supporting cast was of a high standard. Even the direction of the quite unknown Aisling Walsh used contrasting but beautiful blue tones for Briar and browns for London. <br /> <br /> However, so much praise must be given to Ransley, the screenwriter. Converting a 600-page book where each line is of the highest quality into a three-hour show is a great feat. He illuminated the main revelations at a steady pace, while at the same time providing us with a lot of background story and character development at the same time. He has my total admiration. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a brilliant adaptation where everyone involved gave 100% and making this one of the best BBC dramas I've seen.
