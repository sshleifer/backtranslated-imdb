Film about two Australian girls, Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight), and what happens when they become friends of two surfers. <br /> <br /> I captured this in an art cinema here in the United States. in 1981. Technically he was still a teenager (he was 19 years old), so he was interested in seeing how Australian teenagers acted. Wise script there is nothing new here. Shows the usual teen adventures related to dating, sex, suicide, etc. I always knew what was going to happen before it happened, but I never got bored. What I found interesting was that, despite the accent and some changes in clothes and hair, these teenagers are not very different from American teenagers. They had many of the same difficulties and complexes. It was also based on a book by a real surfer girl and her real life adventures and (I heard) was a faithful adaptation of him. The performance was fine, but the actors were attractive and this was well done and quite interesting. So this is not an unrecognized masterpiece, but rather a fairly accurate representation of what it is to be a teenager and try to be with popular children. I give him a 7.
