I saw this movie by chance. I was standing on 42nd Street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started distributing free tickets for a preview of this movie. I gave him the opportunity not to wait long. The promotional posters of the movie I have seen on the walls of the subway station that does not do justice to this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about a young rocker who takes a trip to learn the art and art of heavy metal. leave it there. The movie is a heavy and very funny comedy. If you are old enough to remember that when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the eighties, this movie will enchant you. Jack Black is an incredibly talented comedian and actor. Assuming he actually wrote and performed the songs of this film, he is also a talented musician. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D is definitely worth it!
