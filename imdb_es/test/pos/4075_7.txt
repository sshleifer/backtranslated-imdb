I can not understand why so many people did not like this movie. Robert De Niro was at the top of his game, delivering his lines with such aplomb, one has to believe that this is his daily behavior. Of course, the movie seemed to have a lot of movie-themed conventions when trying to make fun of the concept, it goes without saying that this movie was really fun. From the police dog, to the fact that Eddie Murphy did not bother me much, this film is a true archer. Rene Russo also matched the rest of the cast perfectly, establishing his role so that it does not interfere with the budding relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
