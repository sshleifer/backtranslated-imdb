Okay, maybe the imitations of Jay Leno and David Letterman are not accurate, but you can still get an idea of ​​who these people are and how they operate behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are excellent as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz. <br /> <br /> The movie is not for prank and punchline, but it's still fun. Kathy Bates, in particular, is amazing as Leno's manager. <br /> <br /> Funny, amazing, interesting, very visible, this is a good movie for television.
