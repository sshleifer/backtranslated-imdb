Finally I'm watching the Godfather movie, for what I see is an incredible movie, and a lot of action. Damian Chapa is a good director, but I must admit that I love that he is the best. <br /> <br /> I also saw that behind the scene was edited by a lady called kinga, she needs to go back to school and learn to edit. <br /> <br /> However, the movie The Godfather is an epic of pure action. Why can not most people who direct films make you wonder what the plot is? I am very happy to see someone I know as a great real actor, who also becomes a great director. <br /> <br /> I am one of those people who love to see how artists do it. <br /> <br /> BS
