I found that this movie is one of those great touching gems. The story line is very interwoven and the development of the character is fantastic! Anyway, I'm a big fan of movies that are not from the USA. UU And this is at the height of "Happenstance", "The Closet" even "King of Hearts". Vlastimil Brodsky as Fanda, is fantastic. It is a love story in the true sense of loving life and the twists and turns that are required for the viewer to understand / enjoy the vision of Fanda's life (which almost costs him <br /> <br /> more what you are prepared to give) are wonderful. His co-star Stelle Zazvorkova is unforgettable as his wife fed up. I recommend this movie for the whole family, my children loved it.
