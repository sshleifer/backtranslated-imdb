Being Warner Brothers' second historical drama with the Civil War and the Battle of Little Big Horn, General George Armstrong Custer, THEY DIED WITH HIS BOOTS ON (Warner Brothers, 1941) was the most accurate of the two; especially when contrasted with SANTA FE TRAIL (Warner Brothers, 1940), which really did not set the bar very high. <br /> <br /> Although both images were protagonists of the Errol Flynn vehicles, there was a change in the cast. The part of General Custer. While he was "Dutch," himself, Ronald Reagan played the extravagant and egomaniac knight in the previous image, with Mr. Flynn playing Virginian and later the Confederate General Hero, J.E.B. (or Jeb) Stuart; Errol assumed the role of Custer for THEY WHO DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS. <br /> <br /> Once again, the propensity of the Warner Brothers to use a large number of actors from reliable characters from the "Warner's Repertory Company" is employed to give The film is a kind of authenticity, and everything is happening before our very eyes. The main roles are assumed by some well-known actors and actresses, such as: Elizabeth Bacon / Mrs. Custer (co-star Olivia de Havilland), Ned Sharpe (Arthur Kennedy), Samuel Bacon (Gene Lockhart), Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) ), "Californy" (Charlie Grapwin), Major Taipe (Stanley Ridges), General Phillip Sheridan (John Litel), Callie (Bacon's maid, Hattie McDaniel). <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is packed with non-accredited players, though experts like: Joe Sawyer, Eleanor Parker, Minor Watson, Tod Andrews, Irving Bacon, Roy Barcroft, Lane Chandler, Spencer Charters, Frank Ferguson, Francis Ford, William Forrest, George Eldridge, Russell Hicks, William Hopper, Hoppity Hooper, Eddie Keane, Fred Kelsey, Sam McDaniel, Patrick McVey, Frank Orth, Eddie Parker, Addison Richards, Ray Teal, Jim Thorpe American, himself), Minerva Urecal, Dick Wessel, Gig Young and many, many more. <br /> <br /> The film moves very fast, particularly in the beginning; then, more or less, it slows down by necessity as the story advances to the years after the Civil War, the assignment of Custer as Colonel in the Seventh Cavalry and the final destination in Little Big Horn, in Montana. Under the guidance of the director, Griffith's veteran, Raoul Walsh, the film reaches a variety of emotions; of very serious, exciting battle scenes and compelling historical scenes; Looking as if they were photos of Matthew Brady's civil war. As with most of Mr. Walsh's films, he punctuates and speeds up the ending of many scenes with a bit of humor; but not exaggerating and, therefore, risking the possibility of turning the film into a comedy (farce, really). <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, this is much more real than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (the last time I'll mention it, honest Schultz, Scout's Honor!). However, that does not mean that there have been a few fragments of "Artistic and Literary License, as in fact, almost any Biopic will have.It would be impossible to make a similar type of film if in fact all the facts and the incident was attempted The most erroneous inclusion, as well as the most obvious invocation of the Literary License, is the fact that Custer was accidentally promoted to the rank of Brigadier General, however, the "joke" helped the film to move forward, while underlining all the sense of carelessness and light that permeated the first part of the film. <br /> <br /> DIRECTOR Walsh and Mr. Flynn collaborated to give us what seems to be a characterization of this legendary Hero of the Civil War who was very close to the real-life man, and they did it in addition to recreating an incident, being the Lakota Sioux Massacre, Cheyenne and Fukowi of Custer and his seventh cavalry in The little horn. At the time of his appearance, on June 25, 1876, "The Last Battle of Custer" was an incident and a shock as great to the national psyche of the Americans as was the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) or the atrocities perpetrated by the Islamic Fascists to the Twin Towers of New York and to the headquarters of the Armed Forces of the United States at the Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia, on September 11, 2002. <br /> <br /> ONLY like so many films from that period of the Second World War. (and the years immediately before), there were so many incidents in it that they were, if they were not done intentionally, demonstrations of virtues that would be necessary in the time of another global conflict, like the one we were in at the moment THEIR BOOTS ON CONDITION He was finishing his original period of theatrical release. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
