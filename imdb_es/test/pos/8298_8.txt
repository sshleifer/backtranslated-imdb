I'm also serious, I mean, do not get me wrong, if you do not have a penchant for this kind of Z-grade crunchy creature (why would you be looking is my first thought?) Then it's a rating of about 3 to 4 of each 10 tops, but for me it's a special kind of nonsense that brings me to a good time in my childhood. You know the type, the memories that never leave you. Assuming it with enthusiasm, with youthful astonishment, as Doug McClure and Peter Cushing tunnel under the mantle to fight against a large number of creatures and subhuman species. And guys,! Now that we have all grown up we can more seriously admire the wonder of Caroline Munro and her hectic cut. No wonder my older brother was willing to take me to the movies to watch this one. very. And yes, Cushing and a surprisingly chubby McClure act as if they'd really been hypnotized by the evil Meyhas in the "core" of our movie. But it does not matter, stupid and clumsy and full of glorious colors, At The Earth's Core is a throwback to a special pre-ILM moment in which children like me lined up around the block to see such merry nonsense. 8/10
