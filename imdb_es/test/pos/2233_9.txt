She loves drugs, but he never realizes that he is cheating with a chain of bimbos. She is chased by a married but separated man, Ricardo Cortez, who is not free. But when a girl from society catches Ames, everything goes to hell. <br /> <br /> Astor is simply wonderful as the overly intelligent woman who almost makes a big mistake after losing her man. Ames is good as the idiot (but what does she see in him?), And Cortez is good but does not have much to do. Kitty Kelly is as good as her partner, Dolores. Charles Sellon is the original owner, Cather Dale Owen is the girl of the society, and Edna Murphy is as fun as Daisy. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look.
