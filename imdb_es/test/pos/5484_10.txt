I just watched this movie for the first time last night. Woohoo! What a movie This is the kind of movie that everyone wants to see in the world because it's great and interesting. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give a single word about the plot because I think it would be better for people to go cold. DO NOT READ THE SUMMARY OF THE PLOT before watching the movie! All I'm going to say is that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson and Jeff Maguire's script are first class. I wish all the thrillers were more like this.
