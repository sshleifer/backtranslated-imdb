To think that this movie was made the year I was born. To think that people are still being removed from their constitutional rights, now in the name of "national security". To think that this movie was intentionally banned from the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK addresses the political divide in the United States better than any movie I've seen. Had he seen himself more widely, would something have changed? A movie like this is so polarizing, it has the potential to cause disturbances. It shakes you and forces you to take sides. It makes you face the problem: are you in favor of the right of dissent of the people in times of war or of the constitution being compromised in the name of "national security"? The government forces the protagonists to run towards the American flag in a game that undermines the same ideals that the flag represents. The acting is totally convincing. So much that I can not see any performance here. If this is a scripted documentary, it is more compelling than any television program today. PUNISHMENT PARK is possibly the most important movie ever made. It really makes you think.
