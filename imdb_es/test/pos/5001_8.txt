Originally I saw this movie while working as a musician doing musical theater in the summer action. If you have ever worked in theater, especially in a summer theater, you will really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some moments of bad writing in the film, but in general It's a beautiful tribute to the theater and that's why people love it.
