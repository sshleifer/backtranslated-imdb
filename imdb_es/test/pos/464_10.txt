Although it was dark, depressing and, at times, hard to see, You Are Alone caught my eye and was refreshingly honest in their dialogue. He really captured the anguish of teenage romantic relationships. Also, the soundtrack was incredible. The lyrics and tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the film. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl is the best actress I've ever seen in my life. His convincing and credible performance made the film. It made me wonder if she really is a prostitute. Who knows. Anyway, the movie was very worth seeing. LOVE, YOUR SISTER! Yes it's correct....
