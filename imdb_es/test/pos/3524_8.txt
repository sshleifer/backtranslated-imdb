Five teenagers set out to camp in the Oregon desert and, despite being warned by the park ranger, they soon realize there is something lurking in the backwoods waiting to attack. <br /> <br /> When it comes to old horror movies, the only one that keeps showing up in all conversations is Friday the 13th, so I took care to find those old horror movies that fell short to just compare them with Friday the 13th, just before DAWN happened to me I was among those that I found, and it was really very impressive, it was not as insipid as some of the things you find today, it was very acute in terms of character development, since he had quite nice, and has this A very casual rhythm, not in a hurry to get to the hack and the bar bits, he takes his time to establish the right mood and tone and is very atmospheric and creates a bit of suspense murderer by allowing him to always have that feeling of fear, as for example. out there, but you do not know where it is or when it will s trike. <br /> <br /> Where I live is definitely a gem that is overlooked simply because people have never heard of it or will not give it a try, but I will say it is not a scam on Friday the 13th. They do not even come close, but in my opinion, it's one of the most impressive slashers I've seen in a long time.
