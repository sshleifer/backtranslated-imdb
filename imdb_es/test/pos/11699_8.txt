Considering Mick Molloy's terrible record since he came out alone, he had low expectations of Crackerjack. Even the movie's promotional posters made me nervous. In fact, if it had not been for the fact that I had received free tickets for the preview, I would have resisted the pressure of the woman (who thinks that Mick is a piece - there is a concern) to pay money for it. <Br /> <br /> The first minutes of the movie worried me: it starts with one of Micks' "getting angry with insignificant things" routines, but that gave him a nice touch, which at least made it a bit refreshing. The rest of the script was quite good and very cheerful, even the typical humor of Mick Molloy (and Judith Lucy) was well delivered and, although I never had to get up from the corridors, I generated many more laughs than me. waiting (and it was consistent). <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in the plot - quite predictable, but it moved quickly between a sentence and other jokes - I never felt that it held any element for too long or too short; Mick must have worked hard to polish his script. There were one or two "Late Show" jokes, and one or two jokes that only the Melbournians would get, but there are certainly many generic things for a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Something that I found disappointing John Clarke's lack of relative grace: it just did not seem to work like the bad guy, but that does not detract too much from the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoyed this Australain. Comedy, and it was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the film. I left the cinema with a smile of decent size, something very difficult to do for an Australian comedy in my books. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
