I can not help but notice the negative reviews that this film has received. To be honest, I saw the preview of this movie, and the premise seemed intrigued. Yes, I rented it after reading the comments of others. They are correct as to which part of the performance leaves much to be desired. They are also right in stating that one of the best performances of this film was that of Dr. Graves. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the boy in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, maybe because I'm in a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth it.
