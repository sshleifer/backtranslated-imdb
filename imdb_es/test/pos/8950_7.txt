Once again, watching this type of film makes me more and more in English humor, which is not seen too often on the screen since the days of Monty Python and Man About The House. Pity. <br /> <br /> Brenda Blethyn (the first time I saw Saving Grace at the beginning of the year, another that she must see by the way) simply stands out, as does Alfred Molina. The rest of the cast, although practically unknown to me, also presents great performances. The film begins slowly and gradually, and wins in rhythm and fun: halfway there were tears in my eyes for laughing. <br /> <br /> In short, a funny movie in English, a thousand times better than the supposedly "funny" garbage. that comes from hollywood. <br /> <br />
