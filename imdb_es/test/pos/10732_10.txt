I have seen many Dustin Hoffman movies like Straw Dogs or Rain Man and I liked them, but their characters are very suitable for people who are often calm or even shy. I expected him to be in this movie just like him in Straw Dogs, but I saw a totally different person. I was much more energetic in this movie and it reminded me a little of Al Pacino in Serpico. The movie was very interesting from beginning to end. I liked the way the character of Dustin Hoffman was ready to do almost everything to stay with his son. This movie is also revealing. Personally, I think it shows that people must learn to find a commitment without involving other people in the subject.
