Darr is a great movie! Shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady, who in this case is Juhi Chawla. Little does Juhi know in the movie that Shahrukh is very much in love with her and is constantly harassing her. I must admit that some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy ... like threatening phone calls. Never in my life will I forget the phrase: "I love you K..k..k..Kiran!" <br /> <br /> It's just a pity that Shahrukh and Juhi were not exactly "together" in the movie. But Juhi and Sunny make a good couple in the movie. Although the role of Shahrukh was quite psychotic, I still think he did a great job in interpreting it and I can not imagine anyone else doing that role. I'm not surprised that he won a prize for Darr at 94 '! <br /> <br /> Juhi ... what can I say? She looks especially amazing in this movie! It's not that he does not always look amazing in his other films, but Darr gave the audience a wonderful picture of her! <br /> <br /> As for the music ... it was excellent! Especially "Jaadu Teri Nazar", one of my favorite songs of all time. I also thought that "Tu Mere Samne" was also very nice. <br /> <br /> A must for all! In general, Darr deserves a 9/10!
