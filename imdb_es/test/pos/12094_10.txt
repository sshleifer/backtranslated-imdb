Turkish culture is completed by many different cultures. Different cultures have different styles of music. Istanbul is like the turkey mix. It has mostly the same language but different dialects. This documentary shows us these different types of music with different dialects and different instruments. You can watch the reports with singers and groups, their performances, their daily life and learn their thoughts about music. The film includes not only Istanbul music, but also life in Istanbul, how people communicate and what they eat and drink. The surprising thing is that although I live in Istanbul, I learned many things about this movie.
