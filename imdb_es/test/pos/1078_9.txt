Business against personal conviction. Profit vs. art. <br /> <br /> As with any documentary that confronts large capitalist corporations against the small producer, the viewer will invariably have to side with one or the other based on their own beliefs. This is both a documentary of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us, against the old traditional ways in which the character and art of doing things matter almost more than getting the product sold. <br /> <br /> If you have to remember one thing about this movie, it is that the masses can no longer decide for themselves, they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics who tend to equalize and standardize the taste of the same way MacDonalds used to do it. Do something quick (something that Parker himself admits in the movie against a backdrop of a Burger King poster). "Everything is about the image" against the content, as another interviewee says. That's the easy way, the standardized way. Easier than taking the time for a good wine to mature, easier than faking your own taste by trying and trying again. Controlled brand flavor is easier. <br /> <br /> There is a glimmer of hope when even some of our cousins ​​across the ocean agree that some people are "leveling out" the taste of the wines to maximize the benefits and ensure a maximum of it. sell to the "gray masses". Individuality and difference are sacrificed for the extra money. It's nice to see that not all or all are giving in to standardization, even across the ocean. <br /> <br /> As in many other areas of the world today, the domain of a few and the freedom of choice reduced affects us all. ... Allow everyone to decide and decide what to do. Too much standardization kills the mind and taste; the difference brings innovation and healthy competition, and will allow the choice, and not just vacuum packaging "more of the same". Standardization sells easily and a lot, and brings everyone to the same level, the lowest. <br /> <br /> About this, I'm going to open a good bottle and wish you a good "sante".
