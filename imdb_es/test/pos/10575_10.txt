This was indeed an incredible adaptation. I missed the first episode, so unfortunately I missed the union between the characters and the good development of the story. But as soon as I saw the second and then the third installment, I was amazed. I ordered the DVD less than a week later and, since I could not wait for it to arrive, I went straight out and brought the book. From the moment I opened it, I was hooked, I just could not leave it. I decided to finish the whole book before I dared to watch the DVD. I preferred the book because it got into the minds of the characters, you could totally understand where they came from and what was the role within the story. They forgot a lot about the adaptation, which was disappointing, since the book is a masterpiece and I think they could have done it excellently if they could have stretched it for a longer period of time. But considering that you can only fit in a space of 3 hours, I think it was excellent. He brilliantly followed the twisted main plot. And the actors who were registered as the main characters were incredible! The lovemaking scene was pure and beautiful. He was so tender and loving and only showed how natural homosexual love can be. I was totally impressed with the book and the TV adaptation! I loved the two previous Sarah Waters novels and I also found the Tipping the Velvet adaptation quite pleasant. But when I read and observed Fingersmith, I did not know that any of his previous novels / adaptations could overcome it. Sarah Waters has gotten over this time! I recommend you see this adaptation! If Tipping the Velvet was not your thing, then do not let this discourage you. Fingersmith is a completely new ball game. It's a beautiful but dark story about love, greed and betrayal ... <br /> <br /> YOU MUST SEE!
