If you see this at home on DVD or Bluray! Make sure you have a great sound system. The musical score through this is what moves you through the movie. I've seen the movie several times and I thought it was great, but after updating my home theater sound system, what a difference. I will be watching this movie many, many more times. <br /> <br /> if you do not have a great sound system. Find a friend who does and see it there. <br /> <br /> Also see the additional stories and extras that come with it (the BR or the DVD). The interview of Quimet in the conversations of the 60s about his scholarship. Bottom line ... but for those times only the boys got it. today I hope some of that goes to the girls .......
