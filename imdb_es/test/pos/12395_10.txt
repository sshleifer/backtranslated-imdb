First, I rated this movie 10/10. For me, it's just one of the best I've seen since I was born (I'm 23 years old, but I saw a lot of movies). History is cruel, but reality is cruel too, is not it? He entered me and stirred my insides. I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and I still remember it! <br /> <br /> Second, there is no 'national preference' (this expression is a direct translation from French) for this film. I mean, it's not because it's a French film that I put so high: it really caught me when I saw it. Also, I do not know Marcel Carne's filmography well, so I do not know if it's his best film, but I know it's not the most famous: the Hotel du Nord, the Quai des Brumes and Les Enfants du Paradis are the most famous. <br /> <br /> Third, the film is in black and white, but it deals with the intertemporal problems of young people (not acne) such as love, friends and studies in a modern way. You could even redo frame by frame with real young actors, a Dolby sound (tm) and special effects (a car accident). It would still be a great movie! <br /> <br /> Problem: Maybe it's a movie to be seen by young adults (from 16 to 25 years old), and of course, so that your message is well understood ... Did I say it was A great movie?
