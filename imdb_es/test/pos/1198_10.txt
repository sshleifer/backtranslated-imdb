When I was younger I saw the end of HAIR on television. I just watched the last 5 minutes of the movie. And it impressed me a lot. I got goosebumps and told myself I had to see this movie. <br /> <br /> And I did, and I must say: this movie is amazing. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message ... The message of this film is one of the most important: "Make love, not war". This movie is a true masterpiece. Meanwhile, it's my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> The last song is one of the saddest and happiest I've heard. I could almost feel myself joining the crowd. All I have to say: "LET THE SUN BE SHINE, LET THE SUN BE SHINE"
