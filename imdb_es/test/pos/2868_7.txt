This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. A mysterious house, interesting characters, gore and a twisted plot. Who could ask for something more in a horror movie? It's pretty predictable for the most part, but again, most of the horrors can be resolved in the first 10 minutes, so I will not reject it. The music, the camera angles and so on are excellent. The sets are well made and very convincing. However, there were virtually no subplots, since it is a horror movie too many alternative plots that only take away what was missing to a horror anyway ... To be afraid ... This is quite simple and does just that. If I had to compare it to any other movie, I'd say it reminded me of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Definitely a horror movie lover should see.
