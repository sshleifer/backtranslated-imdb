"Admissions" is a good drama, although there are some problems with the end. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie who is trying to avoid college. To make his overworked mother not realize, he invents poems that everyone thinks his sister with mental problems wrote. All the acting is first class, especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. Both put in great performances. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. First is the character of Stewart Worthy played by Christopher Lloyd. Your part is underdeveloped. The other weakness is the end. It goes in circles, which I did not expect with the execution time of 84 minutes. On top of that, the movie is definitely worth seeing.
