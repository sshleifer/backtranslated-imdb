One of the best movies I've seen in my life: a classic "Matrix" movie. For many years, I have been trying to get it on VHS or DVD, without success. The German film / TV industry still prefers the valuable cultural contributions (and this is Fassbinder, after all!) They rot and accumulate dust in some file instead of distributing it commercially (and make a lot of money if that's what it stimulates) . them instead of the promotion of creative thinking). However, the WDR told me once if it paid DM 200.00 to verify the copyright (non-refundable), and then 8 copies of DM per minute, plus the cost of the materials, then consider preparing a copy (only one! ) For me. A way to sell something! The same problem we have with many other television movies or series like "We weit die Füße tragen", "Sonntagseltern", "Kellerkinder", and others. Excellent TV series: you will never listen again. Germany, wake up! <br /> <br /> UPDATE since March 2007: last year, I was finally able to obtain a DVD copy of the WDR "Mittschnittservice" for approximately 50 euros. Cool!
