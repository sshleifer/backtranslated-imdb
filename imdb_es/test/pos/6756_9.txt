Words alone can not describe the beauty and power of this movie. <br /> <br /> Think of "Toy Story". Now, think of "Toy Story," around 1934. Now, imagine that animation looks like something real, like fluid. Think of the film not as something that adults and children can enjoy, but imagine it as a movie. Imagine trying to do something like that in 1934. Somehow, "The Mascot" offers. In a story where toys come to life, and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner, Starewicz offers a completely unexpected level of animation. He is so fluid that he will ask himself for a long time if what he sees is really a stop-motion animation. <br /> <br /> Compare "Toy Story" and "The Mascot" is a useless exercise, in terms of the plot: while "Toy Story" is a story for children that adults can enjoy, "The Mascot" It is a dark and spooky tale aimed at adults. That is, NO, your children will not like it. A little. <br /> <br /> Even so, get it if you can. You may be able to find it along with "Vampyr" on DVD and LaserDisc. And prepare to be surprised by what Starewicz could do in 1934 with a pair of puppets.
