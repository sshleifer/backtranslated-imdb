This is a well-directed episode of Columbo, with a good character too, but the story simply does not know enough to interest and does not appear as well in layers and built as it used to be with a Columbo movie. This also applies to the killer's plan to kill his uncle. It is quite simple and does not seem so well thought out. Maybe this movie really was not taken seriously enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least compared to different Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> For example, the film presents a lot of comic relief, mostly from the character of Columbo. It makes the movie enjoyable to watch, but it also gives you the feeling that you have overstepped, also because it does not match most of the other Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> The characters are good and Help that has Martin Landau in a double role. It is always fun to see how different it looked when I was young, while, for example, a person like Peter Falk almost did not change over the years, he just got angry. The film also features Julie Newmar among others, who is best known for playing Catwoman in the "Batman" life action series of the '60s. It's funny how she keeps moving like Catwoman in this movie. Intentional or is it just your way of acting? <br /> <br /> It's a good and nice to see the Columbo movie, but it also gives you the feeling that everything could have been much better with a better-designed script. <br /> <br /> 7/10
