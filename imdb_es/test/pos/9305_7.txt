If you know something about the Manhattan Project, you will find "Fat Man and Little Boy" at least an interesting description of the events surrounding that story. The film is, in all respects, a very realistic representation of these events, and in many ways it is almost too real (like some scenes involving radiation poisoning). Paul Newman, as always, is brilliant in his role and always manages to come out as a real person on the screen. The cast, like John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia and Natasha Richardson, is also pretty good. However, this movie is not one of the best examples of how to turn a real story into a movie. The big movies are able to take a real story and use enough artistic license to keep their audience engaged throughout the film. This, however, tends to crawl a bit, and some scenes (such as the love story of John Cusack and Natasha Richardson) could have been completely eliminated without the film losing much. However, there are enough interesting facts and little bits of humor to at least keep the audience interested enough to see the whole movie. It is not always entertaining, but when it comes to large performances, this is very precise, fascinating and will leave the audience something to think about. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
