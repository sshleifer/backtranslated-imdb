An unusual film, which begins with the classic premise of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him to escape the country. But a turn soon turns the story upside down. Most of the film touches the right buttons: the story unfolds without problems, the acting is solid (the accent of Sienna Miller is priceless, it can really act!), The chemistry between the two main works and rural landscapes Americans and extravagant side characters really make a good time. The mood, which starts out being light and romantic, sometimes becomes something darker and frankly strange. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, although the pace slows down just a little more than we would like, but do not leave it. Make you stop seeing this unusual and small cinematographic gift. Alexandre Montin, Paris
