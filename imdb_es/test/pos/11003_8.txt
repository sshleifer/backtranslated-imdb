An accurate description of Spock of a powerful almighty in whose claws the crew of the Enterprise falls. This was a sector of space that our ship should have avoided: first, Sulu and Kirk simply disappear from the bridge; A landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounters Trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in the garments of an Earth of many past centuries. But it demonstrates the abilities of someone or something beyond the human and does not register in McCoy's medical tricorder. The officers manage to escape back to the ship but, like a bad cosmic penny, Trelane keeps appearing. He brings them all back, including some female company, to continue their games. The dilemma now acquires elements of the 'most dangerous game' in space and there is an exasperating and even exasperating aspect in the total impotence of the crew before such unbridled power. <br /> <br /> What really makes this a great episode is the memorable performance of guest star Campbell as an overwhelming but not omniscient alien. His character is obviously an early version of Q, which was presented 20 years later in the pilot of the TNG series. The confrontational scene of Trelane with Spock stands out among all the strange drama that unfolds. As usual, Kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, despite being quite outdone. The answers to exactly what or who Trelane is right in front of us all the time, so when we learn the truth, it makes a lot of sense in view of Campbell's perfect performance. He is constantly pleased, cuddling before an unknown audience, commenting on things with a style that is contagious but not entirely correct. At first we can not specify it, but something is missing here. Every few minutes, its tone becomes sinister and the crew seems to be in serious danger. In a way, you can not take your eyes off him, always waiting to see what he does next. Actor John de Lancie captured that tone similar to that of Q in the Next Generation series.
