This movie is powerful. I saw this movie at 3:00 a.m. and I was supposed to be at work at 6:00 a.m., needless to say, I was late for work. I could not get out of bed to go to work. This is the most powerful movie I've seen in a long time. And that made me cry and feel the pain of the family. I think Emilo did a wonderful job directing this movie. I agree with previous comments from other points of view that this is the only movie I have seen that has taken the war home and shows what a family had to go through, what a veteran went through. It's almost heartbreaking to think that back then people thought you could go home after a life-changing experience and be the same person you were before you left. Kathy Bates reminded me of my mother somehow. I think it really showed how women felt and acted back then. I'm surprised that this movie has not received more awards.
