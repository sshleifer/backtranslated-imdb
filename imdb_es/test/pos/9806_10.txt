I think, this is a heart flip movie. Richard Donner (He directed the highest-grossing film "Superman"), he had done a great job directing this movie. Some of the segemets were good, and others were horrible because Bobby (Mazzello) was hit by The King (Baldwin, and especially his dog, Shane attacked the King, which meant he paid for what he had done to Bobby. <Br Elijah Wood, played a good role in this movie, the memorable scene of this, dreamed that he took the advice of the buffalo that Bobby was mistreated.Lorraine Bracco, (Pre-Soprano) had played an impressive role. <br /> <br /> I give this movie *** four!
