This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best. <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 reminds me of "West Side Story" with a new twist. Not even the recent movie "Gangs of New York" can be compared to a New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3, which is not plagued by two rival gangs, but by a large gang. A gang that is willing to do things like kill a person with an ax if it enters the set. <br /> <br /> Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays softly in this action-packed film that is full of shooting violence. So, like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III scores with its soft and romantic moments, as well as its violent moments. Only scenes of James Bond's love interest would do much better. <br /> <br /> And, in addition to his .38, Kersee plays with this new weapon called Wildey Magnum .475. It reminded me of Dirty Harry's movies when Callahan used his Magnum .44 on Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry. The Wildey weapon has a big blow and when Kersey kills with him, he does not care if the gun has a big kick. <br /> <br /> And that anti-tank missile that killed the main leader of the gang? Well, that's something. Kersey would not use an anti-tank missile as his regular vigilante weapon ... that's too military for him.
