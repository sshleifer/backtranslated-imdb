I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and I just loved it. <br /> <br /> I saw a review that said something in the sense that the critic thought it would be just another teen movie, but then I discovered that it was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then started to try to justify the taste for this movie in the lands of Shakespeare. I really believe that this goes too far: the only connections I could see with the Twelfth Night are (a) the basic concept of a girl disguised as a man; (b) the extensive masculine-feminine humor that emerges from that basic concept; and (c) some of the names (including Viola and Duke). <br /> <br /> Aside from those names, thematic points in common (a and b) are really cool topics for any script, and the script of this movie is no exception. Beyond that, however, this is a simply charming and very contemporary / traditional teen movie. And that is a perfectly legitimate genre, even if the intellectuals have to find an excuse to like ... how to allude to Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The film is brilliant, fast-paced, emotional, stylized, fun ... Full of teenage hormones and teenage humor and male / female humor for all ages. And that's really the best part, in my humble opinion: in reality, almost all male stereotypes and female stereotypes are represented in an extraordinarily attractive diversion. Those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but with affection, with such complexity of invention that I'm still a bit baffled ... but I'm not really disappointed at all about it, it's not that kind of movie: things attack you. Quick and funny, and you laugh and moan, and then you move on to the next fraction of a second. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes really is a delight like Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful duke; David Cross makes a wonderful gold about the director. All the performances and characterizations were good and on target. The photography was excellent. <br /> <br /> A wonderful entertainment from start to finish ... take a look!
