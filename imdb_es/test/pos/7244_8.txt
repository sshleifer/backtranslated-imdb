As always, Joan Hickson is wonderful as Jane M. Sutil, keen and aware. I do not want to insist on their acting skills, as they are praised enough on this site. I would like to criticize some of the smaller parts, since the rest of the cast seems to have been chosen by director David Tucker. <br /> <br /> The performance of Liz Fraser as Mrs. Bent (the mother of the missing girl Nora) It's a joy to see. Subtle and profoundly moving as the afflicted mother dependent on the alcohol that loves and desperately misses her daughter. A good opportunity for your monologue (thanks Tucker!) So you can enjoy it to the fullest. I was thrilled when I saw it for the first time when it aired and I am moved again, now I have it on DVD. Brava <br /> <br /> Joanna Hole as Madge, the guide, I find it very funny. She is on the verge of acting in excess, but her role can have it. She is SO fun as the organized guide that wants to do good with everyone on the bus, I find it very funny. Your reaction after boarding everyone on the bus is great ... As always: to make the comedy one has to take it very seriously, and that's what Mrs. Hole does. <br /> <br /> I hope that those two ladies have good careers (as I live in Holland, I do not know if they have them, not all theatrical productions can be searched in Google ...): their performances on the screen what they deserve. <br /> <br /> Pieter
