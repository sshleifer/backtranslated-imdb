Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is unjustly accused of sabotaging a hanger that makes warplanes. Keep running, meet Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) on the road, and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice. <br /> <br /> There are many things that are wrong with this movie. Robert Cummings was a good actor, but he is totally wrong in this role; Priscilla Lane is beautiful but she was never a good actress; History does not make much sense (and it rambles more than necessary); He uses his patriotism a little too much (but this was done while World War II was in full swing) and there is no end. It should not work but yes. <br /> <br /> It is full of strange lines and characters that undoubtedly interest you. <br /> <br /> For example: Lane tells Cummings (while they are falling in love), "I wish I had met you a hundred years ago" (???? !!!!); Lane PAY a villain for his lunch and Cummings and Lane briefly join a circus company as they run. Also the direction of Hitchcock was (as always) just great: it throws some really amazing shots and sequences, especially the climax of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <br /> This is not one of Hitchcock's classic films, but it's still very good and worth seeing.
