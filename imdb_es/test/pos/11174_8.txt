Lucasarts has taken another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games. If any additional proof that they govern this genre of games is required, then this is it. Before actually playing the game, there was a small concern about how the writers were going to keep up the jokes after the first two games. The fears abounded and they were going to exhaust a little. <br /> <br /> Play the game and see how quickly those fears dissipate. From the introductory video with Guybrush on the dodgem boat (!), Until the final stages at the fair, the jokes keep coming. I was a big fan of the first two games and the other works of Lucasarts (Day Of The Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc.) and it does not stop offering quality. You will not be disappointed. (Well, I was not).
