Spike Feresten is a comic book genius. 'Talkshow' demonstrates a new vision of the kind of irreverence of strange ball that has made successful programs such as Letterman and The Daily Show. Your sympathy is palpable. It seems that he finds the unique angle of the joke, not the predictable way of the situation comedy ... thank God. His comedy is reminiscent of the award-winning Arrested Development (cross fingers that 'Talkshow' has a longer life). The themes that stand out tend to be those that go unnoticed by everyone else, but when you create a joke around you, you wonder how you missed them the first time. I especially enjoyed the sketches ... "Unfair Target" will be a cult classic in no time. Establish the people of your Tivo ... this is a show that should not be missed.
