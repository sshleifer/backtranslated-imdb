For a long time I did not know about the time I liked this movie or not. This is surprising, because I usually know, but since the movie did not go anywhere, I was a bit confused. <br /> <br /> Two people move to a somewhat communal family environment. Finding their spouses working or moving away constantly on business trips, their attention, out of sheer loneliness, wanders among themselves. After a platonic love story, the male protagonist played by Tony Leung Chiu reveals that he has a lover aside. His Li-Zehn, played by Maggie Cheung, is wounded, even though his love story has not been physically consummated. Chiu leaves the country, only to return years later, when everything has changed. <br /> <br /> On the part of the cynic, the movie is correct. By never touching the love part in an active or real way, but only approaching it, the film undoubtedly says more than many others have on the subject. It is also true, I think, that nothing good could have come if they had had the adventure. At least that's the feeling I have. <br /> <br /> If we want to believe it, however, when Garica Marquez writes that "... love is a state of grace, it is not the means to anything more than the alpha and the omega, an end in itself same ", then this movie sadly remains below this, like all the others. Or, if you are inclined to a completely incomplete minimalism, hit the mark. What films in history have achieved, addressed or sustained this phrase, even if only for a short time? My sincere feeling in my memory is that of two. When Harry Met Sally effectively suggests this romantic perfection; and the get is everything in getting there. It is interesting that in When Harry Met Sally, this is done in the course of wooing, rather than in his achievement. Can no one say something good about love after two individuals have achieved it? Nicholas Spark's recent film, The Notebook, is closer to this perhaps than to any other movie; Should we believe that, once love is achieved, it flies off the radar only to exist in perfection in some other dimension or, perhaps more true, to become a latent vehicle for other purposes? <br /> <br /> In the Mood for Love is an honest film, with a magnificent and generous cinematography worthy in all aspects of the best that Almodovar has to offer, however, all he manages to say at the end is that "Life is sometimes like that." Now, this is not hard to say, especially if it is said well, but the problem really comes at the end of the last act when Kar Wai Wong tries to complete the film by relating, just for the second time, a broader text. Historical theme that plays in the background of the relationship that has just taken place. This is a worthy endeavor, and the variation in the musical motif that is reproduced throughout the film is quite bright, but the relatively sparse accusation of the subject plays very little to have much more than a cursory effect on the audience with a tilt holistic, allowing the viewer to divide. The difference, an error in any movie. A director must know where he is going and how to get there. But in all honesty, it's just a wrong turn. However, as everyone knows, all that is needed is a remarkable imperfection to spoil the perfect barrel of honey. <br /> <br /> However, the effort is definitely worth it; Trying to let a historical theme broaden and round the film and elevate it beyond the micro meaning of the couple, but without any real omen, is the crucial mistake. In a word, and unfortunately, it is too little too late. It is also, I think, too great a challenge for the non-Asian viewer who is not sufficiently familiar with the history of China to fully appreciate this radical coup.
