Recently I had the privilege of seeing what is said to be the last 35 mm sound, Technicolor, stereo and I found it much more alive and moving than I remembered. Also closer to the original material: basically, all the screenwriter N. Richard Nash did was cut back, change the recitative to the spoken dialogue a lot and insert one or two transition scenes (including a very funny one for Pearl Bailey). Oliver Smith's production design is elegant in the adaptation mode "Li'l Abner" - "Guys and Dolls" of the 50s, but works well for the folkloric and unrealistic quality of this work. Stereotypes and racism are present, but not to an indifferent degree. In addition, for a film of his time, it is quite frank: adultery, violent behavior, the use of drugs and the self-destructive habits of the inhabitants of Catfish Row are not minimized at all. But there are debits, starting with all that variation of the text of the stage. The loss of so much compromises the brilliance of Gershwin, it is not surprising that the family does not like it. The reorchestration, especially of Sammy Davis Jr.'s material, is disconcertingly modern and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, friends; You did not have to bother so much with that. And while Poitier and Dandridge perform well and their double singers sing well, there is a great chasm between the voices of the characters who sing and speak: you are constantly aware of the artifice. What really counts here, of course, is music, among the greatest ever written for the theater, anywhere. Despite all the touch-ups, it survives, and you should be made of stone so it does not move you. If the treatment is not entirely to the liking of the farm (and should not be), there is still no reason not to spend a few dollars to restore this ambitious filming of Gershwin's masterpiece and make the new generations more aware of their genius.
