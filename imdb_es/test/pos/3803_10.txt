Although this film never reached commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-made pieces of artistic expression often do not gain massive appeal. The story shows a young man who steals a car and embarks on a dreamy surreal adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who tries to see this movie from the perspective of its conformity with reality will probably be disappointed; It does not pretend to be "realistic". However, it is intended to be metaphorical with a broad apparent symbolism for those with excellent attention to detail. In addition, the symbolic representations are left open for interpretation, which can be said of many excellent works of art. Do not be fooled by the cover (if you rent or buy this movie), the film is not what it might look like on the surface.
