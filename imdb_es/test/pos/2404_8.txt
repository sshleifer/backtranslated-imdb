I like this film because it has a good approach to Buddhism, for example, the way that Buddhists use to take care of all kinds of living beings, combining some luxurious and real situations; In some parts, photography is very good and there are many messages about freedom, like the Hawk episode, always focused on every moment, even in difficult situations. He also has fun situations like Swank's birthday and, talking about this twice, Academy Awards. , her performance shows us how people who tend to live in this kind of culture try to have a resistance behavior when Miyagi takes her to a Buddhist temple and how she is slowly changing her mind. And, of course, Pat Morita has always been great.
