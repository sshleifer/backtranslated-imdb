Somehow, CHANGI was lost in the AFI Awards to MY BROTHER JACK. The latter, a high-quality adaptation of the immortal novel by George Johnston, was outstanding, but, in my opinion, not as good as CHANGI. I have heard that many critics ruled out that CHANGI was irrelevant, unimportant, historically inaccurate or even disrespectful. Who and where are these critics? CHANGI is outstanding. More than that. Sparkly. It is not supposed to be a documentary; I can certainly forgive the survivors of Changi (or even the survivors of a prisoner of war camp) for being disappointed with the production, but for the rest of us, CHANGI represents the remarkable power of companionship in times of extreme adversity. Part of the Australian culture that seems to be declining as times become easier and less challenging, but which we must never forget: Australians were respected throughout the world after Gallipoli and WW2 for their camaraderie and sense of humor. Score: 96/100. See also: GALLIPOLI; PATH OF PARADISE; THE LAST NEWSLETTER; THE SUGAR FACTORY.
