I am very happy that Zac was in 'Life in the Zack and Cody' suite because that is my favorite show and he is my favorite actor. It's a very funny episode and a fun show !! I love everything about the show and the characters. All the artists are great. Zac continues to act, and I am very happy that almost all my favorite actors (including the characters of High School Musical) are in this program. Zac Efron is so 'hot' and I have an autographed photo of him! It is not a photographic copy, it arrived from the United States to Australia and almost did not arrive in time for Christmas. Also, I have a High School musical mug with my name printed on it. (Scarlett 8)
