This episode of Charmed changed everything! The show is about to finish its third season, and all hell is loosing in this episode. The Enchanted bring an Innocent named Dr. Griffiths to the mansion to protect him from Shax, the Fountain Killer. When Shax attacks, he bursts in like a tornado and then becomes a body in his demon skin. He throws Prue a wall that knocks her down completely and practically kills her. Then Piper's bursts threw what's left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the attic and says that the defeat spell before Shax came killed the doctor. But being the Power of the One, it simply hurts him. Leo comes to heal the other sisters and Prue wants to find Shax and really destroy him. Phoebe, meanwhile, is in the underworld trying to find Cole. When Prue and Piper go out to find the demon, the demon finds them. After the battle, the witches realize that a camera caught everything. When they return to Manor trying to fight the media and after defeating Shax, a witch who left Kookoo shoots Piper. Prue uses her telekinesis to keep people away so she can go to the hospital. But they are late and Piper dies. And just as Prue is about to be shot, time goes back to where Dr. Griffiths is taken to the mansion. Shax blows and explodes Prue and Piper. But Phoebe is still in the underworld, so Shax kills the doctor and leaves the mansion. When Leo finally arrives, he can not cure Prue. Prue is dead and so is the Power of Three. For now. Personally. this episode was sad Prue was the strength of them all. I would love to have your power of telekinesis. I really do not think Phoebe should have gone to the Underworld because, if she did not, Shax would not have killed Prue. But Paige returns to join The Power of Three and I am happy with the progress of the program.
