The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' It is known: what should have been another excursion (after 'Twin Peaks') to the rival field of the television series ended abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the footage filmed and cut, and started new shoots to finish a completely new movie. The result: one of the most impressive cinematographic experiences of this decade that can be classified among the best works of David Lynch. His previous films 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet' or 'Wild at Heart' remained distant in an irritating way that pushed the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot that happened as here. <Br /> <br /> 'Mulholland Dr.' It is a puzzle in which pieces are missing, obviously others were taken from 'Eraserhead' and 'Lost Highway', but it never seemed to be an unfinished work. On the internet I found many instructions and essays to explain this movie. I am now aware that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely. All those detailed explanations of solutions are not only a waste, but also the questionable attempt to offer a response where such a thing is not required completely. Imagine this scenario: a small child is dissecting his teddy bear to discover where the secret and specificity of that bear is. Is it because he wants to destroy his toy? Is the secret in the teddy bear or in the child's heart? Transferring this to 'Mulholland Dr.' It means that innocence is one of the most important conditions to observe and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> David Lynch not only manages to imagine the life surface of human behavior, but also deal with everything underneath. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears, everything that is not said; Emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' It has the intensity that requires a cast that has a total problem with the substance. Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the director's views in a disinterested way. Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressive way that they would not want or could not imagine another cast. While his performance at first seems to be a bit superimposed, he will soon realize that this type of stereo is set up for the purpose of manipulating the viewer and disconcerting him as soon as the red thread of the movie is seen. <br /> <br /> When you claim the criteria of a well-made film to be able to get lost and immerse yourself in what you see on the screen, Lynch managed to make a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifests the status of David Lynch as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. Like every filmmaker who goes beyond limits, he faces criticism and ignorance. This will vanish as soon as I find the individual key to the world of Lynch movies. 'Mulholland Dr.' Is it more than a simple sleeper? It is a must for all lovers of ambitious cinema. And, in addition, the film is a reward for Hollywood, in form and content, that in that distinction hardly dared before.
