I am 17 years old and I am a fan of the Muppet, and although I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, The Muppet Movie deserves to be aware of the best. It's hugely entertaining, thanks to Jerry Juhl's quick script, and the movie looks lovely, with some beautifully rendered musical numbers. Speaking of the songs, I really liked them, I'm sure they are not the best score in the Muppet franchise, but they were very nice to listen to, especially Never Before. Never Before is now one of my favorite Muppet songs along with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate. The Muppets as always were fantastic, particularly the always lovely Miss Piggy, and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was great. And what a brilliant human cast: from Bob Hope to Orson Welles, from Madeleine Kahn (the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like What's Up Doc, Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman, from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor, all of whom They made memorable appearances as guests, if you take care not to overshadow the Muppets in a fantastic movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox
