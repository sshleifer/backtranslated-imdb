This is a very dark movie, something better than the average Asylum movie. It was much better than I thought it would be, it's a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The voice on the phone is really creepy: this voice without a face, this unknown and threatening voice works very well in the movie, since we never see that the murderous face is left to the imagination of the spectator. . <br /> <br /> The action and the suspense never decay and after the first half of the film, it becomes vertiginous; There is not much gore in this movie, just enough to serve the story and also the director does a good job to get your attention. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an 8/10 because of some clich√©s.
