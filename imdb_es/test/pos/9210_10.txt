Very reliable entertainment, since Las Vegas has fun, as well as intrigues, is very cheerful and is very reinforced by Josh Duhanel. I like this TV show and I think many people see it as a form of escapist voyeurism ... Voyeurism in this case is very positive, and many women in this series are very nice to see ... This program incorporates Vegas Legends like Wayne Newton as intermittent characters to authenticate the Las Vegas genre. There have been many representations of the city of sin, this is one of the best efforts ... The producers and directors are lucky to have James Caan in the program, since he is a fully accomplished actor. In general, I like the Las Vegas TV show and I see it on Fridays, I also saw it on Mondays, but with Monday Night Football, I could see why NBC changed it on Fridays ... However, I like Las Vegas a lot !!
