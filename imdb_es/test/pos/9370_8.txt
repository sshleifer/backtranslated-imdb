"Crossfire" feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece: it is well acted and beautifully shot, but it is very well written and is too short. As it stands, it's just a decent police procedure with touches of black cinema (at its height in 1947) and social commentary (also fashionable at that time) included to a large extent. Today is remembered as one of the first two Hollywood films to deal with anti-Semitism, and as much better than the "Agreement of gentlemen" of similar theme (it is not a feat). But its real issue is the difficulty that World War II soldiers had, as trained assassins, when they made the transition to civilian life. (For a more elegant version of this theme, try "The best years of our lives"). A man is beaten to death in the first frames of the film. We do not see his attacker. The film is about the investigation of this murder, which is actually quite simple, but it takes some unnecessary detours, like when the main suspect, a depressed soldier, ends up in the apartment of Gloria Grahame, a ballroom prostitute with a pimp rare played by Paul Kelly. There is also a civic conference in the middle of the film that slows down the process and the ending is orderly enough for a police show. But otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery. Still, what a great noir it could have been. The director Edward Dmytryk leaves some indications on the subject of the original novel: homosexuality, not antisemitism, as when the sadistic drag Monty sees the image of his friend Mitch talking to a strange man in a bar. And the cast is excellent. Robert Ryan becomes a very credible cretin, and even becomes a little sympathetic in his final scenes, not unlike Peter Lorre as the child killer in "M". He deserved an Oscar, but lost to Edmund Gwenn that year (you can not beat Santa Claus). Robert Mitchum is available as a soldier friend of the accused killer. Was Mitchum a great actor or a great star? Someone else may realize that, but his sleepy eyes and funny smile work very well here, since they imply that his character knows something that everyone else does not know. (And he does). And Robert Young, as the detective assigned to the murder, is surprisingly stark, dismissing his usual affability even when he has to deliver the civil rights sermon in the middle of the picture. There is no doubt that Bogart or Tracy would have been brilliant in the paper, but none of them was in RKO in 1947, so he will have to deal with Dr. Welby. Still, Young is good enough to make you want someone to have cast him in a detective drama instead of "Father Knows Best," which he hated and that led to alcoholism and suicide attempts. The man deserved something better than Smarm and Sanka.
