Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative films that have been released lately. It was fun, but it also had many moving moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear and the rest of the cast made their incredibly strange characters seem real. The story had such a twist and turn that it made it incredibly nice to watch. If you are fed up with the movies of recent formulas, consult Nurse Betty to see something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or, at least, fix it when it comes out!
