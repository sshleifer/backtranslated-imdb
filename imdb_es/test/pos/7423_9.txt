One of the most slandered and defamed programs of all time, 'Terry & June' was also one of the most popular comedies of the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> He began his life as 'Happy Ever After' But when Eric Merriman decided he did not want to write anymore, it became this, so the fall of "Aunt Lucy" and Fletcher's became Medford's. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was cozy, domestic, middle class; the parcels covered the full range of clich√©s of the boss who came to dinner, the vicar organized a messy sale and unwanted family members who stayed for the weekend. It certainly was not a terrible lazy comedy. As for what was "not smart", it was not meant to be. It was fun and well done, and that was enough! <br /> <br /> I also loved the 'alternative' boom of the '80s (' Spitting Image ',' Black Adder ',' The Young Ones', etc.) but I also enjoyed conventional things like this. If nothing else, he provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to. However, I found it sad when Ben Elton's players faced both Benny Hill and Benny Hill. Well, the family-oriented comedy has almost disappeared from our screens, but where has it left us? Check out the latest television schedules. All soaps and slag reality. The few comedies that remain are aimed at teenagers, which means that they are full of insults, jokes about bodily functions and explicit sexual references. And they are not remotely fun either. <br /> <br /> The rise of the 'alternative comedy' was good in many ways, but it had a dark side. It made conventional sitcoms seem old-fashioned, scared away talented writers and artists like Spike Milligan and, ultimately, led to such indescribable twists as "Little Britain" and "Tittybangbang" (heaven helps us). If it is not broke, do not fix it!
