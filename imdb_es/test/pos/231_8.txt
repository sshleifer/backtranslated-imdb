The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry among the actors, the sense of camaraderie in their dialogues and dances. This typical musical of a rising star has an overworked plot, even for 1944, but due to the actors it is still fun to watch. Hayworth is not such a good dancer, but she has a lot of 'inexperienced' charm that fits her character. Kelly plays his usual authoritative role, while Silvers offers a lot of self-deprecation and laughter. The movie can also be very serious at times. It is not a must, but it is recommended if you like actors.
