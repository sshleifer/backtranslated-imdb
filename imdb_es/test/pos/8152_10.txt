For an independent film, it scores well with reasonably high production values ​​and a great deal. The performance is uneven but the plot is convincing. We could have used a little more the development of Wes Ramsey's character, but hey, the guy is fun to watch anyway! Mary Kay Place and Jacqueline Bisset are like the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that it has been controversial about its release. It presents a less than flattering portrait of the Mormana Church and its relationship with gays. While, like Brokeback Mountain, it's about tolerance and acceptance of one's life, I found that it is more successful in conveying a positive message. It was also more moving.
