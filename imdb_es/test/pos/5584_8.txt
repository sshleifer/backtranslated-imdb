I watched this movie as a child and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. Has survived? I discarded the 1980 version completely as if it were fluff. I am sure there are many who do not believe that it is necessary to preserve these films. It's so unfortunate to discover a lost gem after it's gone. Young people today do not realize the hallucinatory quality and the impact in life of a film that can be seen in early youth and that can have in later life. This movie, "the blue lagoon" had that effect on me. How many of us have wanted to find ourselves in a place far from the fears and chaos of the modern world. This was an idyllic story of a child and a castaway girl on a tropical island. There are problems to be sure, but in the end they fall in love and have a baby. Life must be so simple and beautiful.
