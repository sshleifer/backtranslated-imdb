I like movies that show real "American" people and tell the truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the best thing about it. It played well here in Norway (Amazon says above that it's USA / Canda but the box says "All regions." I have to say it's not for American viewers.) He played here at World Raw Views, a theater. The cut was different and much better, look at it and you'll like it or maybe you'll hate it, we're loving Bush, but this movie is driving you crazy because it makes sense, it annoys and hates, I do not agree with everything in it, But I, at least, support it, it's not for empty minds, it's long and hard to follow, but at second glance it makes more sense, I loved Owen's words and the poem made me cry.
