If vampire tales are your cup of blood, this Gothic festival based on Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles should be a satisfying experience. A true consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting, 'Queen of the Damned', directed by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and of the unfortunate souls who dwell in it for all eternity. <br /> <br /> The vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored with a world that no longer excites him, has been "asleep" for many years; but suddenly, the sounds of that world that he listens to from his vast dream change and, as he likes what he hears, he ventures to investigate. What he finds is a world full of new sounds, a new kind of music, driving and penetration, sounds that assail the senses and make him feel alive and welcome. And he knows that his moment has finally come, that it's time for him and those like him to go out and face the world on their own terms. To that end, he becomes the leader of a band, a singer and an interpreter like no other who has known the world. He introduces himself as a vampire, and quickly accumulates a following that extends far beyond London (where it all starts), and finally takes him to Death Valley, California, where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond Whatever. Have you ever seen or experienced. <br /> <br /> Lestat is powerful, no doubt, but there are some of his kind who are not favorable to the fact that he has revealed them, one of which is Marius (Vincent Perez), a powerful vampire by right own, the vampire, in fact, who "made" Lestat so many years before ... and they are meeting, meeting and making plans to meet Lestat at the concert. And they do not go for the music. But there is also something else: in a moment, Lestat has inadvertently awakened the "Mother" of all, the most powerful of all the vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who is about to make his presence known to all, and especially which she has chosen to rule at her side as her King: Lestat. And at the concert, rest assured that Akasha will be present without fail. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this is the story of Lestat, and Rymer presents it in an environment rich in atmosphere and with some exquisite moments. although his film is less willing to say it than "Interview with the vampire" or "Dracula of Bram Stoker". He sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide real emotions, but in general, the movie is not as steeped in threat as it could be, or as much as one might expect. In the final count, in fact, the amount of meat that is incinerated wins over the actual bleeding, although there is more than a taste of blood and more than a good amount of lips and mouths that drip with red matter. There is also a good F / X in the hand, especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires, as they move and launch themselves through the air faster than the naked eye can discern. It's a decent job for Rymer, but he could have put in more teeth if he had played with the alienation hinted at by Lestat; As it is, you realize your detachment, but not enough to get totally involved. <br /> <br /> In `Interview with the vampire, 'Tom Cruise brought a charismatic star power to the role of Lestat, but Townsend is even more effective, with an appearance and an attitude that captures Lestat perfectly. He plays it with a sense of acceptance, and upon further examination, he may even find a hint of remorse and longing. It's a good performance, and one that sells your character convincingly. <br /> <br /> Like Marius, Vincent Perez also does a good job: it is, in fact, one of the film's strengths, although His character is a bit ambiguous; that, however, has more to do with the way it was written than with Perez's performance, which is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Marguerite Moreau also stands out, like Jesse, a young woman who is too curious for her own good; and the beautiful Lena Olin as Maharet, Jesse's aunt, who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving Lestat and Akasha. <br /> <br /> And like Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolutely fascinating presence. What else can be said about her besides being a talented artist, with tremendous talent and beauty? And, tragically, it has left us too soon. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudy) With a much stronger story than the usual offers of this genre in particular, Anne Rice fans, especially, will be delighted with 'Queen of the Damned', a very well designed film delivered by the director Rymer and his attractive cast. By focusing on the drama of the story, and the way it is presented, instead of simply focusing on offering cheap emotions, Rymer has managed to produce a true horror movie that is definitely superior, and one that can Awake appetite for more of the same. And that is the magic of cinema. I qualify this 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
