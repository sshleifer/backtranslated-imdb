I also found that "Oppenheimer" is a brilliant series and one of the best deals in the history of the American PBS. David Suchet was particularly effective as Edward Teller, as I recall, and the overall conception was spectacularly good. The only reason why the series does not qualify a full 10/10 is because of the low budget production values ​​in some areas. The real content is absolutely top-notch in my memory. <br /> <br /> The Oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the UK on July 31! It will be a Region 2 / PAL set, but it would seem that a Region 1 / NTSC set should be ready soon. <br /> <br /> If you have a universal player in the USA. UU., You can request the series right now from Amazon United Kingdom. <br /> <br /> http://tinyurl.com/znyyq <br /> <br /> Huzzah !!
