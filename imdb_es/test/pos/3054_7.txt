From the vehicle "Ex-Lady" by Bette Davis, in 1933, I have not seen a movie that was much better than his star said! Most rap of "Atoll K", a.k.a. "Utopia", a.k.a. "Robinson Crusoeland", a.k.a. "Escapade" has recovered over the years from the horror stories that Stan Laurel told about his production. Since she suffered a stroke during filming, it seemed that death had heated up for much of her (from the initial two shots of them together Laurel would never be supposed to have survived Hardy for eight years) and subsequently she was diagnosed with diabetes ( once he adjusted his diet according to the fact that he regained health), one can understand why Laurel did not think this movie was the most enjoyable experience of her life. Yes, it has flaws: the cheapness of the production is seen, the dubbing is horrible and Laurel and Hardy were too old to make the energetic slapstick of their best films. But it's still genuinely fun, and LÃ©o Joannon's story presents elements of political satire (sometimes libertarian, sometimes communal) that one would expect to see from more socially conscious comedians like Chaplin or the Marx Brothers, but never from Laurel and Hardy. The film deserves credit for being different (although its debt to the classic "Passport to Pimlico" of Ealing Studios, made a year before, is quite obvious) and to integrate the comedy of Laurel and Hardy in a quite different context altogether. They had used it before. This is not a great movie, but it's certainly better than the sad eight for Fox and MGM that they made in the early 1940s. I suspect that only the technical rawness of the film prevented it from winning the cult among young people from the boom of babies who had taken "Duck Soup" from the Marx Brothers and who acquired it in the late 60s and early 70s.
