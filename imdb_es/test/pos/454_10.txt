A great movie, with an unclear political message. It is filmed in a theatrical style, i.c. Most of the action takes place inside. Mayor Surov and Diana Ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other. Emotions are high, as tourists and Western businessmen seem unwilling and unable to give in to the Oriental-Russian charm of the mayor, although he does his best to understand his point of view. The two opposing world views are clearly clarified, but the film also shows that human emotions can not be controlled by politics. Its powerful action and has a high emotional impact for a movie of the 50s.
