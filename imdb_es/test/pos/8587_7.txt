In the film, Lumumba, we see the faces behind the monumental change in Congo's history after being claimed by the Belgians, and we see the motives behind those men in whose hands the raped and hungry country fell. <br /> <br /> Lumumba is not a movie for hyper mass; it demands the attention of its spectators with a raw, truthful performance and a complex and full dialogue. Little of the main plot is shown through the action, is based almost exclusively on words, but there is a recurring thread that is only action, and it is the stroke of genius what makes the film an enlightening and powerful panorama of the tense political struggle that The independence of the Congo gave birth. <br /> <br /> This movie is real. It is crude in its description of those in power, and those in the streets. It is revealing in its content. And it is moving in the passions and emotions of its magnificently portrayed characters. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a history buff, a movie buff, or just like good stories, Lumumba is a must-see.
