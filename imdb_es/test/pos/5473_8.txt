Seriously, any movie with John Malkovich is usually very good. And this includes Clint Eastwood, Rene Russo, John Mahoney (Frasier), Dylan McDermott (The Practice) and many other great actors. <br /> <br /> Clint is aging now, but thank you, he is also an incredible director (in his own right). <br /> <br /> We are used to Wolfgang's "water films" like Das Boot, Poseidon and Perfect Storm; this was really different, but in a way as sublime as has been said. <br /> <br /> The premise of the murderer is as serious as it seems, the film has a good rhythm, part of the violence is a bit ... But in general it is recommended (but not for children).
