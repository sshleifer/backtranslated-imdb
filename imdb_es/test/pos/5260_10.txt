People who do not like this movie seem to have some academic revenge against them, those of us who do not have the original can fully enjoy it. <br /> <br /> My husband, who had never seen the original said "I do not want to see a girl movie". I assured him that "women" is just a great movie, not a movie for girls. We had a great time. I was very happy to have gone and enjoyed more than the "boys" movie we saw the day before "burn after reading". <br /> <br /> SPOILER: I even think that the new ending is better. Maybe not so fun, but it was beautiful. At first I did not understand why they had made certain changes in the plot <br /> <br /> but when I got to the end and Debra Messing gives birth and brings the first man to the film, I cried. Is that a thing that men love? they are our children
