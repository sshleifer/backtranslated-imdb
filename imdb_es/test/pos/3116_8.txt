The performances of the male leaders make this long and hard trip to the west interesting at all times. The soundtrack of the Children of the Pioneers is one of the most beautiful I've heard. The trip itself is episodic, and Joanne Dru is very ill. In general, this is a very comforting and sincere Westerner.
