Martial arts films became big in the 60s in parts of Asia, but with the growing popularity of the famous films of Shaw Brothers, the United States was forced to capture. This film was the first to be presented in the United States under the Warner Bros. label. And in fact, a madness began here that flooded the 70s with martial arts films. Many of the films to follow were going to pale in comparison, but some were great and many as Enter The Dragon (which came out shortly after this) became great success stories and made superstars of these fighters. <br /> <br /> Fast Forward almost 40 years later and this movie still stands. Most of the Shaw brothers' films are as good today as they were back then and, truth be told, no films in this genre have been made to compete with those made by The Shaw Bros in the past. <br /> <br /> I like it Think that martial arts are like porn and nobody sees pornography because of the plot, only the action, the same happens with MA films and most of them are just a lot of big ones fights with a little story, this is an exception. It does not have an incredible story, but there is one there. <br /> <br /> The main boy played by Lo Lieh actually stands out among the heroes of the karate movie. He never brags and never fights just because he can, he is often seen as weak and less fighter than most, but when he has to fight, he is the biggest alive. I really loved this character. Many of the bad guys were memorable and the fight scenes were presented so incredibly. Even a small role with Bolo Yeung can be seen as the great Mongol, and Bolo is in my top 5 as the best movie stars of martial artists, was also in the aforementioned The Enter of the Dragon. <br /> <br /> The production, as I said again and again, is wonderful, you can not beat the Shaw, the direction was something different from what I've seen in the movies of the 70s, the use The color was well placed and made this film stand alone. above the others. When the light shines in the hands of Chi Hao while he makes the Iron Fist, his beauty is pure. <br /> <br /> The music was also excellent. Martial arts films were for Asia what Westerns were for Italy, two separate art forms with much in common. The countries that made these films had all genres, but Japanese films were what made waves there, like the spaghetti westerns in Italy. With their many differences the styles of these two genera were neck and neck. As it was seen in films like 5 Fingers Of Death, the fights were easily compared with the shots of the cowboy Sergia Leoni, and the music united the genres very well. The music here took a bit of Ironside, but it was still very original. <br /> <br /> Many of the films were inspired by this and when I see it I can see everything from The Master Killer to Bloodsport, which has been influenced. Kill Bill is the most obvious film that has been influenced, which for me is the best of all time. Many of the sets that Quentin used are full replicas of those seen here and he used the music of this film, even though the music he used was the music borrowed from Ironside. And the scene of the fight at the end of Kill Bill vol. 1 with The Bride and O-Ren is sometimes exact compared to the fight with Chi Hao and the Japanese bully at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen many martial arts movies, some even better, but this is a must for fans of the genre. You can not go wrong here. The film starts slowly, but in 15-20 minutes it resumes and does not slow down.
