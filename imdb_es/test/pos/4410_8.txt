I was delighted to see this gem of a movie available on DVD. Despite being a 'TV Movie' and filmed on 16 mm, it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a 'London taxi driver', along with their family weaknesses and commitments. Even the most unfortunate of the candidates, 'Titanic' with his uncommunicative wife, it was possible to see how Jack Rosenthal was able to make a fragment of London life often funny and sometimes tragic in an entertaining 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Originally released as a vehicle for Mick Ford (intentional pun), the acting quality of a cast that includes Michael Elphic, Nigel Hawthorne, Jonathan Lynn, Lesley Joseph and Maureen Lipman (the Ms. Rosenthal) meant that Mick could have had the highest reputation. but he had to work hard against such competent talents. <br /> <br /> Even 15 years after its launch in 1991, it's still as fresh as ever!
