This movie was amazing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary, and the performance spectacular. At first I thought that this was not going to be so good because of a summary, but after the first five or ten minutes of the movie, I realized that I was wrong. Literally, I cried four or five times in this movie and, despite this, I must have seen the same scenes again and again about thirty times in a week! No, the scenes of the songs were not as impressive as they could have been, but the plot is what really catches you. American or Asain, I would recommend this to anyone, and I have done it now. I guarantee that after seeing this, you will get the best of him and his plot. I hope you feel the same, and write a very complimentary review too!
