This is James Cagney: jokes, arrogance, hard as nails and senseless charisma. <br /> <br /> Although the plot sounds serious, the movie is not for nothing. It is performed in the comedic style of screwdrivers of the 30s and works well with his "disputes" with the fianc√© Mae Clark and his reactions to the stories of his colleague James Burke. <br /> <br /> What raises it above normal is dialogue. and the cast that delivers it. The dialogue is good, but it is nothing unless the delivery is correct and can bounce over the characters involved. This is done well by everyone. <br /> <br /> Good entertainment and very nice.
