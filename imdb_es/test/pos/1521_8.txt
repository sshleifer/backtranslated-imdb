Closet Land is an incredible and terrifying piece of cinema. It has only two actors in a single set, but it never loses its attention. The design of the stage is imaginative and disturbing, the staging of the scenes maintains its attention, while adding to its own sense of confusion and terror. The performance is outstanding, since Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe have the duty to carry out all the scenes. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was in 1991, shortly after it came out on video. He did not play in the theaters where he lived; Not surprising, given its political content. Although it should be seen. It presents a brilliant staging of the techniques of torture and interrogation used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience in their citizens. The country never has a name, which makes it even more surprising. It could be anywhere; East, West, 3rd World, 1st World. Illustrate what happens when a small group of people decides what is best for everyone; when the government becomes the ruler of the citizens, instead of the maid. <br /> <br /> Madeleine Stowe is a children's author who was taken from her bed at night and subjected to terror and torture. He is in a room with Alan Rickman, an apparently nice official. At first it seems like a horrible mistake and she is free to leave; but, fear makes it stay and terror increases. She is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture. The interrogator uses sensory deprivation, temporary manipulation, confusion, auditory manipulation, role play and twisted logic to destroy the author. She is humiliated and dazed, forced to endure excruciating body positions, deprived of food and water. <br /> <br /> In spite of everything, he refuses to surrender; to do what the interrogator asks. They tell him that everything will end if he only signs a confession. A simple little act. She refuses. Through all this, it uses defense mechanisms that have been developed since childhood. Little by little it is revealed that she was the victim of child sexual abuse. To survive, she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would take her away from abuse. These mechanisms allow him to transcend his torture and turn tables over his interrogator. She begins to attack her own beliefs and profession, forcing him to examine her own life and motives. In the end, she is free, because she maintains the freedom of thought. The interrogator is the one caught by the state. <br /> <br /> This film was made during the height of the Cold War, Apartheid, and at a time when the crimes of many governments around the world made daily news. It is even more timely in a world where "enemy combatants" are held and interrogated in secret prisons, denied legal rights or lawyers; where "ethnic cleansing" wastes entire societies and refuses humanitarian aid. It shows that the individual can face the state or another oppressor by refusing to give in to fear and terror.
