For all intents and purposes, 'Teen Devian' might seem like just another light Bollywood musical. To a certain extent, this could be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film was successful with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, Sadashiv Brahmam (who had the "idea" of this story) or Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that the usual formula would take a turn and succeeded perhaps even beyond their own expectations. br /> <br /> It is not simply a handsome man who flirts with 3 women, indecisive about whom to choose as a companion in his life. The character of Dev Anand was really in love with each of the 3 women on several occasions, and they with him, despite being aware of the other two. Dev Anand's relationship with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting, as each of the women depends heavily on him. There are a lot of suggestive suggestions in the body language of the stars that lend themselves to the imagination depending on the maturity of the viewer. The subject is surprisingly adult and, after all, it was a pity that the ending was docile, obviously designed to please the masses and deflect criticism.
