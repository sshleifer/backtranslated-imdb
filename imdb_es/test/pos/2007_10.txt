Drawn by Pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema I've seen in my life. Here are my reviews of the episodes released so far: <br /> <br /> Episode one was even better than I expected and from everything I had heard, I expected a lot. I am very impressed with the actors already. The father was creepy and played perfectly. The girl is so expressive that she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. The animation was excellent. The cinematography was incredible, every angle of the camera perfectly captured the sensation of the scene. The editing was done so well, each scene merged perfectly with the next. The music captured the emotions quite well and took you to the story. I just can not say enough about how wonderful this episode was. It definitely whets my appetite for more! <br /> <br /> Episode 2 was even better than the first one! Everything I said about the first episode continues, only you can see even more the development of the character. I can not wait to finally see episode 3, or the rest of the series. What is unfolding is an intriguing story inspired by the characters, with all the trappings of a great Hollywood production, but without pretense. It says a lot, with so few words. This series is something you've never seen and you've become a real success. <br /> <br /> This episode was INCREDIBLY AWESOME! There are no other words that describe it! WOOHOO! Everything I have said about the previous episodes is valid for this one, and even so it was even better! I do not know how you manage to take something amazing and make it even better! The additional development of the character shows that this is a piece completely driven by the character. Cinematography stands out as it has always done and introduces you to Emily's pain, fear, hatred and emotional roller coaster. I can not wait to see Episode 4 ... or the rest of the series. You really have surpassed yourself! <br /> <br /> As much as I've loved the other episodes, episode 4 is the best so far. I love the progression of the character. I feel that we are really getting to know Emily, her pain and her inner struggle. The other issues that I have indicated in previous reviews continue. GREAT cinematography, the writing is excellent, the actors are right with their representations and have made the characters theirs, and the animation is simply amazing! Another great job of the crew of the DbP!
