The film can certainly be a narrative medium, but it is by no means the ideal medium. Literature carries a plot better, because the reader can supply the necessary imagination to complete the structure. The film is best appreciated when it is seen for what it is: a series of grouped images. What Soderbergh does in Ocean's Twelve is to combine an impeccable cinematographic technique with the fluid form of American films of the seventies. After seeing the comments recently published, most people expected a movie to steal a standard problem, to the Entrapment; It seems that people really miss the tedious clich√©s of romance disguised as tension between the drivers and the ridiculous twists of the plot designed to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh's directing ability is just one reason to watch this movie, but the close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones, who are forty feet tall on the screen, do not hurt either. A real pleasure for those who love the flickering of lights on the silver screen, and a disappointment for those who try to do something that is not the movie.
