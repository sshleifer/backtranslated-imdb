It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a blow to the careers of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure, but it's not up to the standards of the actors, especially Robert. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and presents some small roles of guys like William Shatner and Mos Def. <br /> <br /> Showtime is about two very different policemen, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low and quiet profile, while the other is simpler and wants to have more fun than the criminals in their backseat. Both are behind the same criminals behind a great race of televisions, video recorders, etc. Then they cross paths and a television station wants a new reality TV show, so they fight crime while on television. Mitch hates advertising, while Trey loves her with his phrase "It's Showtime!" His antics and television methods are shown on television and are the new program "Cops". The fun begins. <br /> <br /> In general, Showtime is a funny action comedy. A good movie, but not quite up to the expectations and standards of the actors. However, it progresses as you step on and parody reality TV shows. A good break from shows like Cops. Truly in the end, just a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
