America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every way. She has a great hostess, has excellent guests, a great production and some of the best modeling professionals in the world who contribute something they have not yet achieved: present a true Top Model of the United States. Of course, this is not an easy thing to do, therefore, EE. UU And the world would already have 10 main models competing and fighting each other in this cruel world. <br /> <br /> But it is obvious that his intention is not to present the next top model of America, but yes, the Next Pop Model of America. The show brings together a group of models without any experience with different personalities and great personal, professional and financial problems, giving them the opportunity to make a dream come true or make their lives worthy. It is obvious that Tyra Banks uses all that for her benefit, she gives the dream, but in exchange for that she gains audience and more popularity. Anyway, he deserves it, because he's smart and, if I can say it, a pioneer in this kind of shows. Tyra is also a great observer and knows how to give opinions based, differentiating herself from other models and hostess of foreign versions of the NEXT TOP MODEL franchise. In Brazil, by way of example, Fernanda Motta is your host and model of "once in a while". She does not even have 1/10 of Tyra's professional skills, which keeps Tyra Banks on top. Tyra has professional and personal knowledge about what she says and is a great mentor because she not only criticizes, but also points out the error and teaches with wisdom. <br /> <br /> The program does not suffer big problems. , it fulfills and fulfills what it promises during the cycles. The models chosen to work on the program, in fact, are not the best unknown models in the whole country because Tyra Banks is betting on the difference, and she is right, because she (and also a good part of her audience) believes that it is time to Model World to change some straight parameters. During the cycles, she and her team really do fair deliberations, where the weakest disappear and the promising ones have new opportunities to demonstrate their abilities, but they must be quick to do so, otherwise they lose it. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting thing is that Tyra also knows who should win or who does not, even when it is against the opinion of the people. She knows that whoever wins will be famous, but has very little chance of being a world-renowned top model. Similarly, she knows that, sometimes, the second place is more valuable than the first, because the first place wins the title, but the second does not get the stigma of the title. Almost does not make mistakes when deciding the future of any model during the show. <br /> <br /> After 9 cycles, the show is getting a little tired with some old ideas, it's time for Tyra to change some things and lines because it's getting boring and compared to the first cycles, we can see that she is also getting bored, so she has to do it if she wants the program to live a little longer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the program explores fashion and modeling the world, but it is also entertaining for those who live outside of all that. It provides the opportunity for some girls and also for the market, and also provides excellent advice for those of the audience who share the same dream.
