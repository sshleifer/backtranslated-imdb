During the last century, there have been many advances in gender equality, but not so much in the world of cinema. I'm not talking about what happens behind the camera, I mean the tastes of the audience. The idea of ​​a "movie for girls" is alive and well today, while there are still many action and horror films that appeal mainly to men. Sure, there are men and women who enjoy movies that are outside their typical demographics, but there are not many movies that have attractions in all areas. Hitch, the last vehicle of Will Smith tries to change that tendency to be a film for girls that throws a dose of male perspective. <br /> <br /> Smith plays Hitch as the title character, Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a "Medical Date" that trains men on how to approach a woman and have a successful appointment. Hitch enjoys his work and loves to see men successfully achieve the goals of dating the woman of his dreams, but due to a bad experience in college, Hitch himself is somewhat overshadowed by the idea of ​​love. As the story unfolds, the film presents two apparently separate story lines. The last case of Hitch is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), an accountant who feels very attracted by one of his clients, the beautiful heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Hitch has his doubts about Albert's possibilities, but if the wishes of his clients seem sincere, Hitch supports them. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hitch meets gossip columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) and is attracted to this strong woman. However, the date on which the doctor seems not to follow his own advice to persecute Sara. Things get even more complicated when Sara's work leads her to investigate the relationship between the accountant and the heiress. Can Hitch balance his private life and his work? And most importantly, can Hitch ever believe in love again? If you are a true movie fan, then there has been at least once in your life when you have complained about the redundancy of the Hollywood movie factory and have asked for something new and original. Well, Hitch is not that movie. But, most movie fans will also admit that occasionally a formula movie can only work at one level of entertainment. Hitch qualifies as that movie.
