I know that Chill Wills usually played old adorable guys in westerns. But his role in this segment is something that I have remembered for a long time. The testaments could be a first class villain. Yes, the Fall of Burgess Meredith was correct! That look in Hepplewhite's eye! He expressed pork greed, ignorance and the threat of violence at the same time. I think it's a good performance. <br /> <br /> The segment itself was also good. Question: Could not the small black bag cure alcoholism? I guess he did it, more or less, with autumn. But the doctor would have been prudent to apply the cure, if he had had it, as quickly as possible to Hepplewhite. <br /> <br /> There is a moment that was annoying but also necessary. And it's something that seems to repeat itself in these segments of the Night Gallery. It's Serling's constant need to lecture. Because that's what we have, once again, with Dr. Fall. I do not know what was more frustrating, losing the black bag and all its miracles or not preventing Fall from preaching about the benefit of the stock market for humanity, while rubbing the greedy face of Hepplewhite in the mud and, therefore, everything but pleading for Hepplewhite to hit him. But as I say, it was necessary. At least it was for me. Otherwise, we would not have been able to see the performance of Wills described above. All done without moving a muscle or saying a word.
