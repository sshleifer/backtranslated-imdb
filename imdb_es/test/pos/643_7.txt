This may be the most stressful movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's so stressful that I have not been able to see it again after seeing it two years ago, but I'll do it since I have the DVD. There were a couple of scenes here that are almost too much to see ... so if you have problems and you need to "escape" for an hour and a half, this movie will take anything else out of your mind. <br /> <br /> Russian actress Marina Zudina did an excellent job just with facial expressions, which she had to do since her character here is a mute. She plays a cute and healthy makeup artist for a shoddy filmmaker. After finishing the filming of the day and "Billie" is about to leave, she hears something. Take a look at the room where they were filming and discover that they are now filming a "snuff film" and are actually killing someone. Billie's listening is discovered and she runs for her life while the murderers look for her in this large warehouse-type building. <br /> <br /> There are two extended scenes in which our heroine runs for her life and both of them will exhaust you The first one I described earlier. The second scene, the climatic, lasts too long and is not as well made as the first. In fact, the movie should have been cut out a bit, but in general, since it is very good at keeping our attention, then it fulfilled its entertainment function.
