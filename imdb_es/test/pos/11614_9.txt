Karim Hussain's masterpiece of art / blood: this cat is definitely a talent to which he must pay attention. We have in this several longer vignettes interspersed with some shorter segments. This is a very powerful film that is based on its intense graphic images and its symbolism, and is not for all viewers. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a short film called OVARIAN EYEBALL. Very short segment that has a naked woman placed on a table naked. The hand of an invisible woman covers the face of the supine woman with a red cloth and makes an incision in her abdomen from which a stem of the eyeball is extracted. I do not have much to comment on this because of its brevity. <br /> <br /> HUMAN LARVAE is one of the films of Lynchpins and is a totally inflexible portrait of a perverse act committed by a disturbed man who has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister. This is one of those "you have to see it to believe it" type things. I will say that this movie has some of the best effects I've seen in an independent horror movie, but the theme will make this an undesirably unpleasant experience for most (though I do not, I live for this!). <Br /> <br /> The RENAISSANCE could have been removed from this movie all together. This is the weakest segment of the movie and it has a group of naked people who make bloody holes in a field and all that. Very short, but this kind of hits the impulse of the movie. <br /> <br /> BRAIN RIGHT / MARTYRDOM is one of the most profane representations of religious images that I have seen in my life and it gives me a beating. Think of "P is Christ" or menstrual blood paintings of the Virgin Mary. The sexually violent / bloody / very difficult images are presented in this piece and it is definitely not for anyone who feels offended by the sacrilege. <br /> <br /> Subliminal cruelty is one of the best movies I've seen in history. banner of extreme horror, it will be a very divisive film between terror fans and the general public. Some will call it garbage, others will call it brilliant. I do not see much middle ground. I thought this movie was quite original and I would recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try it. 9/10.
