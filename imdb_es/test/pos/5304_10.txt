The magic of Hayao Miyazaki continues with this complacent public Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated film, which lights the usual sweetness to enchant your socks. I thought the trailer featured his song that was quietly hypnotic, and I did not have to wait for an invitation to make sure I got my ticket for the preview of the movie, scheduled to open here next week. <br /> <br /> For fans of Studio Ghibli movies, you'll probably know what you're in, since Miyazaki has another winner in his filmography, which will win over new fans. I am ashamed to say the least that until now I have seen only My Neighbor Totoro (eyes of that pile of DVD of Ghibli) and I love it, but I believe that this would serve as a final push so that I do not keep losing what are probably animated movies what I would enjoy <br /> <br /> Ponyo (with the voice of Nara Yuria) is a magical golden fish that yearns to know what life is beyond the sea, with its constant forays into a bubble to the surface of the water to take a look . However, these ambitions do not bode well for his humanoid father Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who also feels a certain hatred towards the human race for pollution, and also briefly touches on a secondary argument about the protection / environmental revenge of Mother Nature. as well. In an accident, one day Ponyo is seen being dragged to the shore, and picked up by a five-year-old boy, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) who lives in a house on the cliff with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while the Father Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mostly offshore since he is a sailor. And you can expect some backward moments to likes of The Little Mermaid or Splash for kids. Saying something else would ruin the fun. <br /> <br /> The illustration here is simply amazing even though it is in 2D glory, knowing that each cell is painstakingly worked. There are so many things happening at the same time within the same frame, that it will probably be a game for repeated visits only to detect them all. This definitely outperforms any animated 3D or CG production any day, given its beauty stemming from its simplicity, and not only from the art department, but also from its history, despite complaints that it took a sheet from Hans' classic Christian Andersen. While there are ways to make this film extremely dark, he only suggested certain dark themes, but opted for a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both children and adults. <br /> <br /> At its core, it's about love, that among the members of Koichi's family, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. Moreover, it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish that he named Ponyo, and I tell you that she herself has enough tenderness to beat people like Bolt, WallE and Eve. The characterization here is first rate, and it is difficult not to fall in love with Ponyo, regardless of the form he takes, especially when he is such a playful being that he does not hide his emotions. If she is upset with you, either she turns around or you can Wait for a stream of water to flow from your mouth to your face! <br /> <br /> Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a definitive shoo-in for my best films this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I'm sure I'll go to the Ghibli Museum to enjoy the magical world that Hayao Miyazaki offers us. Highly recommended film, so do not miss this on the big screen!
