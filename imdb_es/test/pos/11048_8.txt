This movie is worth it despite what I can hear. The performance of Marie Dressler (I hope she is spelling it right) like an old drunk is enough reason to see this movie. It is an incredible performance. She is in a drunken stupor in three scenes for a long time and never does the same thing twice. You can really smell the alcohol when it ends. Amazing. And Greta, of course, speaks her first lines in the movie and it's great. The story of Eugene O'Neill is solid and, like most of O'Neill's stories, it is very deep and intense. This is not light entertainment, but if you appreciate those great actors from the 30s and 40s, you will like them. Part of the film is technically confusing, but overall it's worth it.
