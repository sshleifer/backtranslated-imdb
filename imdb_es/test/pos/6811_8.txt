The first in a new style of films for Lamas: without tattoos, motorcycles or karate. I, at least, miss them. But this is a serious movie. He plays an FBI profiler who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone, including himself. Gary Busey is a great actor or someone I would not like to meet in broad daylight on a busy street. Kristen Cloke pursues Lamas as stubbornly as she pursues the serial killer. There is one surprise after another, since the story unfolds, not the least the end. It seems that it never arrives, there is always one more layer in history. Cloke and Lamas begin as good guys, become bad guys and somehow end up becoming heroes. But it is definitely worth the rental price. To enjoy it to the fullest, place it in a chocolate bar, a bag of popcorn and a soft drink. You go to the MOVIES!
