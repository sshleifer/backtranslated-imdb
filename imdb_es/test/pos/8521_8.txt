As the 70s drew to an end, rumors began circulating in the entertainment industry about the possible return of Sean Connery to the role he had made famous in 1962: James Bond. <br /> <br /> Cubby Broccoli was asked at the Brazil venue during the making of 'Moonraker' by Barry Norman of the BBC how he saw the prospect. Understandably, the producer was reluctant to commit to an opinion. <br /> <br /> When 'Moonraker' was opened, Bond fans were outraged by what they perceived as a rebuttal of the character, and the jump to the 'Star Wars chariot as much as' Live & Let Die 'I had finished with the blaxploitation craze a few years before. Many publicly published their hope that Connery would return, if only to show Eon how a Bond movie should look. <br /> <br /> Years of legal battles followed. The original script, titled 'James Bond Of The Secret Service' (later renamed 'Warhead') was written by Kevin McClory, Len Deighton and Connery, was never filmed, and remains one of the blockbusters of films not made. <br /> <br /> A new script was commissioned, closer to the story of 'Thunderball'. It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior, better known as the man who put the camp in 'Batman'. He had also written 'The Parallax View', one of the best conspiracy thrillers of the decade. Feeling that the script needed a British twist, Connery brought Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, writers of the hit British comedies "The Likely Lads" and "Porridge." The ingenious title was suggested by Connery's wife, Micheline. <br /> <br /> 'Never Say Never Again' opened just before Christmas 1983 in a shower of critical acclaim; Normally, sensible critics were so enthusiastic about Connery's return that they ignored all other aspects of the film. Many used it to brutally attack the Roger Moore series, particularly the 'Octopussy' that year. In truth, 'Octopussy' is superior in all aspects. 'Never' lacks the emotion and the spectacle that one associates with Bond, sometimes it seems like a fact for TV. movie. The story had been done before and better in 'Thunderball' in 1965, so 'Never' would always come in second. He was also hampered for not being part of the official series, which means that the "James Bond theme" by Monty Norman and the Maurice Binder cannon logo could not be used. <br /> <br /> Like Bond, Connery is magnificent, and moves back effortlessly to his most famous role. Playing Bond as a greater and wiser agent worked. Barbara Carrera got her best film role as the villain 'Fatima Blush', a lady whose love for murder is such that she dances after (so she believes) killing Bond. Kim Basinger smells like 'Domino'. As S.P.E.C.T.R.E. The agent 'Maximillian Largo', Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a chilling performance. However, a big disappointment is Max Von Sydow as 'Blofeld'. The posters gave the impression that he would be an important character, in fact, he appears only in some scenes. With a more solid script, he could have been one of Bond's greatest villains of all time. <br /> <br /> 'Never' promised to be a throwback to the first Eon Bonds as 'From Russia With Love', but it was not fulfilled. The gadgets were there, but they were used almost as an apology. Bond's rocket motorcycle was a tired trick even in the 60s. The film tried to compete with Eon's Bonds in terms of humor. Bond, who saves himself by throwing his own urine sample in the face of a murderer, is a farcical moment like the one you'll find in 'Moonraker'. But the nadir comes with the introduction of Rowan Atkinson as the awkward official of the Foreign Office 'Nigel Small-Fawcett'. It gives such an amazingly horrible performance that you wonder if you thought you were in a Footlights magazine. <br /> <br /> The music of Michel Legrand is horrible, the man seems to have never seen a Bond movie in his life. <br /> <br /> Although the film was a financial success, seen years later, it stands as the weakest Bond of the 80s. Connery himself was disappointed and did not act in a movie again for some years. <br /> <br /> 1983 was a good year for the 007 mania, in addition to the films of Connery and Moore, George Lazenby made a delight. Cameo on television made 'The return of the man of the U.N.C.L.E .: the matter of fifteen years later'.
