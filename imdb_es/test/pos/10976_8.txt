Manna del cielo is a light comedy that uses the exaggeration of human frailties to entertain the public. Throughout the film, there is an expectation that goodness will emerge in every situation. The result is that the spectator is sitting with this silly smile on his face, peace in his heart and high expectations for humanity. Watching this movie was a very pleasant experience. (I would say an edifying experience, but some would say it sounds corny!)
