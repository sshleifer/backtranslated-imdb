The Child's Play series is not one of my favorites, but Bride Of Chucky is really a good movie. This time we have two dolls, Chucky and his ex girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they set out on a journey to find an object. There are some interesting scenes through the movie, like the guy who was hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending that allows another sequel to take place. It was not really a direct horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and it was a kind of parody of the horror genre. This made the film better as the comedy he makes with many horror movies. All this even if you're not a fan of children's games, give it a try.
