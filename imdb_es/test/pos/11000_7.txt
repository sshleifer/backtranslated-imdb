General Trelayne is a super-being who wants to play a little game with the Enterprise team. It seems that many extremely improbable and pointless things are happening, and Trelayne seems obsessed with the human practices of war and murder. It seems that he needs to experience what he imagines to be an emotion and has created a human environment (albeit a few hundred years out of date) in which to play his fantasies. The environment is subtly inauthentic, and the crew immediately begins to detect the inconsistencies. Very soon, it is clear that Trelayne is not just an immature god, but a very fallible one. Regardless of how you feel about this, stay for the end similar to Twilight Zone. Worth it. <br /> <br /> As many have pointed out, the character of Trelayne inspired the more developed and fun character Q, and can be seen in John DeLancie's construction of that personality rather than just shadows of Campbell's Trelayne. It is fun to compare how the four captains we have seen dealing with Q confront him in such a radically different way.
