This movie was well made. It covers the difficulties that a returning Vietnam veteran has to face the horrors of war. Unfortunately, the writers chose to focus on a veterinarian who had been involved in an act of atrocity. I was in Vietnam and only once did I hear of such an act by one who witnessed it. The criminal was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in Leavenworth. <br /> <br /> The idea that only veterinarians involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a bad service to all those who served. All the soldiers that I knew personally or that I knew by word of mouth were honorable soldiers who respected even the enemy and believed that they were there to stop the spread of communism. The biggest problem was going back home to know that many Americans were opposed to the war. That is what made many veterans feel that they had participated in something less than honorable. Not the way they served. <br /> <br /> The ending showed the father acting more like a belligerent bully than a loving and loving father. For that I gave a 7 of 10. If the end had allowed a degree of acceptance, I could have qualified it with a 9. <br /> <br /> The most decent men will return home from the war with the guilt and scars emotional They need acceptance and understanding to overcome that. I pray that the public will understand our current veterans more than they did in the Vietnam era.
