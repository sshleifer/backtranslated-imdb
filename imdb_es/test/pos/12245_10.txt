A really great, moving movie. Female melodrama in its maximum expression, with a lot of comedy: great dialogue, characters and writing. Any woman can relate to the story because it is a classic: you are in love with "Mr. Right", but he has no interest in you until someone appears to be completely wrong and fall in love with your face. But of course, it is not so simplistic. The characters are real and all the performances are perfect. The movie is hilarious too, every scene paints society. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a well-written script of humor and melodrama. You can relate to each character and the plot moves in unexpected directions. A great movie, underestimated.
