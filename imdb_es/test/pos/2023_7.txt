So, do you want to be a rock star? See this movie Do not you like rock, you say? Or are you really into heavy metal? Then put on your favorite album and dream, this movie has nothing to offer. I have rarely seen a movie that could portray the dream of being in a rock band as good as this one. I had long hair in the late 1980s and early 90s, and I have played the guitar for the last 15 years or so. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yeah. The music is good, not excellent, the actors are good and believable, even Jennifer Aniston does her part perfectly. And Mark Wahlberg is perfect as the would-be rock singer. So you already know what you're going to get. A film about dreams that come true, that are stepped on and finally realize what life is really about. It's a good solid seven out of ten, no more, no less.
