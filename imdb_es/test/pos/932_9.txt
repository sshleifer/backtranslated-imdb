Not only is it difficult to comment separately on the three parts of the Kieslowski trilogy, but it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do exactly the opposite: see them in order, blue, white and red, and consider them together as a complete work. . It is true that they are different stories with different themes: freedom, equality, fraternity, and each of them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and art. All are worth seeing independently, but I think it is better to see them as one work. Collectively, he would qualify the trilogy as a 9; separately, I place them among my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994. <br /> <br /> The red color is the most memorable in the third film as background in an advertisement, whose profiled model is the center of the three main characters of the movie. The other two characters make a double take of a different degree of recognition when they are in the ad, published larger than life next to a busy intersection of the city. This ad is not an important part of the plot of this film, however, its image becomes surprising and is one of the reasons why I called Red an "amazing" movie. This is the third part of the trilogy Three colors of Kieslowski, based on the blue-white-red of the French flag and the three parts of its motto, 'Freedom, equality, fraternity'. The films focus mainly on these themes, maintaining the basic levels of one, two or three main characters, but with each film the complexity of the plot increases as the three principles go from being primarily personal (Liberty, Blue) to relational (Equality, White) to the social (fraternity, red). Red is my favorite of these movies, and I give it a 9. It stands out for itself as a great movie, but one should see Blue and White first to get the maximum effect.
