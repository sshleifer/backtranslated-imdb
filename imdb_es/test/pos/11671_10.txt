The One and the Only! <br /> <br /> The only really good description of the punk movement in Los Angeles in the early 80's. In addition, the final documentary about legendary bands like Black Flag and X. The disgusting views of this current of the Americans are absolutely hilarious! How can music be so diverse in a country of supposed freedom ... even 20 years later ... discover it? <br /> <br />
