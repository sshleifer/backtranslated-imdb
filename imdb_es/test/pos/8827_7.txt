My main criticism is simply that it is not long enough or detailed enough. I would have loved to see more of everything: the construction of the ship, the engineering, the training, the first survey in orbit, the preparations for the exit, the orbital injection of Venus, everything. I would have liked to see more of the first stage, Venus to Earth, instead of going there as a bus of the 10th corporation. In fact, I would have liked to see a series on the Earth Story scale made of this, with a full hour dedicated to each planet and perhaps another one to the loop around the Sun. As it was, I was hungry. On the other hand, I understand the budgets and the attention capacity of the spectators. <br /> <br /> Re science: Let's be fair about the retardation of the speed of light: they mentioned at the beginning that there was a delay in the conversations, but they let this evaporate once they reached the outer planets. We had to present some kind of conversation to the spectators, and we must assume that the delay was corrected for the sake of palatability; so there are no complaints there. But zero for noisy spacecraft. The only movie in which the spacecraft make no noise was Kubrick's in 2001, and even then he managed to use the noise of the crew when breathing in their helmets, which * was * quite effective. I wish the creators of Space Odyssey had realized how creepy it could be to see huge rocket engines flying in absolute silence, but, unfortunately, Pegasus lets out the same roar as any other cardboard spaceship in all other SciFi cardboard films. <Br /> <br /> But the rest of the science was excellent. No complaints, in fact, praise for exposing radiation problems, just as they did. I just hope that having made this film does not discourage the BBC to do a very detailed version, but I guess that is not for next week or next year ...
