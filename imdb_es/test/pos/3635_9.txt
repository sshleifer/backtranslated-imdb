In Nordestina, a town in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had cried uninterruptedly for five years. When she is young, she falls in love with Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen-year-old teenager who dreams of seeing the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to take the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, participates in a sensationalist television program and promises to travel to the next fifty years in the future or to die for love with a deadly machine he had invented. Fifty years later, Antônio (Paulo Autran) tries to fix what was wrong with his trip. <br /> <br /> "A Máquina" is one of the best Brazilian films I've seen recently. The refreshing and original story is a fable of poetic and magical love that will undoubtedly thrill the most skeptical and hardest viewer into a unique romance. The address is excellent; the script is awesome; The cinematography and the colors are magnificent. The cast led by Gustavo Falcão, the icon Paulo Autran and Mariana Ximenes is fantastic, with wonderful lines; The soundtrack has some beautiful Brazilian songs highlighting "Dia Branco" by Geraldo Azevedo and Rento Rocha. If this film is distributed abroad, push me and fix it or buy the DVD because I bet you will love the story that will make you cry. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Machine ?? O Combustível é o Amor" ("The Machine ?? The Fuel is Love")
