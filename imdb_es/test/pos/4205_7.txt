The first films of Dead End Kids (before they were renamed as "the Bowery Boys") were all very entertaining and well produced Warner Brothers films. Despite being quite formulated, they still had excellent writing, acting and endured well over time. Do NOT confuse them with the cheap films of Bowery Boys of Monogram Pictures, despite the presence of Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey, these films were several steps below the previous films with respect to quality. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with tough guy John Garfield winning the lightweight boxing championship. Unfortunately, shortly after this, he gets drunk and is blamed for a murder he did not really commit. The problem is that he was so burdened that he was not sure he did not kill the man, so he flees and lives the life of a vagabond. Finally, he meets wrestler May Robson and the Dead End Kids, as well as a lady you know will become his girlfriend when the time comes. <br /> <br /> Where the rest of the movie was not all that Surprising, but because of the quality of the film, it does not seem to matter. Garfield and the children are at their best and this is a film that will surely please everyone except the most demanding viewers.
