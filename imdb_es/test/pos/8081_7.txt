I like the phrase "postwar British suburban paranoia" that one of the critics used. It describes so well the kind of films in which John Mills excelled ("The October Man" (1947), "The Long Memory" (1952)) between "big" pictures ("Scott of the Antartic" (1948) and "War"). and Peace "(1956)). <br /> <br /> This "Eric Ambler" style plot clearly made John Mills play Dr. Howard Latimer, who promises his friend Charles, (invisible) to meet a visiting German actress, Frieda Veldon (Lisa Daniely) at the airport. A creepy "reporter" Jeffrey Windsor (Lionel Jeffries) is in his consulting at that time and offers to take him but, while he is tracking the actress, Windsor informs him that she is already in the car. (Something strange is happening!!!). Howard is dropped off for his appointment and does not think about it anymore. <br /> <br /> The next night he finds his body when he gets home from work, and even more, discovers that his friend Charles could not have called him. He is still in New York and Windsor does not seem to exist. Previously, in one patient, Mrs. Ambler (Rene Ray), whom Dr. George Kimber (Mervyn Johns) has referred to, recounts her recurring dream of finding a corpse and a bronze candlestick with a square base. It's a nightmare that's coming true for Howard but, of course, when Inspector Dane (Roland Culver) interviews her, she denies any knowledge of the conversation: the candlestick is later found in Howard's Daimler boot. <br /> <br /> When Howard is lying down, Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White) visits him. He calls himself "friend"; he has a photo of Windsor that he wants to exchange for a matchbox that Frieda gave Howard at the airport. Howard returns to the apartment, Charles sounds and while Howard is talking on the phone, an unknown assailant hits him and steals the matches. Who can you trust? Who does not have something to hide? <br /> <br /> This is a great thriller, not quite like "The October Man", but with John Mills doing what he does. Better - playing ordinary men trapped in impossible mysteries !!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
