I think it is incredibly difficult to write any kind of large-scale review for Giorgino, simply because it is one of those complex, poetic, philosophical films that depend on the viewer, that are intelligent if, while looking at them, you are trying to enjoy them. Its shell and reach its core simultaneously, however, there are several things that are true and without a doubt for any man of art (which, I hope, I am). The first thing: it is a certain masterpiece, even that type of art that remains for a long time; the second: it is one of those rare "dark" films in which the darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much sadder than depressing, like the art of Pieter Brueghel or Caspar David Friedrich. As for the core of the film, someone called it Kafkian, although I do not agree with that because it is really far beyond the misanthropic logic of Kafka and much more like the parables of Edgar Poe: dark and terrifying, but a through that it touches the softest strings of our souls. Actually, on the poetic side (which is much more important than the narrative), Giorgino is a story about eternal peace and love that can only be achieved through childhood eternal soul Those who have such souls are usually called crazy by our society, but from another point of view, everyone has the virtue that all others lost when they "grew up": the virtue of God's love. In fact, Giorgino is a very Christian film, "Be like children" (Mt 18: 3) is his true line of hidden etiquette, although the film never deals with any moral and focuses only on Christian philosophy, dare To suppose, the true god is beyond any human moral. However, I believe that Boutonnat is too severe in portraying "adult" people as a kind of demons trying to steal the childhood of rare surviving souls, but it is his point of view and he has the right to think so. While watching Giorgino, do not try to look for some hidden symbols (although there are some), look better for the thoughts expressed through the characters and their behavior, and learn from them. Also, I can not mention that the film is amazingly seen through excellent photography, especially through the rational use of color filters, the incredibly appropriate editing, the wonderful performance of all the actors and, of course, due to the atmospheric beauty of the winter mountains that remind me of those of Brueghel. "Hunters in the snow". Also, curiously, the scene with Death in the form of an old woman with sunken eyes and black rings mounted on a car, reminded me instantly of Pesta (Plague) from the series of drawings by the Norwegian painter Theodor Kittelsen, showing how a black The plague is sweeping the population of a small town in the mountain valley. It is a coincidence?
