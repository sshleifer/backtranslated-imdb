While it is not for everyone, Crackerjack is a pleasure to watch, with the tongue firmly placed on the cheek. The funny character of Jack Simpson, played by Mick Molloy, is swindling the local "bowlo" to get free parking and earn a couple of dollars on the side, selling the parking space to coworkers. When members of the Bowling Club need to raise some money to save their club, they invite Jack to join his bowling team and bowling the competition. <br /> <br /> Filled with Aussie Charm, Mick Molloy's laconic wit is showing through (he also co-wrote the script) reminding this viewer of his previous work on Radio. The perfect cast for Aussie with Bill Hunter as the mentor of Jack in bowling Stan Coombes, John Clarke (of the fame of the Games) as the ruthless businessman and owner of the bowls club rival Bernie Fowler, with Samuel Johnson as the companion of Jack's floor, and Judith Lucy as the tired journalist, Nancy. <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought that only Molloy fans would like this movie, but judging by the number of the blue rinse set that comes out of the cinema, this is a movie for everyone.
