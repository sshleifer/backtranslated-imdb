With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses, this was in my opinion the best series of David Jason. <br /> <br /> Immediately after his television debut in 'Do not adjust your game!', these 13 episodes revealed a comic moment dominance not seen since the old days of silent movies. By comparison, Porridge, Open All Hours and that horrible series 'Lucky Man' did not come close. <br /> <br /> I think Jason forbade the series to be repeated because he showed it in his spotlight. The fault is with him. A new generation deserves to enjoy this. The series really failed in the ratings, but that's very likely because it was against 'The Brothers' that aired on the BBC at the same time, before the video recorders were common. <br /> <br /> By the way, I just noticed that his much suffering assistant, Spencer, was played by Mark Eden; Alan Bradley from Coronation Street. I'm surprised he did not try to murder Edgar Briggs.
