I went and saw this movie last night after being persuaded by some friends of mine. I admit that I was reluctant to see him because, from what I knew about Ashton Kutcher, I could only do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can play with our emotions. He did exactly that. The whole theater (which sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the film, and was moved to tears during the second half. When I left the theater, I not only saw many women crying, but also many adult men, desperately trying not to let anyone see them cry. This movie was great, and I suggest you watch it before judging it.
