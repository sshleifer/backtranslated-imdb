Oh my God ! I can really say that Maya Angelou is one of the most intriguing and important people in the world, especially my culture. It's incredibly inspiring and its story is the story of a great woman! The first time I chose this movie, I thought to myself that the cast was wonderfully composed, now let's see it in action! Maya Angelou is already my favorite PoetEs and now she is one of my favorite actresses and orators. I think she is the greatest of all time. This movie had me on the edge of my seat and I was looking for Kleenex, while at the same time reminding me that it does not matter where you come from, if you decide that you're going to be great, then you'll be great! And Ester Rolle played a wonderful supporting role ... 100% AWESOME ... and now even "I know why the caged bird sings".
