Rock Star is a "pretty" movie. Everyone is nice Even the guys who do not have to be nice, they're really nice. Chris is a good guy, who learns a lesson in life. He returns with his girlfriend Emily, who is also nice. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, despite all the kindness. Maybe I'm used to all the anguish of X Gen music. In a way, the movie was a cartoon of Rock Stars and not tough enough to be credible. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg's performance is quite good. Jennifer Aniston played her role well, but it was not complicated. She was a good girl <br /> <br /> Go see him. If you've ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap, go see it.
