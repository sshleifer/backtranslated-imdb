A notorious big budget flop when it was launched. This comedy inspired by Robert Altman has some fabulous moments and an occasionally inspired cast. Although it continues to lose its focus completely, there are enough fun moments that will keep the curious viewer watching until the end. If you are a fan of actors and actresses of characters, this will be a pleasure for you; You will recognize many amazing and amazing artists throughout this movie (you may not know their names, but know their faces), even the child of A Christmas Story appears in a small part. Rent if from Netflix, if you read this, I bet you'll enjoy it.
