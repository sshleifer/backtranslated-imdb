I've become a big fan of Barbet Schroeder's work, so maybe I'm a little skewed by now, but I think this movie is great, although there may be some lengths. It is a romantic non-romantic vision of the Great Liberation in the late sixties, stylistically amazingly polished (great stage design!) And, in my opinion, still very visible. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's an ironic version of the story of Adam and Eve being kicked out of paradise after tasting the "forbidden fruit" that has turned from an apple into a hypodermic filled with heroin. The woman seduces a man to use it, thus accelerating his destiny. The boy seems to be condemned and forced to an intensive life and an early grave from the sequence of the great title onwards. There is no place for any hope. <br /> <br /> Although the story is quite sad, I was captured by the beauty of both the beautiful location of Ibiza and Mimsy Farmer. It seemed to me that his character was both superficial, enigmatic, endearing, annoying, interesting and boring. In a way, she represents what men see in women in a basic and harmless way. Architecture and artifacts built in general are very much in use? which seems to be a registered trademark of Schroeder. <br /> <br /> There is even some humor, mainly delivered by Stefan, the main German character and his accent. Its main nemesis is not a snake but an older German of dubious reputation. And supplier of heroin - called a wolf. Although it is a German name and Stefan is German, he pronounces it very badly English and in a fit of jealousy spits out his girlfriend's name at regular intervals? become a crying child ... Sometimes, Stefan has to work to earn a "cellery". On one occasion, the boy snorkels and then climbs awkwardly to a rock with its rubber fins. The male frontal nudity has never been seen. More fun in the history of cinema.
