I saw it for the first time when I bought a random DVD of short films a while ago. This is the only short on the DVD that I liked, but I do not like it, I love it ... if you spend time with me, you'll see it. It is beautiful, simple and passionate, without chimes, without whistles. It could have been done with a Sharpie (but do not get me wrong, the animation is elegant and insightful). This person clearly spent a lot of time with the cats, but it's just black and white) and then there's the writing and the music ... it's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> I eat chocolate, I drink wine and I look at it again and again ... <br /> <br /> nothing else matters, I hope Pedro Serrazina comes up with something else.
