Maybe this is not the most exciting or incredible episode that they have done, but in my opinion, it is still one of the most original episodes of Star Trek and Sci-Fi. Most of the ideas in the retro sci-fi series, especially Star Trek, have been reused several times, but this on the other hand remains a one-time triumph. This is one of the episodes that most impressed me towards the end. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I like about this episode is how he has managed to create such an exciting and captivating story with so few special effects. Now, without criticizing the episode, I must admit that the effects are very old-fashioned, but again, what can you expect from a 1967 television show? But still, the creature ("Horta") in this episode is basically a carpet with a bit of colored rubber. However, you forget this after about 1 minute and you just start thinking about that as it is supposed to be. Also, the caves do not exactly look like rocks, but once again you forget them after a few minutes. This episode is living proof of how a good performance and a good story can make you ignore the visual effects. <br /> <br /> The performance of the main cast is, as always, great. This episode presents the mental fusion of the series Second by Spock and is one of my favorites. So to put it simply, Leonard Nimoy is definitely a scene thief here, and his acting is excellent. It's not that Kirk or Bones do not have their part of the episode, but Spock is the most intriguing in this one. I like the fact that the episode is not about a specific character, but evolves around the trio handling a strange problem. It is also good to see an episode that does not just happen in the Company. <br /> <br /> Like most Star Trek episodes, this episode tells us to have an open mind. I will not spoil the story, but it evolves around what at first seems like a typical story of monsters. It has killed several humans and therefore you have to kill them. But is that really all there is? I can assure you that the explanation at the end will not disappoint you. This is still my favorite episode of Star Trek TOS and I give it a 10/10.
