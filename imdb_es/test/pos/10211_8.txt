I doubt that the true story of the development of Western Union would have gained a real audience. Instead of talking about the construction of the telegraph system in the west, it was the history of the boardrooms, dominated by one of the most interesting (and disgusted) of the great "robber thieves": Jay Gould. Gould picked up the troubled company and turned it into a communication giant, and part of his attempt at a national rail system to compete with that of Vanderbilt. But this, while interesting, is not as exciting as the story of the placement of the telegraph lines themselves. At least, that's how the public would see it. Jay Gould died in 1892. If he had lived in the modern era and invested in Hollywood, he probably would have accepted that evaluation as well. <br /> <br /> The film is about how the installation of the telegraph system by the Indians is endangered, spurred by a Jack Slade (Barton MacLane). Slade, a desperado, is not happy with the development of a communication system that will undoubtedly jeopardize his abilities to evade the police in the territories. He faces the man in charge of the placement of the telegraph wires, Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Creighton associate Richard Blake (Robert Young) and a quasi-lawyer Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), who is Slade's brother . Blake, an oriental with little understanding of the West, is falling in love with Creighton's sister, Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but he finds it difficult to get used to his new surroundings. But he becomes a close friend of Shaw, especially when trying to confront Slade. <br /> <br /> By the way, Slade was a true Western criminal and the subject of a section of Mark Twain's ROUGHING IT. He was hanged in the 1870s. But he had no role in stirring the Indians against the railroads or the telegraph companies. However, MacLane makes him a memorable, evil and totally cruel guy. His murder of one of the main characters takes place suddenly and from behind, and sees the corpse as if it had just got rid of a nuisance. But Lang is responsible for that, as well as other touches. Watch the sequence with Chill Wills, where it is in a telegraph post repairing it. He spits tobacco juice several times while talking to Young, who splashes a little. Then there is an Indian attack that we observe from ground level. When finished, Young suddenly splashes again, but it is not brown but red that covers it. He looks up at the top of the pole, and there are Wills with an Indian arrow through it. <br /> <br /> It's an exciting movie to watch, and it's well worth catching.
