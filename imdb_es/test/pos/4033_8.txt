Okay, it's possible that this movie did not win an Oscar, but it's not a bad movie. The original "D.O.A." Undoubtedly, it is a better movie, but that does not mean that this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> The film is starring Dennis Quaid in one of his first roles, when he became really famous, after "The Right Stuff". It made him a star, and a very charming looking Meg Ryan, when she was still quite famous. <br /> <br /> This is more an "update" of the 1950 movie, instead of a new version, from the stage It's different and the characters too, are different. The plot is practically the same. A man (this time an English teacher at the University of Texas at Austin) is poisoned and only has 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays the estranged wife of Quaid, in a low key, but with an intense performance; she steals all the scenes she is in. Daniel Stern (also in a previous role, before "Solo en casa" made him famous) plays Quaid's colleague. Charlotte Rampling is also fine in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> The full cast is top-notch; The movie is elegant, with a fast pace that keeps you guessing until the end. <br /> <br /> I think this is a movie that is worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic movie.
