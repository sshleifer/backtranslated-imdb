Elizabeth Ashley is receiving phone calls from her nephew Michael: she is crying, screaming and asking for help. The problem is that Michael died 15 years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie scared me stupidly in 1972 when it aired on ABC. See it again, years later, STILL works. <br /> <br /> The film is a little slow and predictable, the deaths are very docile and there is a happy ending, but this is a television movie, so you have to give it space. Elizabeth Ashley is excellent, Ben Gazzara is fine and it's fun to see Michael Douglas so young. And those phone calls still scare me. In fact, I had to turn on a light during one of them! <br /> <br /> A scary little TV movie. Worth seeing.
