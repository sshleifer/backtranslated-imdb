"House Calls" is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as "how they used to do them". It stars Walter Matthau (in one of his best roles) as a recently widowed doctor who comes back out on the dating scene and hits Paydirt as he seems to have a different woman every night. Then he meets the Glenda Jackson hospital patient and soon develops a relationship with her. But it is one that will be severely tested since she informs him that she is a woman of one man and hopes that she is a woman of only one woman. <br /> <br /> This is a sweet, very funny movie, also starring Art Carney as the administrator of the senile hospital and Richard Benjamin as Matthau's friend and medical partner. It is a must for any Matthau fan or any light comedy fan. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
