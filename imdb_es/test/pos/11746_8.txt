This film draws attention immediately, with the atmospheric aerial views of a very cute Hong Hong. Filmed in those rich colors of the 1950s films that blockbusters never seem to capture. Probably it is a sign of those times, because it is not a motor of great power, seen everything before the film, full of ravages and violence. However, the ravages and violence are there, in the context, with thousands of refugees trying to leave China. This is a moving and compelling story, full of hope and love in a tragic moment, in recent history. The story of two people from different cultures falling in love. And the preparation for them that try to overcome this is the heart of this very fine and moving film.
