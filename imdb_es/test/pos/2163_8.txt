I just watched this movie and it's not bad; There are some tense moments and not many long dialogue chains. It becomes pretty smart; Fastpaced almost like 'documentary style'. This film will evoke something of nostalgia and a bit of paranoia from the cold war with cars, street scenes and life in the 50s. The performance is quite solid and, after 85 minutes of execution, runs at a good pace. A film enthusiast of the atomic age should not miss this one.
