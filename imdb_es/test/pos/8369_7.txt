This is not the best movie you've ever seen, but it's still very refreshing. Of course, it has its flaws, its moments of humility and, at the same time, it's different from all the things you're used to and it's fun in a way that only the Frenchman can give you this. You may recognize a little of the masterpiece Amelie, when you see the opening. I give it 7 out of 10, but I recommend it to you if you are tired of the usual boredom that you can rent in the video library.
