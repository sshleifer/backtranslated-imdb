While some of the things in Haggard are silly and unnecessary, the overall package is good. <br /> <br /> Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) trying to recover Glauren (Jenn Rivell), Ryan's ex. <br /> <br /> The story follows and unfolds surprisingly well, it is not surprised and becomes an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, although it has a parallel story that does not hurt the main story. <br /> <br /> And, for all Bam fans (and girls) there are multiple Bam skating sequences, maybe the weakest aspect of the movie. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances, even Don Vito got a bigger (but meaningless) run. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a comedy and escape Bam's madness, then get away from this movie, otherwise, enjoy the time you spend with him, if you can find him. There are some really funny scenes in this movie.
