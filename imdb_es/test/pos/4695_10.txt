To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan in one of the many comments on DVD, that "wobbling music" about the HTV logo was enough to make me jump out of what I was doing to stick my face against the screen for an hour. The individual stories contained in the series were excellent and the development of the character was wonderful. Robin of Loxley makes a very convincing trip in the two series in which it appears, although his exit from the program was not planned. Marian also develops very well his relationship with the two sons of Herne. <br /> <br /> After languishing for many years in the wasteland of television, I returned to meet the Sky 1 series in the UK in the mid-nineties and was even more impressed that the series It seems even better than I remembered. This is not a television program for children, it is about witchcraft, betrayal, rebellion and injustice. And, he manages to do it without showing too much blood. As far as I can remember, you only see a little bit of the red matter in the movie Pilot (Episodes 1 and 2 on the DVD set). The DVDs are great, with a lot of extras that include comments from the cast only in Series 3 (Jason Connery Robin) and comments from the crew for Series 1 and 2. The image quality is very good and the remixed surround sound and remastered is amazing. <Br /> <br /> The idea of ​​freedom is important, freedom prevails. Nothing has been forgotten. He never forgets anything.
