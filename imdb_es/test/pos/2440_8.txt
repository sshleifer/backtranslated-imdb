A logger finds a young cougar who needs help. To young people, to be alone, the cat soon takes care of the workers of the field. Nicknamed "Good Time Charlie", his antics entertain everyone at the beginning. Its wild nature eventually begins to cause problems and reintroducing it into its natural habitat becomes a problem. This movie is one of those wonderful Disney nature movies that were common in the 50s and 60s. Of action, beautiful scenery and some lovely animals to love you. These films were not long, but included fascinating glimpses of wildlife and the effects of human contact. Unlike Disney's animated talking animals, the animals in these films remained true to their very nature. Make great travel movies to see the western states.
