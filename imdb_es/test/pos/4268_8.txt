I especially liked the end of this film: I really felt what the characters must have felt, which I think is a mark of good direction. I was surprised by the way the new employee of the record store turned out to be: a great development of characters there, although his "role" would probably be considered minor. <br /> <br /> I was also impressed that the whole film, although obscure in its subject, was free of gratuitous nudity, profanity and violence. Sadness, sexuality and darkness can be communicated (often better) by what is not said, but it seems that it is often exclusive to films and actors really "classy". Congratulations to the filmmaker for that.
