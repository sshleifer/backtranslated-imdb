Just to clarify, Matthew Poncelet was not a real person, but a combination of two murderers who were BOTH convicted and sentenced to die for the murder of two teenagers. <br /> <br /> I read the user's comments and reacts as if Matthew was real. The character is based on a mix of two assassins, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie (who murdered separate people) and the murder itself was based on the one Willie committed. Willie's conflict in having someone else present and both parties swearing that the other committed the murder is also involved in the story. <br /> <br /> Prejean's approach is unique in that she is not only serving the convicts like them. Waiting for her death and helping them take responsibility for their actions, she also approaches the families of the victims, for to help them know that the condemned man did, in fact, feels sorry for what they did, effectively helping both parties. <br /> <br /> Everyone who publishes here seems to have strong beliefs about the death sentence. It is not my place to say that it is right or wrong: in theory, punishing death with death has some kind of karmic sense, however, denying a person his freedom for the rest of his days, although expensive, makes more sense to me: being stuck in a small room 23/7 (with one hour of exercise) for the rest of their days to remember how cruel they seemed a more appropriate punishment: they are technically alive, but they are denied life. Suppose someone killed someone to get out of the responsibility required by the person they killed (like Susan Smith killing her poor children by pushing her car into a lake). I find it rather ironic that they would not get the "freedom" they craved and now they would have to spend the rest of their days in prison. <br /> <br /> The Prejean point appears very well in the story. She has my respect, she manages to find that balance, she is not supporting an assassin, she is guiding them to accept what they did. If they did not feel some kind of remorse, they would not ask for spiritual guidance. <br /> <br /> On a final note, when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix's father for killing his son, the parents of the girl who was also murdered muttered something about why he did not apologize for his death. I think the point was that throughout the movie, Poncelet denies killing both children. In Prejean's mind there are doubts that he committed the two murders; there is a friend who was condemned but not to death; my thought is that Poncelet killed the child Delacroix and that the other man murdered the girl; hence, Poncelet assumed responsibility for what he did. If he had been responsible for the girl's death, he probably would have apologized for that too.
