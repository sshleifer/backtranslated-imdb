This is my fourth review of a Charlie Chan movie in serial chronological order on these consecutive days. This is also my first comment of one I've seen before, although it's been about 24 years since then, so I do not remember much of that. In this, the Honolulu detective is investigating an espionage ring that was initially tracked by a former Scotland Yard acquaintance who appeared missing in the Big Apple ... This is the best of the Chan entries I've seen so far in the present. the memory with each track is connected (although, of course, if I examine them more closely, there could still be some holes although I can not think of any now). And "No. 2 Son" Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) is a little help when he first identifies the poison that results in some murders at first, although, of course, he makes a mistake a little later. Among the supporting cast of Chan's latest film, Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum, are blonde Joan Valerie as June Preston and Stanley Blystone, whose brother John G. directed a lost Chan named Charlie Chan Chance, as an expert in fingerprints. Pleasant intrigue, especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber plane. Oh, and keep an eye on a certain Stooge in the police line ...
