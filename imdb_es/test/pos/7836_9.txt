Forget some of the plaintive (and meaningless) comments left here by some. This series is well acted, well filmed and makes a refreshing change to most of the roles on television. <br /> <br /> Any fool can do anything. However, in this show the characters are credible, the story lines are intriguing and compelling (but require some intelligence on the part of the viewer), in general, it's nice, and it's British! (From time to time we come up with some gems, and this is one of them). <br /> <br /> The shows last one hour each and I think there are four of them all together (at least I only saw four of them). The program clearly impressed a television station / director of EE. UU He did a longer series that was not as convincing despite the bigger budget. <br /> <br /> If you like telenovelas and reality shows, you will not like or understand Eleventh. Hour.
