This film by the well-known Czech collaborator and writer Petr Jarchovský is remarkable for its particularity, but annoying and distracting in its details. Taking her subject and title from a poem by Robert Graves, it is about a woman with several men and some unpleasant relatives in her life who is trying to survive and protect her two children, Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) aged 15 and a small asthmatic blonde. Kuba (Adam Misik). The poem is very obvious, but the theme: you lose a little. <br /> <br /> Marcela (Anna Geislerová), Bella and Jarda (Luknár Romana) have lost everything in the floods of Prague in 2002 and there is nothing left, apparently, but good sex, to which they come with so much revenge in her tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the TV, must hold their ears against the noise. Hrebejek loves those explanations and skates on the verge of embarrassment or shock. There is not a good explanation of why, but the financial despair has led to Jarda to process stolen cars in the large garage that adjoins his apartment. His cohort of car thieves expel an elegant Volvo that Benes (Josef Abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a super nice guy, but not stupid. His Volvo is wired to track by satellite in cases like this and that takes the cops directly to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort go to jail. <br /> <br /> "Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel, / In whom she can trust," begins Graves's poem. But in reality this failure brings Benes to Marcela, when he finds her at the police station. He introduces him to sushi and the way he drinks wine and offers him a picture book about Tuscany, where he, although born in Prague, owns a beautiful village and has lived most of his life. He is here to claim the house in Prague, now occupied by a couple with an old and sick mother, whom he allows to stay. All the gestures of Benes are benevolent, although it does not prevent that Jarda goes to the jail. <br /> <br /> In these circumstances, Marcela must retire with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the mercies of Zdena's current husband, the diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer) , who, for children, begins when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming their dietary cookies, proves to be the uncle of hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point and never abandons it. Even in the final scene, he is a figure of a malicious threat. It is surprising that the unpleasant Richard does not sexually abuse one or both children. He insists that Marcela needs to go out alone, and when Benes offers to take her under his protection, he and Richard become unlikely allies. Unlikely - maybe implausible. Why should Benes like it? But then, what is the full story of Benes? About some things the film gives too much information and about others, it is not enough. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the "good angel", Benes is infallibly kind, and an older man, polished and handsome, whose manners correspond to his Italian education. It is only at the end, when he is pushed to the limit on his Prague property by the devious occupants, that he proves that he is not someone who does not lie down and who approaches him. <br /> <br /> It will also be discussed with the religious fan of Jarda, Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to be observed. But she is just another wild card that does not increase the deck. <br /> <br /> The poem was put into music in a Czech translation and is sung on the screen by accordionist and vocalist Raduza, first in a small scene, and then in a more extended one in a performance in prison witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal. If you live Hrebejk as an author, you can savor this sequence; Otherwise, you tend to feel free. Also included are several Glen Hansard / Marketa Irglova songs from the Irish Oscar-winning musical film 'Once', which includes the latter's song, 'Falling'. They feel more out of place than they are otherwise due to their familiarity with "Once", although this movie came first. <br /> <br /> The people of Hrebejk are arresting; even little Koba has his moments as a child of Shakespeare and a lot of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to wander and expand too much. The nuisance of the property that Benes supports can be useful to show that he has a hard side. But such an elaborate demonstration was not necessary. The acting is fine, and there is a wonder with peculiarity and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex and money are lost in Marcela's confusion and conflicts and how she resolves them she is never clear. It is well that there is no resolution and that it is true to Graves' theme and poem that Marcela still has sex with Jarda during a visit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her children. But there are still too many questions about what to do with the unpleasant Richard or the annoying pious mother of Jarda (Emília Vásáryová). How is it that we suddenly learn that Koba is receiving letters from "India" that is supposedly from his father, who is in jail? When did that happen? Interesting details, stuck hastily. This looks like a world where you can not see the forest through the trees.
