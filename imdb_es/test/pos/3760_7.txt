Mark Blankfield (of the old night television program "Fridays") plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a good-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a party animal driven mad by drugs. This was not, of course, his intention, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a pretty stupid movie, but it's also pretty funny. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he has done, he is embarrassed, but he is not above doing it all over again and running around Hollywood like a crazed sex machine with hair chains and frizzed gold. There are some subplots like Jekyll's fiancee, who is the daughter of the chief doctor of Our Lady of Suffering and Pain, Jekyll's employer. And there's Tim Thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few "real" parts and liking for men, and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of Howard Hughes, and who's going to enrich several people with a whole set of organs. Transplants, including the testicles. Yes, the humor is obscene and silly, and in general everything is quite insipid, but if you're not above a quick wallowing in the gutter, you probably like it. Now also available on DVD, for the first time! Woohoo! 7 out of 10
