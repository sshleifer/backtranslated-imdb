My friends and I spent most of Saturday afternoon watching a selection of "bad" movies. Among the films we saw, the strongest contender (for the quality of the bad movie) was Jack-O. It's ridiculous that movies like "Gigli", "Glitter" and "You Got Served" are on the list of the last 100 of IMDB. While they are bad films, they do not belong to the lowest 100. They are stealing "Jack -O", and "Keeper of Time", etc., from the greatness of the bad movie they so deserve. <br /> <br /> So, what makes Jack-O so big (in terms of bad movie)? For starters, Steve Latshaw, the director, decided to choose his son, Ryan Latshaw, in the role of Sean Kelly. Unfortunately for Steve, Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to being overtaken by a block of wood. The child, seriously, has no ability to emote at all. The final result: involuntary comic gold. The child might be listening to a joke, or just a few minutes after they broke his head to pieces, and his expression is "lack of emotion." <br /> <br /> The other aspect of the film that we thought was incredible was the large number of "double sleep" sequences. What is a double dream? Well, it's when a character wakes up from a nightmare, and then something equally nightmarish happens, and then the character wakes up again. Basically: they wake up after dreaming of waking up from a nightmare. Smart device, right? I think the character of Sean Kelly experienced no less than 3 sequences of double sleep. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what else? Oh yeah! This movie has a real cast of thousands. It is really amazing to see how many speaking roles are introduced throughout the film. Best of all: almost none of the characters has anything to do with the story. Or kill them Jack-O, or they're useless. <br /> <br /> Jack-O himself was pretty sweet. Like most other B movie monsters, Jack-O has the incredible ability to, apparently, teleport to great distances. He invariably meets, somewhere in the background, when you're dealing with an important character. However, what is disconcerting is that when in reality he is chasing someone, he moves at a stumbling and stumbling speed, and still is able to keep up with the people who are running. <br /> <br /> That's all for now. Closing comments: if you're looking for a bad movie, unintentionally, hilariously, you can not go wrong when renting this beast. <br /> <br /> Rating of the bad movie: 7/10 Good score of the movie: 3.5 / 10
