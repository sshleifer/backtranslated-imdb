This film, with all its complexity and subtlety, is one of the most suggestive short films I've seen in my life. The themes he tackles are ugly, cynical and sometimes even macabre, but the film is still beautiful in its language, witty with its camera angles and beautiful in its style, skillfully recreating the tale of the same name written by a master of stories, Tobias Wolff. <br /> <br /> Not wanting to spoil anything in the movie, I will not go into details, other than to say that this movie is magnificent in itself. He takes pride in what he does, and he does it well. It shows the most important memories of life, all of which can be overcome by the most elusive feeling: unexpected happiness. This film, of its own accord, has created in me the same feelings that the main character (Tom Noonan) felt when words transformed his own existence, and that is an impressive feat.
