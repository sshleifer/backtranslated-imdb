I really fell in love with the characters. They were very practical, but each and every one of them had a hidden dark side. A kind of mystery David Graysmark, himself, was an enigma. The secret fears and only the secrets in general that I had. There was a whole side of him that the other characters knew nothing about and left the audience wondering or assuming. There was always a part of this man that he would keep hidden, however, he would also share a little of himself. He was the strong male character and I admire that kind of character. Billy Moses himself is an incredible actor who could do almost any kind of part! He is an incredible talent and a good man. His fans love him, respect him and support him incessantly. <br /> <br /> Since this program, he has participated in many other projects and has expanded his acting ability a little more and quite well. Congratulations to him and all the other actors in this show for doing such an excellent job! I wish you all the best. I wish the series had continued! It's a shame no!
