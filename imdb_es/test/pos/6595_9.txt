This film was not only exciting, but it also led me to go back down the track of memories with its real sound. These were the things we said, and doing ... these were the songs we listened to ... all during this same period of time, at the same time, in southern Alabama. I may not have been one of the skaters, but I was definitely one of the observers, sitting on the sidewalk with the old transistor radio, listening to Neil Young, watching the bravest of what he had never expected to be, as they say. spin on your surfboards on wheels, applying the tricks of Alva and Adams, hoping that maybe, just for a brief moment, adopt the Zephyr style. It only shows how similar we all were during those wonderful days. ~ KLJ
