I have high hopes for the sequel to Gen-X. Luckily, my hopes have come true. You have a lot of action, comedy ... silly comedy and surprises. I think the newcomer, Edison, is really a success in the movie, but it really seems to me that Sam's 'Alien' is very upset with English. Although the film had some flaws with the robot's graphics and silly dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. The configuration of the action is much stronger than the 1st. <br /> <br /> This movie is taking on a more American feel as 60% of the film is in Cantonese English. This movie will not disappoint you. I recommended this for young people who care about fun filled with pure action. <br /> <br />
