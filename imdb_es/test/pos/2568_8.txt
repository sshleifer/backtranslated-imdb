I am amazed and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not understand the point of Black Snake Moan. It is not about black-and-white relations or relationships between old and young, although I think that director Craig Brewer deliberately introduced both elements to modify imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, although Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies that. It is not about popular religion in the black community, although religion plays an important role. It is not a love story, although there is not one, but two happy couples at the end. And certainly it is not about the south, where "everything is hotter", although it is located in the south and is undeniably hot; Holy smoke, even the writers of the tag line did not understand the point. <br /> <br /> Black Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who interprets them, about what they are playing, how he heals them. <br /> <br /> It's as if the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked, "Ok," If we were to help people understand what the Blues really are about, what would it look like? "So they put him in the rural south, then they invent two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes to war and his battered girl sleeps with everyone in the city. a gray world touched only a little by popular religion (they know that Jesus wants their lives, and even though they respect him, they know they can not give him that), some violence between men and women, and many, many things of torrid sexual images, including - Ready to go over? - A black man in a tank top with a half-naked white girl captive at the end of a 40-pound chain, fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, do it with a genuine blues collector, use the music as the element of healing In the main plot, hit blues-man clips Son House on both ends, and Voila: has a modern parable about what the blues are about. Even the climax of the film is not the conflict of characters, but the whole city dancing dances of steam to burning blues. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by the homey religion and firmness of Lazarus (Jackson) (and do not forget the chain). the end. Is this an expression of a restored and healthy life force, or simply more of the same trashy behavior that ruined it in the first place? Brewer wants it both ways, but blues is really about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I guess I would say that the blues gives a healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without untying either. I have my doubts. <br /> <br /> Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; The man is incredibly good. He even chooses some of his own songs in the film, and his interpretation is authentic, dirty and hot. Christina Ricci is not usually that good either. Of course, half of his work is done by the Costume that was not there and his furious figure, but it is a wonderful combination of cynical lust, rebellion and vulnerability; bravo for her, she has arrived. I was impressed by the country's preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to make sure he is a professional actor and not a true minister of the country. <br /> <br /> Parents should be aware of what they do. We will get it if your children bring this home. The language is quite far from the charts, the first half hour is full of graphic sex, and women are raped in a dozen ways during the course of the film (Lazaro looks good and decent, but honestly, chains a woman to the Radiator?) In addition, Ricci spends half of the film dressed for sex; If you have teenage children, they will be licking the screen until the middle of the movie. I do not recommend it for children of any age. Only adults, please. <br /> <br /> That said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, popular religion and sexual abuse, and tells a story that is redemptive in many ways. It's unorthodox, but it's worth the time. And, my God, it's the hot sound track.
