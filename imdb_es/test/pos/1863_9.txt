This is definitely a moving film, and a great expression of Charles Darwin's personal struggle. The film is not only about his struggle to publish his book "The Origin of Species", but also about his relationship with his eldest daughter. At first, her daughter was the only person in her family who approved of her views, something she also had to pay for. I am more than him sometimes. <br /> <br /> Now, this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, in fact I think it managed to be very neutral. A hard thing to do in my opinion. Of course, it does not approve the way in which the characters were treated by the church, but quite the opposite. If you need me to use the big words to clarify this movie; It will be appreciated by deists and atheists alike, but it moves away from theism. The film talks about evolution, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was amazing. Of course, we can all think of Darwin as that old man with the funny beard, but this film focuses on the man in the late 20's, early 30's. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is great as always, but the actor who I was impressed by Martha West as Annie Darwin, Darwin's daughter. Definitely one of the best children's actors of the decade. The story is about Darwin and his daughter, and she is beautifully acted. <br /> <br /> Except for a few jumps in time that were momentarily confusing, the production of this movie is quite perfect. Some scenes where Darwin observes that nature is wonderful, and is almost like something out of a high-production national geographic documentary. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I am not sure why they chose "Creation". as the title. I doubt it's an irony, the film is too respectful for that. Well, I'm sure it also has a meaning, but do not let it scare you. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 9/10. This is really a great tribute to Charles Darwin, and please, give him a chance.
