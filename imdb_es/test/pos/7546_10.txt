This classic comedy of English schoolgirl antics is and was one of the great classics of art. Then the art house disappeared with the arrival of the videos. And the audience did the same for this movie. The loss is not for the art houses or for this great movie. The loss is for those who will never have the real chance to see this memorable film masterpiece full of laughter. But I'm preaching to the converts, right? Who else would look for this movie?
