We do not know why this extraordinary movie was never officially available on DVD ... Anthony Quinn's solo performance makes this a must-see. There are relatively few films in which an actor identifies so deeply with his character, a phenomenon that is always unique to us, the spectators. <br /> <br /> But Quinn's powerful portrait of an innocent Romanian, literally dragged out of his house and every day. Life by the forces that you can not understand, is only part of what makes this movie great. The script is based on a book published in Paris by a Romanian priest who fled the communist takeover of his country, and the film manages to enter a little-known area of ​​Eastern European history. Told as a succession of turns of Kafka-esquire of fate, the misadventures of Johann Moritz (said openly and sincerely, without any of the political corrections that are so valuable today in Hollywood) are in fact a praise of innocence loss of the Romanian people. . It is diabolically ironic that this eulogy is signed by a French director, who works with the American money of an Italian producer, and who oversees a multinational cast led by an extraordinary Mexican actor. <br /> <br /> I saw VCD mentions of this film in several Asian Internet stores, and I was fortunate to take ownership of a digital recording of this film, transmitted in the British version of TCM. But it's a shame that "The 25th Hour" is nowhere in the future DVD launch map of the MGM studios.
