This wonderful short film will come home with all those who, as a child, specifically asked for something because it was modern or great, just to receive something that would mark you for life with your classmates and your mother or father told you (or both) that It did not matter, as he began to seriously consider enrolling in a Witness Protection Program to avoid ridicule. For those residents of the USA UU They do not get the horror because they do not follow hockey, it's as if a Dallas Cowboys fan got a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan getting a Red Sox jersey. It's not pretty For our European friends, think of two big rival football clubs (soccer for us) and imagine that a fan of one gets a shirt from the other. Oh!!! NFB of C was exceeded here! <br /> <br /> Une Hommage du Maurice "Rocket" Richard, Merci, M. Richard.
