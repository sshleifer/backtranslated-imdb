From the first to the last scene, this film is made in a very realistic, even very realistic way, that sometimes we can not see details in night scenes (it's dark like the real night), in the desert (the sunlight is so strong as in the real desert). <br /> <br /> The script and the actor's work are also very realistic. The shots and episodes are edited so as not to show things and events "effectively", to "explain" them or, as many Hollywood films do, to "entertain" viewers. Edit here is to represent events as if they really happened in Afghanistan. The camera is sometimes far from the solders, even at the moment when the main character, Commander Bandura, is shot to death. <br /> <br /> This method reminds me of the masterpieces of Italian neo-realism. And the construction of history here is based on the same principles as "Pais√†", or "The thief of the bicycle": chronological series of episodes of "truth to life" and some pathetic moments, which at first seem to be sudden and illogical , but I have internal reasons. <br /> <br /> I believe that the internal reason for Commander Bandura's suicide is religious emotion: repentance for the death of innocent people (not only his accidental killing of relatives in the village, but also the death of soldiers under his command). He is not represented as an anxious believer, on the contrary, he is described as a responsible and tactful officer. Exactly for this reason his last decisions (to return to the destroyed village and turn his back on an armed Chico, whose family he killed) seems an act of Repentance. <br /> <br /> The Russian Orthodox choir, which sounds at the end ("Evening Sacrifice") is another context, by which the whole film can be seen from this point of view.
