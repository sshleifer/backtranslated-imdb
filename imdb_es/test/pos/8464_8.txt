I went to see this movie out of curiosity and to resolve a discussion. The film is now best known for the set of music that Sergei Prokofiev drew from his incidental music to the film, the Troika movement even appearing in pop arrangements. The general scheme of the plot is well known for the manga notes in several recordings. An employee accidentally generates a Lieutenant Kizhe non-existent on a list to be presented to the Tsar. The Tsar is interested in this person, and instead of telling him that he does not exist, the courtiers and the officials maintain that it is real. Kizhe is exiled to Siberia, is remembered, is promoted, remarried, promoted again, given a state funeral, reveals himself as an embezzler and surrenders to the ranks posthumously. <br /> <br /> I heard contradictory stories about how the employee invented Kizhe, involving ink stains and sneezing, but I heard that the movie was lost, so there was no way to find out what was going on. Then the movie appeared at the Barbican in London as part of its festival Prokofiev. For the record, it turned out that all that happens is that the employee confuses two words while writing an order and converts Kuzhe into Kizhe. As the Tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there is no time to correct the error. <br /> <br /> Having been waiting for a historical curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is very funny, and the audience, including myself, laughed continuously. Although most of it is filmed directly, set mainly in the palace, there are some "trick" shots in which multiple images appear on the screen. For example, the Tsar's army is represented by a small group, which is repeated on the screen. Four identical guards perform a perfect drill in perfect unison. Two identical servants rub the floor. <br /> <br /> One small drawback was that it was very difficult to find out who everyone was. There were two women who could have been the tsar's daughters, or a daughter and a servant or something else. And very few people were named. But in general, a nice movie and I'm surprised that it is not seen more often.
