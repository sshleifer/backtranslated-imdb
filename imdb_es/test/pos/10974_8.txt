No bullets, no secret agents, an entertaining story, fun and credible. I met some of the producers / actors in this movie in the theater. They seemed as interesting in person as their on-screen characters. You may not hear about this movie on television with high-quality commercials, but it's definitely worth checking out. I have spent $ 8 for a movie ticket in many other movies that were not so entertaining. Looking to the future to future projects of this production company.
