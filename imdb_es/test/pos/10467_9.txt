I just watched this movie this morning and it seemed a great sign of the richness of faith. Babette gave them another way of looking at life; It is not a replacement, but an improvement. She shared everything she had with those who gave her what little they had. I see the story of God here. He sent his only son to man. Man could not give anything that equaled that. Therefore, for our small sacrifice, we are given a definite treasure and we are transformed thanks to him. In this film, the locals of the city have been consumed with a small interpretation of God. Babette showed them that life and God can be beautiful in its fullest sense. The love that the son of God showed to man is the love that we must show one another and our lives will be richer for it. Even the movie is a metaphor. It seems slow at first, but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end. It was really a party.
