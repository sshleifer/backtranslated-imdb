Caddyshack 2 has a terrible reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a very important classic. People have criticized the film for many reasons, but ultimately, they remember the fact that this is not Caddyshack. <br /> <br /> I would start by saying that we should take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits, but I think it would be unfair. The movie has much in common with its predecessor. The topics related to the class of "snobs versus slobs" and the desire to adapt to a class superior to yours are as frequent here as they were in the first film. The two things that are really missing here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced by Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively. <br /> <br /> Now I will not try to argue that Ackroyd approaches Murray in The Movie, but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield. It comes out as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too much of either of them. I would not say that he is as close to being as fun as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack, but there is much more to his character and his dilemma in the film. <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase is just a pop. A handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Maybe these particular detractors did not realize that he only appeared a few times in the first movie. For my money, his scenes here are much more fun, although a bit over addressed. <br /> <br /> While I'm on the subject, it's really the over-addressing of this movie that puts it in evidence. He is much more timid in his attempts to make people laugh. Many of the jokes are complicated and there is too much of Gopher, which seems to have acquired a much more anthropomorphic personality and voice, in case we did not understand the idea that it is meant to be fun. <Br /> <br /> The characters are hammered similarly at home, particularly the yuppy children. Jackie Mason rarely loses a beat, and is very nice and very funny, but we do not need the tango sequence at all! The director clearly is not from the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Do not suggest that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a peculiar musical theme. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a funny and silly movie. with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at that time were saying. Do not be discouraged by the frighteningly low IMDb rating, check it yourself.
