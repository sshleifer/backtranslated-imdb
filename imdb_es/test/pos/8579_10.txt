It's a good movie. When two people from different backgrounds and social status think they have nothing to offer and, in the end, what each one needs is a testimony of what the heart knows. Sometimes we wonder why a man is with a woman or vice versa and external appearances say something in our eyes, but what is offered from within that we can not see is amazing and inexplicable. When Nimi thought that Matthew had nothing to offer him and when Matthew was just looking for an adventure (because he had an open marriage with his wife Jenny), in the end they realized that they could not and did not want to exist without the other. It was worth it to resist what family and friends thought and what society said was right to be together. This type of film restores my faith in love.
