This young filmmaker has the talent to capture his audience quickly with unusual camera work and scant but intense scripts. The concept of combining animation with live images is very well executed and the soundtrack is very good. <br /> <br /> The decision to release the film in twelve parts online places the responsibility of the director on making each episode fascinating enough for the viewer to invest in buying each upcoming episode. I just wish all the films had this kind of commitment to keep their audiences entertained throughout their stories. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
