I mean, let's be honest, all you have to do when modeling is pose for the photos. The trial is so exaggerated with his criticism. However, the show is entertaining, especially with Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, J Alexander and supermodel Twiggy. I've seen the season 5, 6, 7 and in the middle of season 8. It seems that American Idol became sexy, but I'm a boy and I only see him because of the hot girls who are posing in their bikinis. The show can be pretty boring, when it comes to judging, Tyra tends to go on and on and it's really unpleasant. Anyway I would recommend it? Yes, would you recommend it to women who want to enter the modeling business? Do not.
