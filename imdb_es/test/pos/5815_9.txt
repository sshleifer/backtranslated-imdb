Although it may not be the best work of Cassavetes, Minnie and Moskowitz are almost perfect in all their efforts. The plot is capricious and charming, and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotions, much more drama than comedy, against the profile of IMDb. Yes, the story is capricious, but not arbitrary; It has such a credible success, although a bit forced, to which I will return. All the artistic aspects are of the true form of Cassavetes: the cinematography and the camera work are a delight, and the soundtrack, although it hardly exists, is free. Also, I think I noticed some winks Godard and others in the editing, as I did in some of the other films of Cassavetes (ie, the abrupt cut of a song in a scene), which are interesting. <br /> <br /> I feel that the plot is very well constructed, with a particularly nice first half. Seymour's conversation with Morgan Morgan (Timothy Carey) in the restaurant, for example, is wonderfully funny and fascinating, and sets the tone of the philosophical comments made throughout the film. This philosophizing, a tradition in the Cassavetes films, is what the film did for me. The fun and deep monologues of Seymour instantly eliminate the first impressions one can have of him as a hippy simpie, although his character is curiously similar to his in Caras (1968). However, this inclined me (in the second visit) to the opinion that he is opposed to the best work of Cassavetes. I gained an affection for this film that I missed seeing it for the first time. <br /> <br /> There are, unfortunately, several aspects that make this film imperfect. I think the plot is unbalanced. As I said before, it accumulates very well, but it fades a little here and there, particularly towards the end. Due to the spontaneous style in which Cassavetes worked, and in particular to the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise, the quality of his product can easily go in any direction. In this case it is inconsistent. I evaluate that most of this film was improvised, and most beautifully. But one or two scenes, unfortunately, just do not work. In particular, the scene after Seymour's fight with Minnie's co-worker outside his home. During what is intended to be the most intense scene in the film, Cassavetes allowed his actors to run freely with the dialogue, assuming that some were planned in advance. This, I think, was a mistake. One has the impression that Cassel does not know very well what to do, since he repeatedly speaks in his speech, often without meaning, and overreacts; All this damaging the scene and the development of the character. I understand that Seymour intends to be a bit silly, but Cassel's attempts here are misapplied. Why is the mustache cut? These defects are the result of: a lack of direction in the Cassavetes part; a lack of understanding and foresight on the part of Cassel; lack of testing and preparation; Evidently, Cassavetes did not learn from his mistakes, since he allowed the same thing to happen in his next film, A Woman Under the Influence (1974): the scene of committing and the ending. <br /> <br /> The defects I mention are not minor, but they do not ruin the movie. They simply make some scenes irresponsible and unrealistic, spoiling the flow of the film and compromising its potential. However, I am very, very fond of Cassavetes and all his actors, particularly Cassel, despite the flaws I mentioned. This is a very nice movie, although it proves the precariousness of the Cassavetes style.
