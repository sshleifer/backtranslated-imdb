In general, I give this movie a decent 7.6. To begin, I will say that I love how the character was represented and adapted on the screen. If you read comics from time to time or simply see additional DVDs, you will see that Blade's character is drastically different from what we see in the movie. Among the changes, Blade is now more important half vampire, therefore, acquires "all his strengths, but none of his weaknesses." The merit of this is obviously due to David Goyer, a fanatical fellow of the darkest genre of comics. Thanks to him, Blade has become a much more interesting character and I really consider him one of my favorite antiheroes. Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, although some probably would have dragged Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (laughs). Her performance here does not need to be exactly an Oscar winner, for example, considering the character, but I'm glad she decides to play the DayWalker in the two sequels. They also star Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Alfred de Blade, so to speak. The acting is actually good and the action keeps the plot moving safely. The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts, I have to say. As much as this movie, there are some things that bother me that take away the classification of this movie with something like "Spider-Man" or "X-Men". Stephen Norrington had them portray the villains in a way that I did not like so sincerely. His lines were so full of comedies that they did not look like a comic book. Also, "La Magra" is a bit disappointing as the ultimate villain, but the intense sword fight makes up for it, I suppose. Not to mention a sense of lack of realism: a black man in a leather coat and a sword defeating the # $% ^ of a policeman in broad daylight, somehow, going unnoticed by the crowd that passed seemed like something good good. ..silly. Moving away from some of his flaws, Mark Isham's music was great and he adjusted very well to the movie. Luckily, all these problems are solved and improved in the surprising sequel "Blade 2".
