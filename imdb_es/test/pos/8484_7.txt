Ray is interesting in some places, and technically it's very well done, but Ray is often slow and forgets some important details about Ray's life. Everything the film shows us are parts where he is at his best, and the most successful, which is good, he just wanted to see some fragments of his older life as well. Jamie Fox imitates Ray Charles, sometimes it's absolutely strange. I have to say that Jamie is the reason why I went through this movie. The first half is much better than the second. It's more interesting, it has more Oomph and it's not as slow as the second. For starters, I was not a big fan of Ray Charles to be honest, so I really did not have any expectations for the movie, far from it. Ray's biggest problem had to be the excess. This could have been cut very easily, with more relevant scenes, apart from the ones they used. I found the first part of Ray's life when he was starting to succeed, the most interesting thing. He was humble at that time, and a little gentleman. And although the movie may have exaggerated his actions too much, he felt too full of himself to care. <br /> <br /> Performance. Jamie Fox gives a performance for all ages as Ray. He looks like Ray, he talks like Ray, he acts like Ray. He even sings like Ray! This is much more than an impression, I really thought he was, Ray Charles. He was the heart of the film, and without his presence, this movie would have been a total and absolute boredom. <br /> <br /> In a few words. Ray is interesting sometimes, terribly boring in others. When all was said and done, I was disappointed by how routine it seemed at times. Just because it is a bibliographic film, does not mean that it is automatically worthy of Oscar. Jamie Fox deserved his Oscar, but the movie is above average at best. It's worth seeing, but if I were you, I would keep my expectations at a comfortable level. <br /> <br /> 7/10
