The debut that ripped one of the brightest stars of the contemporary world from the darkness is a sure, if limited, stab at the game and the obsession. Filmed for zero money, Nolan could not have chosen a better subject than the monotonous and sordid interior of London to exercise his trade, given the lack of funds. This short (67 min) is the best in playing with the expectations of the audience and the protagonist over who is cheating whom, although the initial configuration sounds to some alarms in the credibility department. The muddy cinematography (often used natural lighting due to the budget) can be attributed mainly to the black stylization, although the limitations are sometimes shown. <br /> <br /> One can easily see Nolan's style developing in this budding effort; many of the issues of blurred identity and expectation are repeated in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a good one, and it's definitely worth a visit for fans of modern noir and nolan.
