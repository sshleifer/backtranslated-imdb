I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was released for the first time and it looked really good. Although I never had the opportunity to see it. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I thought I should see it. After all, I loved "Silence of the Lambs" and "Se7en", and if you liked those movies, you could get a kick from "The Cell". The whole concept of the story is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a murderer, I can not imagine the world in which they live. The acting is pretty decent. Jennifer Lopez is the only one I have to say that she was not so good, but she does a credible job. I would recommend it for a scary thriller. <br /> <br /> 7/10
