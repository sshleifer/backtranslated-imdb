There are many similarities between Never Say Never Again and Thunderball not only in Sean Connery, but also in the story and plot. except for the actors, all others are equal, such as the hijacking of atomic bombs, the ransom request, the trafficking of nuclear weapons on a ship, etc. The only difference is the place where the plot of the thunderball was produced. And in the thunderball, NATO / RAF loads the nuclear weapons in the plane and in Never Say Never Again it is modified by an "arm of Rouge of the Ax" and the air falls on EE. UU And he steals it in the Caribbean. Almost 99% is the same. If someone wants to dispute this, he is welcome.
