As many of today's films are guilty, the plot is not exactly stellar, the film does not move anyone, and certainly this does not guarantee any prize (maybe outside Blockbusters') ... but, again, who really Cares. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro come together to produce a very funny, sometimes hilarious movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner also played their small parts. Man, I hope that in the future my wife and Miss Renee have. <br /> <br /> Moving along, this "friend" friend movie produces great laughs in a reasonable amount of time. The film is nice enough to avoid waiting for the release of the video / DVD and, instead, go ahead and watch it. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is at his usual best and is really nice to watch. De Niro has adapted perfectly to this type of role. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and I think that any movie fan who needs a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy Showtime. <Br /> <br /> Top Performance: Murphy. Hilarious Enough talk. Management work: Nice. Good action scenes, we used Murphy and De Niro together as a charm, Russo was fed by good support work. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. It's not going to move you or anything ... but it's an extremely nice movie. <br /> <br /> It's Showtime ... it was a great success.
