SPOILER NOTHING MORE SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to add my name to the list of people who feel that other viewers simply do not understand it. But nobody has mentioned the "s" word that I have seen. <br /> <br /> While I agree that the child died, I think we can be more specific: he committed suicide. He runs down the slope in an old car, shoots from the cliff and ... "goes flying". Maybe the whole story of the form of death is an allegory or maybe suicide in a car as described. In any case, "it goes flying" (come on, it's not such a hard metaphor). <br /> <br /> Maybe I only have one thing with Tom Hanks, but it seemed good with the narration. Also, he is raising $ for the WWII memorial and you have to love him for that. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, I loved the movie and found it incredibly moving.
