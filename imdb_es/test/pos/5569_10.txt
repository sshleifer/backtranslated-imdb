Seeing this series will probably make you feel like our parents felt when they first saw Star Trek. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. The kind of stories that make you forget how to blink, the kind of characters that make you want to jump on TV to join the action and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair shrink with astonishment and endless admiration. <br /> <br /> In short, we start with John Chrichton, an astronaut, who is shot in a wormhole and ends with a gang of prisoners fleeing the black badguys, ironically known as Peacekeepers. <br /> <Br /> Other colorful characters are D'argo, a big guy with a bad temper and a sword / laser rifle. Aerun Sun, former peacekeeping agent and doctorate in criminals. Zotoh Zhan, which is a plant. Not really, she is. She is also a priest, but with a bad streak. There is also Dominar Rygel XVI, a fat, lazy bastard who sets fire to helium and generally does more harm than good. <br /> <br /> Later in the series, we find the sexiest alien that has ever appeared on television: Chiana. A young and apparently chronic Nebari. She is played by Gigi Edgley, which is a name you must remember. <br /> <br /> One of the many things I love about this series is that since John Chrichton ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake, he continues to give references to "real life". That is, when John has a bit of difficulty accepting the fact that he will be frozen like a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaints is that when he returns, Buffy The Vampire Slayer will be dead. <br /> <br /> So Frell all the other series, gather your Drain and pass an Ahn in one of these episodes. I can assure you that, Sci / Fi, as you know it, will change forever. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. It's sexy It's full of action. It `s hilarious. It's farscape
