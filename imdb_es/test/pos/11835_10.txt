This charming and well-written film is based on a New York play with the same title in which Sir Aubrey (Sir Charles Aubrey Smith in 1944) originated the role he plays in the film. Here, in 1931, we see him in the first part of his rebirth as an actor in the very early era of "talkies" and in the character role he would make until his death in 1948 after finishing his last performance in Little Women, which launched in 1949. <br /> <br /> This attractive work is about an elderly British aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and introduces himself to them, having taken them to his mansion in England. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies plays her daughter by mistake and is a tour de force for her. She is at once charming, impatient, superficial, charming, wise and compassionate, while creating an indelible and captivating character that remains well hidden in the memory. <br /> <br /> Ray Milland, 26, appears here in a small but prominent role had already appeared in seven other images and only in films for a little over two years. <br /> <br /> The film should be enjoyed as a representative of the production of the Hollywood factory of 1931, of course, and as such it is not. perfect. However, it is a delightful pleasure from the first scene to the last.
