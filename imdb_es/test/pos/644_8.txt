I just finished this movie and my only comment is "OH! WOW!" Jennifer Beals is fine as promised, but Yancy Butler as a dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite! Having seen her at WITCHBLADE, she was not prepared for pure unadulterated sensuality and the sexual emotion she throws on the screen. <br /> <br /> I have to watch THIS movie again ... even if it's only for Yancy Butler as Corrinne!
