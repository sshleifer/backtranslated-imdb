A warmly sentimental tale by the author of The Waltons. If someone threw the material at me, I would probably reject it for being too maudlin. But the dramatization here wields a tear without the expected embarrassment. Nobody in the 1950s was better at kind hay seeds than Arthur Hunnicutt. His appeal here is used consummately as a mountain man who is loyal to a loyal hunting dog. Their destinies are united as inseparably as any human bond. Good. I see a subtle environmental message here. All the bugs go to heaven, because how can we condemn any poor demon who simply follows the instinct to stay alive? There is no deception in the animal kingdom and yet, how cruelly we treat them often. A strangely satisfying episode that confirms this important message.
