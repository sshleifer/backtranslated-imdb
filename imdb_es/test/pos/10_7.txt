If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the movie, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theater feeling dissatisfied. After thinking about it a bit, I think the problem was the rhythm of the end. I feel that most of the movie moved a little slow, and then the ending developed very fast. So, I would say that the end left me disappointed. <br /> <br /> I thought the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher interpreted their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! In addition, the different relationships between the characters seemed very real. Also, I thought that the different plot lines were well developed. In general, it was a good movie and I would recommend watching it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Good characters, great plot, final badly written / edited. Still, go see it!
