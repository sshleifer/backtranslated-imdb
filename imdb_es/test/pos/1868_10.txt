This sitcom was a great crowd shooter in the year 1984-1985. It was a time when people could see deserted streets in most Indian cities crowded with people whenever there was a comedy on Indian television screens. All this was the result of the establishment of television broadcast stations throughout the Indian nation. This was one of the essential elements of the modernization of the strategy of the Indian television network adopted by the late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It was also continued by his son Rajiv Gandhi. This series provided clean entertainment that a large majority of the Indian television audience saw on their black and white televisions. The curious thing about this series is that it was sponsored by an indigenous company that is dedicated to Ayurvedic products. A couple of days ago, I could see some episodes of this series, but the general equation of laughter was missing. This continues to show that with the changing time of time the entertainment material loses its charm and takes over the minds of the people.
