The films of Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra have never disappointed. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil To Pagal Hai was fresh and perfect to watch. Mohabbatein is still one of my favorite movies. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Darr, although not the best, is a romantic thriller that is different from the aforementioned films, but definitely worth seeing. And SRK, who surprised me with an excellent performance in Baazigar, repeats an act of villain. And this time he receives an experienced Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol to support him. <br /> <br /> Before commenting on the performance, it's not just the performance, but the wonderful script that makes it worth seeing. It is the writing that complements the great performance. The story is exciting, but the characterization is what stands out. The comedy track is going well. But the movie has a tendency to change too much in romance. The spectator is bound to lose interest and you will make a couple of yawns. But the movie is still good. <br /> <br /> Shahrukh Khan is brilliant in his paper backed by the author. Shahrukh Khan, once again, is nice and cruel. You are forced to cry at the end. Juhi Chawla is decent. Their screams are destined to become annoying after a while. But in facial expression she is excellent. But his final scene is brilliant (although SRK eclipsed it). She has a paper backed by the author that makes her very pleasant. Sunny Deol is suitable. His character was very nice, but too perfect. And it gets boring after a while. Although it does a good job. Anupam Kher is really funny, but his role felt a little out of place. Tanvi Azmi supports well. <br /> <br /> The songs are nice and arrive at the right time. Jadoo Teri Nazar (Magic At Your Sight) is my favorite song, and the presentation is very similar to a 90s movie. Tu Mere Saamne (You are in front of me) and Likha Hai (Written here) are good love songs. Darwaza Band Kar Lo (Close the door) is also a decent love song. The instrumental song is danced to perfection, as well as the naughty wedding song Solah Button. The movie may not be perfect, but it's worth spending time, especially if your favorite actor is in it.
