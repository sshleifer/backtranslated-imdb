Once again, we are fortunate to see a magnificent opening scene where the work of the artists has been completely restored and we see this old-time grocery store on a corner with the snow falling gently. Inside are the rich colors of all merchandise, from canned and boxed products, to medicines, sweets, etc. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a story of those goods "that come to life", like animals on the labels of articles, or a cake, or even a pack of cigarettes. <br /> <br /> The whole "show" is narrated by "Jack Bunny", an imitator of Jack Benny, with music by director Leopold. Stokowski, who was in so many animated shorts of Looney Tunes, I lost count. Much of the humor is current, so it is worth knowing who is the "Little Egypt" and other characters. The Busby Berkeley "aqua" number with bathing sardines coming out of the can, and the dancing of tomato cans, they were very smart! <br /> <br /> All of the above, and more, was in the first half of this caricature of slightly longer than normal length. The second half was about a guy from King Kong who runs away from the "Animal Crackers" box and terrorizes everyone. That part was not much, and ended with a somewhat stupid note. So ... an "A" for the first half, a "D" for the second, making it a C-plus or B-minus in general.
