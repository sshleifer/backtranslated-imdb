I was 13 years old when I saw this movie very underappreciated at the ADAMS theater in Newark, NJ. I bought the Program and then I bought the soundtrack ... I still have both ... Now I am over 55 years old. and I have not seen it since (possibly once on the television network, in the 1960s) one of the best films ever assembled, great score and production. Please let another generation see this great movie ... It was my introduction to opera. , and it helped me with my understanding of tolerance .. Please, family of Gerswhins or Premingers, release this classic soon!
