Who won the Oscar for best actress in 1933? It should have been Laura Hope Crewes for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother in history. She really is one of the great actresses of character of all time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in "Camille" (1936) and her most memorable role is Aunt Pittypat in "Gone With the Wind". <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne was the "official" star of the film, but her scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamite. <br /> <br /> David (Joel McCrea) is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife, Christine (Irene Dunne) can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Center. His first stop in America is a visit to David's mother, Mrs. Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates all scenes is an incomplete statement. From his first entry, in a frantic effort to greet his "big boy", all his attention is on her. Even sitting around the tea table, when he forgets Hester's existence, even forgets how he drinks tea, you know something is not right (Hester has been living there for a while). <br /> <br /> Frances Dee is completely sweet and as fair in her role as the adorable Hester. His performance in this film, especially in the scene where he has a hysteria and the consequences, shows that the actress was underestimated. <br /> <br /> All the young people in the cast are excellent. Eric Linden is excellent as Robert, the youngest son who realizes that his mother is horrible, but can not do anything to escape the spell of his mother. Joel McCrea, at one point, says "paint roses in bathtubs, that's more your style". There is a very subtle suggestion in the film about Robert's sexuality. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne is excellent in any movie or genre she has ever tried.
