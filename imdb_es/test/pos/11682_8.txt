Let's start by saying first that I've been a punk fan for most of my life. I always had a kind of lack of respect for the Los Angeles scene of the early 80's, which documents The Decline of Western Civilization, with the exception of X and Black Flag, being more of the English punk type of New York. Then I saw this movie that completely changed. The people who show up may seem like a group of idiotic and skewered children who think they could achieve something beyond what is believed on the street through their lifestyles, but it is a great display of hedonism at its best, along with something fun and loud rock and roll. One of the best scenes, and in fact the most insightful, is the interview with Claude Bessy of Catholic Discipline, or "Kick-Boy," as the readers of Slash magazine knew him. Originally from France, he talks about punk as a dirty old Frenchman and gives clues to viewers about many aspects of punk or DIY, attitude towards music, politics and life in general. Darby Crash of the Germs appears as a complete idiot most of the time, but the performance of the Germs in Manimal is pretty decent, complete with a young Pat Smear. The performance of Black Flag with Chavo Pederast in the voice (it was filmed a couple of years before Henry Rollins joined the band) is decent, and X and FEAR give the best performances in the film. Watch for interviews with young punk children. You will hear some of the funniest things you have heard in a documentary. Highly recommended
