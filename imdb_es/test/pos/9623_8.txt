"Five Fingers of Death" is a classic of kung fu cinema of the 70s. Like the movie that "broke" the HK cinema to the west, this is a must for any fan of the genre. It's also a very entertaining film, with a shocking action, non-stop action, a solid and credible fight choreography and a great dub from the 70's era on top ("Oh, I see ... so what you want in a difficult way! HWA !! "). <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers" is a story of revenge, eye for eye ... and I mean literally, eye for eye! It's great to see Lo Lieh portraying a hero. He played many great villains later in his career, including Pai Mei in the classic FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUS, which was one of the characters that Tarantino used to create the Pai Mei of KILL BILL. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that I would like there to be a better quality DVD; mine seems like it was a VHS transfer. In general, this is a great movie, do not miss it! <br /> <br /> Bart Blackstone Film Club - Hollywood, CA
