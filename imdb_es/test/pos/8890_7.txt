A deliciously nasty black comedy about a middle-aged club (Danny DeVito) who wants to hit his mother and plans a plan to do so with a bitter divorcee, who wants to hit HIS ex-wife. The film does not completely apologize for its cynicism and it does not give us anything that we like, but for once that works in favor of the film instead of as a blackout. <br /> <br /> Anne Ramsey, like DeVito's mother in battle, steals the show in a grotesquely funny performance. Even though it's a horror, you end up rooting it, because it looks like you could kick DeVito and Crystal's ass at the same time with both hands tied behind your back. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
