I just came back home after watching The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit for the third time, I decided to jump to IMDb and see what others thought. I noticed that many Britons loved it, while those in the United States simply did not understand it. That really is not a surprise, since the United States does not understand what "English" is. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are very English. The middle class English, in fact, with a touch of eccentricity in good measure. The movie is very similar to our two heroes; Simple and unpretentious. It has a pleasant and smooth plot so that children do not get lost, but there is enough meat to keep adults entertained as well. There are some slight insinuations (which seem to have offended the evangelical, oh no, drama!), But there is nothing more rude than a background for a brief moment. When a year of plasticine offends people, you know that the world is in bad shape ... <br /> <br /> A quick note to those (all the Americans I've seen so far) who think that Chicken Run is A better movie: Chicken Run was made to please your sense of humor, and I think he suffered for that. Curse of the Were Rabbit is witty, English and intelligent. The Thomas The Tank Engine movie was ruined because it was made to please the Americans and I'm glad that Nick Park did not let that happen to another great British institution. <br /> <br /> In short: you can keep your Chicken Runs, your Shreks, your Madagasga, that kind of coarse comedy, coarse and slapstick simply does not compare to the wit and grace of Wallace and Gromit in Curse of the Were-Rabbit. English to the core, and for a long time Wallace and Gromit can remain so.
