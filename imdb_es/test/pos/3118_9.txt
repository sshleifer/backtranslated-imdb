The first time I saw this movie on television was in 1959, when I was eight years old. I did not know anything about Westerns at the time, but I recognized Ben Johnson from the movie "Mighty Joe Young." What attracted me to "Wagon Master" were the great songs sung by "Sons of the Pioneers". Merian C. Cooper, who produced the film, was the first to commission original music to fit the ambience of a specific scene and created the soundtrack of the modern movie. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the ambience of his classic King Kong creation. Steiner would then win an Oscar for the theme of "Gone with the Wind." Cooper was also the producer of "Mighty Joe Young." If you remember, the music was important for the great ape that would only respond to the sound of "Beautiful Dreamer" by Stephan Foster. In 1947, Cooper would partner with John Ford, who directed "Wagon Master." Of all the famous Ford westerns, this is my favorite, which features his brother Francis and a somber Janes Arness.
