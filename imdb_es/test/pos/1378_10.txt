On many levels it is very good. In fact, considering that it was a low budget British indie by a feature film director with a largely neophyte cast, it is a magnificent achievement. I do not know how much it cost. The figure of £ 8,000 was sold in advertising, but you never know how reliable that figure is. The point is that this movie seems to cost a couple of million pounds and clearly cost a small fraction of those great special effects, an excellent production design, effective accessories and costumes, excellent photography, good acting and direction, an impressive score and an absolutely impressive sound mix. Even having said that, a lot of the script was great. The characters were clearly identified and everyone had something to do with it. This is a movie about ten men, all dressed approximately the same in one place and it would be easy for them not to have blank spaces, without faces, but they were ten characters, mostly through dialogue and the way they reacted to the things. Throughout the middle act, when the plot was developing, the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. If the whole movie was like the second act, it would be awesome. <br /> <br /> Before the ship explodes, twelve people arrive at the individual escape pods or 'e-pods' that are thrown away from the ship. They are not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor people inside are trapped, cramped and have no real idea of ​​where they are going, but that makes sense. I like e-pods: they are an excellent idea very well made and they make more sense than a nice and spacious escape pod. I also like the way they tell us specifically, later, that they are designed to escape from ship to ship, but that they can almost cause the planet to fall into an emergency - because, let's face it, these guys were very lucky that his ship was flown so close to a planet. That said, I do not think there are 116 e-pods still unused on the freighter and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to enter an e-pod, but he stays with it. (And it just occurred to me: should not the Captain have fallen with his ship instead of being the first guy to get out of there?) Anyway, the e-pods land on an arid planet with nothing but sand and scarce vegetation. - or at least in a sandy part, with little vegetation on the planet, which may have icy debris and exuberant jungles in other places. No, it's a planet in a science fiction movie, it will be exactly the same in everything. We have to accept that all the e-pods fall a few miles away so that the ten survivors can gather, firing flares at the sky to locate each other. <br /> <br /> The Captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action movies if he gets the right agent, decides that they should try to communicate with 'Captain Behan' with whom they had the intention to meet. But they can not do this from the planet, they need to go into orbit. The engineer says that if you combine the energy units of two e-pods, they can probably give one of them enough juice to rise above the anti-gravel scribbles high enough to explode above the atmosphere. Everything can be done automatically, but you will need a 'pilot' to send the signal. The captain bravely volunteers for this, but in a commendable move, the engineer points out that putting the heavier man on the e-pod somewhat dodgily repaired is ridiculous and that he should be the lightest member of the team. That is a boy. I really liked the way he now points out that his name is David and the Captain starts using it, treating him with dignity and respect. That was a good story and a good characterization.
