My mother always told me to sit down and really watch this movie because it is one of her favorites, I never did it for years until I saw a night on TV. This movie was great, I do not even know how to explain it. Not only is the cast excellent (Julia Roberts, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt), but the story is incredible. It's strange but it's not very scary and it makes you think. I was speechless after this movie and I was surprised at how good the actors and the actress of these five people are. Where was William Baldwin, he's great. This film is a must for anyone, if you have not seen rent it, you will not regret it. Amazing!
