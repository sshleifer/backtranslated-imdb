This movie was very funny with just a little blood. They are two grave robbers who do business as usual when they discover that there is a different clientele that they can serve. This changes the direction of the corpses they collect. The film is told by the youngest of the two as he explains the business to a priest before he is sent to be beheaded. His partner had already been beheaded. The priest is required to take the last confession and take the form of a story. There are some animations released that give you a feeling of Tales from the Crypt. In the story we find another group of grave robbers that everyone fears, but at one point, a job is offered to the youngest of the two running, so this calms some of the animosity between the groups. When a woman joins the two men, she oversteps her limits and puts them in trouble with the dreaded grave robbers. The story leads to the meeting of the two groups, which led to the arrest of the man who confesses and the man who has already lost his mind.
