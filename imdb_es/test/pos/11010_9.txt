The premise of SF is not unique (although it was quite old at the time), but the approach is completely different from other artificial reality films. Especially during the first part, it is an elaborate crime image, which uses the premise of SF to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of the characters in flight and the useless witnesses that they do not have to lie be useless Instead of an unreliable narrator, we have an unreliable world. <br /> <br /> In the second part we follow the struggle of the main character for sanity and it becomes more a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation. Know that your own existence is nothing but electrical impulses, how do you handle this knowledge? He knows that there is a world that is more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where no one can understand him. The problem of thinking about knowing something essential about the world that no one else knows or wants to believe is very real with which many of us can identify. For me, the film transports this despair very well, with its artificial and sad atmosphere that also supports the objective artificiality of the film's world. <br /> <br /> Aside from 'The Matrix' or 'The Thirteenth Floor', he is not so preoccupied with evoking a sense of wonder at his artificial reality plot, instead he focuses a lot on the psychological aspects. Philosophy is only interesting until the moment when certain philosophical concepts are essential in the way they shape and alter the perception that the character has of the world. <br /> <br /> It could be said that it is longer than it should be (which is not a problem if you are as captivated by it as I was) and part 2 has a bit of steam.
