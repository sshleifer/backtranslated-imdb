While I can understand some of the points raised with respect to cinematography (I thought a more intentional approach would have better supported the low fidelity feel of a home movie) I must say that I thought that the screenplay and the performance of WHAT ALICE FOUND were excellent! Dean Bell has created a true jewel that Judith Ivey loves with a delight driven by the characters. His interpretation of Sandra is a pleasure: it develops, alternatively, as diabolical and romantic. We are intrigued and rejected at the same time for their actions ... and we are never given more information than necessary. The efforts of her and the cast of support meet the postmodern fairy tale of Bell with open arms. Emily Grace's Alice is infused with a magic of dead eyes. She seems to mold like mud before us, transforming into a kind of beautiful lost beast. In the end, we disagree with the words, as she is, saying goodbye to her mother. Congratulations must also be given to Jane Lincoln Taylor, whose mother provides the right amount of tragic historical weight, and to Justin Parkinson, whose shy first-time John, Sam, offers one of the sweetest, if not the most uncomfortable, sex. Scenes in the cinema. Bell has created a first class story and has assembled a lot of talent to do it.
