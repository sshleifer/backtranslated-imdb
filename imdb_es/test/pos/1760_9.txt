Leslie Carbaga's excellent book about the Fleishers tells the full story of Fleischer's great movement of his entire animation unit to Florida and his subsequent expulsion from Paramount. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bug Goes to Town did not destroy the credit of the animation pioneers with Paramount, although it is often said that way, and this was the favorite version of the Paramount story. According to Carbaga, the big studio, more than anything, wanted to put their gloves in the animation studio and free the famous brothers who fought completely. Mr. Bug gave them the pretext to do just that. - The sad closing of a great peculiar and innovative chapter in American animation. <br /> <br /> I also wanted to comment that the film debuted on December 4, 1941, not December 7. That may have been very close. Enough to do the trick, anyway, in terms of national mood damaging the success of the movie. But another part of the legend of this small and problematic movie is that she was murdered for having the bad luck of being in the theaters at the same time that Dumbo (launched on October 23, 1941) was still doing a great vacation business. I have not investigated the box office numbers, but I would say that the concurrent presence of Dumbo in the theaters probably had an impact on Mr. Bug. In this period, movies were at an all time high, and successful films could go strong in theaters for months. - Something unimaginable in these days of short duration, fast on DVD.
