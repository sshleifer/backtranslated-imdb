This Australian film shot in 1999 does a good job of portraying a group of petty criminals in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young aspiring crim, whose life is in danger after losing a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is quite credible with some very funny moments in a scene that revolves around a robbery to a bank. The configuration of several central themes of the story is quite well done. E.g. When a crim is looking for bullets for his weapon. Personally, I do not like gratuitous violence in movies, and in this sense, the film did not offend. He tried and managed to show us the human side of the bad guys like Bryan Brown. The rest of the cast did a good job, without any real highlights that I remember. The direction was very good to achieve a credible movie that would provide good entertainment. The main feature that makes this a good film is the performance and direction of Heath Ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-term gratification, thinking that he is indestructible and without realizing that there are people sinister waiting. to jump over any mistake. The director, Gregor Jordan, deserves a special mention. Qualification in my book - 7 (out of 10).
