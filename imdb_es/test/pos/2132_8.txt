In fact, I liked this movie, although this movie seems so hated and I think it's even better than The Deer Hunter, which was overrated. Both this movie and Year Of The Dragon are very underestimated, although I could see why someone would not like this movie. At three and a half hours, the film lasts too long and the second half of the film is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken are fighting for Isabelle Huppert, but can not decide which one to be with. Sam Waterston is the villain who has a list of 125 people who should be killed, and they are said to be anarchists and thieves. There is a great cast that also has Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and a young Mickey Rourke.
