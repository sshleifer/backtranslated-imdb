It has begun quietly. If you're looking for an action-packed movie, this is not the right choice. All the characters are slowly represented in the scene. Stroke after stroke on the canvas of the scene. No one can take the priest's hands, so the devotion of the sisters' lives can only remain in the village. Philippa and Martina know their destiny, belong only to the people. Then, when you understand that, you are in the scene of the movie, in the town that becomes everyone known at that time. When, no technology can allow you to imagine anything more than the campaign, the people, the sea. You feel the rhythm of the life of that old town. Watching the film on a cold, snowy afternoon can bring you closer to this dinner with sumptuous expectations ... <br /> <br /> The final prayer that gives a title to Babette's sacrifice away from Paris: an artist is never poor. <br /> <br /> Excellent photography. Many situations represent portraits and landscapes as they were designed on canvas there, in Jutland, in the 18th century.
