I usually like this movie a lot. The animation is supreme: which means that they took the trouble to animate the hair and skin of animals and people. And being a fan of graphics and animation (self-learning through books, for those who are curious about the same subject, I use Discreet's Gmax program, a free high-quality program that can be downloaded from the Internet). that the quality of the animation shown here is of high standards. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie is good. Although this film lacks character development, this story is still understandable. In general, I think that this movie should be seen mainly by people who are fans of the game, since its plot follows closely to the game. As for me, I do not play the games and, therefore, I do not have the effect of astonishment that probably has for the fans of the game. <br /> <br /> For those who like the game, I suggest this movie. , and if you have not played the game, I would recommend this movie.
