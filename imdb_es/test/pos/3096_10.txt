Successful films about metaphysical themes are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can attribute the big issue to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an incredibly good job. The objective of the film is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three parts: Creation, Paradise and The Golden Age. The images of each one are in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of 'The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial land, the scene does not go further to illustrate the myth. It lives on waste and on several specimens of destruction (fire, smoke, vandalized vehicles). The images of 'Paradise' are anything but that, and 'The Golden Age' is a dark comic? The highest culture is the strange musical act on the road. <br /> <br /> The Popol Vuh suggests that humanity is the central object of creation, but the film does everything possible to undo this notion. Its mythological framework has no reference in human historical time. There are no human characters to talk about. When a child is standing with a dog in an extended shot, the initial suggestion is from the child's point of view; In the end it is much more of the dog. Likewise, the lizard is a stronger character than the human who presents it, and the turtle's companion barely looks human with its large fins. <br /> <br /> Animal stories and documentaries of nature always anthropomorphize, but Fata Morgana has none of that. Certainly, the dunes look like a female body, but the simile cuts both ways. Presumably, only humans can easily distinguish between their creation and their nature, and here are presented aircraft and factories next to mountains, lakes and waterfalls. People and civilization are part of a larger natural landscape. <br /> <br /> In 1979, Herzog gave a new twist to the idea when he remade Nosferatu from the vampire's point of view.
