I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges, so I played it on DVD without having seen it before. I also instantly became a Kevin Spacey fan. <br /> <br /> In my experience, the general plot of "extraterrestrial in the human body" has come true, but I liked the approach adopted in K-PAX, which I found quite different and much more sensitive than the most. Bridges is an excellent doctor (you * want * to tell him what you have in mind) and Spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect on paper. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Prot and the completely human characters in the clinic is Enchanting, particularly the subtle manipulation of their behavior. <br /> <br /> The ending is bittersweet. I like the choice of Prot, but the final scenes (with Bridges) made me cry.
