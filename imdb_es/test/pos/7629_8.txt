The last dinosaur was one of those "out of the blue" movies of the 70's week that was quite exciting for the time, especially for fans of the Japanese films of Tokusatsu. Originally scheduled for a theatrical release (around when Dino King Kong was out last December) it was suddenly pulled out and turned into an ABC movie of the week of Friday night. Rankin Bass, who was no stranger to Japanese co-productions, were the weapons behind this production, co-produced with Tsuburaya Productions of Japan, the people who brought us Ultraman in various forms. Starring mainly an American cast that includes the late Richard Boone, Joan Van Ark and the late Steven Keats, he told the story of a prehistoric pocket in what was an overheated volcanic caldera somewhere in the icy arctic circle, which contains dinosaurs. It plays a lot like the films The Land Unknown (1956) and The Land That Time Forgot (1975) in feeling and rhythm. Sure the dinosaurs were men in suits (a Triceratops with front knees!) But they were filmed in such a way, the music and the score were so well done, and the cast did a good job that many did not care much about. We grew up in Godzilla. The film has a lot of class, from Nancy Wilson's initial score "The Last Dinosaur" to the "big" general feeling of the film, the locations in the hot springs in the north of Japan were excellent and exuberant, and the undeniable feeling of Kaiju Hey to it. There are some incredible pieces: the "bone yard" of the T-Rex and a tracking shot that takes us deep into the jungle to see the T-Rex eat a giant fish from a stream. The FX people of Tsuburaya did their work with style here and, apart from a few mate shots, they do their job well. This film is considered to be Japan's best "kaiju" movie of the 1970s, even during the five Godzilla films made during that decade. Rankin Bass made other co-productions with Tsuburaya providing the creatures or the miniatures - The Bermuda Depths (1978) and The Ivory Ape (1980), but none of them compared with the epic aspect of this film.
