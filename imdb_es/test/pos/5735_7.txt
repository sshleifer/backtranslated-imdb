A little curing egg, this one. I began to hate him, with his predictable configuration of 'Old Dark House', his constant references to the recent horrors of the USA. UU And regular trips up and down in dimly lit hallways. <br /> <br /> But it gets going and it has moments of originality. <br /> <br /> I started to wonder, once the murder started, how they were going to last only with a cast of six, but then we received flashbacks from a previous visit to the building and we see a lot of bloody murders that are quite effective. <br /> <br /> Naschy is fine and in the end it has been a pretty nice movie. Just do not jump and grab one, strong enough.
