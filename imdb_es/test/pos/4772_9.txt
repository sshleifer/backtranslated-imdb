SPOILERS <br /> <br /> As you may know, I have been commenting on many silent short films in recent months. Now, I have no idea why I'm commenting on Steamboat Willie, I guess I was desperate to comment on something, so I saw it and now I'm commenting on it. This, or course, is one of the first cartoons, and I think it's not the first cartoon with sound. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot. Mickey Mouse is driving a steamboat when Pete throws it and he drives it. When they stopped for the load, Minnie Mouse tried to climb but failed miserably. Mickey picks her up by a crane. Then, a goat eats its sheet of paper with Turkey in the Straw. They use the goat to make the song. When I say that, I mean they used the goat as Victrola. Mickey plays the animals on the steamboat for the instruments of the song. Then, an angry Pete throws Mickey into a potato room and Mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> In general, this is another silent and innovative short film. I mean, this is the third caricature of Mickey Mouse. Yes, the third. Also, this is not the first caricature with sound. I think there were two more before this one. Either way, this movie is really, very innovative. Mikcey was also more violent than him. I mean, he throws a potato at a bird and may have sacrificed it brutally. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Recommended films: Plane Crazy.
