In one of Charlie Chaplin's longest short films, he places Little Fellow in the trenches of World War I, where he brings his intolerable courtesy and infinite patience to the monotony of the life of the trenches, where the troops lived for months on end. the time, before finally going. at the top to overcome the enemy, and usually to their deaths. Someone of Chaplin's ability as a comedian makes something as dreary as trench warfare become such a brilliant comedy, but the irony he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions highly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Like all the best Chaplin films, short films and others, this one is full of bright and memorable scenes, like the scene in which he marks killings with a piece of chalk on a board in the ditch, erasing one when he gets his helmet shot out, the scene where he and his fellow soldiers slept under water, the opening of the beer bottle and the lighting of the cigarette, and of course, the overtaking of the enemy. All these scenes are shows that recall the most wonderful scenes of Chaplin. This one should not be lost!
