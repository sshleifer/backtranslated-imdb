Robert Cummings, Laraine Day and Jean Muir star in "And One Was Beautiful", a 1940 film also starring Billie Burke. In one hour and 15 minutes, this seems to have been a movie. B Cummings is a playboy, Ridley Crane, whom many women want, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Katherine is the most terrified of the two who likes to fix cars, and Helen is the blonde social butterfly with beautiful dresses. Ridley returns to the city and, believing that she will not be at a party, Helen decides not to attend. Since the party is offered by a family friend, his mother (Burke) sends Katherine in a covered dress. Ridley is there, and the two connect. But Ridley likes superficiality more, and when he sees Helen at a dinner party, they both take the place where they left him and went to a club. He gets drunk terribly, and Helen at first refuses to travel in her car because he does not let her drive. After walking a while and breaking the heel of her shoe, she gets into Ridley's car when he passes. He faints, and she takes the wheel, hitting and accidentally killing a cyclist. <br /> <br /> Ridley can not remember anything, so Helen allows her to take over the death. The heel of a woman's shoe is in the car, and Katherine sees her sister burying her shoes, and also, something in Helen's attitude makes her realize that Helen is not telling the truth. Ridley is condemned and goes to prison, and Helen marries a man who does not love and goes to South America. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, although at that time it was not an A-list cast. Cummings is playing a role that Robert Taylor would have played (it's an MGM movie): he's handsome and very nice, even if he does not have the dazzling look of someone like Taylor. Laraine Day is my favorite actress, someone MGM loaned constantly because they did not know what to do with her. Why, I wonder: a wonderful actress with a big face and voice, animated many movies. This is not different. Your Katherine is determined, friendly and totally charming. Jean Muir is a bad actress. <br /> <br /> So, who was the beautiful one? We all know even if MGM did not. <br /> <br /> Small gem highly recommended.
