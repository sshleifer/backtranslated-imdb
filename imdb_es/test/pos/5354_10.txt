There are some aspects of Park's films, and in particular Wallace & Gromit, which I would say make them so cool. The first is subtlety and observation, whose banner is the character of Gromit. He does not speak, he does not make any noise, all he has are the eyes, the forehead and the posture of the body, and with these he commands the film. Park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression. Comedy and emotion are transmitted through the most subtle movements and work very well. <br /> <br /> When watching the movie, you should be aware of the entire screen. Normally, they will guide you to things in movies, the screen will not be overwhelmed, there will not be many things to take your eyes off the track or main action. It seems that Park needs to look the other way with his films. Throw additional content to your audience, there is action in the background, next to the screen, even off the screen, and there is almost always something in the foreground to get your attention. His films are about multiple visualization and discovery, they are full of jokes and auxiliary action. <br /> <br /> Throughout this film there are layers of things happening on the screen, jokes in the foreground, maybe on a bottle label and background. Shadows that give the action. You can imagine that for Park the movies have always been an event, and the films that he loves are the ones he wants to see again and again. This is what is shown in his films, and in his most beloved characters. <br /> <br /> Then there are the strange and extravagant inventions that Wallace does, something that is reflected in the story and the twists and turns of the plot, everything is strange and out of place, but it seems perfectly normal in this world. You can imagine that inside Park is the mind of Wallace. <br /> <br /> There is also one more thing that makes these films so unique, and that is the precise hand animation and modeling. I must admit that I was worried when I learned that Dreamworks was involved in the making of this film, and I thought that they would take their computer animation experience to the forefront. What scared me was that Wallace and Gromit became CGI entities, or the smallest thing, that was used to clean the feeling that modeling brought to the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not like that. You can still see fingerprints and tool marks on the characters, and far from being distracted by the movie, this adds a lot of real feeling and a sense of physical depth to the characters and the scene on the screen. <br /> <br /> So, what about the movie? Well, I must say that the twist of the plot was something I had thought about a lot before the movie was in the movies and it did not surprise me, but that did not affect my enjoyment at all. Actually, watching the turn and the comic moment of discovery and reactions unfold was everything, and I was as impressed as if it were a thriller, but I laughed all the time. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was fascinating in several ways. To see the animation completed, how amazing the inventions are, how Wallace will get into trouble and Gromit will get it out, where all the cross references are in the film and where all the jokes are. I must admit that after talking with my friends I could not believe how much I had missed. <br /> <br /> There is something different in this movie than in the others, there is a new level of humor for adults here, and I do not mean rude jokes (although there is a couple who is so British that you can not help laughing ), I mean jokes that simply fly over children's heads but slap adults. The guy you're used to seeing comes from somewhere like Pixar. This only adds even more appeal to the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, let me try to be a bit negative here. I did not notice the voices in this movie, do you know how you listen to the actors and see if you can recognize them? Well, I was too involved in the movie to worry or realize who they were ... well, that's not negative. Let me try again. The main plot was not as strong and exciting as I had expected, and I found myself stuck in the stories and the characters themselves ... again ... that's not a bad thing, the movie was too rich entertainment. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not think of anything bad to say about this movie, probably the worst I could say is that the title sequence at the end is quite repetitive ... until the final title! Actually, that's the worst I can say. <br /> <br /> The story is very funny, well organized, well written, well executed. Here are many fantastic characters, not just Wallace and Gromit. There are so many things happening on the screen, so many references and jokes (check out Lady Tottingham dresses), cheese jokes everywhere, jokes for the whole family. The characters are incredibly absorbing and you'll find that you've taken them before you know it. There is so much in this movie for everyone. <br /> <br /> There's so much I can say and write, but I know it will quickly become a back exercise for Park and Aardman, which would also become a series of "this bit was really fun" and "there's a little when ... ", and what I would prefer is to tell you that this is an excellent movie, to see it and experience the whole thing for yourselves. . Although I will say that the bunnies are excellent!
