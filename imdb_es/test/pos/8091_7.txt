Great Charlie Chaplin comedy. I've seen Chaplin's 4 main films (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times and The Great Dictator), and I think it's easily the funniest of the four. This movie made me laugh more than almost any other I've seen. From the opening of the disclaimer ("Any similarity between the Grand Dictator and the owner of the hairdressing salon is purely coincidental"), the film is a laugh per minute with a mixture of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor. And at the same time, Chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution. Maybe a little short on the end and the lasting punctuality of the subject, but easily 9 out of 10 for me.
