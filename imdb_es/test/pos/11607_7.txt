Chokher bali ?? A work of passion. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel by Rabindranath Tagore of the same name, this is a classic story of cheating, adultery and exploitation of relationships. Established in 1900 in Bengal, director Rituparno Ghosh transformed the acclaimed literature of the laureates with the Nobel Prize into a delightful visual delight. <br /> <br /> The story of Tagore deals with the Bengali society, through its central character, the rebellious widow, who wishes to live a life of its own. They take us to the picturesque part of Bengal, where we meet our heroine, the beautiful and young widow Binodini (Aishwarya Rai). <br /> <br /> Despite their beautiful looks, two handsome men, the wealthy Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterji)) and his friend Behari (Toto Roychowdhury), denied having married her. <br /> <br /> Mahindra chooses a naive Ashalata (Raima Sen) about Binodini and marries her. Leaving behind the life in the field, Binodini, of free spirit, accompanies the mother of Mahindra to Calcutta as a caretaker. Soon, his friendship with Ashalata flourishes. It seems that the two, addressing each other as 'Chokher Bali' (sand in the eyes), share a lasting bond. Binodini, who speaks English, captures a special place in the house. But, soon, she unmasks her real face. Manipulating Ashlata, of good character, Binodini approaches Mahindra and fulfills his sexual desires. <br /> <br /> When she is expelled by Mahindra's enraged mother, Binodini seeks the consolation of a reluctant Behari. The remaining part of the story shows how the lives of these four characters intersect and culminate in an unimaginable climax. Aishwarya plays the role of a manipulative and rebellious lady, who continues to win the sympathy of the viewer with the elegance of a ballet dancer. The other main artists, Prosenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhury, are equally brilliant, as they represent their characters. <br /> <br /> While Tagore wrote this story 'breaks molds' in the late twentieth century The very idea of ​​widow marriage was a taboo, even among the upper class! In narrating the movement of freedom of the nations in parallel, the author affirms the importance of the individual freedom of the caged life. Congratulations to the art director, who gave life to the Bengal of the early twentieth century, and applause for the director of photography for capturing those scenarios with enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> This 'work of passion', by Tagore, has been fervently turned into. The screen of the most skilled filmmaker without losing its originality.
