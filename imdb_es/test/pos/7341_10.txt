Thanks for making such a wonderful escape. That's what I love about movies. I'm so impressed with the air, the way they filmed and the moment was so dynamically perfect with the music. I am also a dancer and, as part of many dance films, the choreography is usually cut, in cubes and, sometimes, not even the rhythm ..... "Showgirls" the movie. The relationship between the ladies was very present in the movement. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the last one, when it's stopped. I've seen the movie before, a different version, and I did not like the husband the last time. I felt a little more pity for him this time. Change what I feel for female love. Everything is so magical.
