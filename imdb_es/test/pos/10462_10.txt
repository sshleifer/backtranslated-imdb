this is one of the best movies I've seen in my life ... the dark landscape ... the isolation ... the ignorant and intolerant people who hide behind their religion ... a backdrop for some swear words and sophistication ... the performance is completely natural ... but for me, as "enthusiastic", the best is the actual choice and preparation of the banquet. I have spent some time in Paris and I know the kitchen well ... whether the Anglais coffee really exists or not. I do not know, but I do know of similar establishments, and Babette's menu and selection of wines are authentic ... and, of course, the end where in spite of themselves the perfect food returns to friendship is the only end that could have ... this is 10 out of 10 movies and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it
