Another well-made piece of moral ambiguity where the anti-hero makes it difficult to decide who to support. <br /> <br /> If nothing else "The Beguiled" silences anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in the movies. at least in 1971. There were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well chosen and well executed. <br /> <br /> Pamelyn Ferdin did a good job as Amy and would continue to play "Wanda June". This must have been the first time that an adult male box office star shared a prolonged kiss with a twelve-year-old girl in front of the camera, wondering if there was much controversy at that time. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene. Given the fate of the turtle of Amy "Randolph", it is not surprising that Ferdin was an animal rights activist. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page was also excellent, playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint. Interestingly, she died three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide (throwing herself through a fifth-floor window), since they had also worked together on "You're a great boy now." <br /> <br /> Hartman (who looks like she might be Blair Brown's sister) was wonderful as Edwina and should have won an Oscar (there was not another performance so close that year), but given what we now know about She wonders how much of her performance was studied. The effort and how much has just come out of it. Edwina shows such raw pain that it is hard to see. Like Marilyn Monroe's incredible performance in "The Misfits," the viewer is probably seeing many of his own demons in the character he plays. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's Jo Ann Harris, who is incredibly perfect as the flirtatious Carol. For my money, Harris was the sexiest actress of the 1970s, combining sensuality with intelligence and humor. She was the best reason to watch the television series "Most Wanted" and the only reason to see "Wild Wild West Revisited." It's hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star.
