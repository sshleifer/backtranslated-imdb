true love. true love. crazy Love. beautiful love. Ugly love dirty love. sad love. happy love. love fool love intelligent love precious love fool love Love Love. Minnie Moore understands that what she really needs is a man who trusts her, trusts her and loves her madly. Of course, when this man comes ... she tries to flee but seymour, wonderful seymour, he trusts her, he believes in her, so he will fight for her against her. I want to be like Seymour Moskowitz. I want to be that kind of man. A man willing to love without fear to fail but willing to fail. That is a kind of hero. That's my kind of hero ... and Minnie Moore is my kind of woman. Long live the cassavetes and all their adorable group!
