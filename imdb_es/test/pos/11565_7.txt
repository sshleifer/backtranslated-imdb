This is a cute little French comedy in silence about a man who bets on another who can not stay in this castle for an hour because he is being chased. And, once the boy enters the house, it looks much more like a crazed house of fun or maybe like the side effects of LSD. While there are ghosts and skeletons, there is a strange collection of animals, strange special effects and gags too. It is very difficult to describe, but only with the visual effects makes it worthwhile to watch the movie. HOWEVER, I understand that the self-indulgent director also had many "funny jokes" that totally collapsed and hurt the movie. His "camera tricks" were not so complicated, but annoying and stupid. IGNORE THESE AND KEEP OBSERVATION: it will improve. The movie is fast, funny and worth seeing. In particular, I really liked watching the performance and the Max Linder robbery, it was so expressive and fun! Too bad you practically forget today. For an interesting but very sad reading, check out the IMDb biography about him.
