An incredible performance! This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I know this is saying a lot, but I bet you will not regret having seen this movie. <br /> <br /> It's great from the beginning to the last second. The performance (especially of the mother, played by Judith Light) is so convincing, there are not many other films that I have seen that can compare with her, and it seems that it is impossible not to feel anything for the people in this drama. <br /> <br /> Every year many films are made, but if you have to choose just to see some in your life, make this one of them.
