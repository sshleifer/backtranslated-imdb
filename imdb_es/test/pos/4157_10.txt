This film is a poetic and impressionistic impression of the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear that might be associated with emigration. These are aspects that are often not considered in films about emigration to America in particular and to any country in general, and the film vividly and convincingly describes the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, of the poor and illiterate Sicilian immigrants in forecast of his emigration to the United States. <br /> <br /> They have some fantastic and unreal notions about the United States that are spread during the trip. One is that the rivers run with milk, an image that is represented in the film with a poetic and impressionistic effect. The film lacks sound and the silence seems to reflect the restlessness of the ignorance locals have about life in the United States, or if not ignorance, a vision significantly colored with superstition and fantasy. <br /> <br /> That said, the film shows with abrupt realism, the boat trip to the United States and the admission process that arrivals to Ellis Island had to undergo. The boat ride imagines itself as something boring, which surely was most of the time. The rooms in which the incoming residents sleep are represented as extremely full of beds separated from each other by four or five inches and devoid of much light, which surely was the case under the cover. <br /> <br /> Again, the film is not complemented by improper music or excessively bright lighting and the effect is to create a fairly realistic imagination of what it really was for people who migrate to the United States. The villagers may not be mundane, but they are quite reasonable, and the interaction with the greatest of the emigrants, Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) with the immigration officer who insists on particular results, is quite bittersweet insofar as they are not diluted or softened. the benefit of a syrupy conclusion and one sees the fusion of Sicilian realism with the extensive regulations that guide life in the United States. <br /> <br /> Immigrants and their history are very interesting and the combination of cold. The visual realism and the magical fantasy of the peoples' imaginations make possible a persuasive vision of the beliefs of the Sicilians, or of any other person, with little formal education that moves to the United States. The performance is similarly barebones; It is not at all demonstrative or striking, but it seems more realistic for it. That said, all the main artists, in particular Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), the clear leader of the group, are excellent. Although she never smiles, her character's actions speak much louder and it is clear that (fortunately) the other members of the group, her two children and the elderly man named Fortunata, the grandmother of the children, have faith in their leadership skills and respect its clarity. leadership. Amato imbues his character with great decency and frankness, and it is a testament to his abilities that his character is so capable and confident, while his character reveals very little emotion. <br /> <br /> One of the oddities of the film is a casual encounter with a mysterious Englishwoman (the excellent and appropriately mysterious Charlotte Gainsbourg) who speaks Italian and, throughout the film, we wonder why she goes to the States United. or what connection he has with the group of Sicilian emigrants, otherwise unanimous. In the end, this is finally revealed and the revelation is made in a typically realistic way and does not seem particularly melodramatic or striking. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Emmanuel Crialese, who has a firm understanding of the realistic, though sometimes superstitious, world view in which his characters inhabit and presents it competently and confidently. In fact, he's incredibly confident given how clumsy realism and superstition might have combined in the movie. It is a worthy examination of the immigrant experience.
