Amazing movie! Great combination of talents! I'm a big fan of David Duchovny and he's outstanding in this movie! I would love to see him in more films of this nature. His talents are definitely underutilized and he has much more to offer besides "Agent Mulder" (although I'm also a big fan of that series). Anyway, I want to see more of him. He is easily the Cary Grant of our generation. If you have not seen this movie, YOU MUST! A great love story that shows that love never dies ... is with you forever. Minnie Driver is great and how can you go wrong with a cast that contains Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Loggia and Mr. Belushi? This movie did not receive any kind of awards, but it deserved one. Good job Bonnie Hunt! ** By the way ... the soundtrack is great too! **
