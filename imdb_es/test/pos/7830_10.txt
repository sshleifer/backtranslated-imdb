This is one of the funniest movies that have been made. And for those of you who do not understand it, it's supposed to be fun. Very often, the comedies try to be so fun intentionally that they get lost, but here finally there is a movie that manages to be hilarious in the most subtle way. Even "parodies" lack the originality and the natural feel of this movie. It is a comic classic that will surely be appreciated at another time when the studios do this kind of thing regularly. congratulations to the creators, and to a cast of hilariously subtle actors, including Isaac Wade, whose performances are top-notch. Truly, a true star performance by a true underestimated stage actor. It will be great to see this man receive what he deserves.
