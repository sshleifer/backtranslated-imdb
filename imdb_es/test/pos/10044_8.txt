George Armstrong Custer is known throughout history as an inept general who led his grief to his death at the Battle of Little Big Horn. "They died with their boots on", he paints a different image of General Custer. In this film, he is portrayed as an extravagant soldier whose mistakes and mistakes are mainly due to his love of adventure. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer, whom we know for the first time as an overconfident recruit at West Point. . Custer is quickly distinguished from other cadets as a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. Somehow, this never seems to bother Custer and he just seems to confuse him since he really does not know how he gets into such situations. Despite his bad reputation, he eventually graduates and becomes an officer of the United States Army. Through an error, Custer receives a promotion in rank. Before this can be corrected, he leads a Union regiment in the battle against the Confederates. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, marries his girlfriend, Libby, who is played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is a sympathetic and understanding wife who stands firmly by his side and follows him to the frontier while taking over the leadership of the Seventh Cavalry Regiment. Custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the Native Americans. To prove his intentions, he enters into a treaty with Crazy Horse, the leader of the Sioux. When that treaty is threatened by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold found in the Black Hills, Custer sacrifices his own life, as well as the lives of the men under his command to avoid the massacre of thousands of innocent settlers. /> <br /> Errol Flynn dominates every scene in which it appears. He portrays Custer successfully as extravagant, arrogant, romantic and funny according to the mood of the scene. The representation of Libby Bacon Custer by Olivia De Havilland as the love of her life allows us to see her most tender and gentle side. The chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who acted together in several other films, is so smooth that it almost makes the viewer feel as if they are acting themselves and not the parts of Custer and his wife. The other actors who represent their characters really improve the performances of Flynn and De Havilland. Anthony Quinn as Crazy Horse, Sidney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott, Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this film entertaining. <br /> <br /> The critic would rate this as a 4 star movie. While it is not historically accurate, it is very entertaining. The movie has a bit of everything. It has adventure, comedy and romance, so it attracts a wide variety of audiences. The cast of the characters is excellent and the actors offer credible performances that make you forget that it relies heavily on fiction instead of fact. The reviewer especially likes that it was not shown that the Native Americans were the bad guys, but simply showed them that they wanted to protect their sacred land. <br /> <br />
