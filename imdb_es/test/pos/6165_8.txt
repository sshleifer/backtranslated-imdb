Compared to Battle of Britain, this is a real movie, with real characters and a real plot. Battle of Britain is basically a documentary with the occasional Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine, but the real protagonists are Spits, Hurricanes, etc. Here, on the other hand, you have two well-forged characters (actually three) and a real plot. I recommend it to anyone, even those who are not particularly fond of war movies. It's well filmed, and I wonder what the director could do if he had the big capitals behind him. And I do not think it's too sentimental. It's just that in the fighters you have real people, with real feelings and a real life, as real as any fictional life in any great movie.
