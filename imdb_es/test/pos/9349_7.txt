I've seen this movie more than once. It's not the best science fiction movie I've seen, but it's not a bad movie. The acting is good and the characters are more "real" than most in low budget science fiction. (At least it's not full of dumb bimbos like so many other low-budget scifi). I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She is a good actress and she cares as much about being a single mother as she is about anyone and better than some. <br /> <br /> Do not let the nay sayers miss you. See it for yourself and judge it for yourself.
