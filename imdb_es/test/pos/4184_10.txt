I do not understand why people are surprised that this movie does not make sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted in Frodis at that time). It was supposed to just be fun and make fun, and both do it wonderfully. <br /> <br /> The Monkees are good actors. They would not have been hired if they were not good actors. Mike likes non-existent things and darkness, Micky is the best comedian of psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people who thought he was so dumb in real life. Do not tell me they can not act, because they definitely can. <br /> <br /> They can also write. Sure, Jack and Bob get the unique credits, but in reality, they got a lot of help in the script for the Monkees, who were also in that smoke-filled room. <br /> <br /> (It is absolutely impossible to spoil this movie) The head is very symbolic. Among the most memorable elements is the black box, which was actually based on 2 things: the image of Monkee to which the children were linked, and the real black box in the Screen Gems lot where the band was kept between shots . There's a lot more symbolism in the movie that I'll let you see and understand. <br /> <br /> The music is incredible. "Circle Sky" is one of Papa Nez's best songs, and "Porpoise Song" and "As We Go Along" will captivate you. If you prefer to be missed, then "Ditty Diego", "Can You Dig It?" And "Long Title" should be satisfactory, excellent songs that they are. And then there's "Daddy's Song," no doubt a tribute to Davy's Broadway days, and the editing / color combination for that sequence is excellent. (At least for '68.) <br /> <br /> Oh, for those of you who are not going to see a 'PG' movie, you're missing out. Especially since Head was originally classified R in 1968. The score was reduced about twenty years later! <br /> <br /> Now, where was it? Ah, yes: "We were talking about beliefs, beliefs and conditioning ..."
