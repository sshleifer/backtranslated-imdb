This movie was an excellent performance, an excellent address and, in general, an excellent story. I have had real life experience with a guy like 'Radio'. In the soccer program of my city, every year we had a child with mental problems who practices, travels and has fun with the soccer team. This movie is really true and I can identify with it 100%. A boy like 'Radio' just needs to feel that he belongs to something; They need to feel that their life is worth it. This is how 'Radio' feels and that's why that type of program is set up in my high school. This is a very moving film that I'm glad I was taken to the big screen. My dad and I loved it and I will always remember it for being a movie that tells a fascinating story about the goodness and kindness of man.
