Sublime - perfect - profound - a real lesson about the idealized meaning of life. We are completely caught up in the journeys of Martina and Phillipa's life and <br /> <br /> Babette. Their longings, desires and sacrifices resonate long after the movie is over. Seeing him years ago, since he gained a lot of notoriety for the audacity of his subject, half of the film was a unique dinner, the audience was "animated and aahing" as some of the courses took their final. Br /> <br /> glorious form, laughing at the reaction of the guests, as they were seduced by the taste pleasures that Babette presented them, and were surprised by the turn of events at the end of the film. Later, watching the movie years after my own turns, I realized how deep the film is. In this vision the tears flowed freely. The film's <br /> <br /> meditation on the passage of time and the way it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life and love and art and generosity is something to appreciate <br /> <br />
