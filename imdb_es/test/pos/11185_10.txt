The curse of the island of the monkeys. Released exactly 6 years after the success of Monkey Island 2. You would think with the strange ending of Monkey Island 2 that would end with Monkey Island once and for all. But, everything turned out to be a trick to lure Guybrush into captivity. But enough about that, all this is that Monkey Island has returned, and the voices are just phenomenal. If LucasArts made a movie / caricature of Monkey Island, this would probably be what it would look like and what it sounds like. His argument is really good, and everything is simply amazing. If you have not heard of the Monkey Island series, buy the Monkey Island files or the Monkey Island boot pack and play through all the games that start with The Secret of Monkey Island, then Monkey Island 2 and The Curse of Monkey Island. Monkey Island 4 was really good, but this one surpasses them all.
