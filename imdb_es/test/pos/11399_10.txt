One of the things that I like about PT Anderson is that he has the guts to take the talent that most people push aside or push aside and make them stars. For example, a wash ... Burt Reynolds offers a great interpretation in this film. And if proving that Adam Sander can be a great actor (Punch Drunk Love) was not enough ... here comes Mark Whalburg ... as you've never seen him before. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people do. up "Boogie Nights" because they are anti-porn, or they just hate the adult industry and can not overlook that aspect of this movie. But below that there is a great story about the characters who lose everything and struggle to recover. There's a beautiful movie ... and it's a shame that enough people see it.
