If "Love Me Tonight" is "the musical for people who do not like musicals", it must be said that "The Gay Desperado" is definitely not a musical for people who do not like opera. In fact, although it is apparently based on a comic operetta, it is not really a musical, but rather a story of false bandits with unrelated interpolated arias to show the voice of a character; and what voice is it? <br /> <br /> Nino Martini, as the young singer Chivo who joins the troop of bandits to get a place on the radio (no, the plot does not make much more sense later or ...), It has a glorious golden tenor whose style has not dated in a day since the time it was recorded. The trills and distortions of some of his musical contemporaries belong to a past fad, but it is very easy to imagine Chivo singing "Nessun Dorma" to a crowd of the World Cup and surpassing the charts in the process. Unfortunately, although he has an attractive smile and a decent dramatic range, he is completely incapable of acting and singing at the same time. The result is that, otherwise, the fast-paced film stops chilling each time Chivo puts his hand on his chest and begins to declaim, and the tolerance of the result by the viewer is likely to depend on his appreciation of operatic performance. <Br /> <br /> Apart from this inconvenience, the film is a broad and fun satire on the Hollywood conventions and the stereotype of a Mexican bandit in particular, which achieves the vital objective of all those parodies by making his characters commit enough in their own right. Keep the interest of the viewer when the joke otherwise would have been obsolete. The boss bandit and his partner have the traditional double-act relationship, there is an enigmatic pawn with a face of carved teak and an energetic heroine (a young Ida Lupino) who performs the generic "you say you hate me but you really love me" routine with a refreshing touch. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is entertaining and quite funny, and I feel I got the value of my money, but it can not be denied that the musical interlude, while admirable in its own way, introduce serious rhythm problems .
