Family Guy has been very funny for a long time, but I feel that he lost his strong and random mood at the start of season 6. Although I enjoyed Blue Harvest, I felt that the remaining episodes were "ending", episodes that made the small producers attempt Meet the Family Guy reputation of American social satire. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the episodes of season 7 and I was completely surprised and happy that Family Guy has found his true colors again. Season 7 offers many fantastic episodes and lots of jokes about current situations in the United States, which is exactly what we need right now: more fun. <br /> <br /> I feel like the Simpsons have lost their spark. All in all, this show, however, has made a great recovery by proving how perfectly satirical it can be. Great job!
