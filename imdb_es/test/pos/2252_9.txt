I went to see this because I have some friends in Ukraine. but the movie moved me beyond what I expected to become a perfect mix of laughter in my belly (Alex's strange use of English) of situational comedy and the heaviness bordering depression. I loved the range. It made me want to jump into an old car and hit the road through Ukraine. alex (hutz) perfectly interprets his part of the guide and provides a great counterpoint to poker with the poker face of elijah woods. The film shows the positive side of humanity when people from different cultures can come together and do the right thing when they feel the sincerity of the situation, even when they entered it with preconceived notions and prejudices, and how this can open doors deeply buried memories . There is a lot in this movie.
