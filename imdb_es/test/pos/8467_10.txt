This movie is a strange movie, but interesting. I will tell you why it is very strange later in this review. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting because it was the first film that contained the sound. No, it may not be a movie of one hour and forty-two minutes, it may not contain great action scenes, but it's still a wonderful movie for me. It brought about a whole known revolution, so to speak, of sound films. This can be a bit strange to see, knowing that everyone in the movie is dead, I can hear the voice of a man who at first no longer makes the Earth visible, and that the sound is squeaky and broken. <Br /> <br /> I recommend this video for everyone to see. This created movies as we know them today!
