This series, although idealized and fictitious, has the extravagance, discomfort and good heart that come from living on an island. <br /> <br /> I lived in a secluded part of Hawaii for a few years. and I found some people fun, quirky and funny in some remote areas (not touristy). <br /> <br /> Every time I see the repetitions of this series, I compare with affection my memories of experiences outside - The parts of the road of Hawaii with the portrayed and fictional memories in Key West. <br /> <br /> This series is not reality television. I hate reality television. <br /> <br /> It's from the time when people were still writing creative television shows. Give me a "young writer" who will be inspired by the "angels in the dew, magicians in the palms and elves in the seashells" any day.
