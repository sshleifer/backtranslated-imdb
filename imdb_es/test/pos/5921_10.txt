This is a great story. Although there are some parts of Jimmy Stewart's corn ball, for the most part it is a compelling story about an individual with a compelling drive, vision and sense of adventure, to say the least. The bottom line is that it's one of my favorites to see and I've done it, probably dozens of times, that is, until someone stole it from a bag I left on a plane on a flight to California. <br /> <br /> Some have commented on many flashbacks, but I do not know a better way to keep a long flight interesting. For those of us who really fly, the flight can be hours of boredom interrupted by moments of terror. I would not have wanted to see the flight shortened at all. The oppressive need to sleep, the drone and the surrounding solitude is part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are many parts that I especially like, including the Long Island takeoff and the night landing in Paris (Wow, things have really changed with us and the French since then!). The scenes of construction of the airplane and the record flight of San Diego are interesting, as it is the incident on the Atlantic on the ice (which I understand is not entirely true, but it happened on the San Diego flight). <br /> <br /> One has the feeling that one of Lindbergh's greatest assets is his enlightened supporters and his persistence. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines that ring in my head from time to time include "Pull the chocks!" in the takeoff scene and "I hope I do not have to use it that way" when describing the submarine type "periscope" to the lady who loaned her a mirror so she could better see her instruments at the top. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone, but it certainly is for me. I hope they do it on DVD soon so I can replace my stolen version!
