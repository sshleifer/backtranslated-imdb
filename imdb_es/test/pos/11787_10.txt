After my daughter was born in 1983, I needed to lose weight. I tried the 20 minute workout and I was hooked. I lost about 50 lbs. It was the weight that I lost in my life. I can not believe that this show has been forgotten. It would be a blessing if I started a cable channel strictly for exercise and included the 20 minute workout. I think this was the best training video ever made. I would like to be able to buy it in some way and somewhere. The routine was easy to learn and you worked a lot. The workouts they have today are too complicated and difficult to learn. Please, do everything possible so that this video is back in circulation. I pray that it be a blessing to all who see and use it.
