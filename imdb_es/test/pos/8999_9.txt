I think several of the baseball movies of the United States are among the best films that have been made. When this film was in production and it was heard, it was described as a rugby movie. I read about the Highland team in the newspapers, but I did not have high expectations regarding this film about a sport that did not interest me. <br /> <br /> Last night I saw it "on demand" and I loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies. Ryan Little and the cast and crew did an amazing job. Neil McDonough was especially convincing. As the "bad father", he showed a fine range and a bow of subtle, but touching character. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the actors from the Pacific islands. I have been lucky enough to meet many of these good people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture. A flashback that shows how island culture became a key element of the Highland team would have been an excellent addition to the film. <br /> <br /> Some pretty catchy movies have recently been shot in Utah. It's good to see a quality movie like this one from Beehive State.
