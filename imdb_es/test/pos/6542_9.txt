This is one of the best car movies (It's a work of art / YER a work of art!) All classic cars are not fantastic plastic, I've seen them again and again. I have used two videotapes, and I will exhaust much more. Many more car lovers, young or old, will love this movie and will see it more than once! so buy it or buy it (just watch it) I would like you to make more (car) movies like this V8 with power not provisioned from small beaters! (engine magic) (the car pile) <br /> <br /> (you have to learn to feel the power)
