"THE KING OF THE QUEENS", in my opinion, is a pure success of CBS! Even though I've never seen all the episodes, I still enjoy it a lot. For that reason, it's hard for me to say what my favorite episode is. Even so, I must say that CBS really knows how to make a good situation comedy. Before finishing this, I would like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well designed and the writing is always very solid. In conclusion, if this program continues in syndication after it leaves the CBS, I recommend you catch it in case it leaves the air forever.
