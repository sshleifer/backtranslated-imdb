"The Piano Teacher" has to do with the character of Huppert; a middle-aged classical piano instructor with a Stoic fa√ßade behind which hides a powerful and aberrant personality. Unsatisfactory as a story but intriguing as a character study, the film follows the character of Huppert through the end of his anguished relationship with a student that offers excellent results in the process. Not for everyone, "The Piano Teacher" will play better with those of foreign films and dramas directed by characters that deal with obscure themes. (A-)
