I found this movie on television after 30 years or more. Several aspects of the film stood out even after seeing it many years after it was made. <br /> <br /> The story of the little known C Virgil Georghiu is remarkable, almost resembling the story of a man beaten by Tolstoy. by a cosmic scheme that he can not understand. Compare this film with more familiar contemporary works, such as Spelberg's "Schindler's List", and you will begin to realize that the trauma of World War II must be seen against the great canvas of racism, beyond the simplistic Nazi notion of Aryan against Jews. This film is about the displeasure of the Hungarians by the Romanians, the displeasure of the Romanians by the Russians and so on ... even touching the questionable relations of the Jews with their Romanian Christian friends, while they are under stress. <br /> <br /> Like me I have not read the book, it's hard to see how much the director and screenwriters have changed. For example, it is interesting to study the Romanian peasant's point of view of emigrating to the United States in order to earn money only to return to Romania and invest his profits there. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Johann Moritz character was probably one of the best roles played by Anthony Quinn, along with his work on "La Strada", "Zorba the Greek" and "Barabbas". <br /> <br /> The film's finest and most memorable sequence is the last, with Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi trying to smile. The father who takes a daughter born after the rape of his wife by the Russians is a story in itself, but the director can show the reconciliation with a simple gesture: the fact of taking the child without falling into melodramatic images . <br /> <br /> Today, after the death of Princess Diana, we often comment on the insensitive paparazzi. The final sequence is an accusation against the paparazzi and the insensitive media (director Verneuil also makes a similar comment during the court scene when the cameramen prepare to attack Moritz). <br /> <br /> The interaction between Church and State was so beautifully summarized in the laconic statement of the Orthodox priest "I ask God to guide those who have the power to use them well". <br /> <br /> Some of the brief shots, like those of a secretary of a minister who scribbles while listening to a petition, say a lot in so little archival material. The direction was so impressive that the edition takes a back seat. <br /> <br /> Finally, what impressed me most was the exquisite and rich texture of the colors offered by the Andreas Winding camera, from the brilliant sequences of credits to the end. I remembered that he was the cameraman of another favorite French film of mine called "Ramparts of Clay" directed by Jean-Louis Bertucelli. I have not seen so much use of colors in a long time, except for the epics of David Lean. <br /> <br /> There were flaws: I wish the character of Virna Lisi was more developed. I could never fully understand the character of Serge Reggiani, the only intellectual in the whole movie. The scene of the railway station at the end seems to be taken out of Sergio Leone's westerns. Finally, the film was essentially built around a love story that, unfortunately, takes a back seat. <br /> <br /> To summarize, this film impressed me in more than one department. History is relevant today as it was when it was made.
