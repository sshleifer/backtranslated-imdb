Tipping the Velvet (2002) (TV) was directed by Geoffrey Sax for BBC television. The basic plot is a story of coming of age for the protagonist, Nan Astley, well played by Rachael Stirling. As a teenager, Nan works in her family-run oyster house. Everyone expects her to stay at home, then marry an appropriate husband and settle into family life. Nan also expects this. <br /> <br /> Everything changes when Nan meets Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes), a beautiful and talented artist who dresses in men's clothes and captures the hearts of her audience. The audience includes Nan, who is sexually attracted to Kitty in a way that she is not attracted to her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows Nan to London and, through her ups (more or less) and her downs (horrible) as a lesbian impersonator and, sometimes, men. <br /> <br /> As is typical of the BBC, each role, no matter how small, is performed by an excellent actor. The BBC has a wide variety of performing artists that are truly wonderful. None of the supporting actors stick out in my mind, they were uniformly good. Both Stirling and Hawes are wonderful, and their acting takes the film along. <br /> <br /> It is always sad to remember how difficult life can be for someone who does not fit into the mold of society for what is normal. I know it's not easy for lesbians even in the United States, even today. Imagine the obstacles to love and happiness for lesbians in Victorian England. We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.
