This is an early one of the children, but some people may not be satisfied with this as everyone else. I thought it was different in some way than his average Stooge slap. He was more amused by his jokes than by the blow to the eye or the slap. Watch for a funny part when Larry grabs Moe's stethoscope and sings to him. Moe gives him a good punch. That part made me break for a good ten minutes. Another blow for the Stooges.
