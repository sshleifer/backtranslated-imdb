Yes, I give it a 10 because I compare it, not only with others of its kind, but also with the dredge with which it is bombarded daily in what is ridiculously called "popular culture" today. Apart from that, the film has a beautiful cast, as has been said elsewhere, and gives us a good idea of ​​the popular theater of the late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is no small coincidence that many of the plays that Olcott played involved a similar plot: the boy knows the girl, someone opposes him, (usually the father or some authority figure) the boy fights, the boy wins the girl. Actually, at that time it was known as "Chauncey Olcott Law". It's no coincidence, too, that John Ford ran one. He called him, "The quiet man." And, "My Wild Irish Rose", is, in itself, an "act Chauncey Olcott". Great things, right? Anyway, great songs, great things. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> PS: After watching the movie, I would like to know more about Bill Scanlan. I found an obit that said he quit "Mauvorneen" as a result of madness (replaced, as in the movie, by Chauncey Olcott) and died in an asylum several years later. But he had apparently been a great star in his own right, who wrote songs and plays and had works written for him. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know more?
