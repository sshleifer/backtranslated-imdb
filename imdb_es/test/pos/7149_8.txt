Leaving aside the work of the amateur camera, I thought that this film was very different and, unlike all the blogs and publications that I have read, I got something totally different from the end than others. The premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and its links with its church. How they should adhere to all rigid rules and regulations, but the daughter seems to have trouble staying on track, with unpleasant thoughts from others and her use of inappropriate language. However, she prays a lot, as does her family. Then, one day they go to a church picnic and they are in an accident. From there the parents and their brother change; what with being eliminated and "saved" by Jesus. WARNING: ALERT HIGH ALERT. Or that leads us to believe. I think if you only see this movie from the daughter's point of view, then you really pay attention at the end and you'll see that what we, the audience, think is a real fact with the parents and the child, is in fact quite a dream, and from the point of view of the daughter. This would explain many of the actions represented by the parents and the child, which were totally opposed to how they lived before, especially sex, and would also explain why Peggy got away with murder, etc. It is, but go back and look at the cake that Betty makes. That is unless Caroline eliminates all evidence that the cake was tied. And also the fact that the scene in which he sees his dead parents, lying in his arms, and his brother, all of whom seemed to die very peacefully, even if poisoned, fit with a sequence of dreams.
