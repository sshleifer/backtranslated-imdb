The show itself basically reflects the typical nature of average youth; Going partying and picking chicks is the common goal of weekend clubs. People do not like the program because of their "perverted" idea of ​​choosing girls using technique and strategic characterization, but the truth is that practically all young people do it in the club. In general, the program really appeals to the younger population, since we like to see the performance of a "player" in the club, since the program offers a comical approach made possible by the panel of judges. <br /> <br /> 10/10; a great, fun and exciting series that allows the audience to truly interact. Good job guys.
