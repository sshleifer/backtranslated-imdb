I only saw this movie once a quarter of a century ago, however, its impact has never left me and I can still remember my reactions to it. I was fascinated by the breadth and beauty of much of photography. I was surprised that a US studio could produce such a European film with its slow rhythm and its unfocused plot. The lack of strong characters felt like a flaw, but I was enraged by the completely unnecessary end on the yacht, which looked as if it was bolted to give some kind of cohesion to the plot and that was totally at odds with the style of the rest of the It was also comforting to see a western that did not simulate the brutality and exploitation that was so often the unfortunate detritus of the American dream. The scenes and Western sets also had an authenticity that was completely new to me and prefigured the recent Deadwood series. The film was cut in a massive way for the American audience and it is my real desire that in these days of Director's Cuts, Michael Cimino has the opportunity of a new edition in light of the reflection, a cut that could make this sick . predestined movie in the masterpiece that had the potential to become Now I have seen the first original cut and the network of relationships makes much more sense, although Christopher Walken is primarily responsible for carrying this out. I wish De Niro and not Kris Kristofferson would have played the lead role! There was still a massive concern to create reality and atmosphere to the detriment of a good script. However, the work of the camera was handled so skillfully that sometimes you could almost believe that you were inside the action yourself. And there were many special moments. All those who discussed in the room in different languages, trying to overcome their national differences and seeking a certain unity of action in the face of the impending disaster, gave a real idea of ​​the difficulties faced by US soldiers. US: especially when the threat came from a combination of the old elite and money. Nate's hesitant approach to Ella when she first visited her cabin contrasted with the violence that was to follow and was another. I had a special presentation with a large group of colleagues to see the new cut and we all enjoyed it at the same time that we had varied reservations. This revisionist and much closer to the actual version of the events was probably too much for the Americans when the movie was the first time. launched, but we all felt that it had enormous merit and that its place in the history of cinema was also due to a major revision
