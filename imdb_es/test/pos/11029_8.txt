This is one of my favorite movies, which goes back to my childhood. Located in the remote Siberian desert at the beginning of the century, a small community is agitated when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come down from the mountains in search of food, which take advantage of the peripheral farms. In this atmosphere, we are introduced to Avakum, a hermit fur hunter, who lives in the wild, as he approaches the village to sell his annual catch to Boris, his close and quite unique friend in the village, who runs a store . At the request of Boris, Avakum accompanies the arrogant son of his friend, Ivan, in search of the threatening tigers. The personalities collide and the spirits become furious when the older and more experienced Avakum criticizes Ivan's amateur methods, a meeting also observed by the other members of the hunt. On the second day, the hunters see their prey and pursue it. In a thick forest, Ivan injures one of the tigers, who then attacks the helpless man. Avakum, seeing that Ivan is entangled with the enraged beast, shoots, but accidentally hits Ivan. He kills the tiger while running away. The other hunters arrive on the scene, suspects. <br /> <br /> Back in the village, the doctor works to save the wounded Ivan. Avakum tries to leave the village, but is confronted by Ivan's friends. However, the trapper removes them and hurries with his sled pulled by dogs. The young villagers swear that they will go after him if Ivan dies, which he will do later, but before he dies he explains to his father that it was an accident. Old Boris, upon learning that his close friend had left the village, arranges the "mob of lynchings" and goes after Avakum, to find him and fix things. And so the main story begins. <br /> <br /> A simple film, which raises the conflict between man and civilization against nature, mainly Avakum's struggle to survive alone in the desert. The winter landscape is very well filmed. Perhaps the strongest element in the movie is the soundtrack of Jimmie Haskell. Very sentimental and evocative, the main theme reminiscent of Albinoni's Adagio. Other movements reflect Russian styles, as well as a couple of folk music melodies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not available for purchase, as far as I know, which is rather a pity. The copy I have, recorded off television almost twenty years ago, is slowly deteriorating. This film is a must for those who can appreciate it, if they can find it. 8/10
