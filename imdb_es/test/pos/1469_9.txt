Going 'Down To South Park is a 1-hour documentary about South Park with interviews with Trey Parker and Matt STone and all the other people who work in South Park. There really is not much to say, it shows the history of South Park and what it takes to make an episode. It's basically a scene behind the show's stage. It shows the different merchandise that South Park has made (it was really a central comedy that took it out). It also shows the controversy caused by South Park. It also shows many funny clips of the program. It's a pretty funny documentary. Any fan of South Park should see this. You can find it on YouTube. <Br /> <br /> 9/10
