If you like 80's rock, you should definitely watch this movie. I've only seen him recently and I fell completely in love with him. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very entertaining, it gives you a lot of rock songs and not a second of the movie. Find boring! It was a great idea that some of the real-life musicians were in this, doing what they do best. I was glad to see Zakk, as well as Blas Elias, they all offered solid performances. I tend to agree with many people who say that the first half of the movie was much better than the second half, especially in terms of the script. It could have worked a little better, but not a big problem. One thing that bothered me a bit was the performance of Jennifer Aniston. I thought that she was not the right person for this role, I just could not see her as a rock star girlfriend. But as the movie continues, somehow you realize that you did a good job with this. Of the honesty and the sincerity that she gives, that simply does not make you feel cold. <br /> <br /> To summarize, a good and funny movie, that does not go into the characters, but gives you good fun, a feeling of nostalgia and, of course, the powerful voices of Jeff Scott Soto and Mike Matijevic!
