Why did Ramón (Carlos Fuentes) take his five classmates from the university to an abandoned and spooky school building that used to serve children from the wealth of black sheep? That answer could be in a newspaper in his possession, supposedly written by his dying father. What they come in contact with is, in fact, a revived episode involving another group of six, with five of them presumably facing graphic destinies by a sadistic security guard (Paul Naschy) that happened 20 or more years ago. years. But, while looking for a way to escape from this place, terror waits for them while that horrible moment in time is repeated while the group runs for their lives, often in panic states when the killer begins to hunt and destroy them in different ways . shapes. Will Ramon and some of his friends survive this night of horror or will they become ghosts forever on the same night as those who preceded them? <br /> <br /> The elegant Spanish slasher has that professional brilliance and a powerful and powerful violence that it combines. Some ingenious exchanges between the characters ... in their dialogue are references of pop culture to American horror films that can annoy some viewers. An insane Naschy is really fierce with children while attacking them happily ... a maniac thirsty for blood who performs his violent acts with gusto. I found the noisy musical sounds a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the film as reminders for the audience. I do not think these tricks are necessarily necessary, but I felt that the director wanted to communicate in depth with the viewer, therefore, the use of signals and flashbacks. A small detour for the plot of this film keeps moving and the camera follows the rhythm of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation that is presented to them. Your enjoyment of this movie may ultimately be reduced to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. Moments in time revived and a murderer who continues his work apparently from the grave. The turn seems a bit shocking and abrupt, but this could (or might not) work out how the story unfolds with respect to why Ramón's father is shown among those ghosts who represent those grisly events two decades before. . I will say that this movie probably would not hold if it is analyzed in detail, but like a slasher hit, it is a breath of fresh air.
