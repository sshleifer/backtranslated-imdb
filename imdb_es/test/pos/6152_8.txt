This feels like it's a Czech version of Pearl Harbor. It has the same story, both boys fall in love with the same woman. And to this we must add that the woman is actually a married woman whose husband has been missing for a year. I do not think the story line is too strong. The younger guy is pretty naughty, that's nice. He kept me watching because of the emotional music and the nice scenes one after the other. It also has some strong special visual effects. Best of all, the love stories are perfectly integrated with the story. <br /> <br /> I think if it were in English, it would be a great opportunity in every state. It is a pity that there are not many people open for foreign films.
