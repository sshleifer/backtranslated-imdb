My wife and I watched this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much. We wanted to see her again. It was so moving that I called it a tearful tear. The mystery that Billings was sent to inform is not really any mystery. Anglos !! It seems that every time he turned around, something happened to him, everything was fine, and I think that scared George a little, considering that he did not realize what he had gotten himself into. It simply shows that even the cold heart can change with the right attitude. If we could all treat each other in the same way, the world would be a better place. To date, we have been searching the network for a copy of it, now I finally have a connection with it, as soon as I can find a copy. To buy what I'm going to grab.
