Although it is generally recognized as one of the first martial arts films to be played here in the West, its real impact is retrospective. The Lieh is VERY low profile and many of the fight scenes, although often considered innovative (as they were at the time of the initial release of the film), are somewhat less than what came after (especially after that Bruce Lee, who became the instant standard by which everyone else will be judged forever). That does not mean that FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH / KING BOXER is anything less than a classic in its own right, because it is. Like many of the main characters in many martial arts films, the character that Lieh plays stops for most of the movie for a reason, but when it is released, it effectively cleans the house. You can not ask for more than that.
