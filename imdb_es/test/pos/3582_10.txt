The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best series of nature we have ever seen. The episode deep down is like traveling to outer space! We have seen this with our children of 10 and 7 years and the four of us have not been able to get away. We read a negative comment about this and we could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned at school. It is also the best view we have seen from any television or movie in the delicate balance of the ecosystem of our land. The amount of time and effort in capturing these shots is very evident when you sit down and watch this series. <br /> <br /> A must for all.
