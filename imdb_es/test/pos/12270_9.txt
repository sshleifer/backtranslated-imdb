This was a very pleasant surprise. Last night I got up late and could not sleep. I really did not think twice, I turned on my TV and HBO was on, and this movie was just beginning. Luckily I saw everything, and I am very happy to have done it. Because this movie was very good. The actors were well chosen and did a surprisingly good job. Kris Kristofferson had a solid performance, there was a lot of substance behind his lines. This movie made me realize that he is a good actor. Brian Keith was great like his father, like Trey Wilson playing the Colonel (this was the last role of Trey Wilson before his untimely death, too bad, he was a quality actor and he seemed like a good guy). Jobeth Williams also did a good job as Kristofferson's American wife. As for direction, I had no idea that Franklin J. Schaffner was the director until I read the review in the Leonard Maltin Film Guide (this was the last film he made). Now I understand why this movie was so good. Schaffner also directed Patton, a really great movie (I have not seen his other great movie, Papillon). While looking at "Welcome Home," I said to myself, "this director really knows what he's doing," not knowing that Schaffner had directed it. There is a really beautiful scene in an orphanage shelter in Thailand, enough to bring tears to my eyes. This was not only directed with sensitivity, but was also directed in a very economical and tense way. There is nothing lost in Schaffner's effort. The script was one of the reasons why this movie is so good. The writer does not weigh the actors with too many lines. It was written very simple but very effectively. It only shows you that you can say a lot with few words. This film also made me proud to be American, at the same time it showed how beautiful ALL people are.
