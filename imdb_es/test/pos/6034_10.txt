After repeatedly saying how brilliant Columbo's episodes are, it's time to honor an episode with the maximum points. "Etude In Black" is not 100 percent perfect, but it's certainly more than 90 percent ... maybe 96 or 97! <br /> <br /> Last week I reviewed "Just Married" and compared it unfavorably with "Meet The Parents". Well, here is one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a very old role as wife of the famous conductor Alex Benedict, played by the legend that is John Cassavetes. Alex has been having an affair with Jennifer Wells, a girl from the orchestra (it's not her first romance, one suspects). She is blackmailing Alex into abandoning his wife, but since his wife's mother is holding the orchestra's funds, Alex does not think it's such a smart decision to destroy his career and his marriage overnight. Instead, he plots a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murders his young lover while making it look like suicide. <br /> <br /> Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes about two seconds to realize that homicide is more likely to be more than suicide. Columbo does not take much longer to connect Alex with the victim, and soon follows him to wherever he goes. Even though Columbo is sure that Alex is his man, it actually takes quite some time and some false leads (none of which Columbo really swallows) before he has the vital piece of evidence. <br /> <br /> On the way there There are some additional top-notch characters, from the early neighbor of Jennifer Wells and the English mechanics who seems to be more at home in Coronation Street, to the disheveled metal player who He is almost ready for murder. (He had also been watching Jennifer Wells, the busy girl!) And there is even a short cameo by Commander Lassard of the films of the Police Academy. As with Leslie Nielsen in "Lady In Waiting," it's impossible to take it seriously (I bet you're thinking about the speech she gave on the podium, right?) <br /> <br /> But it's Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk who stole the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine like Mrs. Benedict. From the moment she sees Alex dialing Jennifer Wells' number by heart, she feels deeply worried about exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as he struggles to trust Alex even though his intuition tells him something is very, very wrong. Columbo does not help matters by interrupting his tennis game to ask impertinent questions about Alex's relationship with members of his orchestra. <br /> <br /> As for John Cassavetes, well, it's a shame he does not repeat appearances as Columbo villains, because he could have been there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the great showbiz greats . But this performance is excellent! He is another who falls into the category "highly irritated", losing all patience with Columbo instead of befriending him and pleasing him. Despite this, when the game finally ends, he grudgingly acknowledges Columbo's genius. <br /> <br /> Well, it's a really fantastic show. He loses a couple of very small points for his rather deep vision of classical music, as many of the posters here highlight, but none of them has any relation to the logic of the story or the characterizations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting! <br /> <br /> Finally, if you have not found it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70's. I am totally convinced that Steve Coogan saw this clip and based Alan Partridge in him. Everything related to the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You, from the cringewy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra participates in the act, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and his friend Ben Gazzara cheat and ridicule the host. <br /> <br /> It may not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip gives a good insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It is clear that you can see in the quality of "Etude In Black" how well they worked together!
