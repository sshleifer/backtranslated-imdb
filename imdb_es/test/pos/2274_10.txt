In Everything is Illuminated, Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American who searches for the woman who saved his grandfather during World War II. In a certain sense, the woman who saved her entire family. <br /> <br /> This is a sincere story about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. A stranger in a strange land so to speak. Jonathan is not fully prepared for this adventure, it sticks out like a sore thumb in Ukraine (it would probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere). But what he discovers is more, much more than he anticipated. This movie will make you laugh and it will make you cry. Elijah Wood is really good at this movie, based on Jonathan Safran Foer's novel. <br /> <br /> From someone I spoke with, this movie is something different from the book. A book that I collect is really good. However, this is a good movie, it has something for everyone and I really enjoyed it. Can someone say Oscar?
