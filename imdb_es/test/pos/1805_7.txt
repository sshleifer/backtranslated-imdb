I have seen this movie several times and every time I see it, it becomes more extravagant and fun. Maybe it's the lack of research that was done on the "punk" character of Nicolas Cage's character or simply the cheese factor because it was a typical movie of the eighties ... however, it's a cute love story with characters Extremely fun and unique. I think it lives up to "Fast Times" and "Weird Science" (films of the eighties par excellence).
