Having studied Western History while studying at the university, the views about the Second World War are quite uncomfortable and, in general, wrong. The Second World War was the most graphic and bloody case that has happened in world history. While the Axis Powers carried out many crimes against humanity, which is still the point of view today and the right people forget that not all German soldiers went to exterminate the Jewish population, not all Japanese soldiers turned a samurai sword and flew kamikaze missions, All Italian soldiers were fascists. Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you and me, trapped in a terrible conflict, and by chance we fought for a country they loved. <br /> <br /> The Battle of Stalingrad was possibly the most lethal battle. in world history with more than 1,500,000 casualties suffered in the course of the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader, Lieutenant von Witzland, when they are reassigned to the Eastern Front to fight the Soviets in Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as a kind of main character along with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They are all normal men and they seem completely unaware of what is happening in Germany and Poland. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the course of the battle. The film is generally very grim when it comes to its depiction of combat and the life of a soldier during the battle. We are shown numerous frightful battles and intense violence outside the battles (including a firing squad sequence). In general, battles are the first examples I know that portray the loss of members and, in general, the sequences of death and violence. Much of the inspiration for the battle sequences of Saving Private Ryan seems to have come from this movie. <br /> <br /> The film does not pretend that the German is completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the army's highest-ranking officers are represented in the usual view that most people are accustomed to, evil. Most soldiers are normal people who often talk about their home. The film makes it very clear that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and the army were totally oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that soldiers in the German Army were simply fighting for a cause they did not really understand and that most wanted to simply return home instead of freezing to negative temperatures in Russia. <br /> <br /> The movie really shows what the hellish war is like, especially the Second World War. The battle scenes will surprise you with their harsh realism and the story is pretty easy to follow, since you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As in most war movies, do not expect much happiness after watching it. It will leave you a little depressed just to see the life that most soldiers faced on the Eastern Front. Not recommended for children. <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
