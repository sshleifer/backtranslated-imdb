Woohoo! It's even better than I expected! The best animated Asterix movie of all time! And it feels so good to listen to Roger Carel make Asterix's voice again! Surely I recommend it to everyone who likes Asterix comics! But I suggest you go see the French version, because it is probably the best and you listen to the original cast! Did you know that Roger Carel has played Asterix for almost forty years? I think he did a wonderful job! And the CÃ©line Dion song at the end fits well with the final credits! The music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are wonderful ... in a word: a masterpiece! Go see it! You will not regret this!
