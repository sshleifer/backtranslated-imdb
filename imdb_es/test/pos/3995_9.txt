No wonder that this movie was made by I'm Kwon Taek at the time it was. He examined the early beauty and tragedy of the life of the Chosun dynasty in Seopyonje and delightedly explored a well-known Korean folktale in Chunhyang, which included his last two films. What is even more surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon, his 2002 offer, is not presented in the pansori style of those two previous films. <br /> <br /> However, I'm experienced hand out ahead. We explore together the life of a real person: a Chosun dynasty painter of the late nineteenth century who enters the limit of modernity but who is not a nobleman and who, therefore, causes a stir in contemporary Korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old Korean noble class and his contempt for aspiring Japanese dominant settlers alike. The painter, Chang Seung Up, popularly known as Oh Won (played magnificently by Choi Min Sik, the famous star of the already legendary "OldBoy" of Park Chan Wook) becomes increasingly influential and therefore more dangerous throughout. the movie. Contemporary Korean audiences will support a hero like this despite the fact, or perhaps due to the fact that he was so isolated in his time. The sense of beauty and the simultaneous tragedy of history remains intact. I am a master at capturing the past idiosyncrasies of his country, and in this film he almost surpasses himself. As expected in an I'm movie, the cinematography is impressive, the editing is accurate and the story is fundamental. <br /> <br /> Arguments against Seung Up are established, family ties are tested and broken, scandalous behavior is alleged (and sometimes real), all to overthrow the man who "painted fire". But against all the complexities of the detailed but sometimes complicated story of Seung Up's life, Seung Up himself manages to survive. It becomes legendary due to its ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after a single glance. Art dealers and agents besiege him and try to make money with "Oh Won". In other words, begin to form lines of people who want to take advantage of the real Seung Up, an artistic star. But he refuses to be manipulated. His intelligence to avoid both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience, if not the cast. <br /> <br /> What does Seung Up think? He has powerful emotions and opinions about painting, like the aesthetic belief that paintings are living beings and never really end. Despise those who try to turn art into profit. And he does not care about the politicians who use their power to carry the artistic beauty around him and then get rid of the artist as a traitor. But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the disorders that lie ahead. Horrible scenes are presented involving foreign invaders from France and Japan. The epic historical motive of the firm, and its influence in the kingdom, remains in a prominent place in this multi-million dollar epic. <br /> <br /> The protagonist causes more pain for him and for those who take care of him when he refuses to paint. This is when history acquires a completely new meaning, one that is not only political, but of a social nature. I deal with the issues in a realistic and praiseworthy way. <br /> <br /> He, Oh Won, becomes a figure of Jesus. People believe he is capable of performing artistic miracles and the government feels he needs his artistic support, but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and dismissive of what others want him to do. Eventually, both the government and the people come down on Seung Up in a way straight out of the Bible. His holiness becomes human; His humanity is not accepted; He dies for (or escapes) the sins of commoners, art critics, politicians, who harass him. <br /> <br /> But he dies? As with most I'm movies, there remains one question. In this case, does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit? The film does not address that issue; it simply presents a possible ending for the real man of Chang Seung Up, or Oh Won. Death is not represented because death is not known. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find faults in this movie, but I've become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in their culture that when it does, it's no longer surprising. As usual in I'm movies, cinematography, editing and writing are top-notch. It is a well-crafted film imbued with the strange ability to tell stories. Of course, he can be better at doing this through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori. Still, the film contains extensions of this admirable form of art and, by the end, viewers feel that they have become deprived of a great untold story. And they have it, because that, precisely, is the gift that I have.
