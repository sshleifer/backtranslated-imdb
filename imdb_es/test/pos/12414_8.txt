This is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night. If you like some laughter with your horror, this is the movie for you. The foundations of a true cult classic. It has everything you would want to see in a horror movie. A beautiful girl, A hero, The jester, A TRUCK OF MONSTERS and of course a family of mutant satanic assassins. This one is full of blood, guts and blood. I highly recommend seeing this first thing in the morning, and be careful who you see entertained by the sounds of Monster trucks, Bad {But Funny} One liners and our hero eating the stew of the eyeball. Not as good as the Evil Dead, but a close second. Just remember WARNING ..... DO NOT EAT BEFORE SEEING THIS MOVIE ...
