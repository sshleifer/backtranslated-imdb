This was a very energetic and well played show. I saw it in '98 and my friends and I still joked about it. Every time I see it, it's always as fun as the first one. I also love the way in which everyone can relate to her in a particular way. I really want to see more of John's own scripts and productions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can not find it anywhere for sale, and I have made many looks. If someone knows a website or a store that I'm referring to, I'd appreciate it a lot, since I'm also looking for their other live shows. Please send me a message if any of you has information on the subject. Thank you.
