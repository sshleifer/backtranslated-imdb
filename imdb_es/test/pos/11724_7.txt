The response of Burt Reynolds to Clint Eastwood invading his comedy territory with his orangutan comedies was to make his own Dirty Harry in the Chicago thriller, Sharky's Machine. Originally intended for John Boorman but ultimately directed by the star himself, it is a complete commercial package with Reynolds, a drug dealer who is arrested by the Vice Squadron (literally, they are in the basement) who goes to catch a mysterious lord of the crime that supports Earl Holliman as the next governor. You can guess the rest, but while Reynolds tends to lose sight of the story, he sometimes has a good eye for individual scenes and almost gets a performance of Rachel Ward as the upper class prostitute she falls in love with. The secondary plot is unusually well developed, there are a couple of good action scenes and some nice touches, like having the villain of Vittorio Gassman a mirror image of the hero or Reynolds and a murderer, both watching an adjacent apartment witness in the same building. One of the best movies of the star of his glory days, it is not a classic, but it is a Saturday night more than efficient.
