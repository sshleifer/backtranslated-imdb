If ever a potential movie should have sounded as if it did not work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this one. Here we have what appears to be a soft and sleazy s & m movie of soft pornography, complete with the huge poster in the theater, which shows an almost nude Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself, Samuel Jackson . But let me tell you that if ever a movie comes to life on celluloid with a great deal of power left over, it is Craig Brewer's redeeming follow-up to Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan. <br /> <br /> No shame. From the beginning, this film absorbs you with the initial scenes and proceeds to deepen more and more in each subsequent frame. It is the basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find among themselves the strength and courage to move forward, in a more positive way, with their lives. I've done it before, of course, this story, but as I've always said, it's the way a story is told that gives it heart, depth, meaning and power. <br /> <br /> Ricci is damaged. The wild character of Child Abuse, Rae, and the Lazaro musician, who feels just like Jackson, find each other in desperate circumstances, and Laz is in charge of trying to help Rae. This, in itself, is relatively unique: the idea of ​​a man who genuinely tries to help a woman who suffers from severe pain, instead of trying to take advantage of it, and we know from the beginning that Laz's heart and heart of the movie are in the right place. In its essence, the film is about the redemptive and healing power of love (with music as a very close second), and the film resonates deeply with this truth: with soul, artistically and brilliantly. <br /> <br /> An important reason The success of the film is so profound that it is due to the wild and committed performances of Ricci and Jackson. Scenes that would have turned out to be so ridiculous and pathetic in the hands of smaller artists are, on the other hand, as powerful as everything. In particular, the film's archway scene, in which Jackson sings and plays the title song alone at home, with Ricci, in the midst of a severe thunderstorm and the abusive demons of Rae's past go crazy inside. her head, which leads her to crawl to Lazarus and cling to her leg, does not become ridiculous as technically should, but rather as cathartic. <br /> <br /> All the support performances are fantastic here as well. Justin Timberlake is completely believable as Ronnie, her boyfriend harassed by anxiety, and the always wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson is also chosen as a character who obviously has feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is also outstanding, as the reverend friend of Laz, R.L. (A nod to blues musician R. L. Burnside, no doubt). Everything works on this film, let's be honest, including the music / soundtrack, which features Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House and, more importantly, Jackson himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I listen to as I write review There is also a really beautiful and moving version of "This Little Light of Mine" presented in the film, sung temptingly and softly by Ricci. <br /> <br /> Samuel Jackson has said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this film is the best of his career so far; I could not agree more with him. This is a job he can be proud of as a monument, along with everyone else involved in this bold, extremely wise and deeply sincere mother of a project.
