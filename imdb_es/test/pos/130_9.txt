What makes "Fire" even more attractive to watch, apart from its magical art, is its touch of feminism and rebellion. In my opinion, the same character played by Shabana Azmi is a symbol of Indian female protest against Indian society. The name of the film and the scene in which Radha walks through the flames in her kitchen are sympathetic to the wife of Lord Rama of Hindu Mythology, Sita's walk through fire for the proof of her immaculation, according to the same narrative that appears in the film. The film could be a great inspiration for women, particularly those of the subcontinent, to seek their freedoms and achieve control of their lives.
