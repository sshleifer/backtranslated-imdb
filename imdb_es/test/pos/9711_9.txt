Where do I start? I sat ready to laugh a little and I was impressed! This movie is just perfect, it's indescribable. Jackass Number Two, in all honesty, was coarser, more obscene, more fun and more entertaining than the first. This was just what I needed tonight. <br /> <br /> There are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say "Oh my! No way!" or "Ay!" Perfectly mastered and prepared, each event and scene were coordinated much earlier and, therefore, made it even more perfect. I loved every minute of it! I'm just going to say that there was even a scene in which it was necessary to censor certain images to avoid an NC-17 classification. It was so funny that they had to put it in anyway! Surprisingly good <br /> <br /> 9/10. Incredibly fun, do not miss it!
