I'm really surprised at how unpopular this movie was. I think it has to do with distribution companies, etc. <br /> <br /> Do not be an idiot. If you're looking for good fun, take this movie. This is a very nice movie to spend a few hours and the music is GREAT. <br /> <br /> It's about ... well, girls and boys, and what's between them without too much history, but not all movies should be PULP FICTION, should they? It's nice and cute and it's good weather. The girls are also very attractive and this makes the movie even more pleasurable. <br /> <br /> Why did I just give him a 9? Well, the story could be a bit more convincing from the middle and on. At some point you start to see events that are a little less reliable. SMALL SPOILER: the baby is crying and the father comes in and tries to relax him. Now I'm not talking about a little scream but no, hysterical scream and 30 seconds after the father comes out and "the baby is sleeping" - excuse me, when and how exactly did you calm and sleep and be able to leave Your room in 20-30 seconds. but ignore this kind of small selection because the film itself is not Docudrama, it's fun and this must be overlooked.
