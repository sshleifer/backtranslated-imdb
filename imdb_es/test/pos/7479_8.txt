Is Thursday an original movie? Heck, no, but it's very fun! I just saw this buried in the movie channels one night and it was a nice movie. I expected a lot, but what I got were some interesting scenes (the first time I saw them in the store I liked), some funny stories told by the characters and also some action in the mix. Paulina Porizkova, some good performances by young actors, was good and I was particularly impressed by Aaron Eckhart (who has continued to impress me more in "Your friends and neighbors" and "Erin Brokovich"). So, if you want 90 minutes of fun, go ahead and check out Thursday.
