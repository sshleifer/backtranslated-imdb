This movie was a nice enough watch for me, I mean it was not great, but it was one of the best horror movies of recent times. It seems to have been low, almost the size of the state benefit budget, but it has its charms as the beautiful ladies in it. The atmosphere was also good (which is what is missing in many horror films these days). The performance was a typical low-budget issue of the 1980s, but in case you do not know it's a "dubious" performance. But that's what Lucio Fulci's films were full of. They like. This film had an atmosphere of what was missing the plot and the money, etc. More than compensated for the horror, the gore and the atmosphere of the film itself. <br /> <br /> It's just a typical low-budget horror movie that you can see, I've seen it to the end and I love horror movies. I've seen movies where I just turn off within 10 to 20 minutes or I sit down and move fast if it's in the video, or skip a scene on the DVD. This movie did not make me want to do that, I sat down and watched it until the end, without wanting to skip parts. <br /> <br /> However, I would have liked that the zombie type people in this were a little more scary, since they were as afraid as having Freddy Kreuger as your nanny, no. But seriously, even if they were a little better, it would have been low budget perfection, maybe. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie was first class, the ideal horror music, and it was. I've seen horror movies in which the music is good or average, but it could have been better, thank God, although this movie had nothing to do with Metal music. <br /> <br /> I've been a Metal fan since 1990, but in horror movies, metal music ruins it, it loses a lot of atmosphere when playing any kind of music other than a score. So I am glad that there is no music in this movie more than just your typical score, which was quite spooky, well done. <br /> <br /> I could have used "Profane Grace - Epitaph Of Shattered Dreams" on it. As it is keyboard music, there are no guitars, nothing more than "really" spooky keyboard tracks. As on the "Forever Sleep" track, you hear the wind blowing through it and a little keyboard music that follows it. Always the track on that CD is the same, the best ideal horror music, it would have adapted perfectly to this movie. <br /> <br /> The only unattractive girl in the movie for me was the one who was attacked / murdered (or at least that makes us believe) and we hung up like a scarecrow, only to free ourselves and try to escape later. All the other women in the movie were really lovely, a big 9 out of 10 for all of them, except the one I mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> I would like Hollywood (the main side of things) to give money to Romero and El chico who made this movie. Since giving them to them for movies is a much better decision than giving them to a muppet thug named Paul Anderson of "resident evil." <br /> <br /> Well done guys, it's not bad, it's not bad. not at all, I loved the part of the final credits when they kept showing clips of them making the movie (behind the scenes) Not many films do this kind of thing, which I thought added a bit to the film, as it also showed some shots and that's always good if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Qualification for this film 8/10, qualification for the beautiful ladies in the movie 9/10, qualification for the environment in the Movie 9/10, qualification for the score of the film 9.5 / 10.
