I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 copies on VHS, but the quality is so bad that you can not read a joke written on the door of the room. It always amazes me that Blankfield has done almost nothing afterwards. It made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable. <br /> <br /> The movie is plagued by its low budget. (An atrocious edition jumps to the middle of the word and is described in "Siskel and Ebert".) But, there are a thousand jokes, visual gags to subtle references, which more than compensate. I often find myself quoting lines (or, singing "I have nothing to hide") and, from time to time, I completely describe a scene that coincides with some conversation. There are, at least, six scenes that are among my favorite comedy fragments of all time. <br /> <br /> Viewers without a history of cocaine use can miss many gags. <br /> <br /> "Here, take it." * Visual driving while shaking your butt out the window. * "I said: 'Is this seat occupied?'" "Nice Burn!" Visuals of chapters, headdresses, girths and swimming fins. * "Yes. I'm right-handed." * "Yo! Yo!" says the woman who tries to sell 'nads. * "Bernie is going to love these." * "That's my feet, Jack." says the black foot. * "Why should we tell you?" ... "SHE IS IN THE SUPERMARKET!" * "Ivy!" in supermarket PA. * Load all the shopping cart in ambulance. * etc.
