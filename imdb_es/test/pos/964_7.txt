I did not expect much from this tale of a child whose term paper was stolen and turned into a movie script ... who then travels to Hollywood to get revenge ... but ... hey ... it's still a fun movie. Frankie Muniz, from "Malcom in the Middle", fame plays the boy and is pretty good, and Amanda Bynes as her friend is also very good. Yes, the movie works like an advertisement for the Universal Studios theme park and it's really a silly children movie ... but I enjoyed it anyway. GRADE B-
