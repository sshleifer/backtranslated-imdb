This movie is to spend a short time, to entertain, but who could then be made in the country of no one, has nothing to identify "the Colombian." Whoever looks for the subjects of the alleged Colombian or socially and politically correct cinema and what is called "committed", it is better that you do not see this movie. Some for drug trafficking, or the fight is not a reference, be it farmer and worker, or guerrilla wing and political kidnapping. <br /> <br /> The corrupt police is a character that could be Mexican, Russian, Italian or Chinese, and also the main character, an Argentine photographer, could be Venezuelan, Peruvian or Filipino and the frequent "boludo" in his Parliaments could be replaced by another slang word from any other country without the character or story changing. The important thing is that it is a very decent story with images and correct performances. Its quality is almost television movie but good. That if a film like this one deserves or does not deserve a bit of public funding support is a classic "mamerta" discussion.
