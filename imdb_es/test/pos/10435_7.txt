I see that there are excellent reviews of this film, I have some points to comment, reasons why I thought there was something special in this film ... <br /> <br /> first of all, the film is realistic. It may not be realistic for an adult who has forgotten what it was like to be a teenager, but that is really the kind of super drama that happens among teenagers all the time. Second, the good boy, the one who treats women with respect, does not receive the girls. That's right, in real life anyway! It's too good for your own good. The people are selfish. third, it was nice to see a fat man who had confidence in himself. I mean, that role already has the confidence of the actor, I'm not just talking about the character. In general, I thought that the film was a positive surprise that is secretly hidden among the teen sex comedies on the rental shelf. Do not get me wrong, not everything is sad, it's also a good laugh.
