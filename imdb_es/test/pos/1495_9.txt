"Mr. Bean," starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a huge success during his career in the 1990s, and I probably saw him for the first time when he was about ten years old, shortly after it was over, from what he was seeing repetitions. I certainly was not a big fan at the time, and I did not see too many episodes. I did not really enter the program until my adolescence, only a few years ago, which was when I finally saw all the episodes. Unlike before, it made me laugh many times, and since then, it has always been that way during the repetitions of the episodes! <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is a mysterious, self-centered, antisocial and extremely naive jester whose best friend is his stuffed animal. He is quite isolated from society, and life is not easy for him, as he constantly struggles with very simple things! This is because he lacks a fairly basic knowledge and has the mind of a child. He encounters several types of problems wherever he goes, and he comes up with very strange ways of trying to solve the problems he faces. Not only does it often cause problems for itself, but sometimes for other people as well, which often does not happen! In other words, Mr. Bean is a walking disaster! <br /> <br /> The humor in this show is very visual, and there is very little dialogue. The gags are almost always gags in sight, which is mainly what the show is about. While there may be an occasional lackluster gag, I would say that the vast majority of them are fun, often hilarious (there are so many highlights)! While "Mr. Bean" is not the most sophisticated comedy ever made, it's still great for those who like visual humor, and because of very limited dialogue, you do not even have to speak English fluently to enjoy the show. That's why it has received such a worldwide reputation! The show lasted a few years, but the episodes were made very gradually, so only fourteen were made in total. However, it is a classic series and deserves its great appeal.
