In a really nice turn to Hitchcock, Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) lead unpleasant lives: Larry's ex-wife got rich by publishing a book she wrote, and Owen has the most dominant mother she can imagine. When Larry tells Owen to calm down by watching "Strangers in a Train", Owen has the idea that they should commit cross-murder as in the movie. And just like in the movie, Larry thinks it's a joke, but Owen is serious. <br /> <br /> How they came up with the idea of ​​"Throw Mommy off the train" I'll never know, but it's a hilarious movie. There is not a dull moment in it. And that ending was a hoot. Crystal and DeVito are at their best, and Anne Ramsey is as bad as here in "The Goonies." A modern classic.
