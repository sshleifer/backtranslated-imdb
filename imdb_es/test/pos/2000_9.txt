A ghost story in a typical Turkish high school with good sound and visual effects. Taylan biraderler (the taylan brothers) had made their first shots on a television show a couple of years ago, to my knowledge. That was a kind of Turkish X Files, they had very nice stories but they lacked visual effects. This time it seems that they had what they needed and they used them well. This movie will make you laugh, that's for sure, and it could also scare you. It has a good plot and some young and brilliant actors. If you are a high school student in Turkey, you will find many things about you here. There are many clues in the film about its history and its ending, some of which you understand at this moment, some will have a later meaning, the dialogues were written very intelligently. So these films make the film one of the best films of Turk in recent years. Do not forget, this movie is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry.
