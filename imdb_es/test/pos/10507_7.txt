I put the DVD waiting for the perversion of the camp by the creators of Society and Re-Animator, and I was quite surprised to get involved in an authentically suspenseful story. Acting was top notch (it was nice to see Vosloo in a leading role after a long series of villains), the story involved and the few rather surprising twists. I thought I would go a long way to get to the abduction scenes, but instead I saw it, it just disappointed me in the end. <br /> <br /> It may be too lenient, but as I said before, I did not expect much more than extraterrestrial sex. Of course, if you are looking for some hot extraterrestrial sex, you will be disappointed. For the most part, it was a stupidity of the fast cutting exam table with a flash and you will lose sight of an interesting alien "impregnator".
