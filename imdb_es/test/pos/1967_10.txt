This is actually the first movie I saw in a theater, where people did not leave immediately when the final credits began. Instead, they sat for a few minutes, open-mouthed and gaping at the infinity, trying to understand what they just saw. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say: try to go see this Movie with the least possible knowledge about it (me too!). I gave him a 10
