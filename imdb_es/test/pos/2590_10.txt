Oddly enough, pants like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is very funny. Notice a lot the peculiar humor. Daters and children for those who do not know, but do not know what they are talking about. They have to know that cartoons are not just for children. The art in this is probably the best art that is not Road Runner of the Looney Tunes shorts of 1950. It is difficult to find something better than art in "The Great Piggy Bank Robbery", although nothing will. This probabley runs a 3rd or 2nd closing. Shorts like this could have generated LT's meaningless scams like Tiny Toons Adventures to try to squeeze out all the old comedies over and over again, like cool movies like Scream generated garbage like I Know ... that was released just to squeeze all the Scream's old horror, but like Scream, this is great alone. Chuck Jones has had his failures with shorts from time to time, but he compensates for them. Take Hopper, for example. A few people like Hopper, but it never ruined LT's reputation, but I'm sure this was his way of being. Conclusion: this is not as good as "Duck! Rabbit! Duck!", But close. Catch him frequently on Cartoon Network.
