This year's Royal Rumble was not really bad, but last year it was definitely much better. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH- SHAWN MICHAELS VS. EDGE Even though this game took too much time, it was still fine. Edge wins after using the ropes to hold Shawn Michaels. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND GAME- THE LAWYER VS. HEIDENREICH IN A CASKET FIGHT Now I do not like Casket matches, this game was boring and sloppy, but in the end it increased its tempo when Undertaker nailed the Tombstone and then put Heidenreich in the coffin to get the victory. 4/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD PARTY- JBL VS. KURT ANGLE VS. GREAT SHOW IN A THREAT PARTY FOR THE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP It is not a bad combination of triple threat. Pity that JBL wins again to retain his title after nailing a Clothesline From Hell on Angle for victory. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FOURTH PARTY- RANDY ORTON VS. TRIPLE H FOR THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP OF HEAVY WEIGHT Great match of these two men, the game was a bit neglected but it was still good and it recovered quite towards the end. Even though Orton lost, the game was fast and great towards the end. HHH defeats the Pedigree in Orton for the victory to retain his world title. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH - RUMBLE REAL This was a great Royal Rumble {All Royal Rumbles are good}. After all 30 men entered, the last four remaining superstars in the Rumble were Cena, Edge, Mysterio and Batista. Edge was able to separate Mysterio, then Batista and Cena lined Edge's clothes. Now it was Cena and Batista's turn. First, after reversing an F-U, Batista went for the Batista Bomb, but suddenly both men collapsed on the outside at the same time. After a controversial decision, Mr. McMahon went to the ring to resolve the matter. The game restarted again when Batista and Cena met, but Batista managed to get the best of Cena, caught Spine-Defeat and threw Cena to win the 2005 Royal Rumble and continue with Wrestlemania 21 to face the Champion in the event principal. . 10/10 This was a very good Royal Rumble, but last year it would always surpass all the Royal Rumbles in history. <br /> <br /> In general: I will give you 8/10 and B +
