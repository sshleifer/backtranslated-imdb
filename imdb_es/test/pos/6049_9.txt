I watched this movie on television in the 60s and it still holds up well even after the brilliant performances like DI by R. Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett and even Frank Sutton (in a comic vein) on Gomer Pyle USMC. I was not in the service, but my brother had a recording of an Air Force Drilling Instructor and it was scary. Other members of the family who were Marines told me that Ermey and even Sutton were quite successful in their roles. The only thing missing in "El D. Yo". it's the language. In 1958 they could not use bad words in the movie yet, but Jack Webb ran into a damn resistance without that. I think it's your best role ever. In Dragnet he was quite rigid, I admit it, although not as bad as George Raft, but he only used it to make an effect on "The D. I." Never forget the funeral for the dead flea! The romantic part was simply to stretch the film, but it did not really interfere with the basic plot. Don Dubbins was pretty good, but he never got over this movie in his career. As for patriotism, Jack Webb was John Wayne of television. He took it a little too far in some episodes of Dragnet, but not in "The D. I." After 40 years, I hoped that the film could face the likes of "Full Metal Jacket" and others; And he did!
