Harvey Keitel offers a typically top-notch performance in one of his first major roles as the young and ambitious and uncompromising young and committed producer Coleman Buckmaster, a true talent with a "golden ear" and the son of a famous jazz pianist. tear. Coleman is eager to cut some clues with the R & B team that smokes in the Group (nothing less than Earth, Wind & Fire in his amazingly funky original), but his rigid commercial label A-Chord Records directed by a tense medium and connected to The Mafia - the road to Jerry Street (one Ed Ed) wants you to record a hit single for the pop potato trio from Pages, a supposedly squeaky group that includes a handsome birder and birder Franklin (a vile perfect Bert Parks ), the evil and neurotic daughter Velor (a fine and capricious twist of the cheerful and charming brunette Cynthia Bostwick), and the hedonistic son addicted to the slap Gary (former member of the 50s juvenile comedy, Jimmy Boyd). The extremely naive and idealistic Coleman must immediately learn how the music business really works and play the dirty game in the best possible way or he will lose the Group and its credibility. <br /> <br /> Adopting an acre, incisive, corrosive and harsh and unbiased script by syndicated columnist and rock journalist Robert Lipsyte, director Sig Shore (who is most famous for producing "Superfly") shows a decidedly cynical depiction and unflattering of the various bribes, rewards, broken promises, back - stabbings, duplicities and double deals that are an unpleasant part, but intrinsic to the business of rock music, largely corrupt, with particularly reflective thematic aspects about Arte vs . Commerce, which struggle to preserve the artistic integrity of one and the recent push to homogenize rock. in the insipid, useless, creatively stagnant respectability of the mainstream. On the other hand, this gritty downbeat gem offers a fascinating, thorough, meticulous and totally believable behind-the-scenes view in the recording process, as cowboy Coleman's recording booth struggles bravely in his own words to "make a salad chicken with chicken **. " Appearing in witty fragments, the disc jockey and the legendary "fifth Beatle", Murray the K, play the carefree and ruthless DJ Big John Little (Velor bites his hand after Big John strokes his thigh during a live interview live!), New York soul DJ and Frankie Crocker, host of NBC's "Friday Night Videos," as her own jazzy'n'jivin ', R & B singer and songwriter Doris Troy (she wrote the lovely "Just One Look") as a church pianist, and shaggy of the 70s favorite blaxploitation Charles MacGregor as a priest at a wedding. The rather poor sound and neglected cinematography of Allan Metzger inadvertently add to the authenticity of irregular, irregular and generally documentary documentary style of the film. Although technically it is a bit scarce, in general, this film is still considered one of the most incredible gems behind the scenes, pessimistic pessimists not forgotten in the 70s.
