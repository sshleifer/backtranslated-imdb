You, the Living One (2007) <br /> <br /> Mordant. I have never written that word before, but it comes to mind here. Let me find it. Well, it's part of that, corrosive, but also fun. Very corrosively funny. This is a stern film, for sure, with such dry and dry wit and peculiar humor that it is impossible that you do not like it at some level. Filmed in a very sober style, often with a static camera and really balanced and stable compositions, like theatrical stages, we see a brief enactment. <br /> <br /> But that makes it look normal, which it is not. Ordinary life is shown as disheveled, ironic, charming, shy and depressing. And impossible We, the living, must live, and since we are alive, we must take note. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you're laughing and you do not know why. Exactly. And the promotional material somewhere said it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python, and what they mean is that it has the dry, silent and sonorous look of Ingmar Berman's famous Swedish films, but it has the madness, somehow touching, elements of the British comedians. . <br /> <br /> I would say, definitely, I would definitely see at least half an hour of this. There is a part of me that I thought had already ended by then: the rest continues in a similar set of small scenes and moments, and gradually evolve, but there is no great plot to follow or a climax of the usual kind. There are some great moments after, even just the attention to the storm, which draws us out of mundane human events very well. <br /> <br /> The filming is beautiful in its classic control, almost like a series of scenes by Gregory Crewdson (and actually surpasses the photographer). And the performance, with all its very ordinary people, without glamor, is right. An amazing experience, beautiful, strange.
