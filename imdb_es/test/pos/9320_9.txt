One of the best musical biographies. Dennis Morgan is great as singer / songwriter Chauncey Olcutt. The cast is very good, especially Andrea King as the glamorous Lillian Russell. The atmosphere of the turn of the century is the perfect scenario. Technicolor is excellent. A simple plot, but the movie makes you feel good. Morgan was always underestimated as an actor and singer.
