Like many, I first saw The Water Babies as a child / adolescent in the late seventies / early eighties. He has remained with me since then with his catchy melodies, memorable performances, a less successful animation and a story full of heart, coldness and, ultimately, a good defeat of evil. I recently sat down and saw it again after spending at least two decades, and I noticed THIS time around its striking similarities to The Wizard of Oz. No, these are not blatant similarities, but listen to me. In this we have a boy and his dog, who have personal problems in the "home", fleeing from something and in the scene right after they flee, changing the essence of their appearance. In this, the child and the dog are encouraged. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and Toto are colored. In this case, the child and the dog are told that they must find the Water Babies in search of answers and then to Kracken for guidance, and they have the ability to let Tom go home if he shows that he has courage , etc. In the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy must also find an authorized figure to test her before he allows her to return home. In the Aquatic Babies, Tom meets three characters that will help him on his trip to the Aquatic Babies. Dorothy also has three assistants. When we meet each assistant, he entertains us with an interpretation of "Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Cockallorum ... We are on the way". In the assistant is "We have gone to see the assistant". Dorothy has a good witch who takes care of her; Tom has a woman with many roles (Billie Whitelaw) does the same. If you look closely at the two, there are many other similarities. That said, The Water Babies is not an imitation in any way, I was just commenting on the spooky tastes between the two. This movie has some solid performances from the bad Bernard Cribbins and the always fascinating James Mason. The children who play Tom and Ella are good. The supporting cast of Joan Greenwood (loves her voice!), David Tomlinson, and the vocal talents of John Pertwee and Lance Percival contribute greatly to the mix. I must confess that the animation is less than excellent even for its time, but it is adequate enough for the challenge. The three animated characters that help Tom get home are all nice. I always have trouble choosing my favorite between the French swordfish and the John Inman / Mr. Humphries as the seahorse. The scene in which we hear this guttural and manic laughter from a ship wrecked just to see a seahorse with a huge polka dot bow out always makes me roll! The Water Babies is very funny. Sure, it's more like a movie for children, but it has and always will have a loving place in my heart. Most of the credit for the movie's successes should go to director Lionel Jeffries. Jeffries is a wonderful comedy actor and his sense of humor is clearly evident in everything.
