I went to see this movie with caution. A suicide "comedy" did not seem consistent. Having a brother who has tried to commit suicide and see the devastation that has caused our whole family, I know firsthand how overwhelming it can be to treat this problem. I must say that this film deals with this in a way that allows the viewer "inside" someone who is suffering and simply does not know why, or how to stop it. While the film is not perfect, it respects the theme and, more importantly, makes it accessible to the masses. I know that for our family, humor has helped us with a lot of pain. And, Max and Grace is exactly what it presages to be: a suicidal COMEDY. It's funny, and I also felt that the characters were real and vibrant. He is also extremely intelligent, but simple. Cut to the chase and I appreciate it! I give it a 9 and I will recommend it.
