We still love the movie and the soundtrack of "Valley Girl." I own it in video for eons and I wore the original soundtrack. I have several friends with whom I meet and we have "Raves de los 80", parties where we meet and play music from the 80s and we present "Valley Girl" on the big screen, and now we are in our 30s. We have an AWESOME time. <br /> <br /> Everything is very funny, you know?
