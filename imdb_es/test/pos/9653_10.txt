This movie is probably the best new French movie I've seen in this century so far. There have been some great ones, among them Noe Irreversible, Le Pont des Arts de Green and Innocence de Hadzihalilovic, but none of them comes close to the eternal glory of Les Amants Reguliers. <br /> <br /> The film is a description of the events of May 68. and what followed in its wake and, in addition, is an update and a tribute to the Nouvelle Vague films of those days. As for the representation of the disturbances in Paris, the film is meticulously accurate (I'm only 19 years old and I was not there, but you know what I mean) and the real-time and very long riot scenes set the stage perfectly for the aftermath of the events on the streets of Paris. The revolts are not glorified or beautifully photographed like those of The Dreamers of Bertolucci (to which the film is comparable in many ways) instead, they are recorded in black and white images, courtesy of the excellent William Lubtchansky. The love story that is the main concern of the film after the riots in 68 was filmed in impressive shots and much less blurry, and manages to evoke true feelings of love and adolescent confusion in a politically worried and apparently cold environment. <Br /> <br /> This film is a beautiful love story and radiates through it that the director wants to describe his own experiences of those mythical late 60s, which makes the film even more compelling. But the film is also a tribute to the whole canon of Nouvelle Vague. Much of the dialogue evokes the Truffaut principles, and the length, the lack of action and the less structured plot remind Eustache or Rivette. There are even shame effects similar to those of Godard with people looking directly at the camera and even addressing Bernardo Bertolucci directly. This film is undoubtedly a response song for Bertolucci's The Dreamers and is also a tribute to Nouvelle Vague, but still stands out as a beautiful and radiant love story. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this movie is amazing and if you love French cinema you should not sleep in it. It may be the best French film since La Mamain et la Putain de Eustache.
