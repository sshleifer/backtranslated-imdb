I have to confess that I slept in the cinema while watching the first Asterix movie ... but this is simply FANTASTIC! It's really fun and leaves the first mile away. It has gags and funny situations that made me laugh from the first minutes of the movie and I just stopped laughing when I got to the car to go home. I repeat: this movie is spectacular ... Obelix is ​​very funny and Cleopatra is a real babe!
