The performance inspired by Alistair Simms by Miss Fritton transcends resistance. He is one of the great characters of comedy in the cinema. Equally wonderful is the character of Joyce Grenfell, Ruby Gates. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you should cuddle on the couch on a humid Sunday afternoon and be transported to a time long ago when the school girls just terrorized won our respect - not our anger! Have I heard that there is a new version in sight with Rupert Everett as Miss Fritton? Will have a hard job competing with the teacher, or should I be a lover? - Alistair Simms. <br /> <br /> Go and fix it, it's much better than what is now used for comedy.
