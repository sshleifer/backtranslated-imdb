Richard Abernethie, a very rich man, has died and his relatives have gathered for his funeral. Included in the funeral party is Abernathie's younger sister, Cora Galaccio. Although none of the families have seen Cora in at least 20 years, everyone agrees that Cora was always a little different. Then, when Cora says something about Abemethie's murder, most laugh like one of Cora's eccentricities. But obviously someone is taking Cora seriously. The next day, Cora is found dead in her bed after being beaten violently. Is there any connection between the two deaths? It depends on Hercule Poirot to find a murderer. <br /> <br /> After the Funeral is one of the best organized episodes of the entire Poirot series. I've always been a fan of this particular Agatha Christie book and, as far as I remember, the film is as true to Christie's original material as it is to any of Poirot's deliveries. The mystery is first class with many clues, suspects and false leads. And as I have written before, I always enjoy a story of Christie where Hercule Poirot gathers everyone in a room for the final revelation. It may be old-fashioned, but that's how I like it. Beyond the plot, technically and artistically After the Funeral is a winner. Games, editing, directing and cinematography are as good as you'll find in one of these movies. The performance is equally impressive. I have come to expect a nice performance from David Suchet as Poirot and it does not disappoint here. The rest of the cast is equally strong with Monica Dolan giving a particularly remarkable performance. Apart from a little dispute with the fast way in which the characters are presented, I have no complaints. It's a good show in every way.
