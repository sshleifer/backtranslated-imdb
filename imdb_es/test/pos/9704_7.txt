Like the first one, the JACKASS team is back to try to commit suicide in the way that best suits them. Or, it is adapting to a tractor tire and rolling down a slope. Or, a bull deliberately crushes it. Or even something. worst. <br /> <br /> The first one was crazy, and that's how you can describe it. It was also a very difficult movie to laugh. But this one is completely crazy. It has even more dangerous acrobatics and even more difficult laughter. . So, I think seeing the idiots who kill themselves will be the funniest thing this week. <br /> <br /> So, before BORAT comes out, I'll laugh.
