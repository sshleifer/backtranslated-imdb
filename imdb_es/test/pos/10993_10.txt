In the wastelands where Hollywood Productions has become lately, this film, in and of itself, is truly "MANNA FROM HEAVEN" !!! <br /> <br /> In what could best be described as a "cute" movie, approximately 350 years of experience in movie acting (according to 100 years!) happily illuminates the screen to tell a story of cheating, remorse and redemption on a Catholic family in Buffalo, New York. <br /> <br /> Truly well-positioned to take its place in the genre of the movie "Feel Good," this little Burton Sisters independent film 'FIVE SISTERS PRODUCTIONS COMPANY' will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart, while renewing your faith in humanity. <br /> <br /> From the spectacular opening scene of Buffalo, NY to the final credits, the film manages to tell a story that could have been told by any family, anywhere. However, somehow, this particular meeting of family and "family by association" in a small, nondescript house in Buffalo is more than adequate. If you have never been to Buffalo, you will leave the theater with thoughts of "crawling" for a visit! The shots of the landmarks and the surroundings of the city help to bring a picturesque and realistic tone to the film, which adapts perfectly. The tranquil beauty of the "Queen City of the Great Lakes" complements, instead of detracting from the story that is told. If only more movies took advantage of the natural beauty of the "second cities" of this country instead of escaping to a sound study somewhere, the final results would be much more credible. <br /> <br /> Great Shirley Jones performances Frank Gorshin, Wendy Malick, Jill Eickenberry and the rest of the cast prove once again that true talent surpasses Hollywood's "flavor of the week" at any time. <br /> <br /> GO TO SEE THIS MOVIE! <br /> <br /> You've wandered in the Hollywood desert for too long!
