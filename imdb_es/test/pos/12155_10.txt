Stefan, a German first-year student, makes a trip to Paris during the summer holidays and falls in love with a mysterious young woman he meets at the scene of the Paris phenomenon. Then he follows her on the famous island of Ibiza, the hippie met Wolf, a man who throws Hitler-Jugend knives, owns bars and hotels and keeps Estelle under his control. The couple tries to escape from Wolf, Stefan gets hooked on drugs and jealousy by Estelle, who is great and a free spirit. Great photography and music, the plot is quite common at the time, but it is not a type of exploitation film, cold and dramatic. The moral is quite strong (he was looking for the sun ...) but I would not say it is a film against drugs, even puts an emphasis on the use of drugs.
