Isabel just got out of jail. She decides not to return again, but life is difficult for ex-convicts, especially if they are homeless, like Isabel. When she meets her boyfriend Rufo, she can see a glimmer of hope, but Rufo is now not only a drug addict but also an AIDS patient. This will not make Isabel give up, because, if there is a will, there is a way and she will fight for her future, to have a normal life, with a house and a family. A very hard and moving film that has gone unnoticed by most Spanish cinemas, the actors are great and the story is very moving, maybe a better treatment of the secondary characters would have improved the movie, but it is really good. I highly recommend to see it, but keep in mind that it is not a happy Disney movie, it is difficult and dramatic.
