My second favorite movie of 1970 (after Five Easy Pieces) was totally discarded by a lot of idiots, calling a piece of garbage that provoked harassment. Peter Boyle, a well-known liberal, is amazing as the rigid worker who has some problems with the younger generation. He's a scary guy, but he has a great imagination and it's a lot of fun. I was a teenage liberal when this was published, but as horrifying as Joe seemed to me, he also criticized me! Susan Sarandon, in her first role, is perfect and a fox rich in mixed stones. The dinner scene in Queens is hilarious and insightful for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This was NOT an exploitation film and the script (which was nominated for an Oscar) should have won that year. The director simply did not waste enough money to give him enough credibility in Hollywood. No matter your political persecution, then and now, you will like someone in this movie. A final 9 out of 10. It's on DVD and video. Check it out!
