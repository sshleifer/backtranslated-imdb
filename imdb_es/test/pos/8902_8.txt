Having been a faithful Asterix fan all my life, I have to say that "Asterix and the Vikings" is probably the best work of all Asterix movies. It has some very funny jokes and the animation is excellent. As many people have pointed out, it does not really follow the comic book plot ("Asterix and the Normans") very closely, but in many ways it's so good, because that book stands out in my mind as one that stood out. a lot of fun in the culture of the sixties, and much of it is very outdated today. <br /> <br /> What really rubbed me the wrong way, however, is how they incorporated a Disney-style plot in the movie that took much of the focus away from Asterix and Obelix. We have a misunderstood boy who does not fit, Justforkix. We have a tom-boy girl who does not fit because she wants to be treated like a man, Abba. They meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened because the boy is ashamed to be totally honest with the girl, but in the end his love wins. This has been the plot of so many Disney films (and, to be fair, from other studios as well) that is not funny and the plot was ancient twenty years ago. I mean, they even gave Justforkix an addiction to a capricious animal. <br /> <br /> Not only did I find this derivative and a clich√©, it really detracted from the story and left me unsatisfied. <br /> <br /> I think it says a lot about how excellent the rest of the movie was because I keep thinking about it very well, despite the way the plot was hijacked.
