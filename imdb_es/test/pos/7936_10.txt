I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it many years ago. I'm not sure how many times I've seen it, maybe 10, maybe 20. The last time I saw it I was surprised by a detail I had not noticed before. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the image, the dead heroes are transported back to the village through a sled. There are a couple of close-ups of the dead. The one that struck me the most was a photo of the young blonde. Everything you see on the screen is your profile from head to hands. His hands hold a flickering candle. The wind blows and her thick blond hair dances to the wind, in tune with the flickering candle flame. The contrast between death and the life he has lost is incredibly powerful. The moving hair and the flame of the candle remind us of the vital force that once inhabited his body. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch this movie again, I see something new.
