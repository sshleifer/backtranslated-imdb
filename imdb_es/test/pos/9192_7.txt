I have read the last comment made in this movie and I have to totally disagree with it. <br /> <br /> You see, I am a Portuguese national and although this film can say little to someone who comes from Boston, it surely says something to both Portuguese and Brazilians, as well as immigrants everywhere. <br /> <br /> And why, maybe you wonder? Well, first of all, this film is about two sister nations: Portugal and Brazil. Brazil gained independence at the beginning of the 19th century (from the heir to the Portuguese throne) and since then relations have improved enormously. <br /> <br /> However, however significant it may be, there are still many prejudices. Due to the economic climate in Brazil during the 1990s, immigration to Portugal grew enormously. You see, Portugal is not only a country that shares a language, culture and beliefs similar to Brazil, but it is also a gateway to the rest of Europe. Thus, some people were forced to make the decision to cross the Atlantic and seek a better life, and Portugal was the first logical place to try to emigrate. <br /> <br /> As is still the case with many immigrants, they were paid averages below the minimum wage and treated as "garbage"; only in this case, because the language is similar, they were constantly informed. of his immigrant status. <br /> <br /> Another curious thing in this movie is the idea that conveys how a man so knowledgeable of the history of his own country still tried to earn money quickly by exporting coveted national resources. . It is exactly like these people that keep Brazil in a constant state of arrested development, since the country is well endowed with natural resources and could easily climb the economic ladder if given a fair chance. <br /> <br /> In a way, this shows how colonialism still exists: Paul represents the exploited people, Igor, the man whose status as "noble" (or at least wealthy or "wealthy") is assured by the foreign colonialist power that in turn represented by Kraft. <br /> <br /> If you have seen other Salles films, you will recognize this as a recurring theme: the struggle against an oppressive power. I do not mean to lecture or be condescending to teach history to anyone, but I thought that this movie was, symbolically speaking, very powerful. I'm not saying there is not room for improvement (as there always is), but I think the last written comment was not only narrow, but also ignorant. <br /> <br /> One last thing to say about this, I have to assume that you have seen this movie with the eyes of an "American movie observer". This comment does not intend to harm him, but I mean that "foreign" films can not only be "beautiful landscapes": art deals with the problems of his time. I would not expect Otto Dix, for example, to paint all the charming places of Bayern and the Black Forest ... Why should I expect a filmmaker to focus exclusively on the stage when he feels there are more relevant problems to attend to? br /> <br /> In a nutshell, do not judge movies lightly and with only two or three scope criteria. This film is very interesting, his photography is quite good and even the idea of ​​the black and white drawings goes hand in hand with what it is about. I think the image is purposefully grainy ... like reality, right? :) <br /> <br /> Look at it and come to your own conclusions ...
