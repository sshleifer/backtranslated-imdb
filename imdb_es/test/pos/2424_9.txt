This is another one of the underestimated films of Robert Altman (let's be honest, the only movie he did that really did not work was Ready to Wear), and Sandy Dennis offers a fascinating performance on it. It is much better here than in "El Fuera de Towners". The material, I admit, is below the great director Altman and the extraordinary actress Dennis, but that almost does not matter. As long as they are allowed to do their thing and do it well, almost any story will do.
