This is a movie that must be seen. You will laugh, you will cry, and when you finish you will want more. Well written and convincing, this film attracts you and keeps you firm. The casting was perfect, the characters solved and the performances outstanding. "Nanny" is the norm to which all women must stand firm: strong, forgiving, protective and never critical. "Nanny", for me, is the epitome of what a Christian mother and a woman should be: a true pillar of the community. If I were half the woman who is "Nanny", you might consider me to be fine. It would have been devastated if "Nanny" had died at some point in the movie, but since she did not, I will definitely buy this when it comes out on DVD. I can only hope that the story continues and that Ruben returns to Lackawanna to try to rebuild the city, piece by piece and person by person.
