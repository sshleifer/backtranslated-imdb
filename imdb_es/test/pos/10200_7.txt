This Western was established in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were installed by Western Union. While the good guy Dean Jagger (sporting a lot of hair) did everything he could to do this, there was a bad guy hoping to undo this for his own selfish reasons. Then, it's up to Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the best Western years of the 1940s that I have seen and almost got an 8, it was so good. However, for my life, I have no idea why Fritz Lang was assigned to direct this film; After all, I did not know anything about westerns. His strength was the drama, and I think this movie is a kind of drama, which takes place in the old West. Strange, yes, but it seemed to work well, although I wonder how this great German director felt upon receiving this work. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the film, it is exceptional, with vivid colors. , excellent shooting location and very good performance. As usual, Randolph Scott made another relaxed and realistic performance. However, I was surprised that Robert Young was also part of the film, but it was a good casting decision: he was supposed to be a Harvard-educated Oriental. When I saw that Barton MacLane was also in the film, I almost assumed that he would be the "bad guy" and that my thoughts were well founded, since he made a career of playing idiots! As for the script, it seemed pretty normal for the most part, but the final showdown between Scott and Barton MacLane was much better than I expected, making this movie end on a very high note.
