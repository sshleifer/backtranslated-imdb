RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt warm and tingly when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) set out to avenge the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely malicious and devilish. For me, she deserved that Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him. However, I liked his castle, as well as the rest of the configuration. In addition, I thought Lurky (voiec Pat Fraley) and Murky (voiec Peter Cullen) were diabolical. Before finishing this, I would like to say that all were chosen perfectly, that the management was impeccable and that Disney was very successful. In conclusion, I recommend this excellent masterpiece to those who have not seen, especially fans of the television series. I guarantee you will enjoy it.
