This is the fifth part of 'The Animatrix', a collection of animated short films that tell us a little more about the world of 'The Matrix'. This time they present Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) in a story about a detective who is hired to find her. With a great animation in black and white and an interesting story, this is again a great animated short of 'The Animatrix'.
