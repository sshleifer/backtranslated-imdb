Nelson is a professor of medicine who wants his four students to kill him and then return him to life so he can prove that there is a life after death. This is what they do and very soon all medical students want to know if there is life after death. The other life is not about nacreous doors and lights at the end of the tunnel, but something more sinister. <br /> <br /> The ghosts of the past return to pursue them and, surely, this movie will chase anyone. It has some pretty terrifying moments that could translate into real life and make people wonder about what happens when you die. It's a good movie to watch when it's raining and you feel depressed. It is also a little weird. <br /> <br /> See it with an enchanted past.
