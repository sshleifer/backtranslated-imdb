"Hey, I did not order a taxi!" "Yes, well, you have one ..." What can I say about Hack ... what man among men? He was an encouraging former policeman who had become a taxi driver with a heart of gold. If you could (and fortunately for US viewers ... one person per week) penetrate the cold, hard surface outside of Hack, you have to see a humanitarian man dedicated to vigilante justice. The show was magnificent, I laughed, I cried, I smiled ... all in the same episode. My arms would burst in goosebumps when our dear friend Hack got out of his taxi in another dark alley ... with nothing but his fists ... ready to avenge a wounded civilian. A smile broke on my face when the screen showed me a criminal in the facial expressions of a dark alley when the headlights of the Taxi of Justice lit up on his face. Week after week I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to enjoy the heat of Hack's brilliance. I have never seen a better show and I regretted the loss of one of the greatest treasures in the United States when the show was canceled. In other news related to Hack, I would like to announce to the world that my wife and I hope that Hack Koen will come to the world in about three weeks.
