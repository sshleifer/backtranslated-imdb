This movie is one of my classic Christmas favorites. Sure, it's a fluff, it's not "relevant," but when did the simply entertaining and fun movies turn into something bad? No, this movie is definitely "A good thing" as Martha Stewart would say (appropriately). Barbara Stanwyck is so attractive in this film and Dennis Morgan complements her perfectly. Both have charm and warmth to spare. They are assisted by a team of incredible actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40s and 50s: Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall, Reginald Gardiner and Una O'Connor among them. Where are the characters like this today? No paper could have been better chosen. Bette Davis, fortunately, rejected this paper because it was below her and she was right to reject it. I would have tried to shoot with steam on everyone and everything around her and destroy the film completely. Stanwyck was a strong actress, but she had the wisdom to interpret this lightly. It has rarely been more attractive and it is perfect. Morgan is the essence of the good boy. Because your part is the least striking, there is a tendency to overlook your ability. The mere fact that he can stay surrounded by such characteristic actors is an achievement in itself, but he is also absolutely perfect like Jefferson Jones. Skip the badly advised (and mindless) 1992 remake and look at this bright and brilliant Christmas gift!
