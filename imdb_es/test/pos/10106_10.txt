This criticism is very delayed, since I consider that A Tale of Two Sisters is the biggest movie ever made. I will put this gem against any film in terms of script, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing or any other aspect of film making. Is it practically perfect in all of them? a true masterpiece in a sea of ​​false "masterpieces". <br /> <br /> The structure of this film is easily the most closely constructed in the history of cinema. I can not think of any other movie in which something of vital importance happens every two minutes. Literally, Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a movie that practically insults the viewer to analyze it at the most detailed level. A seemingly insignificant object can be shown? a shelf of clothes, two newspapers, a drop of blood that emanates from a crack in the floor, a bottle of pills, etc. But after a meticulous inspection turns out to be much more? a clue that helps make sense of that particular scene (or perhaps the film as a whole), which almost always contributes with a poignant reflection on the psychological concepts that are hidden in the background until the viewer's intelligence drives them to jump to the forefront. Such an event can happen a handful of times during any other movie, but in A Tale of Two Sisters such events occur in such a quick and implacable way that the viewer must see the film in a perpetual state of alert, so as not to miss something important. In other words, the content level of this movie is enough to easily fill a dozen other movies. How can someone in their right mind ask for more than one movie? It is simply the highest and superlative form of cinema imaginable. <br /> <br /> The most quoted criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is well summarized by Zaphod B Goode, who falsely claims that the story is incoherent. Unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. Poses that Ji-woon Kim released a dozen possible explanations and left it at that. In reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth. A Tale of Two Sisters provides a series of objectively irrefutable data that help the viewer identify the EXACT occurrences of each scene in the film. If our good friend Zaphod had been paying attention, he would have noticed. for example ?? the series of obvious flashbacks that provide enough objective information to make sense of the movie. These flashbacks convincingly contradict Zaphod's claim of complete subjectivity. The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone who wants to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a bystander who apparently does not want to put the slightest effort. to see them. Can Ji-woon Kim be blamed for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film? I think not. <br /> <br /> Note that I will not insult the intelligence of critics like Zaphod who can not "get" a story from two sisters, because it really has nothing to do with the lack of intelligence as much as the lack of persistence. The film is explained so effectively that the only possible explanation for the confusion is the lack of effort on the part of the viewer. Yes, this movie requires a fairly significant amount of puzzle solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful image. You only need to join them. Remember, the script was written by someone with the image already in mind? simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully in order to provide a magnificent brain exercise that? when it is complete ?? gives a maximum form of satisfaction and state of amazement. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. There are movies that seem to start with an incomplete image and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are perfect examples of this. A tale of two sisters is not. It is ironic that Zaphod says that Darko has a more masterful construction than A Tale of Two Sisters, especially considering that Darko not only provides almost NO objective information but that it is also a final spin that is the quintessential deus ex machina cliché that could be eliminated at the end of any film that has been made to provide the ultimate in false intelligence. I am ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence, but the contrast is important. Although I am surprised that Zaphod would cite a film that falls apart when exposing even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that is only perceptible through a significant application of intellectual effort. Apparently he likes his "smart" films in the most superficial way possible. This is evident when he asks 17 consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself. Simply read Opiemar's threads in the IMDb A Tale of Two Sisters discussion forum. Anyone who carefully reads those threads and even affirms the lack of an objective solution for this film can stop watching smart movies completely because the answers are so OBVIOUS. <br /> <br /> I would like to say more, but I have reached my limit of 1,000 words. Everything that has been said here had to be said. Let it be said now!
