I went to the cinema to see Claudine and I loved every minute, also the cast and the soundtrack. Diahann Carroll was never better than in this role. We saw that Mrs. Carroll played down her looks, barely saw her naked, smoked a cigarette, drank beer and, oh, she cursed. Every time this movie was shown on TV and finally it was connected by cable, I called my friends to see it. Only the soundtrack from the beginning of the movie is incredible, all thanks to Gladys Knight and the Pips. We saw a black woman struggling to raise her children, dealing with teenage pregnancy and everyday life encounters a man whom she learns later that she has problems. Finally this movie was made on DVD and well deserved.
