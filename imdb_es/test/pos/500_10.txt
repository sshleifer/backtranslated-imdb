This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and not get tired of that. It is, by far, one of the best adaptations of comics of all time. I liked this even more than X-men. In fact, this movie is a kind of cross between X-men and the matrix and appeared earlier. Wesley Snipes does a great job with Blade's character. He is simply not a superhero without emotions. Also, this movie is not suggested to get a score of pg-13. Of course the comics are mainly for children, but I like a little more in my films. Let's face it, if we were in these situations, we would consider a storm to make it more realistic. This comic book adaptation also has something that many do not have. A good fight at the end between the bad guy and the good guy. Let's face it, none of the Batman movies had a very good final fight.
