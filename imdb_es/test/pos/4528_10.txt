How many reviews of this film will I have to write before doing it right? Tom Conway completely inherits the Falcon cloak from his real-life brother George Sanders with this entry. Covered in beautiful criss-cross suits, with a single button, draped style and cruises in beautiful 110% steel cars with huge fender skirts and suicide doors that reach your armpit, Conway travels from New York to Miami to maintain a Formula for Industrial diamonds fall into the wrong hands. Your "client" is charming, the virgin Louisa Briganza, who has beautiful hair but will only allow you to kiss her for the first two months. Along the way, he encounters the kind of colorful set of characters that only a B movie could provide. His partner in this exit is perhaps the best among Falcon's companions, Edward Brophy as Goldie Locke, who is given some really funny lines. She meets the sinister Doris Blanding, the kind of girl of the 40 you know she takes out. His cohort is Benny, played by Steve Brodie, who, twenty years later, was a Presley punching bag in two Paramount King movies. Both work for the cold fish and Kenneth Sutton, who wears a yachting cap, ready to do whatever it takes to get the formula while he sails his yacht to Brazil. Dirty with the police who chase the hawks, the entrance still reigns. Forget those 120-minute melodramas, give me a 1-hour Falcon movie any day. I have a wife and two children, who has time for a two-hour movie? Shake some dry martinis and forget your problems with this great Falcon movie. But if you did not record it on local television in Toronto like I did 17 years ago, you have no luck.
