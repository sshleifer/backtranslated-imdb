Fellowe's drama about the marriage of a couple that is threatened by a younger third that interests the wife of the house (Watson). Wilkinson plays the role very well as the troubled husband who can not control his wife's traps and deals with the problem. I also really like Rupert Everett in his role as William Bule, the man with whom Watson has an affair. Although I think Emily Watson is a great actress, I had a little problem with the way her character was written, it did not make her too nice (I know that a cheater is not supposed to be nice, but some of her actions and things She does not had no reasoning behind them). The script was perhaps the weak part of this drama, although the direction of Fellowes was good and the performances were also quite good. This movie is better than Infidel, but it is not a masterpiece in any way. --- IMDB rating: 6.7, my rating: 8/10
