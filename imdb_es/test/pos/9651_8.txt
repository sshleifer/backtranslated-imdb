The reason why I am reviewing this is that the previous revision was written by someone who abandoned this movie, not even half. Unfortunately for him, a film of tremendous beauty was lost. Okay, the movie took a long time to start, in fact, the friend I was with fell asleep briefly, I woke him up before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. Fortunately, the film developed from there into a story of love, drugs and what it was like to be young and free in the 1960s. Fantastic performances by the two protagonists and a great aspect of the film that gave it an authentic feel. Be patient, like many of the great movies that are well worth waiting for, and it is certainly a movie that I hope to see again! 8/10
