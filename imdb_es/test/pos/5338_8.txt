If you have not seen the movie yet, but you like comedy, go out and buy or at least rent it! The fact that he won, Oscar animation, is not a coincidence! I have not seen many other Wallace & Gromit movies (in fact, I think I only saw one more), but the humor is very distinctive ... and some would also say that they are very British. In a good way, of course! <br /> <br /> The story will only be an excuse for all the jokes to come, but although it is not the most elaborate, it still works (by the way, my niece supposed to see one of the great surprises to come), I did, congratulations to her; or)). I think, after seeing this, you'll go out and find the other W & G movies out there. Have fun!
