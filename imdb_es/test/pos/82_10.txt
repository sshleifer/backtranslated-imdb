When the circus arrives in the city and places the lion's cage directly over the house of Bugs Bunny, Bugs ends up somewhere in the right range between scared and intrepid. Despite the title "Acrobatty Bunny", it is only at the end when Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics. But even before that, it's quite fun what Bugs does to escape being eaten; somehow, he always manages to use the weakness of the other character against him, and then he removes any convenient object from the air! Later, the insects ended up in the circus in "Big Top Bunny". This one I liked more, since the latter slowed down a bit by giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know it was during the Cold War, but still). I recommend this one. <br /> <br /> And with the end, we can affirm that Aloha Oe will never be for this caricature.
