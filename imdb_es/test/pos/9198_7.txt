I had heard interesting reviews about this movie. I thought it was a love story, but I was not sure what the plot was about. Then, when I finally saw him, I found myself in the middle of a love relationship between the ex-swindler (Isabel Ampudia) and the drug addict Rufo (Sebastián Haro). So, a love story, but not probably what I expected. <br /> <br /> The film is focused on Isabel, as she struggles to return to society. She does not want to go back to her neighborhood and finds herself homeless or where to go. Then, while she only experiences those first hours of freedom after being released from prison, she met Rufo, an old woman who, while there, had become a drug addict and lives in the streets. Having no place to go, and without money or a viable source of income, he decides to join Rufo at his residence: a covered area on a lonely street. <br /> <br /> The story itself is moving. Explain how the impossible relationship between Isabel and Rufo deepens until the almost final spin of the film. <br /> <br /> Definitely, it's worth watching the movie. Sebastián Haro is splendid in his role as a drug addict. A person who can be both an innocent and tender person and a relentless street scum. Only depending on who treats it. I think its role. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I do not fully believe the role of Isabel Ampudia. Although the film tries to show the bitterness in its interior through several scenes, she is not able to make me believe it. She is in a way too sweet and honest about what could be expected from someone in the same situation. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to show a love in a desperate situation. It's a nice movie. But the feeling I have when the film ends is that Isabel, with the way she thinks and acts, would never have reached that situation. His role, partly due to the script, partly due to the performance, is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I especially like the end, and because of that I have increased my score of one or two points. I liked its bittersweet and the fact that sometimes, the instinct of survival is above other more spiritual considerations such as love. <br /> <br /> Summarize, an interesting film, but it lacked some power to be an "all there is to see".
