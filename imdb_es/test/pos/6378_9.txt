I saw Teen Devian in 1993 televised in Doordarshan on a Friday night, and I could hardly believe that such a remarkable movie was made in Bollywood. It was amazing? a movie with a "modern" story, excellent music, three beautiful ladies and my favorite superstar Dev Anand. In this unusual story, does Dev fall in love with three women? The simple Nanda, the dazzling Kalpana and the sophisticated Simi. They are also in love with him and want to marry him. This puts Dev in a dilemma (which is the knot of the story): with whom to marry? Consult a hypnotist who asks Dev to look at a crystal ball. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully directed (probably by Dev Saheb himself and not by Amarjeet, the official director), does the B & W classic have evergreen music? Some of the best compositions of SD Burman (aided generously by RD Burman). "Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is probably the sexiest song of all Hindi movies. Majrooh Sultanpuri must also be credited for writing the memorable lyrics. Teen Devian is a windy musical that fully adapts to the style of Dev Anand and did full justice to the role. Unfortunately, the Devian teenager has never received the recognition and popularity it deserves. <br /> <br /> A must for any Hindi film aficionado. I will qualify the eternal favorite 9.5 out of 10.
