Seriously, I enjoy Dr. Who. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not dismiss me simply as a "science fiction person", because normally I am not. I caught up because a friend hooked me when they started seeing him. Actually, it's really fun, and most of the time, it's fast paced. My whole family sees it a lot and that's a miracle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Ecclestion is pretty good, but David Tennant is brilliant. I think it's because he made the doctor so manic and it's good to have that eccentricity in a television character again. <br /> <br /> I do not know what it is, but everything manages to do it. It works like a clock. <br /> <br /> All I'm going to say is just try. An episode (probably better if you do not choose the second half of a two-party game).
