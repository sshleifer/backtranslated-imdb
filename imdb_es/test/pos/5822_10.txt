Oz, is one of the most amazing and addictive television experiences in history. <br /> <br /> Having caught fragments of this in the SBS, at first I was skeptical; However, having finished the fourth season, unfortunately this brilliant show is nearing its end (6 seasons) and, however, I still do not get tired of OZ. <br /> <br /> You want something that pushes your senses and your stomach to the limit ... Oz adapts to expectations, <br /> <br /> This is not a child thing, friends, it's Violent, Brutal, and not handsome. Therefore, it is an experimental unit within a maximum security prison. <br /> <br /> Tom Fontana's Oz is brilliant in all the right departments, actors, writing and direction. <br /> <br /> The HBO Oz The site is also highly recommended, for newcomers, to obtain information about this series. This was the first one-hour program, produced by HBO, and proves that it is a masterpiece and that others would follow. <br /> <br /> Thanks, HBO
