This almost perfect cinematic interpretation of the popular children's novel by Edith Nesbit follows the life of Roberta (Bobbie), Phyllis and Peter and her mother, after her father was unjustly accused of treason and sent to prison. Are they going to live in a house that is almost uninhabitable in the country near a railroad? Mom writes stories to earn enough money for food and candles, while children spend most of their time at the train station and, specifically, waving to a particular train to "send their love to the father". <br /> <br /> Always an attractive and intelligent novel, the characters come alive here under the perceptive direction of Lionel Jeffries (better known as an actor of fine characters). Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie, while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are her sister and her brother. His mother is Dinah Sheridan, while the other memorable characters are played by Bernard Cribbins (Perks the railroad man) and William Mervyn (the old gentleman on the train). <br /> <br /> 'Children of the railroad' is kind Entertainment from another era, but it does its job very well. While we see Bobbie grow up with the worries of an absent father struggling with his own needs, both to be alone and to have fun, we can only rejoice when the events come together at the end of the image. Throughout we have sense of time and place. Whether from the steam trains, the pursuit of college articles or the red flannel skirts worn by girls (and used to avoid disaster!).
