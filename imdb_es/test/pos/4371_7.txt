George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I have seen many of his specials and I even had the chance to see him perform live. I had a certain cynicism that always appealed to me. His last two special offers (Life is worth it, especially Complaints and claims) have lacked a certain spirit and content. George appeared overweight, old and tired (not to mention he left rehabilitation). "I did not say I mentioned it"! Anyway. Life is worth it The loss was especially tragic because I was overweight, I was unhappy, I had left rehabilitation (here we go again ...) and it was extremely ungraceful. If there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without interrupting him off stage, George did it with Life is Worth Losing. It's as if the New Millennium and the 9/11 of the United States were trampling George's spirit. The bs had become too big to be managed. <br /> <br /> The return has been partially successful with It's Bad for Ya! This special is the completed transmutation. George is no longer trying to rekindle his glory days. He is in full acceptance of his age, being old and dealing with the prospects of death that lie ahead. He has agreed to be an old crisp SOB and is savoring it. This is better than his previous specials, but away from Jammin 'in New York. It is a little tragic. His observations are no longer cutting edge and look more like Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce. George is not George anymore. He is no longer criticizing us, but it is the man in the high castle who points out how things were and how different modern life is. <br /> <br /> This is an improvement over the previous two special offers, but George has not regained his former glory (if ever). It has been reduced from critical social and political poignant comments to mostly personal people. When he becomes a politician, he still has something to say. It derives to a great extent (especially if you have seen any of his previous works), but still works in some way, unlike his random periputations that lack some relevance outside the baby boom generation. The last 25 minutes are the best that this special has to offer. <br /> <br /> For now I will worship the Sun and pray to Joe Pesci so that George can recreate himself as a vanguard seventy-year-old. It's a 50/50 opportunity. Life seems to have become more tedious for George and his "art" is now his life. This is a step in the right direction of your 2 previous specials, but it is far from your old self. Where does he go from here? He may never recover, but perhaps he can metamorphose / refine this new old routine. Here we give him the hope of 7 more words he can not say on television or at least one windmill he can handle.
