Look at it with an open mind, it's very different, there's nothing that looks like it. Very well made realistic tale of tarzan. The chimpazees animatronics are well made for '84, Christopher Lambert was brilliant imitating the language and behavior of the chimpazee. I would not be surprised if I took lessons from Jane Goodall.
