Adam (Eric Jungmann) and the odious best friend Harley (Justin Urich) are driving through a cross-country wedding. On the way they pick up the sexy hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Then, for no reason, a monster truck keeps trying to get them off the road ... and maybe kill them. Who is doing this and why? <br /> <br /> Very good horror movie. It is energetic and full of striking direction that takes you directly into action. It is also a horror comedy. Most of the humor is childish and REALLY disgusting but actually something fun. Also, this movie really builds up in the blood sometimes, but that's a GOOD thing! The acting is fine: Jungmann exaggerates too much his role as a nerd; Urich has been stuck with the desperate role of being the best friend with a dirty mouth and obsessed with sex, but he succeeds; Brooks is also good at a limited role. <br /> <br /> BUT I could see that the "turn" ended long before it happened and the logic disappears completely at the end (especially the rescue). Still, this is a bloody horror movie, sometimes funny and sometimes terrifying. I give him a 7.
