I went looking for this movie after I read the novel "Red Storm Rising" by Tom Clancy. Timeless masterpiece about the Russians of the thirteenth century being invaded by the Germans. The film was made in 1938, under the orders of Joseph Stalin to warn the Soviets about Hitler and Germany. The battle scenes are done wonderfully, proving that you do not need computer animation to make a great fight scene. Probably the greatest work of Sergei Eisenstein. Also see 'Battleship Potemkin'. Any history buff or poly-sci major should see this movie. 10 out of 10
