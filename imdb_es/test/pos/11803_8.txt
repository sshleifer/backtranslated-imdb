"The Cure" is a very touching and moving drama. The film focuses on two guys from the neighborhood who become good friends. One of the children has AIDS. The boys become good friends despite Erik's apprehension at first. The film shows the children's journey to discover "the cure", which is in Ohio according to "The National Examiner", and how it affects their relationship. The acting is wonderful (I've never seen Annabella Sciorra do better), and the movie is simply moving. I could not stop crying with the shoe scene. This is a good tearjerker. Keep the kleenex close. 8/10
