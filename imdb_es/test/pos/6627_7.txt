Shame, is a Swedish movie in Swedish with English subtitles. The film is about a husband and wife named Jan, and Eva. They live on an island working as farmers. There is an ongoing war and the soldiers begin to attack the people on the island. Once the war subsides, a little Jan and Eva are arrested as if they agreed with the opposite side. Once released, even more problems occur and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war and life or death. Winner of the CEC Prize for Best Foreign Film at the Cinema Writers Circle Awards, Guldbagge Award for Best Actress (Liv Ullman, who plays Eva) at the Guldbagge Awards, NBR Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actress at the National Board of Review and the NSFC Award for Best Actress, Best Director (Ingmar Bergman) and Best Film at the Awards of the National Society of Film Critics. Shame, has good direction, a good script, good performances of both Max Von Sydow (who plays Jan) and Liv Ullman (who plays Eva), good cinematography and good production design. Shame is a well-acted and well-made story of how people in a desperate situation sometimes do what they can to survive. The movie has a powerful message and it's a good movie. The reason why I do not rate this film is because it is not a masterpiece like other Ingmar Bergman films like Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal or Persona, for example. The film did not have as much impact on me as I thought and lacked the reflective and philosophical dialogue of Ingmar Bergman. Although it is far from being one of his best movies, there are still many things that I like about Shame, and it is a good movie. I probably would have liked more not to have seen some of those other Bergman masterpieces.
