Each show is excellent. Finally, a show about something more than why it sucks to be married or beautiful people who talk about why they are like normal people. It is a pity that it has been canceled. <br /> <br /> Mike Scully and Julie Thacker, former members of the Simpsons, wrote or produced some of the funniest episodes of that series and much of the similar humor style is filtered here. Take Officer Steve Cox and think of Troy McClure. However, it comes with its own unique brand of humor and let's face it, a teenager will love it just for the faces. <br /> <br /> What about the television that cancels most of the good programs and us? Do they feed themselves with spoons of abominations like Who My Mother Almost almost with whatever it is called? Please learn a lesson. Not everything has to be about tenderness or romantic sufferings or, especially, reality shows about how to demystify every aspect of life. Some people really like to laugh and not have to think later. Well, my grip is made for the day. Now let's go back to the Simpsons. When is it in? Oh yeah! All the time.
