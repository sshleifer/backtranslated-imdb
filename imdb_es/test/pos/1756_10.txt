Hi again, I've been thinking about this movie all my life. I saw him when he was 5 years old in Los Angeles, California, in 1942. What a wonderful story of being good to one another, kindness and charity. It is forgotten that the errors are related to each other. It was as if they were people. I love this movie and also my adult children. What a beautiful color in this movie. I need to watch this movie again. There is a story about an envelope in the movie, that I just can not remember the "why" of it. <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening.
