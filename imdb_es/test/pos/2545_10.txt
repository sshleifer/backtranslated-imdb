The majesty of the second characteristic of Ramin Bahrani is that, like the work of a poet, he portrays the very soul of humanity and lets it flourish on the screen. Beyond the reach of most other independent films, CHOP SHOP is wise, exudes the best of the great cinema of the era; We can observe the works of Bresson and Pasolini and compare the work of Bahrani with theirs, and yet CHOP SHOP is fresh and urgent for modern society. Can we see the operation of a teacher here? a certain sense of beauty, style and content merge into a movie that reminds us what it means to be alive. Instead of focusing on the New York side that we see so often, we live and breathe with our young hero, Alejandro, in the homeless Willits Point. A fascinating quasi-world of our culture? And yet, it is a very, very real place. Trying to stay afloat, Alejandro has to support himself and his older sister. Watch this movie and feel the sense of spiritual understanding in which Bahrani guides us. all with deep and concise realism.
