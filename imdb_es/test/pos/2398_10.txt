I just saw Eddie Monroe and he really impressed me. The story accelerated easily as the plot unraveled to a surprising end. Poignant performances, action, humor and drama filled the screen. Topnotch acting for some talented inhabitants of Long Island. Great script This is the best movie that Fred Carpenter has done to date, I should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on the mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. It's hard to believe that this is an independent, low-budget film. Just imagine what Carpenter can do with a Hollywood budget. The last film by Paul Regina and is very missed and loved by all. He was a wonderful, successful, talented actor and a great human being. He will take care of all of us and we will never forget his dynamic smile and spirit. Great job for everyone who participated in this movie. A few stalkers stealing scenes, and comic cameos to break the serious content. You will enjoy this movie, go see it!
