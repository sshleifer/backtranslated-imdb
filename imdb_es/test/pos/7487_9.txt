Okay, I owe it to Pulp Fiction, but in my opinion it has its own voice and identity, mainly because of the direction of the music video, the sketch narrative and the great performances. Thomas Jane performs very well (the fight against drug trafficking is extraordinary), and also Aaron Eckhart. James LeGros has a short and effervescent appearance, great humor, "they got the Wong house". The interrogation and rape scene of Porzikova is memorable, as is the appearance of Mickey Rourke in the cameo: "take a beak". <br /> <br /> Great production of Hollywood B popcorn with excellent performances of aspiring and renegade A-level (Rourke). <br /> <br /> Well, take a pick, it's worth it.
