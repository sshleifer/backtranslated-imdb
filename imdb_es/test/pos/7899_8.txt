Let's face it, you know what to expect when you tune into a 1990 post-Corey Feldman film, it's likely that there are tits, guns and cars. In saying this, there is more to this film than just naked women (I am sorry to say), because they are mainly people who kill themselves in a variety of unusual ways and, as the name suggests, are often "mystical". I love horrible horror, and I love this movie. If you do not, you probably will not. But I think it's worth it for most people to try it, it's not so bad that it ruins your weekend or something like that. In general, if it's fun, meaningless, a bit of a corpse lover, and a childhood superstar of the 80s that you fancy, then you've come to the right place. It is a cookie !!!!
