Well ... it's about time! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that is his best movie in recent years. The plot is not too inventive, but the whole issue of the border patrol is interesting, and the ex-sailors, like the turnaround of drug traffickers, are great. But what makes this film so amazing is the fact that Van Damme has gone back to doing martial arts again. His latest films have been more action-oriented, but in "The Shepard", JCVD ​​has left the bad guys behind and seems to be in excellent shape. There are some impressive fight scenes and Van Damme proves that he can still take out the famous and famous 360 degree heel kick. Because it is a low-budget action movie, it has good scenarios and great acrobatics. Van Damme says some lines of humor and shows that he is improving as an actor. I am glad that he has once again distributed something of Van Damage ... I was disappointed by the lack of fight in his recent films. Scott Adkins is great in his role and Van Damme and he have a 1 to 1 showdown at the end. In general, it is one of Van Damme's best movies and will keep you entertained. A must rent for JCVD ​​fans. I just keep my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like "Bloodsport" or "Kickboxer". Nok Su Kow!
