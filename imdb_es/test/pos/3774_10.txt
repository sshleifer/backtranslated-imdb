I really liked that movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More classic / faithful / horror films should be remade at this level of comedy, which in my opinion is at the top of the line. A film without drinks, you laugh so much that you will spill it all on you. Can we wait more? Hopefully. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes did some remakes of classic movies. He made some very strong contributions. A photo of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope that some producer or director can come into the idea and bring new comedy to our screens. We need a good insurgency of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever. A good FIX comedy.
