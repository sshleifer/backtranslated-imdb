Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their art of scratching. From that single line of description of the film, you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little movie is. It is a joyful and vibrant celebration of a fresh subculture that is little known. It is full of excellent hip hop underground music and you can see some of the best DJs (for example, DJ Q-Bert, DJ Shadow and Mix Master Mike from Beastie Boys) showing their stuff. When entering the film, I was not sure that "scratching" can really be called an art form, or that the record player can be seen as an instrument in its own right. Scratch completely changed my mind on these points. What these guys do with their turntables is really amazing, it's definitely a kind of art, and the turntable, if you know how to use it, can be transformed into an instrument that can "play", like a drum or a guitar. And you even get a lesson on the basics of DJ Q-Bert scratching (for example, how to use the slider to get different sound effects). All these DJs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after seeing Herbie Hancock perform their song "Rock It" (remember that song, right?) Live at the Grammys. What attracted his attention was not Hancock himself, but his DJ and his scratching. Scratch not only tries to scratch, but also makes some "scratches" themselves thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is recorded and edited. There are times when the clips "rewind" quickly and then "resend" several times, reflecting (in the middle of the movie) what happens when a DJ quickly moves the disc on his turntable from side to side while use your fader (that "wicka wicka-wicka" sound). If you are hip hop fan or not, you can count on Scratch to enjoy a very pleasant night at the cinema. After seeing it, I wanted to go buy a record player on my own. And I want to say this as a compliment.
