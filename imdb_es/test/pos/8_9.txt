I am a First Class Petty Officer (E-6) and I have been in the USCG for 6 years and I feel that this film represents the Coast Guard strongly. There were only a few scenes that were crazy. The most outlandish thing was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down inside the sinking ship to get the captain of the ship out of the engine room ... that would never happen. Swimmers are not allowed to enter any ship regardless of the circumstances. Second, the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak), looked more like a NASA command center ... we do not have any equipment that is high tech. Third, the Captain of the Air Station would not execute search and rescue cases with 10 people on duty. Actually, it would be an E-6 or E-7 as the SAR Controller and maybe another 2 support staff members such as a SAR Controller and a Radio Watchstander. Otherwise, the movie was over, I think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the CG and their search and rescue functions instead of just aviation-based rates. Some of the scenes from school "A" reminded me of my days and the silly things I did and I got into trouble in my younger days.
