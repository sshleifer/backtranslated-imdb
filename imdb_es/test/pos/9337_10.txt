The video begins with a scene from a horror movie, in which a man proposes to his girlfriend. He begins to tell him that he is "different." As the full moon rises, it becomes a werewolf. Then he pursues her through the forest, and just before he attacks, they take us inside the cinema. Michael and his girlfriend are inside the theater. She is too scared to look any longer, so they leave. When they leave the theater, he starts to make fun of her. ("It's close to midnight, something evil is lurking in the dark ...") Michael then sings and dances down the street with his girlfriend. This scene shows Michael's ability with the camera. He never once acts "conscious" of his presence, as many other artists do. As they move through the cemetery, the tombs begin to open ... Once they reach an alley, they face a horde of undead. Then we see the horror face of Michael's girl. Who would not have a look of horror if their date turned into a zombie? Yes, it becomes one of the undead. (A very bright and bright, however). He and his fellow zombies begin what may be the best-known dance choreography of any music video. Telling you something else would give the end. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite music video of all time! You do not want to miss it! I give it a 10/10. (Yes, I know you can see the curtains on the back of the sound stage, and the werewolf looks a bit corny by today's standards).
