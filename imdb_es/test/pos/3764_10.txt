Some said it was a glorification film of nose candy, but apart from Dr. Hyde's original invention, no medicine has been developed that can provide THIS effect. If Viagra was the stage of the slime mold, that white foamy powder is the evolutionary step Stephen Hawking (or at least the branch of the wise idiot pharmacist). This reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine, seen as the emperor was without clothes. Few of us want to question the field of health; both because most of us would not have lived to our present age if we had been born before "modern medicine," and because our subconscious expects us to continue living if we have faith in the helping professions. So the geniuses who produced this movie made jokes with those Calcutta Bessy's, giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine. The timing was right, and many could see the commercial side of the healing companies behind the Oz curtain. A decade before, when George C. Scott came out of the movie The Hospital, my wife and I were sitting at the premiere in Oklahoma City. As in the new version of Jekyll & Hyde, we almost could not avoid falling from our seat, and we burst out laughing and howling uncontrollably while it lasted. The hundreds of other members of the audience were deadly silent. They were surprised that the doctors, the nurses and the hospital institution mocked. It was as if the Pope, Billy Graham and Gandhi were sitting in the House of Animals, with beer-stained T-shirts and all, competing to see who could tell the funniest jokes among the thieves. If the Hospital had been a slapstick comedy instead of a satire, they could have seen what was shown to them. Unfortunately, they were like the Republicans in a September 11 screening of Michael Moore. Perhaps smaller gold parachutes would have been given to the leaders of corrupt medical corporations, health insurance companies would have had more difficulty denying medical care, and health care providers would have demystified earlier, if George C. Scott I would have danced in a tutu while offering His terrible truths. But - forget everything I just said. Watch the film, be aware, cheerful, happy and full of laughter like the best play of Saturday Night Live, and let the subconscious submerge in the documentary of the underlying reality. Just do not blame me when "I have to get to have to arrive" becomes one of your sayings, or when "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide" occupies that part of your brain now paralyzed by "It's a small world after all". Or when you start calling your local hospital Our Lady of pain and suffering instead of Our Lady of Eternal Construction. Even Oklahomans were changing their favorite plea from the winner of their favorite boss's spur of "piss on him and leave him for dead", to "Body in a pit, you inside ..." The smell of death .. . It is gone! Chicken sushi! Mary. MARY. MARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
