This movie is the most traumatic and painful horror movie I've ever seen. Knowing that this movie is based on a true story and seeing Jeffrey Dahmer (Carl Crew) brutally murdering his victims is enough to make me full of tears. I admit that this was a low budget movie without the best dialogue, however, he explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a psychotic maniac. As he was so selfishly / inwardly emotional, his emotions and selfishness were so deep in his brain that it led him to become a murderer. All the people he attracted back to his apartment were attracted and felt feelings, and the reasons why he murdered them were not only for the excitement of killing them, but because he could not deal with the fact that they left him. . In the scene where he killed his first victim by striking an object on the back of the boys' head, I noticed that it was not because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated by the idea of ​​the guy leaving him. It was from then on that he got used to the homicidal behavior and made him kill his hobby, for both emotional and bad reasons. <br /> <br /> The scene he talked about while crying on the phone with his mother and telling him. how much he loved her and the love he showed his grandmother and how he did not want to move out of his home showed that he had love in his heart. One scene that I found quite spooky and strange was when a priest heard Jeffrey in a pub inviting a boy to his apartment and then phoned Jeffrey in a phone booth inside the pub to lose his patience and change his mind. house with jeffrey. When the boy left the pub, the priest hung up the phone and was laughing at Jeffrey. I also discovered that Carl Crew played a remarkable role as the role of Jeffrey Dahmer. His evil, cold facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real, he was shaking in my seat. His facial expressions reminded me of the way Vincent D'onofrio (soldier Pyle / Leonard) in the movie 'Full Metal Jacket' looked just before he knocked the General down in the toilet barracks. <br /> <br /> If your an emotional person. I would not recommend you see this movie, but if not, I encourage you to watch it.
