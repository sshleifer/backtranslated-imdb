I caught this movie at the far end of a film I had used to capture a movie that I really wanted to see again. When I saw the name of Raquel Welch in the opening credits, I decided to see it. Actually, it was a little entertaining and it took me back "on the back road machine" to the farces movies that Hollywood produced during the sixties, both in the same genre as the current things of the Austin Powers. Oh, the performance was not excellent, neither was the plot, but it was worth seeing. There were some lovely landscapes, although Mrs. Welch provided the most enjoyable of these. Hit it if you have the opportunity and look at it when you have absolutely nothing else to do. He's not a snoozer, but he will not let you roll down the aisles and want more.
