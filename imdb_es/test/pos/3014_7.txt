The cell fascinated me at first sight. I was a little surprised that fact, because the story of that movie is absolutely boring. If I had no history, the movie would be better. Bunuels comes to my mind "Un Chien Andalou", a film without a history, but also with fascinating and, sometimes, disturbing images. But THE CELL is at first a Hollywood movie, and only the second is a work of art. I am very interested in the next Tarsem project. Hamlet on Indian could be very interesting, especially when it looks the same as THE CELL. <br /> <br /> For movie music enthusiasts: Howard Shore's score for THE CELL is absolutely wonderful, but a hard listening experience, due to its very modernist style.
