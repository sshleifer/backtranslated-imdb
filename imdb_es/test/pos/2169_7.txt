This film will not be considered for an academy award, but if you enjoy a movie that is not taken seriously and only wants the viewer to enjoy it for ninety minutes, it is not a disappointment. You will enjoy a shipment of Darth Vader for the villain (the one who breathes), a female Batman for the heroine (but much nicer with much less disguise), and a joke involving cigarettes and the police captain who is very funny. In no way is it a great cinematic achievement. But if you like the countryside, it's worth seeing. God help me, I liked it.
