Golden Boy is, in my opinion, one of the dreams and treasures lost out there. A sexy comedy, about a young man who seeks to find his place in life and gets into all kinds of strange jobs that somehow have this sexy girl who finally falls in love with him, but he's not realizing it! It's really something that can easily be lost if it's in the name, but once you see it ... it will fall into the comedy / nonsense that lies within. Truly a crime was committed that only produced 6 episodes of OVA and a pilot movie. However, being unique as it is. I'm surprised he survived to produce so many. If you want to laugh, with a high quality anime (100% without CGI), take a look at this anime. Boy that one day can save the world ... or maybe not.
