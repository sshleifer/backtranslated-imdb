Let me start by saying that if you expect a subtle mood, you are in the wrong theater. It is low and forceful. But he is not willing to tickle his funny bone. He has drawn the hammer and has drawn an account on one side of your head. But do not fear. As the movies go, this is a pretty smooth education. Oh, too, loaded with oath, but once again, Mike Judge, not Fred Rogers. <br /> <br /> Was this movie called 'intelliocracy'? F *** no. The gem, the essence of Mike Judge is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves. Beavis and Butthead were the most popular among young teenagers, the same people who laughed endlessly. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, I do not think the humor in this movie is aimed at the super smart. Maybe you're too smart to get it. But it is not pointing you. He is pointing to his average Joe. And it has a message: act together and, for the love of God, study botany! It's a bit uncomfortable and the narrator becomes a little irritating after a while, but once again, this movie is aimed at people who need a lot of narration ;-) It's funny. You have a message that you want to make sure we all understand. <br /> <br /> I question the casting of Luke Wilson in the role of a man with a 100 IQ. Sometimes, you can not minimize (what do you have, like a 104?) At the level of your character. Slightly forced at times. <br /> <br /> Kudos in Dax Shepard in this. I remember seeing him in Zathura and I thought, "This guy looks like an idiot." In this movie, he makes a great idiot. Maybe I'm a psychic. <br /> <br /> It took a little time to warm up Maya Rudolph, but I gave her some room for maneuver. After all, she had to be a heterosexual man for a whole planet. But once he had a little time on screen, he made a solid contribution. <br /> <br /> Terry Crews played the same psychotic and aggressive character he has played many times before, but he is a first-level president. <br /> <br /> Another advantage is that the place was practically empty. Counting my girlfriend and I, there were literally six people in the theater. We could have had a barbecue pit and a mariachi band. Therefore, there are no annoying people who speak, as seems to be the norm in the era of 'talking to television'. <br /> <br /> In general, a good premise and a competent delivery, given the intended objective. Many laughs splashed everywhere. <br /> <br /> What made this movie scary was the fact that when we left the cinema, it was as if the movie was still playing. We saw a lot of idiocy in the people around us, maybe it was made more evident by the dose we received in the theater ... <br /> <br /> They are all capsules, all of them!
