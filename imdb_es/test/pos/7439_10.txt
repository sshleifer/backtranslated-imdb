this film is just amazing ... unfortunately in Portugal not even a shadow of it ... and I agree with a previous opinion, only FF fans really give real credit to the film ... but for the rest ... I dare. to see it the story is great, and I thought the game had finished the story, but the writers have given us a great story to the god of all RPGs ... the ost, as always, came from heaven;) ehehe but The little details that they gave us (those of us who are fans of the game) are beautiful. As the ringtone is the winning song of the game, and even some movements are very familiar. Look at them, it's a great story, a great animation. ... only 10/10
