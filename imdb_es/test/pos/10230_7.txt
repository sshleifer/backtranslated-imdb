I enjoyed this movie. The appearance of these mutants, along with the tone of the film, is very good. Also, David Cronenberg as Philip K. Decker was great. I wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (except murders, of course). <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the creatures in this movie, although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget. , the mutants / creatures / monsters looked great, especially from 1990. This is definitely a unique movie and not a shit. It makes me want to go and find a novel on which it is based. This is an interesting movie because it shows how humans can be monsters and the "monsters" are those who have humanity.
