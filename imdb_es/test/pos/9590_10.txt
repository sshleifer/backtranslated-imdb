I'm like the rest of the fans who love this comedy, I've been waiting for it on DVD. I have it on VHS and I'm so tired of waiting for a release and I'm worried that my VHS copy will go bankrupt, I have the equipment to burn it on DVD. The image and sound are excellent to my surprise. If someone else wants a copy, write me at <br /> <br /> stone_stew@yahoo.co.uk <br /> <br /> and for £ 7.00 I'll put it on a DVD, print the DVD and get it in the post for you. £ 7.00 only covers my costs and registered shipping, etc. maybe with a little more, so I'm not going to make money with that, I would like the world to see this jewel of ignored comedy. I recently saw a copy of eBay I got it for over £ 26, amazing. How can they not release this classic? Send me an email for payment details such as check or Paypal, etc., etc.
