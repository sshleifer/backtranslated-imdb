Last night I saw this movie for the first time. I've been thinking about it all night and this morning. I can not say it was my favorite movie, at least not yet. I need to see it again. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is impressive. Each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a movie that has the name of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> It is always tempting to see De Chirico in any image of rows of orders that vanish in the dark, but in this case the analogy fits. In many ways, the figure of Malkovich walking through the fog and the Ferarra wind echoes the shadow of the canvas statue that pursues Milan in the main works of the Italian-Greek painter. It is a little threatening, a presence that observes and, in its quality of film director, exerts influence in all the history. <br /> <br /> The enthusiastic fan of the Wenders can not help but think of a bit of Damiel and Cassiel wandering the streets of Berlin, watching everyone but not interacting directly with the inhabitants. And, following the metaphor of Himmel Uber Berlin, the angel (or in this case the director Malkovich) interacts with one of the stories. <br /> <br /> At this point I have to withdraw from taking this line of criticism too far. I need to see the movie again. I'm pretty sure this is the thread that will unite Malkovich's monologue. <br /> <br /> Perhaps your reflections and pontifications are a pretentious and empty dialogue that sounds good but can not be analyzed in real communication. Maybe that is the central point of this. No one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until he has done his homework. <br /> <br /> We must be careful to throw the word "pretentious". It is easy to dismiss anything that sounds like a pretense of the intellect, but that leads to a frightening mental state, in which the only conversation that is considered genuine, earthly or authentic is the most banal. When we reject all discussions about philosophy, God, existence, meaning and all that sweet brain, we are shaping our culture to die a slow, stupid and ugly death. Perhaps this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us. Certainly not the only subject of the film, but I think it can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> The other leitmotiv (and the most obvious) is that of satisfaction. There is a lot here, and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would far exceed the 1000 word limit for this review. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch the movie. But I offer a warning: it is not an autonomous film (at least I do not believe it yet). Some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thought of their time so much that the viewer needs to have a training in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film. Par-dela les nuages ​​is one of those movies.
