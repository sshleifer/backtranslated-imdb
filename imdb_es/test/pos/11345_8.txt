In Hong Kong, 1962, editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife, and secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband moved simultaneously to an old building. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. His wife and husband spend most of their time away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like kung-fu stories, noodles and soap from a restaurant near the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a kind of repressed and platonic love. Later, they realize that their partners are having an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and the probably repressed condition of the married woman keep her love on a Platonic level. 'In the Mood for Love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholy and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film did not have a script and the actors were never sure what they would be filming. Later, the director edited his story based on the filming. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in history until 1966, when his conclusion is intentionally open and is not well defined, leaving questions like who is the child with Li-Zhen. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Love Ã€ Flor da Pele' ('Love on the surface of the skin')
