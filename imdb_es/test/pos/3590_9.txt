I admit that I am amazed by the sea and have spent several years in the Navy, so I am a little predisposed in this. I missed this documentary when it first came out, but I bothered several people to buy it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it. Part of the film is incredible and I respect those who make this type of documentary. Seeing the 200 tons of "blue whales" across the sea is an incredible image, they looked like submarines. I like the level of information and the data that is transmitted through the narration, it is correct, I do not want to know anything about science, only some of the basic concepts, seeing these things is enough for most people. The BBC has the ability to put things at the right level for the target audience. <br /> <br /> A really great documentary, up there with 'The World at War for' me, the DVD is of excellent quality. If I had a little criticism, it would be some of the sound effects obviously added here and there, I think they detract from some of the scenes. But well done to the BBC and to Discovery.
