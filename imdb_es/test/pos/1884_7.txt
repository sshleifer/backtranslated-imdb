This was a funny movie. The fact of having seen the Evil Dead trilogy not a week ago (and stop wanting more), I got as many Bruce Campbell movies as I could, including the really bad ones. This is fun, without being exceptional, but as original as hell. <br /> <br /> I mean you have crazy scientists, superhuman cyborgs, half-brain fanatics, gypsies, ex-KGB taxi drivers, jealousies, murders. of passion, love, romance, sex, action and more, all with the same 6 actors :) <br /> <br /> You really have to see and enjoy it, I can not explain it in a text box. I guess it's not so much a cult movie as Evil Dead, but it certainly has that Bruce Campbell touch that I love. Ted Raimi lends a hand, Tamara Gorski looks beautiful and interesting (she has moved away from the prostitute much on Friday the 13th) and Vladimir Kolev also shows great promise as an actor, although he will probably be chosen as a secondary character. in Hollywood movies his entire career. <br /> <br /> In a few words: funny movie. If you liked Evil Dead you will also like this.
