The rise of punk music was barely documented in the film and most people tend to focus on events in other cities such as London or New York. Penelope Spheeris managed to preserve a snapshot of Los Angeles around '79 -'81 that shows that a vibrant and diverse art / music community had been generated and rivaled any other. For some, the bands are read like a who is who of the now legendary American punk; Black flag, X, Circular pulls, Germs, Fear. The purists argue that vital bands were lost (Weirdos, Zeros, Flesheaters) and that the film was the cause of a rush of suburban possessors and male violence. However, the themes covered in the film are still relevant, the intensity of the music remains unparalleled and the influence continues to be seen and heard in the trends / fashions of today.
