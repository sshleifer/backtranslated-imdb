I once captured a 20-minute portion of this movie in Turner Classic Movies about 6 months ago. I thought that every minute of what I was seeing was gold, and because I was somewhere in the middle of the movie and I did not want to spoil everything if I saw it from the beginning, I decided that I would rent it immediately. Well, the video store that I frequented did not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. Before that experience I had only seen some Chaplin shorts, funny but not very witty, but after seeing the fragment of The Great Dictator, I watched three of his other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush and Modern Times (City Lights were Cool, I found that the Gold Rush was a little overrated, but it was still worth it, and I found that Modern Times is one of the funniest movies I've seen (the second funniest, behind Sherlock Jr. of Keaton, more Exactly). <br /> <br /> Finally, all the Grand Dictator, well, to be honest, he had his moments, both comedy and drama, but these moments do not always match well, Chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama (City Lights is the best example of this), but it did not always work with social comments, and the fact that there was a dialogue diminished the ability to print Chaplin's talent, do not get me wrong, I liked the as a whole, but I considered it of little importance. It would have given him a solid 7/10 on the grading scale. .if not for the end. The final speech given by the Jewish barber is enormously powerful. Yes, it is aimed at the temporality and customs of 1940, but its message is perfectly applicable to today's world. The speech made me cry, and I consider it one of the best finals I've seen. Final score: 8/10.
