On the surface, TMHS seems to be another generic drama of high school; but surprisingly hidden below are immense amounts of depth, originality and eccentricities that will not only make it unforgettable for the viewer, but also make it one of the best anime that the medium has produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> We see the world through the eyes of Kyon, who on her first day of high school meets Haruhi Suzumiya, a girl who boldly says to the rest of the class that she has no interest in the "normal humans" and, to top it all off, casually invites foreigners, time travelers, sliders or espers to join her. Kyon looks at him incredulously, wondering if he's joking or if he has some loose screws. However, defying her instincts, she starts talking to her. In doing so, it soon becomes evident that she is not an ordinary high school student. Not long after, he creates his own school club called 'SOS Brigade', and drags Kyon among other very unfortunate people to attend. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this anime complies with the usual standard conventions, Kyon the protagonist is an overly cynical pessimist and brings an ingenious narrative to the show. Far from the usual male 2D main characters that tend to populate the medium. The episodes themselves are not chronological, and require the viewer to think about the events that take place and how they relate to the previous cases. This is a stroke of genius; the effect is like a puzzle, as a new piece is placed, it gives us a more general idea. The previous scenes are now given complete new meanings, and their realization is deeply satisfying. However, this means that you feel disunited (it is nothing), a script written with great intelligence has overcome this problem and has ensured that it flows smoothly from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The story itself is surprisingly original, but I will not go deeper than the simple scheme of the plot I presented earlier, as it will undoubtedly be spoiled. However, what I will mention is that the plot incorporates a wide range of genres, ranging from comedy to science fiction. The way in which they managed to achieve this in the space of fourteen episodes surpasses me, and without a doubt it is a great achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> TMHS is a real gem, it has so much diversity and depth that it will attract practically anyone interested in anime. Look at it, quite unusual, this is something that is up to the enormous exaggeration that has received, and even exceeds.
