For those who have enjoyed the books and movies of Asterix, they will LOVE this movie! Yes, I must admit that it mixes some of the books and movies, but the characters are brilliant and not only do people show their CGI to the left, to the right and to the center. I've seen it several times and I've made fun of my socks. <br /> <br /> Of course it contains the main heroes Asterix (Asterix), Obelix (Obelix) and Dogmatix (Id√©fix), but this time having someone new with whom ... to deal with. <br /> <br /> With a sense of humor like that, the Gauls will follow and continue. Bless them.
