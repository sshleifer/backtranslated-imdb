brilliant script .. <br /> <br /> the script is very tight ... it will stay in the seat ... <br /> <br /> this film is an example of the film can survive only with the script and no-story is necessary .. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple and you can write in a line. but the script was amazing ... <br /> <br /> the brilliant performance of Vijay and Prakashraj ... <br /> <br /> although the plot is similar to the okkadu ... the director adapted only the plot. The Tamil version is much faster than Telugu. <br /> <br /> The film travels in a straight line without any possibility of deviation, although it can be understood that each and every one of the characters leaves. <br /> <br /> keep going
