I just finished projecting The Godfather in Germany. A great movie. We hope to see more Mr. Chapa movies in the future. It was wonderful to see a film so well made with so much suspense and a story that it will remain an instant classic. The ending with little ambiguity leaves the story open for a sequel. Watching a film with great quality really describes the serious potential of Chapa and his ability as a writer, actor, director and filmmaker. Chapa has impressed many with his triumphant "blood on blood" performance and has now demonstrated to all who have seen his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with genuine artistic control. Something that few filmmakers can afford.
