"The Dresser" is perhaps the most refined of the films behind the scenes. The film is full of wit and spirit, for the most part provided by the "energetic" character of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an attraction for the main actor (Albert Finney) who attends, the film never stops in her or makes her more than she is. <br /> <br /> The harsh style of Peter Yates, who worked so well on "Bullitt", is back on display and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence. This is very much appreciated in a story that could easily have become tedious. In the end, "The Dresser" will bore many people, but it will be a delight for lovers of British cinema. <br /> <br /> 7.7 out of 10
