The second live action release for Asterix is ​​much better than the glued elements of ten different stories that were called the first movie, instead of staying pretty close to the original comic. <br /> <br /> In a few words, Queen Cleopatra has made a bet with Caeser to build a palace in Egypt to prove that the Egyptians are a great people. The real architect Edifis seeks the help of Asterix, Obelix and the druid Getafix to complete his task. There are several moments of laughter out loud, some jokes that only the French can get (jokes in the week of 35 hours) while others are more universal. The big-budget special effects are spectacular, but are overshadowed by the jokes of the original comic. <br /> <br /> Depardieu and Clavier continue to perform brilliantly as a couple, while Monica Bellucci does the perfect casting as Cleopatra. Also, for comic book fans, fun pirates can compensate for their absence in film 1.
