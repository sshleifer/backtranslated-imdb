The controversial novel by Thomas Mann is the basis of the film "A Death in Venice." Although in the book, the hero is an author, in the film the director Luchino Visconti, who also wrote the script, transforms him into a composer. As such, the author / composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde), on the verge of mental exhaustion, is a burned artisan. After a long and successful career, now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice, where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition. However, while staying at the picturesque spa, he captures the attention of a beautiful young teenager, Tadzio (Björn Andrésen) who looks at him with curious interest and is immediately struck by him. Although Gustav is captivated by the wonderful youth, however, he must find a private time away from the child's governess (Nora Ricci), while he has to face an invasive plague that seems to have infested the city. The dialogue of the film, like the novel, remains subtle, as do the few brief encounters between the child and the artist. At the end. The audience, unlike the book, is hampered by imaginative imaginative hints and flights. Their relationship is never given wings, substance or opportunity, and if it were not for the brief resolution of the book, the film only allows the possibility of "what if". However, one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment of peace to obtain the forbidden, elusive but definitely criticized by prying eyes. Great story and a Bogarde classic. ****
