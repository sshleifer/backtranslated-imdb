When her elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her tenant Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and becomes a cannibal monster, television news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to prevent her beloved and old mother satisfy your hunger. /> <br /> Although the summary of the previous plot evokes images of horror titles of the coarsest 80s, such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mama turns out to be a refreshing and original version of the werewolf / vampire / myths zombies (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it's not right!), as well as a poignant study of the close bond between mother and son: Clay's devotion to his mother leads him to abandon all his other responsibilities , including his work and his relationship with the pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough), while Emily's love for Clay finally leads her to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie could be sharper, with a more elegant direction and better effects (the creature's shots are brief, so as not to disappoint), and some more experienced members of the cast are frustrated with terribly cheesy performances (Yes, Brion James and Stella Stevens, I mean you); Fortunately, however, the strong emotional current underlying the well-constructed story is enough in itself to ensure that Mom is an effective, compelling and occasionally powerful story, one that I do not hesitate to recommend to those who are looking for something a little different. .
