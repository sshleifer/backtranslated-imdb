Begetting is certainly an experience, and an experience out of the ordinary. The use of color is fascinating and, at times, frustrating. A lot of what happens on the screen is incredibly hard to distinguish. His sight is obscured by a sudden and strange change in color and tone, characters on the road and random cuts to the sky. The sound is very disturbing and a welcome addition. It really helps the nihilistic and hopeless tone that stifles this movie. <br /> <br /> As far as Begotten is concerned, the theory of "environmental violation and rebirth" seems pretty accurate to me. But I would not spend much time focusing on the meaning, it's virtually unimportant. It is clear that the director did not want to explain anything. Simply present it as it is, and if you want to find a meaning that depends on you. <br /> <br /> Watching Begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, but it captivated me from the opening. It really is like watching a person's worst nightmare. What we see is sometimes anguished and very unpleasant, but there is a beauty of surreal dreaming. If you are a fan of experimental / art works and you have not yet seen Begotten, make it a priority. I doubt you ever forget it. I'm sure I know I will not.
