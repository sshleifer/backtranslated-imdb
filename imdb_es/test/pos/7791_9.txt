The best part of this movie is that you can watch it again and again and still not be happy to see it. I've seen this movie at least 10 times in the last 12 years and it still makes me laugh as if I was watching it for the first time. I really like good comics like Orgazmo, Cheech n Chong, Monty Python series and many others, but this in Hindi is one of my favorite favorite movies. Some of them recently in Hindi are Golmaal, Munnabhai series and Herapheri series. So all I can say is that the Indian comedy is finally evolving. But Andaaz Apna Apna is quite different from the films I've said before. It is what I call the cobblestone comedy of Hindi and very few of those that are around the year 1994 in the Hindi cinema. Rajkumar Santoshi is replicated for the brilliant film.
