This film was screened at the Egyptian Theater of the American Cinematheque in Hollywood on April 7, 1999. It was described in the American Cinematheque's calendar as follows: <br /> <br /> "TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY 1951, Warners, 90 min Steve Cochran's a former convict who has never been with a woman Ruth Roman is a dime-a-dance lady who does not serve sad men A hotel room, a dirty cop, a shot: the perfect leap for a fugitive, the love story, this virtually unknown noir is Felix Feist's masterpiece, replete with revealing elements Cochran was never more vulnerable, Roman never sexier ... Imagine GUN CRAZY with a Steinbeck script. So good. "<br /> <br /> I just watched this movie and I agree with every word of the previous description.
