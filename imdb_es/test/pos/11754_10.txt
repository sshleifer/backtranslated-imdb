Two great stars and a legendary director created a magnificent love story that is memorable and moves on many levels. <br /> <br /> Henry King directed Jennifer Jones in his first hit Song of Bernadette and he again directs Jennifer Jones in this film and Miss Jones are perfect in this role and provide a beautiful and engaging interpretation that captures the conflict in the character and Bill Holden, who hit a home run in the 1950s with a series of hit movies that start with Sunset Blvd, Stalag 17, Born yesterday, Country Girl, Picnic and, of course, River Kwai is excellent at this paper. I can not imagine anyone other than Holden in this movie. I loved the ending and I cried every time I saw it. For anyone who has ever loved and lost, he will understand. For those who have not done so, they will not.
