I loved the movie. I loved Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whaley. The movie had many different places in it. I really liked it when Ann Hampton realized that she could not make Rhett love her. And when Scarlett and Ann were together and Ann apologized for taking Rhett and Scarlett, they just told her not to worry about getting him back. He had a great story that counted. You just can not compare it with GWTW. It just has so many great scenes. I love both SCARLETT and GWTW! Of course do not forget to have a handkerchief at hand.
