Jolene (Heather Graham) operates a nightclub in New York and lives with her husband, Carl (Luke Wilson), a photographer. After about 500 days of marriage, Jolene returns home to find a note from Carl that says he needs "some space" ... and a bouquet of daisies, his favorite flower. Jo quickly puts the margaritas in the blender and presses the button. Soon after, she embarks on a trip to find Carl somewhere in the west because, after all, she is "engaged" to Carl. However, when he finally finds him in Texas, Jo camps near his home, initially, hoping to find clues about his decision to leave. She knows a magnificent sculptor-neighbor (Goran, she can not spell her name!), But Jo discourages her attraction for her. When he learns that Carl can have a new girlfriend, he decides to consult a Mexican-American mystic (Alfonso Arau) for advice. Jo is engaged, but does that mean anything to Carl? This is a very imaginative and quite humorous look at the marriage vow. It is a peculiar script and an unconventional style is frankly infectious. Graham is simply great as the leaning woman who is having a hard time letting go. Wilson does not give his best performance, but he is suitable as the mixed husband. The rest of the cast is quite nice, however, with Goran, the beautiful wonderful as the sexy neighbor. The landscape, both in New York and Texas, is very beautiful and the costumes are fresh and fun. If you like romantic comedies And independent films, it is tailor made for you. Walk at a different pace that is the most attractive, but still delivers in the final category of happy ending.
