Captain Corelli's mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's best films. It becomes a good performance as the title character. This is a romance set in the context of a weathered, torn island. The character of John Hurt gives his daughter, beautifully played by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie is not to blame for being completely predictable. This film also allows Cruz to surrender as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the movie warms up beyond the opening sequence, this movie will keep you focused on it. Again, Nicolas Cage did not disappoint.
