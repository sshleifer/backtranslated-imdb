Continuing his return, John Travolta played a slightly twisted angel in "Michael." He may be a messenger of God, but he is not the friendliest type, as reporters Andie MacDowell and William Hurt discovered. The first time I saw this movie was before I started watching "All in the Family", so I did not recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now that I recognize her like this, I try to imagine Archie rebuking him for harboring an angel (whom he would probably classify as black, Jewish, etc.). <br /> <br /> I know, that's not true. relate to the movie. But I like to associate things that way. Anyway, it's a pretty interesting movie. Also starring Bob Hoskins, Teri Garr and Richard Schiff. <br /> <br /> What John and Paul said ...
