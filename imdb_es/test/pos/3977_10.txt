Contrary to what many may believe as this movie is a kind of film and attitude "against the system". It is an excellent portrait of the "system" in question and how ridiculous it really is. The funny parts of the movie are actually funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this film unrealistic is simply denying the obvious truths of life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That's what the university is about ... <br /> <br /> I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines. I think I've given my opinion about it. So now I write a couple more lines as a fill. I hope you have been entertained during this time. I encourage you to go watch the movie. It's worth it to entertain yourself as long as you follow it and immerse yourself in the movie.
