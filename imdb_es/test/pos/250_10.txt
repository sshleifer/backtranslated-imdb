"Cover Girl" is the best musical that Rita Hayworth has done. Mrs. Hayworth will always be remembered by "Gilda", however, the next movie would be "Cover Girl". The story is great. It is a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it great in the world of entertainment. He does it without the help of his talented dancer / director director (Gene Kelly). Mr. Kelly is given the opportunity to choreograph the musical numbers. The dances are spectacular. It's fun to see Phil Silvers, a comic, do the musical numbers with Mrs. Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is perfect. Lee Bowman has the opportunity to be an interesting third wheel, the other boyfriend.
