"Tumbling Doll of Flesh" by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese surprise about three thugs who sexually abuse, torture and dismember a young woman while filming their horrible actions. Typically crooked Japanese porn disease that offers a lot of sadistic violence and gore. there is no plot to talk about, just a lot of hard sex scenes (optically censored again) and a lot of blood. The special effects are quite impressive: the dismemberment of the Japanese porn actress is shown in detail. The scene of the tongue cut really made me writhe "His arm is also cut and his stomach opens graphically and finally one of the patients is having intercourse with his intestines." Psycho: The Snuff Reels "actually reminds me of" Guinea Pig: Flowers of Flesh and Blood ", but it's not so memorable, so if you're a fan of Japanese depraved people, like" All Women Are Whores "or" Raping My Virgin " Slave ", take a look at this 8 out of 10.
