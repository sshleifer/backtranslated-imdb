This movie is excellent! Afraid to watch documentary films? Cancel your contraction and see the story of little Dieter. You will not believe how captivating this good movie is until you've experienced it. I'm anxious to say that everything goes well in almost any film about the Vietnam War, including Apocalypse Now. It's a true story, it's a personal story, a story about the love of flying, the dream of being a pilot and the nightmare of being shot down on enemy territory. Everything is filmed in a style of "return to ...": in the place, Herzog asks the questions, Dieter responds with a memorable German-English accent, and with a memory that points out what happened about 25 years ago. There's a part I told my friends over and over again: rescued from their US Navy plane. UU., Dieter becomes POW of the Vietcong. Blindfolded for most of the day, he is being dragged through the jungle of Southeast Asia for miles and miles, barefoot. Tortured, insulted, disoriented, hungry and covered with infectious wounds, they arrive at a small and cozy village to spend the night. The next morning, after walking for several hours, Dieter discovers that someone stole his wedding ring from his finger. That's. He can not take it anymore. Start crying, as a result of complete exhaustion. The vietcong men react surprised. Dieter manages to explain what happened. Immediately, the group returns to the village and starts looking for the person who stole the ring. They find the man, they immediately cut off their finger and return the ring to Dieter. - The movie is full of these amazing and amazing situations. The immense cultural difference, the clash of East and West, the fear of the unknown (that is, everything that represents America on the one hand, the Asian jungle and its secrets on the other) can be seen throughout the film. Back problems? That's because you sat on the edge of your seat for two hours and did not notice.
