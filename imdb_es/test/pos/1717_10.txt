If you are a long-time Doctor fanatic and you cringed when you knew you were doing another series, rest, as it meets the high expectations of the original. The pace is much faster than the original programs, fitting more often in 50 minute episodes instead of the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the performance excellent. The hardest thing, and the best, is to get used to the production values ​​of the new series. Compared to the original, it has some now. (Although I will always have good memories of bubble wrap monsters and hand puppets). If you are not a fan, or if you tried the original and could not control it, jump with both feet now! Everything you really need to know about the Doctor, will inform you about the progress. This series was written with minimal references to the doctor's huge background story specifically to encourage new viewers. It's true that I'm just watching the first new series now that it's showing on the Sci-Fi channel (in other words, it's probably cut into tapes for a limited time), but I'm looking forward to watching future episodes, either on open TV or on DVD (July 4 can not come soon enough!)
