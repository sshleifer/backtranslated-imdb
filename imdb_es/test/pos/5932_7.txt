This Royal Rumble basically had the message of the fight these days. The trick and the image are more popular than the ability to fight. <br /> <br /> HBK vs Edge. Very good game A lot of heat for Edge, who was starting again like a heel and what better way to compete with HBK. It got a bit slower at the end of the usual. In general this match gets a 6/10. Undertaker vs Hedinreich. It is not a good match. Undertaker had to take Hedinreich through this game, which seemed to be really lost and ruined his movements. It became interesting to see Raws Gene Snitsky and a little later to Kane enter this match. In general, the fans seemed more interested when this match ended. 2/10 Kurt Angle vs. JBL vs. Big Show. This fight was slow at first, but it got pretty good at the end when Angle managed to accelerate the fight. Kurt Angle made some really good fighting moves and proves he is the best fighter in the game. JBL and Big Show played a slow game. The end of this game was bad. Throughout this game it was a 5/10 mainly due to Kurt Angle. Randy Orton vs. HHH. Good game, surprising heat for Randy Orton, who was the face in this match. Randy proved that he can go to the limit with any top star. This match also marked the first game in which HHH has fought where someone does not give up and saves him from a loss. Throughout this match it was around 6/10. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble game was fine. Some surprises Some not so good surprises. I was a little annoyed because Kurt Angle did not have enough time in this game. But throughout this game there was a guy that I never thought would be pushed so soon. I will not tell you who wins. I give this match an 8/10
