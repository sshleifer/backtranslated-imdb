I could watch this movie ALL DAY! I love. Probably my favorite movies of all time. But, by the way, "badger1970" there are some parts with a bad language, not too bad, but it is not exactly a G rating. Great movie !!!!! I recommend it to everybody. Either way, it makes me write 10 lines of text, so I'll keep writing until I'm allowed to post this comment. It's okay ... Still writing ... This is getting annoying. Ugh I still have four more left. Anyway, LOOK AT THIS MOVIE! Even if you've already seen it. I DO NOT CARE! Have you been 10 lines already? No Only 2 more lines remain. I do not even know why he wants me to do this. I think I'm finished. Wait a minute, I have NOT finished, SORRY, people. I know it's torture to listen to me. I guess you do not have to read this comment ... But you should, because I wrote it. It's probably over now. Finally, goodbye.
