Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, is in love with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear) and is married to Del, a stupid and stupid chauvinist who is trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he is brutally murdered and bloody, while Betty watches in secret. It leaves her restless, believing that Kinnear is really the character she plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his ex-girlfriend of RN. He goes to Los Angeles to find his lost love, not knowing that the stolen drugs are in his trunk. They chase Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, respectively), the hit men who killed Del unintentionally before they discovered where the drugs were hidden. They chase her across the country, while Charlie gradually falls in love with her image of her. <br /> <br /> And in Los Angeles, things become totally strange, since nobody realizes that Betty is delirious. Alternately funny and moving, this movie is almost perfect. Stop reading the comments and go see it.
