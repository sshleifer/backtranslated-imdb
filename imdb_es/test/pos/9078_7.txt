Hollywood is one of the best and most beautiful things that happened in my life. I admire and am very fascinated by the way Hollywood generates ideas and implements them. It makes me wonder about the reach of the human brain. I saw Flatliners a long time ago, but the story, the direction, the cast and all the performances are still fresh in my mind. The story begins with our main actor, Sutherland, who says during the dawn "what a beautiful day it is to die". For all of us, it is a story that shows emotions that are sometimes held in our mind throughout our lives. I can never understand few things in life. It shows us how to motivate ourselves and improve our quality of life. Anyway, I suggest it to all who look at it once.
