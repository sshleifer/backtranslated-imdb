This movie was a wonderful romp, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in strange places and a tremendous energy. The famous film director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through the film are entangled in a fascinating way when a prince who has never heard of him is overcome by a maneuver. There are beautifully rich images in everything and suggested paths but not followed (exactly what is happening with the shadowy wife of the pedestrian wedding director?). The ending is much better because it is messy. Realism and logic are not what you should look for here. If we are going to spend our weddings and our imaginative lives with the film directors, we should be prepared for a wild trip, seems to suggest this movie.
