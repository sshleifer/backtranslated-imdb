The commercial success of Peter Segal in 1995 and now the cult classic 'Tommy Boy' is a hilarious movie, an evergreen artist. Chris Farley is a talent we will never forget! <br /> <br /> 'Tommy Boy' is a simple story, told in the funniest and most fun way possible. Farley and Spade embark on a journey full of unstoppable laughs, even the part of Rob Lowe is very funny. As a child, I remember seeing 'Tommy Boy' over and over and over again. It has been one of the favorites of my childhood, and will always remain so. Even today, when it comes to TV, I remain a fanatic. I'm quite possessive about this movie. <br /> <br /> Segal's address is super. Chris Farley may have died in 1997, but he's still alive to me, at least. What an actor! Look at his work on 'Tommy Boy', he feels very comfortable. Later, he did fantastic performances in films like 'Berverly Hills Ninja' and 'Almost Heroes', but his work here is still the best to date! I love you, Farley! Spade, on the other hand, is as good as ever. He is an excellent actor in all aspects! <br /> <br /> Rules of 'Tommy Boy' .... 100 thumbs up from this writer!
