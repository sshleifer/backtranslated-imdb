One of the best silent dramas I've seen. As dark and gloomy as anything produced by the German Expressionists, but with performances that were quite underestimated and naturalistic for the day. No assaults on the camera and no involuntary laughter due to the histrionics that shake the eyes. Sjostrom had a convincing performance as the drunken, miserly and terrifying David Holm. <br /> <br /> The film, which mainly took place in a seedy Swedish slum, had a very claustrophobic feel, aided by low-profile lighting and the extensive use of irising. <br /> <br /> There was a deep, and typically Scandinavian, sense of despair and hopelessness in the narrative: the film begins in a rather grim present, and then we are told the story of David Holm in a series of flashbacks ( and retrospective scenes within retrospective scenes, a fairly complex story structure for 1921), where his character is offered numerous redemption opportunities, but he does not take them, and we know he will not. take them, because we have seen him die drunk and miserable and mean as always in the present. The penultimate scene is as dark as the one I've seen in all the movies. <br /> <br /> The writing and the direction are strict and intelligent, even by current standards. In several cases, Sjostrom skillfully prepares the audience to suspect something, and then pulls a surprise. The end may not be a surprise to some viewers, but I did not see it coming. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a complete restoration and a DVD release. Or even a fucking budget release. It just needs to be there so that people can see and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10, which is rounded up to 10/10
