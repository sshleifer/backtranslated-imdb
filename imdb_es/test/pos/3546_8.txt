Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Ten different directors present a segment based on their favorite opera aria. You do not need to be an opera lover to see this movie. (Although, of course, if you hate opera, you'll really have a hard time with this!) <br /> <br /> It's not surprising that the segments vary from bright to fair. Most of the scandal seems to have been for Godard's contribution, whether you think he's brilliant or pretentious, his segment will not change his mind. <br /> <br /> Some of the pieces have a clear narrative; others are more a montage of connected images. <br /> <br /> None of the pieces is more than 10 minutes approximately; If you are not satisfied with what is on the screen, wait for the next segment and think about how much culture you are absorbing. <br /> <br /> Keep your eyes open for the presentations of Buck Henry, Beverly D 'Angelo, Elizabeth Hurley, Briget Fonda, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt. (The Buck Henry segment is only worth the price of admission). <br /> <br />
