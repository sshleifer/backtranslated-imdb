Ingmar Bergman's meditation on war refers to a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast (from which country it is not specified). The war that is fought in the distance is a war that you only know from news reports. As they advance in their day, the war comes to them and soon becomes a struggle to survive, since both parties seem not to care about them. A grim look at the human cost of war and those who do not get involved easily in battle but who find themselves caught in the crossfire, nonetheless. It is a film ahead of its time, since some 40 years ago it became the notion of armies in war, where most of the victims are civilians who have reached the age of majority. This is a dark and disturbing film that is told from the point of view of the average person with the complete sense of hopelessness and confusion that is best expressed in the thought that kept running through my head: "What do I do now?". As an intellectual exercise, the film is first, this is a movie that will make you think. As an emotional film it is moving but it never moves completely. I never moved emotionally, even when the horror of the situation caused my brain to make flip flops. (I must say that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas he brings to the table, however, I have never been touched by his films.) I'm not a "fan." I've always sided with Fellini in the old class argument of cinema as to Who was better since he had more emotion with his films). Leaving reservations aside, it is necessary to see them, especially because we live in a world where war, for most of us, is just one thing on a television screen.
