By many accounts, Stu Ungar was not a very nice guy. He spat at the traffickers, at the rigid people to whom he owed money, and he was verbally abusive. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers could choose to sweeten man, turning him into a sports hero who would triumph despite adversity. But High Roller does not do that. And that is a difficult fight to overcome. <br /> <br /> Instead, we have to look VERY MORE CERTAINLY to see a man who never matured, surpassed the frightened child of the streets of New York, despite all his successes. And the only real approval he gets is death itself. Very brave (because people do not understand it) and very touching (when you do it). <br /> <br /> What is also brave is the use of a Scorsese sensation. "Aha, what a derivative!", People will say. Really? But there is practically no violence. And Stuey loved gangster movies. Maybe the feeling reflects the man Stu and not the director Marty? And if it really is a low budget movie and it looks so good, bravo! <br /> <br /> Finally, the linear flashback structure. Wow, will that be hammered? However, it not only works, but also works exceptionally well, even for those who do not see the connection with the "Seventh Seal". (TRIAL: In SS, Knight plays a chess game with death: In HR, Stuey says "We can play a hand of cards for, you know" ... Death says "It's never very good in cards ... "Damn the last line. <br /> <br /> No complicated effects or camera movements. There is no unstable camera. Nothing fashionable at all. Only a solid and tense narration. <br /> <br /> Maybe that makes the movie too basic and somehow defective. But, again, so was the boy. And that makes it almost right. <br /> <br /> 9/10
