Nazarin, from acclaimed surrealist Bunuel, is an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values. It's not a visual movie and I think I would have played better on stage. Bunuel takes us through this man, the Nazarene who lives as Christ lived; a true follower, that is, in poverty, and without taking care of the property and what it brings the next day. Some may call it parallel to the story of Christ, but any follower and practitioner of the word, life must be like Christ in a certain way. But, in essence, Bunuel also explores the office of selfishness and the need to sin of man and how kindness can save us all. It is a bold statement to make the film memorable for some. The truth, let it be said that the Nazarene is also selfish because he inadvertently gives in return or asks for it. His selfishness is his madness and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin, with the same face on each side. Many people represent the sides of a coin in this film, all with both faces equal. But the film is not exactly memorable once it ends and one could attack many of its ethical drilling and spills within the film's own doctrine. It is not a first-class Bunuel, but rather a "surrealist" dream sequence that takes place in the place where the message of the film is framed and worth noting, as it shows the capacity of the director, Bunuel.
