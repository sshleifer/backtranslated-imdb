This episode of Buffy was one of my personal favorites. Also the number three of Joss's personal favorites too. The episode presented very little dialogue and, in spite of that, the good people of the Emmys decided that it deserved a nomination. Unfortunately he did not win. When Hush premiered for the first time, it received around 6 million viewers, which was the episode with the highest rating of the fourth season. That should tell you something. Although there was very little talk, he managed to intrigue people enough to tune in. Those gentleman characters (who were played in my mimes) were some of the most terrifying creatures that the show has produced (or any television show I've seen). Nothing is more creepy than a group of men with silver teeth who attack you with a scalpel while smiling. I think that despite the lack of dialogue, the actors did a fantastic job in the episode.
