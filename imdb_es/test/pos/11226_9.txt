The cold and gloomy landscape of Big Sky Country, with its majestic snow-capped mountains juxtaposed to arid plains, is used poetically here in this slide show / lynchian fables about the death and melancholy of young and talented Polish brothers (who previously I treated the fans of independent films with the strange and fascinating "Twin Falls Idaho" (a film about a young woman who falls in love with two brothers who are Siamese twins.) A small orphan child is dying, and a city is point of flooding in the name of progress (in the form of damn and hydroelectric) With their strangely pleasant musical scores, their minimalist dialogue and their development of characters, and their strange fantasy sequences involving unique angels, the Polish brothers focus on what every good film artist knows about a movie, the moving images ... the images, the scenes ... paintings of deep beauty captured on celluloid. It is best to be seen late at night so that the disturbing images can stay in your mind and overflow while you get numb. The fact that all this has been done with a budget of less than two million dollars puts Hollywood with its costs of bloated films and its empty films to embarrass and indicates something important of the Polish brothers in the future.
