This movie has it all! It has a good story, good acting, great landscapes, adventures and some brilliant gags! Chris Farley plays Tommy Callaghanhe, the mega successful company 'Callaghan Auto Parts' has to hit the road to prevent the company from falling when Big Tom dies. The problem is that Tommy does not know anything about the rupture pads and needs the help of Callaghan Auto Parts worker Richard (David Spade). From the moment the two idiots hit the road, the movie is very funny. If you love the slapstick with a great story, you will love this because the gags are still coming thick and fast and the movie will only make you laugh out loud. He was so sad about Farley's untimely death in 1997, but a credit to his genius is 'Tommy Boy'. Get it, relax and enjoy this brilliant slapstick!
