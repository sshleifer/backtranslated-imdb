If you have nothing better to do, then go and rent this movie, it's smart, it's fun, it sure will have your attention occupied for a while. <br /> <br /> I discovered it while browsing the channels on a boring Sunday, it was on the wire, and for the faces I saw, I thought it would be worth trying, it made me laugh and for a movie on a Sunday without anything else on television, it was fine. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler looks amazing in the movie, even though her performance is not what I expected, it's a bad performance and for the rest of the team, I liked Reba in her role as Dr. Me. It seemed interesting to see the comedy guy "What I like about you" playing an almost gay lawyer. <br /> <br /> As for J. Goodman, I found him, as always a very good performance, Michael Douglas plays a small role, but his characterization was difficult for me to identify him ... <br /> <br /> It is also a good movie to watch in company.
