It's the 1920s. And a man named Walt Disney was on a mission: to satisfy families and children all over the world with one thing: entertainment. What did he do? He made cartoons! Whoo !!!!! And he made a character that is as good as a mouse ... Mickey Mouse. LOL! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> Mr. Disney himself drew two films: "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie". This review will focus on the 1928 feature, "Steamboat Willie." <br /> <br /> Since I learned about this movie when I was a child, I always wanted to see this movie. Well, in 1997, I rented an old VHS that had many old Disney cartoons, starring the Mouse !!!!! Mickey Mouse!!!!! And guess what? That short was there, and I loved it! Shortly after I recovered the tape, I was on the old Disney Channel (note: the "Old" Disney Channel) on an early Saturday morning. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a great caricature; This paved the way for more great Disney things from 1928 to 2002! <br /> <br /> 10 stars, in fact !!!!!
