wow is all I could say that I really loved the movie and one thing I could say to Aaron Carter is that I really think you should be in a lot more movies because you're rock. I love Aaron Carter so much that it's very hot and that's why I say Thank you so much for making this movie great. I really do, I wish I could do many more movies because he is a great dancer, actor and singer. I wish I could sing as well as he did. and I've been a fan of him forever and I'll never stop loving him. I rented the movie and I've had it for two days and I've seen it literally like 10 times. laugh out loud, you could call me crazy, but that proves that I liked it a lot.
