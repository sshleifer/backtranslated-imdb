... and I'm very disappointed because I can not seem to buy the DVD or VHS anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's a mix of Uncle Buck, The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald. Fabulous as the spoiled teenager. This was done when Molly was still dark, just before she hit big with Pretty In Pink. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good and clean family comedy, with an advantage! <br /> <br /> If someone has a copy of this, or knows where I can get one ... please leave a message for me, it will be very appreciated.
