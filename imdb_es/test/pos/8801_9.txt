Great movie in the style of Trainspotting ... It received the name of Welsh Trainspotting, but so was Twin Town, although this is a street ahead. <br /> <br /> Take a weekend in the life of Cardiff Clubbers, good debut Kerrigan Movie and some great performances in the cast. <br /> <br /> Go see! then go to dance
