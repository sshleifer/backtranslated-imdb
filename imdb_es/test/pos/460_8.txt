Set in Hungary in November 1956, this is the story of a group of foreigners trying to leave the country at the time of the Uprising. <br /> <br /> Once the airport is closed, the starting trip begins on a bus that takes them to Austria. As would be obvious, they stop on their way, which is where they face the almost impeccable Yul Brynner, whose military might as commander of the Red Army was marked by loneliness, his inner struggle between good and evil, his quest for the truth and His need to feel emotions for other human beings. He was saddened by the fact that his work had taken him as far away from his friends as from his enemies, and he longed for social contact. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley interprets the quintessential English of rigid lips par excellence, no matter how serious it is. Rol, manages to maintain a logical perspective almost carefree of life, while Jason Robards has a surprising film debut that reinforces the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career. Deborah Kerr, as the protagonist, shows the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her, but manages to provide the strength and resolution necessary for her character. <br /> <br /> The film is a very stormy moment in European history, but it never fails to remind us that there is something good in all of us and that you can never completely judge a book by the cover. Fabulous scriptwriting guarantees that, for all the seriousness of the theme, there may still be large instances of a line and comedians being added, rather than detracting from the film. The chemistry in the cat-and-mouse game between Kerr and Brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than one movie together. <br /> <br /> In general, a completely absorbent film that I would definitely see again. 8/10
