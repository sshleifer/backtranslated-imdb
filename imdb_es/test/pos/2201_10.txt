I have a copy of this movie and I've always loved it. I comment here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. That production was staged by the San Francisco Opera and starring George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early 1980s, Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou had won Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won the Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) play Sweeney on Broadway. They must have made the movie about when I saw the show. To this day, the most touching moment I can remember in the theater happened when Hearn sang "These are my friends". ("These are my friends, see how they shine." "My arm is complete again!") <br /> <br /> Hearn's performance in the production of the San Francisco Opera convinced me that there was no I've lost nothing in the almost twenty years since I first saw him play the piece on Broadway and later in the movie. What a talent! It's nice, funny and scary, all at the same time; and he can sing, boy can sing. All this reminded me how great the movie is. Highly recommended Ten out of ten.
