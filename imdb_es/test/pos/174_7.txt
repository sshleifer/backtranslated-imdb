I can not believe I rarely see this title mentioned by all the horror fans of the eighties and I will definitely not join all of my critical colleagues here in saying that 'Bloody Birthday' is a horrible sight. On the contrary, I enjoyed it a lot and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingenuity and surprise turns it offers. Do not limit yourself to refer to this movie as "another slasher of the 80s" because the victims here are quite improbable and the murderers too. We are introduced to three cherub look youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse. At the time they were released, the planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and, because of this, the children are without emotion and apparently without consciousness. This really begins to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a wave of merciless murders. <br /> <br /> Of course, these things are incredible and even somewhat offensive but, seriously, who cares? Unlike many other horror films of this period, at least try to bring something original and imaginative. For once, the children's performance is good and the whole movie has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music. The sequences of murders are somber and tense, and it is always strange to see them committed by children with the face of an angel. I do not know who hired the 3 children, but they did a good job. Especially the girl and the boy with glasses are very memorable. The shadowy images of the heartless trio remind you of the classic highlights, such as 'The Village of the Damned', 'The Bad Seed' and 'The Children of the Damned'. This movie is not as memorable as these milestones, but it is very funny and no horror lover will regret having seen this. <br /> <br /> The Bloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not particularly the biggest genius of cinema, but a pleasantly disturbed guy who also offered us an immense feast of cheeses like 'The Brain' and 'Starship Invasions'. If all this is not enough to convince you yet, Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not any nudity, but an act of topless dance of MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh, and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo of Joe Penny, later the protagonist of the television series 'Jake and the Fatman'. Check it out!!
