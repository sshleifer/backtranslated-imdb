SPOILERS ahead? During the first ten minutes or so of Star Witness, we are presented with a typical quote from an urban American family, without appointment in an unnamed city, which is another way of saying the NYC version of Warner Brothers. Except for the small children, including the lovely Dickie Moore and the cheerful Sally Blane, they are a pretty boring group, and their conversation at the dinner table is tedious and we wish the story to move forward and bring in the star, Walter Huston. But wait, friends, wait. Suddenly, the action of a movie of serious gangsters is triggered, attracting the family against their will, and after that, this baby never gives up. There is suspense, a screenplay nominated for an Oscar, good performance; Everything you want the old movies to be is here. I question chic sales performance; It must be an acquired taste, but its presence is crucial for the plot. He has received a special status in the credits, so Warner Bros. must have been really important in Sale, but the way his corny routine fits in with the audience is something lost to me. Maybe it's lost for a period of time, an unknowable factor that had to be a movie buff in 1931 to understand. In addition, the climax is typically melodramatic. However, this is the best studio release of that year that I've seen so far (however, I've only seen eight, so maybe that's an inconclusive view). Do not miss it when TCM shows it. 8 out of 10.
