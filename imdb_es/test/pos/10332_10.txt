This movie is a study piece for my English class, but I was surprised by its depth and meaning. Since we are closely watching all the facts and characters of this film, it is an interesting story of love, hate, war and prejudice. Well recommended! <br /> <br /> Story: a girl called a well-to-do Jewess Patty Bergen encounters a runaway prisoner of war, then hides it in her playhouse in her huge gardens, and when they meet, they begin to see the other qualities and they earn love. Patty's father despises her and treats her like trash. Anton (the prisoner of war) almost blows his cover to protect her, but Patty manages to stop him before anyone sees him.
