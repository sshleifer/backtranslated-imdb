After having seen the full-length film Kieslowski made from this episode of "The Decalogue" years ago, I returned to this viewer as we watched the ten full vignettes. As with the other films, it is loosely based on the fifth commandment, or "Thou shalt not kill." <br /> <br /> Kryzsztof Kieslowski, writing with Kryzsztof Piesewicz, took a look at the mind of a young man who commits a heinous crime by murdering an innocent person to vent his own frustrations. This delivery has a Dostoevskian character that reminded us of "Crime and punishment", or at least some of the qualities of the novel are transferred to young people without direction that apparently have no redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> The story shows the young man walking the streets of the city without having a clear idea of ​​what to do or where to go. The only tender moment he shows is when he visits the photographer's place to ask for an old photo of his sister to be restored. Kieslowski lets the killer board a taxi with the intention of robbing the driver, but it is his anger and frustration that makes it the best thing for this young man to kill a man who did not deserve to die. The last moments of this criminal is one of the most fascinating sequences of any film, past or present. <br /> <br /> The other element of the story is the relationship between the public defendant and the criminal. Nothing can prevent the court from condemning the young man to death. The lawyer feels that in the end he has failed his client and goes to the judge to see where he was wrong. All the young man asks him to do is to recover the image and send it to his mother. <br /> <br /> Kieslowski's account of how he interprets the fifth commandment is a surprising film that will remain in the viewer's mind for a long time. After this episode is forgotten.
