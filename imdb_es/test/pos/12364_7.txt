Victor Sjöström was a master in this film, since he starred, directed and even wrote the script. That is pretty amazing. While few today know who Sjöström was, it could be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star of Bergman's most acclaimed films, WILD STRAWBERRIES. <br /> <br /> In regards to this movie, it's a bag mix. On the one hand, we must respect it because by 1921 it is a very good movie. The idea that Grim Reaper is sitting with a dead man to talk about his wasted life is quite imaginative. In addition, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is quite convincing and technically speaking, this is a well-crafted film. On the other hand, it is an incredibly outdated and preached movie, rather like something that is expected to be shown in Sunday School rather than in an honest theater of kindness. Also, some of the elements of the story simply do not make sense. Instead of leaving as dedicated or good, the moribund Salvation Army worker looks like a sap, a very sad and confused sap. Why is she "in love" with this man? I'm missing something? <br /> <br /> So, my recommendation is that if you're madly in love with silences (like me), then, of course, look at it. But, if you're not a silent fan, this movie could do nothing to convince you that this style movie is brilliant because the story is too melodramatic and outdated.
