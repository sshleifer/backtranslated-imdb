I really did not know what to expect from this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. I learned it because I recently met Norman Reedus and I'm trying to find more of the movies he's been in. <br /> <br /> I do not like much the movies of scammers or swindlers, but I have to say, this cornered me in minutes. Probably because I could not help but find out exactly who was pressuring whom. This film is elegant and fast-paced, with a credible story thanks to the location and the fantastic performances. <br /> <br /> Although I was impressed by most of the film, I must say that Dagmara Dominczyk was simply excellent. <br /> <br /> Give it a try, it's a very funny movie.
