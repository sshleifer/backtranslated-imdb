I really liked this movie, it totally reminds me of my high school days. The soundtrack is impressive. I'm a big fan of nic cage and this is my favorite movie where he is. I love history, it's a story of total love, against all kinds of things. I think that anyone who graduated in the early eighties (1980-1984) should see the movie. It brought back memories of high school.
