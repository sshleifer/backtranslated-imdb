The film is about Paul (Páll), a young man who is immersed in the hard world of madness and his stay in the psychiatric hospital "Kleppur" and his friends. Victor (Viktor) who during his education in England began to think that he was Adolf Hitler. Peter (Pétur), who took a lot of LSD and tried to fly from a roof, the fall did not leave broken bones or physical damage, only madness, is opposed to China. Oli Beatle (Oli Bítill) Oli has spent most of the time in the hospital, although Viktor is a little older than he, says he wrote all the songs of the Beatles and sent them by telepathy. <br /> <br /> The novel is better than then. The film covers Pauls 'entire life from his birth to his death, I have not seen the film for a long time, but if I remember it well, the film does not cover Pauls' childhood. <br /> <br /> "Englar Alheimsins" is fun, sad and powerful if you have not seen it veil NOW! And reading the novel first makes the movie better.
