"Joe" is one of those movies in which, although you think it could go smoothly, it ends up hitting you like ... I can not give an analogy. He showed not only that the idea of ​​long-standing unity in the United States was debatable, but also the various aspects within our society. Melissa Compton (Susan Sarandon) is the best daughter of flowers, while her father Bill (Dennis Patrick) is a clean cut executive. One day, Bill accidentally kills Melissa's boyfriend. Immediately afterwards, Bill has become acquainted with Joe Curran (Peter Boyle), a rabid ultra-rightist who works. As a result, the two end up associating more and more with the hippies, whom Bill finds unpleasant and Joe openly hates. But in the end, everything has serious consequences. <br /> <br /> It is true that some parts of the film are a little outdated, but it is a good juxtaposition of the two parts of the United States during the Vietnam War. And rest assured that the residual effects of everything will probably never go away.
