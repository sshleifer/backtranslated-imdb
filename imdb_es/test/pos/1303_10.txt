GLORIFY not GLAMORIZE World War II. <br /> <br /> We have had enough documentary series about the Second World War in the regular television programming. Without looking for information in any encyclopedia or book of films, it seems that this old memory can remember most of the names by itself. <br /> <br /> There was CRUSADE IN EUROPE, which was the title of the memoirs of war of an army general and later the 33rd president of the United States of America, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He told the story of the conflict in Europe as the Supreme Allied Commander saw it. <br /> <br /> Then there was a CROSS IN THE PACIFIC (a subject that is self-explanatory), of which I do not remember much. The newspaper / man, Jim Bishop was the host / navigator of BATTLELINE. <br /> <br /> And there was the excellent WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALIANT YEARS. * The series was a co-production of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American Broadcasting Company. It aired for the first time in the 1960-61 season here in the United States and boasts that Richard Burton speaks the words of Sir Winston. <br /> <br /> It's the production of our current issue of the NBC television network of 1952, this VICTORY IN THE SEA that wins the cigar, no doubt. <br /> <br /> To begin with, this had to have led to the production of several years of careful and literal classification through thousands of hours of film. The film images referred to here were the official filmed record taken by members of the Armed Forces of the United States, the independent news film, the Moving Image Register of our other allied allied nations, as well as the captured images of the Axis of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan. <br /> <br /> Once this was achieved, the corresponding film had to be cut and edited in a series of 1/2 hour installments. This was done with great skill, since there were so many changes of scene, either abruptly or as dissolution. The appearance of each episode seems as smooth as if it had been a single film project. <br /> <br /> The writing of Spoken Word to accompany this more refined real-life movie was no less surprising and unique. Highly polished and meaningful eloquence does not waste a word and sometimes even underestimates the description of the action, instead of exaggerating it. The narrative goes to Mr. Ralph Graves, who was a talented theater, film, radio and television actor. Without a doubt, he obtained a measure of immortality thanks to his golden tone of the written descriptions of the episodes. <br /> <br /> Finally, VICTORY AT SEA enjoys the luxury of having an original score, both opening theme and incidental music, written by Richard Rodgers of Broadway fame. (Rodgers & Hart, Rodgers & Hammerstein) His compositions are complex, complete, variable and even "classical" in the true sense. <br /> <br /> The Classical Arrangement was performed by the NBC Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Robert Russell Bennett and as a soundtrack / cassette tape / compact disc, it has been continuously available and has been in demand since its first release 55 years ago! And, really little wonder, because it is this musical score that is so fascinating to the viewer / listener. It really puts the frosting on this cake. <br /> <br /> * SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALIANT YEARS also had a beautiful and memorable original rating. This was also composed by Mr. Rodgers. <br /> <br /> ** We had additional "As in the Hole" in our house in the person of our Father, the late Clement J. Ryan (1914-74). Dad had been in the United States during the war, being admitted in 1943 or '44. Our dad was always at his disposal to explain and clarify even more any of the situations that were described in the series. <br /> <br /> He and our mother, the now 90-year-old Bertha (nee Fuerst) Ryan already had my older sister, Joanne (1942-90) as Dependent.
