This movie is the best horror movie I've seen. The acting is terrible and the plot leaves much to be desired, but the puppet gave me nightmares for weeks. Seriously, if you have small children do not let them see this. Of course, I'm a bit skewed because of an irrational fear of puppets and dwarves. Also a double cameo for the guy who makes mini me verne troyer. and a bit of gratuitous nudity, a necessity in any low-budget horror movie. All other horror films will be judged forever in my book.
