I remember reading the original Balzac story in French at the university. <br /> <br /> I remember Ken Nordine from WGN-TV in Chicago, reading as one of his nightly shows. <br /> <br /> I always loved History, but never believe you could or would make a movie about it. To my surprise, they did it and they did it VERY WELL. <br /> <br /> Few of Balzac's stories lend themselves to dramatization, which is unfortunate, and, as I love myself, I always wanted it to be filmed without him. A lot of Hollywood sexing. This is the closest thing to the perfect conversion that could be made. <br /> <br /> The theater of the mind is always better than what the eye can see, but this is as close as I think it can get to let the imagination of reading fulfill the reality of seeing.
