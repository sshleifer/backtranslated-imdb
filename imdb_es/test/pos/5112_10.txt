This is an excellent movie. The movie I liked several parts. This movie is very funny! Visit the website of Ernest's fun club at www.ernestfunclub.com There are several movies like the following: Ernest Goes to Camp, Ernest Saves Christmas, Ernest Goes to Jail, Ernest in the Army, Ernest Goes to School, Ernest Rides Again Slam Dunk Ernest, etc. I highly recommend it for family movies. All the protagonists, Jim Varney, return to visit www.ernestfunclub.com. What is Ernest's best movie? In my opinion, there are actually 2 Ernest Goes to Camp and Ernest Goes to Jail. So, if you've never seen Ernest P. Worrell, it's time to go see him. You will find it quite satisfactory "not what I want to say"?
