China White (1989) was the first international film by Ronny Yu. This U.K production, / Holland / Hong Kong was recorded in English and edited slightly for the Western audience. It was assumed that the American Wong brothers (Michael and Russell) should star in the film together, but due to previous commitments was not available, so another Western actor, Steven Leigh, took his place. Several stars of Hong Kong, like Tommy Wong (playing a silence) and the always spooky William Ho, appear as the director in an interesting place. <br /> <br /> The Chow brothers are in the Netherlands to run the family business. . They want the family business to become legitimate, but the other Asian gangs do not want to and see that it moves as a salvation move to please "foreigners" and they want to continue earning money the old way. Others want to take their business to a new low level by drug smuggling and what does not. After Chow's old man is shot down in cold blood, the brothers move against any family that is not with them. Can the Chow family prevent families from killing each other or while the streets of Holland flow with the blood of innocence and mobsters? <br /> <br /> A highly underestimated movie. I was surprised at how good it was. I have not seen the Hong Kong version. That would be a great gift for me. It's longer and has many more Hong Kong movie stars involved in the production. Pity that this movie is not available in D.V.D. The print of the video I saw was washed and the sound reproduction was not so good. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for fans of the action. <br /> <br /> factoid: This film takes place before the decriminalization of drugs <br /> <br /> in Holland.
