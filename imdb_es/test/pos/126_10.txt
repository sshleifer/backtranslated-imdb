CONTAINS INFORMATION "SPOILER". Watch the other film by this director, "Earth", at some point. It's a better movie, but this one is not bad, it's just different. <br /> <br /> A rare feminist point of view of an Indian filmmaker. Tradition, rituals, duty, secrets and the representation of strict sexual roles make this an attractive and culturally dynamic movie viewing experience. All married characters lack the "fire" of the marriage bed with their respective spouses. A husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual "adultery" by giving all his love, honor, time and respect to his religious swami (guru). His wife feels lonely and longs for the intimacy and tenderness that she finally meets with her lesbian sister-in-law who lives in her house with her unfaithful husband. This unfaithful husband is openly in love with his Chinese lover, but was forced to marry a lesbian (unknown to him). They only have sex once when their lesbian wife in the closet loses their virginity. <br /> <br /> A servant lives in the house and finally reveals the secret that the two women are lovers. Another important character is the elderly matriarch who can not talk or take care of herself due to a stroke. However, she uses a sound bell to communicate her needs, as well as her dislike of family members. She lets them know through her bell or hitting her fist that she knows exactly what is going on in the house and how much she disapproves. <br /> <br /> In the end, the truth about everyone comes to light and the two women Lovers end up running away together. But, not before, there is an emotional scene between the spouse addicted to Swami and his formerly heterosexual wife. His sari catches fire and at first we believe he will die. However, we see the two women united in the last scene of the film. <br /> <br /> The writer / director of this film challenges the traditions of her culture, but shows us individual human beings who are trapped by their culture. and the genre. We come to really worry about the characters and we do not see them as stereotypes. Each one surprises us with his humanity, vulgarity, tenderness, anger and spirit.
