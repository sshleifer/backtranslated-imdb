In fact, I had seen the last parts of this movie when I was a kid. Thanks to the parcel search function I was able to find out his name. For years I did not know the name, but the movie stayed in my mind. The ending left the hope that the main character would eventually return to Earth. It was a pity that it did not reach a series. This movie reminds me of Journey to The Far Side of the Sun. Also known as Doppleganger. If you liked this feature, the other one is worth seeing. It was made before The Stranger, but shares a similar plot. However, different. I just bought The Stranger off from eBay on VHS. I hope they make a DVD, but it is doubtful unless it comes out on Dollar DVD. Some pilots are doing it on the budget DVDs and maybe this will do it.
