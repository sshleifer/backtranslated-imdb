(r # 88) Bright show, very entertaining with spectacular effects. Any fan of these prehistoric reptiles has to see this. The CGI integrates extremely well with the environment and it's just fun to watch these giants go about their daily affairs as casually as on the Discovery Channel. This show was a stroke of genius and blows his followers "Walking with beasts" and "The future is wild" out of the water. <br /> <br /> The biggest episode was definitely the last one, where we could see it. the last days of Tyrannosaurus Rex and the impact of the meteorite that became his downfall. This is almost too impressive for television. How about a theatrical premiere? I would pay anything to see these dinosaurs in the movies. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a show that manages to be spectacular, engaging and educational at the same time, this is for you. Dinosaurs have never been colder.
