When the first trailer of this movie was seen by myself, I was curious to know what angle the story would take. After all, the plot of having a return from childhood to the present leaves many options open. Bruce Willis, however, does an excellent job in the role he was given. I was surprised to see how well I could act in this part. This is also a good career change, as many others have said, but after seeing it now I agree. This movie is mainly about remembering the child you used to be and realizing that you are not the adult you planned to be. This is a wonderful story and an exciting story that makes us all think. In general, we despise the films of "What happens if ...". For example, Waterworld tried to answer the question "What would happen if the world were covered with water and ...?" But the truth, nobody cared. However, this film affects everyone in the theater. It is true that young children may not fully understand the idea of ​​growing up and that their dreams may fade, but it leaves a big impact on the adults and parents of those children. This movie is definitely worth seeing. Although it will be better the second time because you will not think much (about how the child arrived and why and all those things) Just relax and have fun. And take something with you when you leave that theater. Take that piece of your childhood that you have forgotten and enjoy.
