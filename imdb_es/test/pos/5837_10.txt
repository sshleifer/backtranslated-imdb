Oz is undoubtedly my favorite show of all time! The best word to describe it is "genius"! The writing, the acting, the story lines ... everything about this show is absolutely incredible! <br /> <br /> I just discovered the program and I became addicted to it immediately and I was very surprised that it did not receive the recognition it really deserves. It's violent, and most of the characters are not meant to like you, but the program is written so brilliantly that it allows you to look beyond violence and criminals and see them as real people. They are the lowest forms of scum, but still find a way to allow you to understand many of the characters and even worry about their stories. <br /> <br /> The violence in the program is necessary to make it as realistic as possible, but the program does not deal with violence as some people may believe. It really is a work of art and I am sure that whoever gives it the opportunity will love it as much as I do.
