This film reminds me a lot of the latest Rock Hudson movie SPORT OF THE FAVORITE OF MAN, about a fishing writer who has NEVER fished and is forced to participate in a fishing tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is a Martha Stewart-style writer who can not cook and who does not really have the perfect family she describes in her articles; in fact, he has no family at all. Well, like Rock, she is able to act, in this case, creating a big festive dinner while on vacation in the country. Since there is no family, she takes home a veteran and a few friends and tried desperately to NOT "let the cat out" because she can not do any of the things for which she is known. A cute little comedy and a welcome movie for the annual holiday movie lineup.
