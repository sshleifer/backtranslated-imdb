Like most, I thought 'another crocodile movie'. So far we have had Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 months, what can they do that is new? Where both films dealt with action and violence, this is about fear and tension. <br /> <br /> The performances are not worthy of an Oscar when nothing happens, but in times of anguish or terror, these people suffer. It is as much as torture. There are holes in the plot and maybe the crocodiles do not behave as others have pointed out, but the fear is so effective that it is an exaggeration to say that you will enjoy this movie. It will leave you feeling as uncomfortable as The Passion of Christ.
