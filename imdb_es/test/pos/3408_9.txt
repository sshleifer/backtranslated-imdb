I'm a history teacher and, overall, I was satisfied with the movie. My teenagers enjoyed it during the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a bit sappy in some places? Yes ... but I took my children away from the computer and the game station to spend four nights observing everything. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were impressive and we met many historical figures. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought that Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evil and charmingly brilliant. We all think that Charles stole the show from Orry and George. <br /> <br /> We will enjoy the movie again!
