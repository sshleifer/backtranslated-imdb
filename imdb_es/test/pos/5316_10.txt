My God, Ryan Gosling has made many deep characters in his career, this is one of his wonderful works as an actor. For me, this is a very deep film, it needs a lot of concentration, not because it's hard to see, just because you understand it if you put your shoes on this child, although it has everything and has a famous father who is a writer, has a deeper mind , you do not understand why he kills this poor child, until you really heard what he has to say and you start thinking, at least for me, that a lot of the things he says are true. Simple child, sweet, very gentle, in a normal way like any teenager, but inside he suffers because he begins to look at the world in a different way, then you understand why he did what he did. I recommend this movie for those who like deep drama.
