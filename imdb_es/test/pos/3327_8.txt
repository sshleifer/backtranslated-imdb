"Side Show" is one of the rarest horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very bloody in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer does (The Trailer in this movie shows all the bloody parts). In addition, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to terror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this should see Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full movies Moon Pictures.
