Following the advice of a friend, I got this movie. I really like computers in general, so you can not stop watching a 1995 movie about identity theft on the Internet. I had some bad echoes about it, but in the end it did not disappoint me so much: the story, although classic, is quite interesting and must have been really new in the days when it was released in theaters. I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that, unlike what we usually see, the actions performed by computer are somehow realistic, since they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. The narration is medium and does not bother the viewer. The ending is typically American. The performance of the actors is globally good, Sandra Bullock usually bothers me with her way of behaving "oh, my God, why", but this time she seems to have controlled herself. I would recommend that movie.
