Shame represents a high point in a teacher's career. Ingmar Bergman studies the existential study of a couple on the island of Gotland that tries to survive a long war. Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow give painstakingly detailed presentations in this sober and austere drama. The intensity of the film is based on Bergman's attention on the minute, the intimate relationships of his two characters, both consummate musicians, trapped in a landscape they have failed to understand. We see how the external pressures of war complicate and corrode their relationship. The material circumstances of the war force both characters to betray their own sense of ethics. In one of the most powerful episodes, Bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of the cinematographic medium by showing us a filmed interview with the Ullman character that has been re-edited and distorted by political effect on one side of the conflict and is used by the other side as evidence of war crimes in a scene of brutal interrogation. <br /> <br />
