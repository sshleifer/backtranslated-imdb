For me, the Tempest and its characters (as I refer to the admirable ones) are like old friends. From the first time I began to experience the game through acting classes (I played Ferdinand), I found myself immediately caught up in the fantasy world that Shakespeare created. I can clearly remember that a student decided not to play with Ferdinand after all, so I went on stage and had the honor of playing against an excellent Miranda. <br /> <br /> One of the virtues that a great friend has is that you can never know them completely, there is always something you can discover about their character. A film production of The Quality Storm is, therefore, like a visit to an old friend, dear to the heart: each visit presents a new perspective on the memory we have of work. With Prospero's books, the ritual and elegance of the work, the exuberant celebration of art within art, was highlighted. Here, we see a vision as esoteric mysticism, with lovingly elaborated interiors filled with candles and chalk diagrams on the floors, more Aleister Crowley than the nobleman of Naples. It also made me reconsider, why was it that Prospero was expelled from Naples? His magical power is so palpable in this production that one wonders if it was only politics that condemned Prospero to exile, but the fact of its difference with respect to its companions. So, in the real world, he suffered. He was expelled, impotent to change the evil on the right. All the villains in this work, whether they realize it or not, act according to the creation of a hell more full of pain: the oppressor's interest is to make life on Earth closer to hell. But Prospero manages to bring these terrestrial villains to his island, the kingdom where he has dominion (absolute). <br /> <br /> Shakespeare takes his audience to the theater, the kingdom where Shakespeare dictates the events, the words, the results Shakespeare is, of course, Prospero, but what makes this film adaptation that really respects the text is to make Prospero as sympathetic as a figure of reason, even though he is surrounded by what society calls irrational (astrological texts, alchemical symbols, magic diagrams, etc.). Is it more rational to be a man of clothing and murder, or to be a heretic and work to correct mistakes? Prospero IS a heretic, because the reason why he abandons his magic is not because books lose their value in Naples, but because they are no longer necessary, the world itself has become the magic of books. <br /> <br /> In Hamlet, Hamlet presents a play to his classmates. The play accuses his companions of conspiring against others for their own advance. The reaction of the audience varies: while Ophelia is confused, Claudio reacts with amazement. This happens inside the work, and then Shakespeare realizes this work for the men of his time. Did Shakespeare observe his reactions? In the storm, Prospero lives the work he is building, and we live with it. How do we react? Do you react with simple delight in the happy ending? Are you annoyed and surprised by the strangeness of this production, which is totally appropriate given the source material? Do you feel sad about the fact that this little life, the work, is rounded off with a dream, as transitory as it is eternal? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for the life of humanity on Earth, but man is weak and unwilling to do it in favor of small struggles for power. We have Claudio. <br /> <br /> As a good friend, this movie is not without its flaws. I do not agree with the option to paint some scenes completely in blue. The dance of the sailors is quite tangential. But in the heart this is truly The Tempest, and one of its many faces.
