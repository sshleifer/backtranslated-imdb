This movie is one of the best of 1986 with creepy but intriguing performances by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were quite grim for many people, not just teenagers, but this movie really captured the despair and despair. Well directed with a great script (apparently based on a true story), I really do not see any weakness in this. The opening shot was brilliant. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves was decent for a change and Miss Skye was right. Hopper had three other great performances that year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II and Hoosiers). I imagine that this has a cult following and I wonder how this image would go if it were reprinted. Super things!
