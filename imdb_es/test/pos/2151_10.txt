I was lucky to have seen this movie at the screening of the Seattle Film Festival, and I was impressed by how great it was. This is, without a doubt, one of the best musical documentaries I've seen in my life (and I've seen a lot!) It's a loving look at life and times, the music and the relationships of one of the true legends of the music. Harry Nilsson deserves to be there with people like Gershwin, Cole Porter and all the other great song writers of the standards of the twentieth century. The four members of the Beatles considered him a partner, everyone called him a 5th Beatle and one with the same wavelength as themselves. <br /> <br /> Harry refused to go on tour, so many today do not remember him. , and those born after their heyday, do not know who he was. This is tragic. Everyone should have the opportunity to be exposed to this wonderful talent. This film is a step in the right direction, to finally give man his due. Unfortunately, the film has yet to have a wide distribution, or even a DVD, so for the moment, good luck to see it. <br /> <br /> If you are someone with the power to put together a DVD distribution deal, please contact the filmmakers. This movie needs to be available. Hey VH-1, how about you project it into the air and then put it on DVD? Harry Nilsson does not deserve anything less.
