When it opened in London during the Christmas season of 1969, this musical version of the famous James Hilton story was crushed by critics. The same reception received it when it opened in the USA. UU., Which caused that MGM withdrew its state "Roadshow" and cut almost all its songs. That mistake! <br /> <br /> Observed years later, when the fashion world of the 60s and 70s was turned around, this version of GOODBYE, MR.CHIPS is a delight. First of all, like "Chipping", Peter O'Toole offers one of his best performances. To see him go from the hated, cold and carefree Latino teacher in a boarding school for children, to a man who can finally see the colors of the world (after falling in love and marrying the musical star Catherine Briskit) is to see a genius working. (If you can, see LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, THE LION IN WINTER, MY FAVORITE YEAR and CHIPS for several days or weeks, then see what a great actor O'Toole is and how great he is in CHIPS.) <br /> <br / > Catherine, played by the brilliant Petula Clark, at the height of her popularity, is any man's dream; Beautiful, loving, understanding, with a great voice to start. Most of the songs are beautiful and fit perfectly into the story, while the address of the late Herbert Ross makes the proceedings come to life beautifully. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie may be too romantic for some people, but for those looking for a beautifully performed love story, sung and directed, look no further. (If you can get the wide-screen version of the laser disk, better still, I'm looking forward to the debut of CHIPS on DVD).
