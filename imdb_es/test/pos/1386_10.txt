GZSZ is the oldest daily soap in Germany and is cult! I started seeing it from the first day and I was hooked from the beginning. Over the years, both the ancient characters as Heiko, Elke, Tina, Saskia, etc. they left and new ones appeared like Marie, Kai, Cora or John. I have to say that I liked GZSZ more in the years 1995-2000 because nowadays the show focuses too much on the younger characters. My favorite character is Sonja Wiebe because she is the most intriguing person who has been with that soap and is also one of the most interesting characters in the program. Tina Bordihn was great as the first Sonja, but when Tokessa became Sonja's version, the character got even better.
