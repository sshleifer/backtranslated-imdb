Everything that Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed as unique, bright and very twisted at the very least. Well, anything that is not, at least I'm a Cyborg. Park's latest film, titled Thirst, is a dramatic comedy, a drama, a thriller, an erotic romance, a vampire. Yes, that's a lot of adjectives ?? Inspired by the nineteenth century French novel by Emile Zola entitled Therese Raquin. Park creates a uniquely Korean vision, and only Park, of the myths of vampires and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest discovering that he is thirsty for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop. Park offers the elements you would expect, but it definitely does not match the quality of the masterpiece like Oldboy or even Lady Vengeance. Very bloated with a narrative that is often lost much less to the audience, Thirst desperately needed another trip through the cutting room. He crawls when he should be running, but fortunately he returns home before completely losing the audience. However negative it may seem, the positive aspects definitely outweigh the negatives and, without a doubt, another volume has been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of the movie Park Chan-wook. <br /> <br /> See the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com
