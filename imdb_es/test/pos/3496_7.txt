The character of Ali G works brilliantly within the limits of a comedy show, but as a movie, it does not work in the same way. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, this is a very funny movie. , full of nibbles, witty dialogues, that caricature the modern British chav wonderfully well, while giving the viewer a hilarious, though unrealistic, story. <br /> <br /> One problem with this movie is that the script and content are: Fantastically brilliant, or it's embarrassing to watch. When I say shameful, I do not mean embarrassing embarrassment for Office or Extras, but rather you wish they did not include it in the final cut. An example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the movie has ended, to the rhythm of "This is how we do it". When I watch the movie, I stop the DVD when it says the ending and leave it like that. <br /> <br /> In general, Ali G Indahouse is a good movie, it's worth seeing a couple of times. The script is nice to some extent, and there are no problems in terms of acting. However, refinement is the keyword here. <br /> <br /> Ali G is a better television show. Borat is a better movie.
