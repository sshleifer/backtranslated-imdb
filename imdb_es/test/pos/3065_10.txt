Like all of Mel Brooks' other comedies, Men in Tights is hilarious. But seeing this as a scandalous comedy, I think many do not realize that the reason why the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves are so good. Elwes is a well-spoken former British nobleman, Lewis is an eternally annoying king (I hope it's worth it for all NOOOOOOIIIISE!), DeLuise is a FANTASTIC godfather, Roger Rees is a worried and cynical sheriff ... The actors and actresses they are so loyal to their parts that jokes flow with ease. Yes, we have seen this type of comedy before, but the only comedy to achieve a better development of the character, in my opinion, is The Big Lebowski. Very very funny.
