This is the latest film in a trilogy by the brilliant Turkish director, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose latest film, Mayis Sikintisi, which was very ceanal, was screened at prestigious film festivals. Unlike its previous films, the story of 'Uzak' takes place in Istanbul, which is one of the busiest cities in the world. However, in Ceylan's film, we only see small traces of that great crowd. Rather, he chooses to focus on two characters, a photographer and one of his relatives who comes from his small town to find a job on transatlantic boats. The photographer, who we understand has also migrated to the city, seems to be inhabited by the customs of city life, not only in the material sense. In his relationship with his relative, we see him first as affectionate and tolerant; however, when he could not find a job, our suburban character begins to be bothered by sharing his private "space" with someone whose departure date becomes ambiguous. I will not reveal the tactics he develops to get his relative out of his life to avoid any damage to his visual pleasure, but it is enough to say that Ceylan shows us the tactics we acquired within the routine of suburban life; 'tactics' to maintain our own private space, 'tactics' for not communicating with other people, 'tactics' to prevent our relationships from acquiring a complex nature (from our own experience, we believe is complex enough). br /> <br /> Ceylan's film presents a clear picture of what a human being becomes within the limits of the modern (or postmodern) city by representing the two characters in different ways. But, he does not condemn either of the characters for doing this, but instead uses the power of cinematic language to underline this difference. For example, in search of new opportunities, we always see the character that comes from the town in open spaces. Even inside the house, he prefers the balcony as his favorite space. On the other hand, we see the photographer always inside the closed spaces, and generally in his house. Although there are more than 10 million people, and many adventures, many interesting things to discover (or is there any?) He prefers to sit at home, watch TV, etc. Your home is like your temple, a kind of sacred place. <br /> <br /> Everyone who lives in a big city, and aware of the experience they are experiencing, will find something that belongs to themselves in Uzak. If you like this movie, I'm sure you'll like Ceylan's other two films, Mayis Sikintisi (The May Clouds) and Kasaba (The City). Go find them!
