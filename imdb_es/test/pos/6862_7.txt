I thought the movie was good enough for what I expected. Although I'm tired, because I'm afraid of injection needles, I got to wait when they got close. So, if you do not like needles, blood, the human body and a little medical fun, return this movie and rent another one. As the other user commented, I was also pleased with the German attempt of a Slasher movie. I am an American who has just moved to Germany to stay with a family and saw him lying on the shelf. I love psychological thrillers, and I would say that this is somewhere in that sense. A character falls in places and feels misunderstood. As you try to discover your path and find some truth in a situation, things get a little complicated and others are not so sure that you are on the right path. So throughout the film you keep track of who the anatomy is that you can take a look at and who is rounding the next corner.
