Jacob Goodnight, a dangerous psychopathic murderer, is hiding in the abandoned and rotten Blackwell Hotel, alone with his nightmares until eight teenage delinquents show up for community service along with the policeman who wounded Jacob four years ago. When one of their own is kidnapped by the murderer and his fate uncertain, the remaining petty criminals must fight for their lives ... "See No Evil" was directed by porn filmmaker Gregory Dark and stars Kane, the superstar of the WWE, as a psychopath without remorse. there are no surprises to be found here, but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy. In general, I liked this movie and you should, too, if you like nonsensical slasher movies. Sure, it's a clich√©, but who cares about 10.
