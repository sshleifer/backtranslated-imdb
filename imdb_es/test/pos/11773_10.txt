This is classified as my favorite movie of all time. It is the best parody of a science fiction movie; the fact that it was a summary of Star Wars improved everything. <br /> <br /> I love the slapstick. Think of this as the Marx brothers or the Three Stooges meet Star Wars. The writing is hilarious. The effects are hilarious. The free association that is carried out guarantees all kinds of things that come out of the left field. (I almost wet my pants when the Wookie Monster approached the Princess). <br /> <br /> Space Balls was a much longer movie, but I only had about 15 minutes of good stuff, and I felt like a scam. Then, like buying a hamburger that turned out to be mostly stuffed. The hardware war, despite having only about 15 minutes, it would be worth paying the price of a function, OMI.
