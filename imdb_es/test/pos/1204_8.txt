The first time I saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving him and all about him. 13 years later, now I am 17 years old, and I decided to see it about a month ago because I am attending a class in 1960 at school. I really did not know what to expect, since it had been 13 years since I last saw him, but I was completely impressed. The actors were incredible, the music was very funny and now I'm singing every song. Treat Williams is great as Berger, the "leader" of the hippie group, who always gets what he wants, one way or another (except, of course, at the end). John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude, the Oklahoma recruit who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is adorable as the rich and proper girl who eventually rebels against her education and joins the hippies. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is as adorable as Jeannie, the girl who is pregnant, but as cute and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good as Woof and Hud, the other two members of the group, and Cheryl Barnes, who plays Hud's girlfriend, has an incredible voice. <br /> <br /> However, the only problem I have with this movie is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They almost never show up together, and when they are, they fight (remember the thin immersion scene?). It seems that their relationship is very weak, and at the end of the film we are supposed to believe that they are madly in love, only in terms of the few meetings they had. I also see that many people who write reviews here are upset by the PG rating that this movie has. Personally I would raise the rating to a PG-13, just because there is a use of drugs ... but remember that in 1979, the PG-13 did not exist. I do not think nudity is bad at all, in any way it's sexual (in fact, in this movie there's no sex), and it's just to show the childish innocence that the group maintains. In most European countries, nudity is not considered a bad thing, and I do not see why it is here in the United States. Anyway, I give this movie a high rating, and I'm glad it was done back then, because in the incredibly "politically correct" world of today, they would not even think about doing it, and even if they did, it would be a very "diluted" version, and I'm sure you would not get the full effect. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a very underestimated film that is definitely worth checking out.
