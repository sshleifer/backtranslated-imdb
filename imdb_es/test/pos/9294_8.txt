The hilarious team that brought you 'CNNNN' and 'The Chaser Decides' have returned to ABC with their new series, 'The Chaser's War On Everything'. Filmed in front of a live audience, the Chaser team, once again, does what it does best: key political figures, international celebrities and media personalities. <br /> <br /> Satire is simply priceless, and nothing is sacred. In recent weeks, Team Chaser has chased the Queen (during her visit to Australia) to try to sack John Howard and have Kim Beazley (Opposition Leader of Aust) threaten to surround them. <br /> <br /> The particularly funny segment is "Mr. Ten Questions", which shows a too enthusiastic reporter approaching celebrities (recently Charlize Theron and The Backstreet Boys) and asks them ten such foolish questions like "what is your optimum length of rice grain?" Just for the record, Theron ignored him and walked away, and one of the Backstreet Boys got angry and "refused to dignify it with an answer." <br /> <br /> A segment that recently had me in trouble was when one The team decided to become a "statues reseller" to earn some extra money. When he realized how desperate he was, he put a real statue in its place. THE PERFECT SCAM! He got thirty dollars in twenty minutes! <br /> <br /> A brilliant satire of everything in Australian society. Two thumbs up! <br /> <br /> (By the way, the program will not be shown during the three weeks after Easter, because "although the entire team is atheist, they are also hypocrites").
