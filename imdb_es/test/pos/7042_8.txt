When I was younger, this film was always aired on Friday night on channel 40 (this was years before Fox was a network and took over the programming). I always looked forward to it. I would go shopping with my parents, then I would sit down with my Swanson TV dinner and a Lady Lee Cola (the only time of the week when I was allowed to take a line and enjoy.) Of course, the script is predictably in the late 70's ( like Little Darlings), but it's a fun movie, and I loved Rudy and Tripper, Bill Murray has little effort in the film, but he's charming, he has to love Spaz and those glasses (pre Revenge of the Nerds). He is practically the same character that he played in "My Bodyguard", but he does it very well.
