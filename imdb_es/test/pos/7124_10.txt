The best fanboy movie I've seen, except "Free Enterprise." <br /> <br /> It kind of reminded me of a Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> If you do any kind of role-playing games, this movie will probably make you laugh often for its insatiable fun. Do not expect a big budget here, the acting is also questionable at times, but it really adds to the fun of the environment they create. The script is really humorous, with many ingenious moments that are worth experiencing. <br /> <br /> The bard who always dies made me roll. The sexually confused player also made me smile a little too. But in the end ... it was just a great movie that shows some of the best moments in the lives of a few geeks who had a great time with RPGs. <br /> <br /> If you're bored, and you ever got into the role playing, this will do very well for a distraction. A real unexpected pleasure.
