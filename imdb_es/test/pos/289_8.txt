I have to admit that I had low expectations for this movie. But I was surprised to find it entertaining, interesting and fun. It's an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror movie. There were moments that made my hair stand up! Even better, however, were the funny moments, sometimes hysterical, in the movie (you'll know what I'm talking about). There are also some great special effects (and humor and special effects are not necessarily separate). <br /> <br /> The acting, in general, is very good, much better than a low budget typical horror movie. The protagonist (Jackie), in particular, and many of the smaller supporting roles (such as the lawyer, the couple living next door, the pizza maker) are well acted. If they had not been, the film would not have maintained my interest and I would have lost my belief in the story. This is a good low budget thriller that is worth renting.
