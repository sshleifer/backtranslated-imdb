I am a firm believer that a film, television series or any art form should and should be fully appreciated once the time factor is taken into account (as to when it was written, produced or conceived). <br /> <br /> Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is one of those series. I remember seeing him in the mid-1980s on television and replays through video cassette libraries in the early 90's and laughing out loud and being addicted to it. That made me buy the DVD set of the whole series and the surprise of the surprises: the comedy and the moments of yesteryear simply fell apart. Even the very popular "30 years of experience ka" "GULAAAAB JAMUN!" and "Sofa cum bed" did not invoke the kind of joy I thought it would be. The time factor: for the 80s, this was the showstopper. The main event The mother of all television comedies. And it worked during the time and the time! Maybe you can not say the same thing at the moment, but nevertheless, watching the DVD brought back pleasant memories. <br /> <br /> I wish the seasons with Shafi Inamdar and Swarup Sampat were longer. Satish Shah has been incredibly good as the heart of the show, with an equally effective support team from Farida Jalal, Tiku Talsania and Bengali neighbors. The Rakesh Bedi hams everywhere. <br /> <br /> In short, an experience that will bring back memories for those who saw it during prime time, may not be appealing to younger viewers or first-timers!
