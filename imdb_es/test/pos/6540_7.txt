Every time this movie is mentioned, the discussion usually begins and ends with the wonderful collection of cars and drag scenes, often overlooked by the sometimes eclectic characters that populate the film around the three central characters. <br /> <br /> A character What stands out is Rebel played by the great Australian veteran actor Max Cullen. Rebel is a blind tracer, who almost runs over the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he is not using any beacon. <br /> <br /> In the later story we discovered that the master of the street building Rebel racing cars, and he and his wife seem locked in a time shift from the 1950s. Rebel continues to play a role small but fundamental in the teaching of Mike, played by Terry Serio, the almost spiritual truth about street racing. It's not speed, reaction times that make a great runner. It is who best feels the car that will become the best <br /> <br /> This is exemplified better as Rebel explains to Mike after a test drive "You have all the agony, just lack the style" <br /> <br /> Graham Bond, is another well-accredited actor who lends his talent as a crooked policeman who seeks to participate in some of the financial actions generated by street racing. The confrontation between Bond and Fox, played by Richard Moir, adds tension to the story. Bond not only expects results but also Fox to boost the racing business. <br /> <br /> In most of the film, Fox shows a true manipulative and evil side, but in the climax he presents a sense of honor that makes the final few. Minutes in an extremely tense and memorable ending. It is almost as if the film were once again focusing on its true intention, showing us the culture of street racing instead of the daily activities of people. <br /> <br /> One of the main complaints about the film is the script. . Although it's nothing exciting, I think the total lack of chemistry between Mikes' girlfriend played by Deborah Conway and her mechanic played by Vangelis Mourikis has more to do with the problem. Any scene in which these two interact simply should have been cut off <br /> <br /> Finally, in terms of the actors, a really outstanding performance is provided by Kristoffer Greaves, who plays a deaf and crippled member of the Fox's intimate circle. His background story is never explored, if he was injured in a career, he was born that way, what does Fox consider valuable to keep him close? <br /> <br /> The reality of the film is simple, it's about the street The races, and the culture behind it. When the cars are flying and the action sequences are in motion, it's the only time that Director John Clark and his writer Barry Tomblin feel really comfortable with what they're doing. <br /> <br /> Then, if you are looking for something in depth Exploration of human relationships, moments of life that define drama, then this movie is not for you. If your pulse quickens at the thought of a blown 57V or the iconic Phase 3 of GTO on the streets of Sydney, then you will not find much better than this movie.
