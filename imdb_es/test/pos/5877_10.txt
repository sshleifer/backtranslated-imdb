This magnificent post-war classic from the 1940s tends to be overlooked these days <br /> <br />. When it was released in 1945, it was cleaned at the 1946 Oscars <br /> <br />, mainly at the expense of `It's A Wonderful Life '. Both films were nominated for the best film, best director <br /> <br /> and best actor, all won by "Best Years". Frederic March, <br /> <br /> and Dana Andrews along with an amateur actor Harold Russell (a real-life soldier <br /> <br />, who lost both hands in an explosion), play the <br> /> <br /> returning soldiers, finding life is very different, from what <br /> <br /> they remember. Myrna Loy is excellent as March's wife, who has to support the family <br /> <br /> together while he has been absent. The scene of tears <br /> <br /> where March and Loy meet is magnificent. The three <br /> <br /> men find they have trouble adjusting to post-war life, not least that Russell accepts artificial hands, and his finances <br /> <br /> (Cathy O'Donnell) trying to be very useful. Sam Goldywn is mentioned who does not care that the film does not win money <br /> <br /> at all, as long as everyone in the United States watches the movie, so they will appreciate what These men went through If any movie is worth 10 out of 10, this is it.
