There have been several books that have cited this as the first gay cinema. I do not really see this as so gay in the homosexual sense, but then seeing two men dancing in what has to be the world's first musical movie has its appeal. <br /> <br /> There have been several previous comments about this film that rule out any homosexual innuendo. As for those who are quick to dismiss this movie, they are simply nonsense and an experiment conducted late at night after too many drinks ... Well, I've heard that story before. <br /> <br /> This movie is of interest as a rarity and if people want to consider it as the first gay movie, so be it. Better this than the depressing one of 1919, Anders als die Andern.
