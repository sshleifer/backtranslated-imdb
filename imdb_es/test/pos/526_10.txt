I have never, never been so impressed by a film as this small piece about four groups of people, that faces a crisis, or many. In a way, a bit like Short Cuts, but totally different, at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of main characters, whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold, and they are, as people show their good side and their bad side, their weaknesses and their strengths , with a lot of drama and laughter. <br /> <br /> The closest equivalent in a movie in the United States, I can think, is much weaker. In all respects, it is the Royal Tenenbaums. <br /> <br /> Four Shades of Brown, as the title would be in English, tells the story of a stressed hotelier and his wife, and their elderly parents (who are traveling magicians); about the receptionist in an animal crematorium and her family misadventures; about the members of a cooking class (who mostly talk about their sad lives) and, fourthly, about the funeral of a womanizer jockey trotter, who tries to continue orchestrating the family from beyond the grave, singing and appearing in 3D during the funeral, thanks to the high-tech equipment that has cost him his entire fortune (the family is left with nothing, not even the famous horse is given to the family)! <br /> <br /> There's a warmth and compassion in this movie, which is full of pain and laughter, that I've never experienced before. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were new to me, except Robert Gustafsson and one or two others, but they all deserve the big blow that the film had on the Swedish Guldbagge extravaganza (= the "Oscar" awards Swedes) a week ago! <br /> <br /> Men, women and men who supported actor awards went to this movie, and some more, to start! <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, go see it, the hours pass very fast!
