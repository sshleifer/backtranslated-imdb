Haha, what a great movie! Wayne Crawford attacks again, or rather this was his first big hit, a deliriously entertaining little ball of kitsch staunch energy that disguises itself as a movie of psychopathic killers. In fact, it is a ** brilliant satire ** in post-hippie American culture in the country of the flyover, although the film was actually filmed independently in Miami. You can challenge any kind of studio convention or plot device you can think of: SOME THINGS THAT MARTHA MAKES SURPRISING THINGS may not be a technically very skilled movie, but it's a wonderful little slice of Americana, made cheaply by people They were honest, ambitious, imaginative and had balls made of steel. It took guts, nerves and cunning to make this movie, which surprisingly seems to have withstood the test of time. This film is fresh, vital, alive, unforgettable and strange enough to recommend to anyone with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I unearthed last year during a period in which I was fascinated. the "star" Wayne Crawford (here called under his pseudonym Scott Lawrence), a master of what can only be called regional cinematography, generally of the grade B variety. He is a writer, producer, director and actor, all in one, probably best known for his favorite 80s apocalyptic teen NIGHT OF THE COMET. Here he plays Stanley, the pants that carry half a pair of truly wonderful characters, seemingly homosexual murderers in the street after beating an old lady in Baltimore for her jewelry. Abe Zwick, an unknown legend of the screen, is completely convincing when Paul, who poses as Aunt Martha of Stanley, the brain of the company that has tricked Stanley into thinking he has committed murder to ensure his loyalty. Martha looks as feminine as the sailors in the SOUTH PACIFIC support choir in her coconut bikini tops, but somehow, no one seems to notice, or do you care? - that she is a he, has no means of visible income, seems to spend all day worrying about where Stanley is, and sneaks around the neighborhood with her bathrobe carrying a butcher knife. Only in the United States ... <br /> <br /> As the film begins, the two have just arrived in Florida and settled in what appears to be the former home of Ward Cleaver, a design television home and striking lighting that is so clich√© as to be surreal. During a memorable scene, Martha and an unwelcome guest at the house sit on the couch, talk about problems and drink cans of Budweiser in one of the most fascinating and subversive sequences I've seen outside the John Waters movie. Then there's Stanley, who always gets in trouble because he's a hippie with a mop in his vest who drives a painted psychedelic truck that is as subtle as the Batmobile, drinks his milk directly from the box, drinks drugs with blond bimbos. , and hoards donuts in an old cigar box for a quick snack. Opposites attract, I suppose. <br /> <br /> But Stanley also likes that he does not like it when the girls with stones are trying to take off their pants, and it seems that it always depends on Aunt Martha. He got him out of the predicament that inevitably results. The bodies pile up, a meddlesome addict blackmails them to use their house like a flop, Stanley's birthday cake is crushed, and everyone gathers at the local pizzeria before heading to the wooden hut on the back property for a Hookah party where the girls dance in their underwear. Things get out of control when Martha, one of the neighbors, tries to get a little crazy and naturally prefers to keep people away when they are rudely invited to a pleasant chat. And this is a woman who carries not only a butcher knife but a .38 loaded in her slip. Finally, the strange duo is trapped with a body, a baby and nowhere to go, and ends up taking refuge in an abandoned movie studio where, without a doubt, the technical team borrowed the equipment used to make the film. I just hope that they have politely asked for permission and cleaned up after themselves. <br /> <br /> Of course, a word must be said about the relationship of Stanley and Martha / Paul, since to dance the fact that the two are at least It is suggested that a homosexual couple would miss the main essence Of the plot. We never see them both intimate and, in fact, although Stanley makes fun of being mocked in a scene, their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. Certainly not a "gay" movie, with abundant feminine nudity and an air of misogyny of the 70s that can not be denied either. Stanley and Paul never consumed their implicit sexuality on the screen, even though the film would certainly have had the guts to do so if it was important. It is not, the story is not about their sex, but about the bond they share and how strange it is. It's not that they are homosexuals, but that they are the different people they are, which are two of the strangest cinematographic creations that have inhabited my television. <br /> <br /> The movie is unique. It was done for only a few thousand dollars in what looked like borrowed study sets, occasional jobs at the location and a couple of public places where they managed to sneak into a camera crew when no one was looking. The dialogue is completely strange, mundane and delightfully esoteric. It's a movie that will take you by surprise, not everyone will like it, but those who like the low-budget American horror thriller THE NIGHT GOD SCREAMED, HELP ME! I AM POSSESSED, BLOOD & LACE AND CHILDREN SHOULD NOT PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS, you yourself have a winner here. <br /> <br /> 8/10: Usually, I would say something like "It deserves a DVD restoration" but somehow I think doing it would ruin the bad taste of the movie. And Wayne Crawford, you, sir, govern.
