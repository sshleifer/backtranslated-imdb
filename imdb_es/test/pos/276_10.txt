I was half asleep while watching a selection of short films late at night, but I sat upright from the first frames of "I Shout Love" and could not look away for its full, brief and perfect length. With an incredibly safe rhythm and performances, this film maintains its funny / sad / insightful tone at all times. The credits at the end happened so fast and in such little type, I had to connect online to find the person responsible for this master work. What a pleasant surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley, an important actress who is rarely seen. <br /> <br /> Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) become rich and moving performances as a couple in The Anguish of Breaking. While working through a repetition of Tessa's favorite moments from their time together, both actors reveal the dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that only bring honor to their talents, and to the skills of the director / writer. The film creates a moving narrative with moments of loud laughter and ragged breathing. <br /> <br /> "I Shout Love" is undoubtedly one of the best and most memorable short films that I hope to see. He has wit, heart and dazzling originality. It matters
