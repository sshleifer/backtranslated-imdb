"Babette's Feast" and "The Horse's Mouth" are the two most insightful and precise films of what it is to be a true artist. The key lines in "La Fiesta de Babette" are not, as other commentators have said here, "an artist is never poor", but two lines that come before and after: <br /> <br /> "I was able to make them happy when I give the best of me ... Everywhere in the world a long shout sounds from the heart of the artist: give me the opportunity to give the best of me ". <br /> <br /> I spent nine years producing experimental multimedia musical theater in San Francisco, raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers, actors, designers, etc., and the artists I supported stretched every penny in their effort to do the best possible They were like Babette: they were desperate to get every dollar needed to do their best work. Babette's art is an excellent French cuisine, and for her to make her best art costs 10,000 francs. When, after years in the political exile of France, isolated with two caretakers on a bleak Scandinavian coast, she suddenly gets an unexpected profit of 10,000 francs, she does what any real artist would do: she sees that she unexpectedly has the opportunity to do it The best, and so does she. She spends all the money to be able to do her best work as an artist. The twist in the movie is that we do not know that she is such an artist, until she is really cooking and serving food. Until then, she seems to be just a working-class French lady who haggles a bit with merchants, and is very serious (her husband and son were murdered in Paris by violence in 1871). <br /> <br /> For such an artist, it is secondary if there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it. That is why the author organized this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly understand what they are receiving. Babette did not cook this meal as a gift for the two singles, or for the religious community. It was not their goal to achieve reconciliation or a spirit of good feelings among the members of the small religious sect. In fact, she never leaves the kitchen to talk to any of them. After the meal, she is sitting alone, drinking a little wine, without paying any attention to how the guests reacted. She is enjoying the satisfaction of finally having the opportunity to have done everything possible as an artist. <br /> <br /> That's why it's so satisfying and so important to the story, that the General appears unexpectedly, because, as Babette knows instantly, a general will know what she has presented before him, and what You will appreciate Because there is a kind of tragedy in a great work of art that is shown to an audience that lacks even a competent person to appreciate it. She is happy, very happy, he came, in fact, he is the only guest that he mentions in the whole dinner, the only one that she chooses for a special treatment, not one of the two. But she did not plan the food knowing that that person would come to receive it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has had the opportunity to enjoy an authentic first class Parisian dinner, as I have done (my father was a naval attach√© in Paris in the 1980s, and I had my honeymoon Honey in France), this dinner, and Babette's satisfaction in doing so, and the pleasure it gives diners, is absolutely convincing. If any art has the power to flood the recipient with a sense of joy, it is good French food cooked and served in France. This film makes a claim about the transforming effects of great art on the recipients. Before dinner, the members of the small religious sect fight, dragging old resentments. The old hymns fail to restore good communion; People ignore them, talk about them. But the shared experience of great sensual art, so that people can enjoy the flavors of food and wine, even if they do not have the idea that they are experiencing great art, content people, puts them in a state of indulgent spirit, reconciles them. and by making them happy, it encourages them to love one another and, therefore, has a divine sacred effect of bringing peace. This is the claim that is found today in the modern artistic movement: that art can supplant traditional religions to make humanity more peaceful. Therefore, unlike commentators who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian belief, it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal the wounds that Christian ritual can not. After all my years in the art world, I must say that this affirmation, that art brings peace that religion can not, is exaggerated and invalid. But it is a beautiful concept and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> One last note: upon Babette's arrival at the Spinsters' house, a particular French general, Galliffet, is named as the Person who in 1871 executed Babette's husband and son, and imposed a military rule that had to flee. At the end of the film, while the General tells the story of the magnificent food he enjoyed in Paris many years before (before 1871), at the end of some military maneuvers, it turns out that this same Galliffet was his host in the meal. . While the general tells the story, French General Galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the best woman, the only woman he would risk his life for. Of course, that woman was Babette. Thus, ironically, the same French general who said that he honored Babette above all other women was responsible for driving her away from France forever.
