Attending this film was an excuse to escape from the work I had to do for my classes, but it turned out to be one of my best experiences here in France. The film does a quick job in the construction of multidimensional characters and has an excellently smooth plot. The characters really had the voices that would be expected when reading the graphic novels and the artistic talent exceeded my expectations. The music was sticky and the comedy played and was cheerful, almost a flamenco inclusion of modern elements in playful ways. The film was striking, cute and action-packed at the same time. A wonderful story spun by experts. I will show it to my French students.
