This is probably the best film of 2002 about Romanian cinema. I recommend it to be an intense drama without lack of action and emotion. The film focuses on the lives of teenagers in the suburbs of Bucharest through the main character, not focusing so much on the form or definition of the character, but more on the anger that he and other characters feel. The title "Fury" means rage instead of anger, but could be considered in the film in both directions from the behavior of the actors. The rather strange love story (not a typical romantic, but a modern suburban conception) is well configured towards the end. It's a captivating image, and the cinematography is pretty good at capturing the nightlife of the suburbs, so it's a good movie to watch and. <br /> <br /> You will not get bored for a minute, I promise!
