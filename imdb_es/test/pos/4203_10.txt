As a fan of the Warner Brothers gangster movies, I had to watch this, it is the second best movie on the DVD set of adventure classics that also had one of my favorite movies: Scott of Antarctica. During many Warner Brothers films, he boasts of having a great cast: John Garfield, Claude Rains, Ann Sheridan and the children of the dead end, who would later be known as the Bowery boys in the monogram photos. Well, a boxer (Garfield) is framed by a murder he did not commit and is fleeing and is being followed by a tough New York detective (Claude Rains) who ends up at a fruit picking place run by a pretty woman (Gloria) Dickson) and the children of the dead end (Huntz Hall, Leo Gorcey, Benard Punsley, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Gabreil Dell) who later returns to boxing but tries to keep a low profile. This was directed by the famous conductor Busby Berkley, who directed timeless classics such as 42nd street, 1933 goldiggers, and 35, footlight parade and many others. I would like to give a shout out to the platinum DVD / video for posting a lot of adventure classics such as good price DVDs (see my Scott of the Antarctic review) I give them a 10 out of 10, great movie. I have to point out that I've only seen 2 films by John Garfield, this and body and soul. I thought he was a very good actor.
