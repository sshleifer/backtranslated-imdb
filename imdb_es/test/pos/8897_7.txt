It's a pity that Asterix and his friend Obelix do not get the worldwide recognition that other comic cartoon characters get. <br /> <br /> This is another fun Asterix cartoon full of entertainment. The animation is excellent and the characterization of the voice is good, even if the timing is a little off. The music and the score fit well into the story and the inclusion of some modern musical numbers is a nice touch. <br /> <br /> The execution time seems short and, while it is not the best Asterix story or the most developed cartoon, it's good clean fun. Modern animation (like Disney's) will capture children, Asterix fans and newcomers ... Enjoy Gaul's adventure!
