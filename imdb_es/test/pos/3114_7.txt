George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The anonymous hero of his generation. No one mentions Cukor in the same way as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder, and yet he watches his filmography. From sparkling comedies "The Philadelphia Story" "Adam's Rib" "Holiday" Psycho melodramas "Gaslight" "A Double Life" a great semi-Western "Heller in Pink Tights" not to mention "My Fair Lady" or "Travels with my aunt" He was at the service of his actors, he never got in front of the camera. I feel a certain tenderness to see the "rich and famous" flashes of the old teacher still very much in evidence. Candice Bergen gives us for the first time in her career a vision of the wonderful comedian she was about to become. Jacqueline Bisset is a reminder of the days when Greer Garson and Loretta Young and Hart Bochner intervene, mock us and promise something spectacular that will eventually materialize in 1989 with "Apartment Zero", Meg Ryan, since Bergen's daughter is already Meg Ryan. As tired as the formula is, it's still a Cukor movie and so I compile one of Almod√≥var's favorite movies.
