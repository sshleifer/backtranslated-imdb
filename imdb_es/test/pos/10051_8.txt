In short, an excellent film from that time and origin (from Warner Brothers, since it reached its peak in craftsmanship and style just before the Second World War), as long as you do not take it seriously. The film does not really claim to be historically accurate, and it certainly is not more or less accurate or credible than, say, JFK. (However, this can actually be more honest about it, since it essentially admits along the way that it should not be taken as a fact based particularly on facts, but rather as a representation with semi-heroic style). It is worth noting that the audiences of the time was not more naive about the history than we are today; The NY Times review admitted that the hearings "would rule out objective inaccuracies throughout the film," described the biographical account of Custer's life as "extravagant" and pointed out that the presentation of Custer's motivations regarding the final events I disagreed with several historical accounts. . They could have been really exaggerated in the construction of Custer, it is supposed, but they manage to admirably represent him as the most astute or diligent type in the world, but duly determined, based on principles and inspiring. <br /> <br /> Flynn and DeHavilland, making their eighth film together in 7 years (and the last), feel so comfortable together, and face each other so easily at this point, that it's not that hard to overlook the how you write your courtship here. With the first couple, it would be hard to imagine what could really attract Elizabeth to Custer, but these two make it work. The film also misses the director of his seven previous films (the very underestimated Michael Curtiz), but since he worked with them on the Santa Fe Trail theme of the previous year, it is understandable that he chose not to participate in this topic. one. (They all started together with Captain Blood and the Light Load Brigade, both incredible, so we can not blame them if they started having trouble keeping it fresh). <br /> <br /> Raoul Walsh The director here, no doubt, feels more comfortable with the action sequences, which are exceptional, and everything else outdoors. The interior scenes are a little more uneven, but the artisans of the studio make up for it very well, as does the prominent cast of "usual suspects" from Warner Bros. and new faces (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc.). ). I would have liked it more if Kennedy's character had been a little less standard (I generally like his work), but here he seems to be playing approximately the same notes in each scene; the paper could have been better written, and I guess they were not sure what he could handle, since he had only been in movies for a year (Walsh probably took it for this after having done High Sierra together). <br /> <br /> Several highlights include the (probably imagined) representation of the genesis of "Garryowen" as the theme of chivalry. The last half hour is particularly outstanding, especially when the separation of potential customers echoed the end of their screen association, followed by the final battle scenes. An exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
