In a previous comment I mentioned how much I enjoyed this movie, better the second time. I do not dismiss that opinion. Interestingly, I can not find anyone who likes it. <br /> <br /> My mother was going to see him but several friends said "No way". My sister and her family saw it and half of the theater went out in the middle. <br /> <br /> My wife's suggestion is that Australians see the characters as normal, everyday Americans, so it's not funny. But, hey, most Americans think that all Australians are like Crocodile Dundee, so it's good to have the boot on the other foot for a change.
