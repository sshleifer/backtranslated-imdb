Mr Bean was very funny, I loved it, every episode was really fun, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he is a fun looking guy and his facial expressions were funny. <br /> <br /> The series was so successful that they even made a Mr Bean movie in 1997, which by the way was also very fun. <br /> <br /> It's funny to see all the adventures and situations he's in, this series was a classic, and I still watch an episode from time to time. <br /> <br /> Mr Bean is worth a 10/10 in my book, fans of unconventional comedy should check it out.
