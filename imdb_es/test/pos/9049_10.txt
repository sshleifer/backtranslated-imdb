If a joke does not offend anyone, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Inki cartoons are offensive, without a doubt. This is rap music. Get over. I suspect that any sensible black person will find the funny Inki cartoons and that the people who feel offended by them the white people who still think that Black needs his condescending protection against racist humor. <br /> <br /> Seriously, Inki cartoons are funny. It saddens me, not because someone is really offended, but because someone might be offended, I can not buy Inki cartoons or the African queen or Song of the South on DVD.
