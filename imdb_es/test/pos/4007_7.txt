I have been religiously observing Attack Of The Show for about 6 months (maybe more, but not much). I was very much in love with Olivia and I found Kevin very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately, although it is starting to run out due to many factors for me. First, my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around the Network, which show 5 video clips that you can find on a site like YouTube, which are usually fun, or people who get hurt inadvertently (some intentionally). Umm, this when you see 4 to 5 times a week shows again and again the same, I have not really seen anything so good and I can only laugh at people who probably break their necks and stop so many times. The show is like a show of Late Show wanna / Colbert Report, also with its politics, if you do not live in a blue state and you are not an automatic liberal, this humor also ages, McCain is old, yes, yes, whatever. The libs do not have the guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that they would be comfortable with the sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves, so almost all the shows are by McCain or Palin , Caramba. Then we have the same old videos of people getting hurt from those of us who are supposed to keep on laughing and then a bit of political humor from the left who never laughs at himself for his own weakness. I will continue to watch since I look at work and it is all there is, with the hope that I am entertained, but it is getting old. I liked the filling of the hosts of Chris and Alison, however, they were really a good change of pace; Maybe this show could do a rotating host thing. Olivia, who I thought was sometimes very funny at first, has resorted to this constant response and is getting old, hahaha. 7 out of 10; It will keep you in a young mindset, which is good if you're a younger Boomer like me (mid-40s). Maybe a caricature of the day would be another segment that they should do, there are a lot of things available that they could use.
