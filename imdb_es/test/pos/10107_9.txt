I love horror movies, but I think they work better when they hide a dramatic impact behind (The Devil's Backbone, The Exorcist, for example). This is that kind of movie, and it's not only scary and scary when it has to be, it's also really beautiful. A Tale of Two Sisters starts very slow, so if you're in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes, you'll be disappointed. Actually, this is not a ghost story, although there are some. It's a bit more complex, and it's done in such a way that it beats Ringu and The Grudge out of the ring without sweat. A story?? It's a much smarter way of the film than those great cultural successes, because it really cares about its characters, and the direction is impeccable. All the details of this movie will leave you breathless if you are the kind of person who loves to pay attention to the details while watching a movie. The performance is excellent, especially the stepmother and the main girl. Those two are worth the price of the ticket alone. Do yourself a favor and watch this awesome movie.
