I bought this in the budget department last week. I already had Halloween and Halloween II, and since I intend to compile all the horror movies in the story, I chose this. after all, the first two were good. <br /> <br /> This movie is smart enough to tell the truth. It seems to create the right atmosphere, and it has a good "michael myers story". uses the original locations of the original, and the main character is the child to whom Laurie walked taking care of the children in that fateful Halloween in 1978 ... <br /> <br /> the climax is also quite satisfactory. Anyway, it's MUCH better than H20, which, frankly, is absolute shit.
