This movie for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the violent suspense / mystery / murder movies that abound. They are real people who make the best of their lives. They just happen to be Indians and the main characters are in the application of the law. The realistic performance and the great scenario more than compensate for the implausible plot. The soundtrack is from BC Smith, who also made the soundtrack for Coyote Waits, and it's great. Adam Beach plays a tribal policeman who is somewhat prone to accidents and Wes Studi is the stoically professional and consummate detective. There are many other good supporting or cameo roles by Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, etc. We have also seen Coyote Waits, another adaptation of a Hillerman novel, and we also enjoyed it a lot.
