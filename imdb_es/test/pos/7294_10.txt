This is a very unusual movie that starts with a rich guy who buys a new sports car to graduate and decides to take a ride in the local city. A rich boy meets a poor girl in 'Mabels Diner', who is a waitress and a local boyfriend gets angry and starts a fight. There is a car chase and all sorts of problems seem to happen, and the rich boy and the poor boy end up having to do Community Service as ordered by the city judge. The rich boy and the poor boy simply do not get along and the rich boy ends up winning the heart and soul of the poor boy's girlfriend. There are many walks in the woods and poetry is cited and some very deep thoughts about life. The poor girl says: "Some people go through life and never find love, I can say that I found love and I cling to it". You will need a little tissue if you are sensitive, there are many romantic scenes and I doubt that you will guess how this image will end. The producer and the director had a good idea and finally they put an end to a movie. If you like life stories with poetry and very sensitive topics, this is your movie.
