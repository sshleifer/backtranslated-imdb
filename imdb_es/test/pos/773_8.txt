Sweet and entertaining tale of a young man of 17 and a half, controlled by a dominant religious mother and a retired father, and how he finds himself through his work with a retired, eccentric and tragic actress. Very well acted, especially by Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of the teenager well, proving that his talent will outlast the Harry Potter film series. Laura Linney plays her implacably strict mother without a touch of redemption, so there's no place for her to like her at all. But the film is a very entertaining film, well done by the British in the style of Keeping Mum and Calendar Girls.
