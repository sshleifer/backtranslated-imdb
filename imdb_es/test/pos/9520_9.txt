Or at least you feel pretty high after this movie. It is the kind of film to which the word "hunchback" can really be applied, although it is fucked in that totally casual, intelligent and open way that belongs to the French. <br /> <br /> No, Catherine Deneuve does not spend the whole movie (sorry to disappoint the Puritans with an agenda) ... but the only scene I'm talking about involves all members of a wedding party - And it's a musical number! Anyway, everything fits perfectly to perfection, and the unusual, bright and colorful family (Deneuve's mother is a lesbian, Deneuve and her good living daughter) alternately entertains and annoys us as real families do ... but as it is a movie that mostly entertain. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say too much about the ending, but Deneuve ends up marrying a man about twenty years younger. This is totally credible, since we see that the relationship develops over time and that the two are getting closer and closer. The end is happy; and like the rest of the movie, satisfyingly extravagant and with a perfect tone.
