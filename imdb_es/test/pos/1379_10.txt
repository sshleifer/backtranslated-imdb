Was I trying to find out why I enjoyed this movie? It's not because of the money spent on that, that's for sure! Did I see a water gun painted there? Maybe they do not have the same kind of visual effects houses in Scotland? Or maybe they just did not have money? The making of clearly shows a gang of very brave guys who make a film against all odds. Amazing! But what I really liked was the value of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White interpret the main parts as 2 normal types. Here there are no Hollywood histrionics. <br /> <br /> Well, then the effects are not very good. Spacecraft just do not look as good as they should in today's FX world and I've seen much better free things on YouTube. But the film remains very well once they arrive on the planet. Was it filmed in Scotland or only by a Scottish team? Or is it simply that the best effects work? Did you fix the water? In the end I loved this movie and I was disappointed when they all died.
