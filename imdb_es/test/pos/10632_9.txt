After seeing "La Pianiste" several years ago, I told myself that I would never see her again, so powerful and disturbing that I was. Time passed but I could not get the mind of the film and its main character, Erika Kahut. The story of a respected piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory, fresh and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-hatred and self-destruction strong enough to ruin it. more than one vision I read the book "The Piano Teacher" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial winner of the Nobel Prize in literature on which the film is based and, after reading it, I went back to see the film. The second time, all the pieces of the puzzle came to the right places. Not too often an extraordinary heartbreaking book with as much brilliance as "Le Pianiste" is transferred to the screen. Three actors gave outstanding performances. Franz Schubert's piano music, "drenched in morbid humanity", is another brilliant star of the film. <br /> <br /> I just have a problem with Haneke's vision. There is a scene in the film where Haneke made some changes in the character of Erika compared to the novel. In the book, the farthest it was to reveal himself to Walter, the young student at the conservatory who was attracted to her, was in a letter. As soon as she realized what she was dealing with and showed him how much she rejected him, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika's book would never chase Walter to throw himself at him. He kept everything inside, he did not like to act, he was not a hunter, he loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. He tried to make Erika sympathize (and, of course, Huppert was heartbreaking), but he understood the mystery that surrounded her: Jelinek did not write that scene, it sounded and looked fake in an excellent movie.
