This movie was marketed extremely well. When it was released in '97, during half the fame and success of Master P, everything and everything with his name on it was being sold on the shelves. That's why it's no wonder that this underground urban drama sold more than 250,000 copies and still continues. <br /> <br /> If you're a No Limit fan back then or even now, take a look. It has some fantastic old-school videos and do not make me start with the extravagant strippers at the Ice Cream Party. So, what I have to say to all the people who do not like Master P or No Limit Records do not see it because it's not for you and do not bother to vote because you're just going to dissuade TRU there's no limit to the fans to rent or buy this video with your low votes.
