*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I loved the setup and I laughed constantly throughout the movie. The acting was great, with my favorite part being the attempts of Howard (Kevin Kline) to be a "manly man". The fianc√© and the parents did a great job as a support cast. Spoiler warning: acceptance of your conservative family and attempts to be educated were moving and credible. My only problem with the ending was the fact that Howard was actually gay. The film is configured as a "being who you want to be", but in reality the film does the opposite. Howard's logic behind his "discovery" is the fact that he loves Barbra Streisand's films and loves to dance music. His gestures and tastes seem to be gay, and it is not until he is pointed out that he realizes it. Instead of releasing Howard, it pigeonholes him. Oh, he likes to dance music, he must be gay. His confession in marriage was felt as an inclination to the wishes of society. In the end, the film becomes a film about gay rights, which was not the original course. It almost becomes bland with the rest. I think ultimately, the movie would have been better if Howard had been heterosexual. It would have been more true to the message.
