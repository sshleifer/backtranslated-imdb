Okay, well, no one in their right mind would take a movie called "The man with the brain that screams" and I would expect it to be serious. This is an extravagant B movie, and that means a really hokey plot, weird characters, clich√©s, exaggerated action and funny phrases. For that weird segment of the population (including myself) who gets mad at that kind of thing, this is a gem. <br /> <br /> The performance is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in her character. Bruce Campbell brings an energetic and convincing performance. His physical comedy skills are really impressive in this film and go back to the "Evil Dead" movies.
