On a dark and gloomy night on New Year's Eve, a sick sick woman, whose life slowly fades, demands that David Holm be presented immediately. We still do not know who David Holm is, or why this nurse wants to see him, but his only wish to die is to talk to him just one more time. On the other side of the city, nestled comfortably among the tombstones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sjöström, who also directed) and two of his drunken associates happily await the arrival of the New Year. "Here we can know when to drink the New Year," exclaims Holm, pointing a finger towards the great clock tower that looms over the darkness. Little does he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet him. <br /> <br /> To pass the time, Holm happily recites a ghost story. He had once had a friend named George, "a cheerful guy" who was "smarter than the rest of us". On a New Year's Eve, several years ago, George has broken a potentially disastrous fight, fearing that the last man to take his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the ghost car for next year, fulfilling the orders of the Death and collecting souls. of the deceased. "And, gentlemen, George died on New Year's Eve!" Holm concludes happily, without bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of man's beliefs. <br /> <br /> As fate has it, of course, an unexpected violent encounter results in Holm's death, right at the stroke of midnight. As the transparent spirit of man rises cautiously from his earthly body, he witnesses, to his horror, the distant approach of a phantom car. The driver, a fragile hooded figure, a sickle tightly clasped in his hand, gets out of the carriage and approaches. We are surprised to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit George, who is preparing to transmit his horrible duty to this year's successor. <br /> <br /> Considering the time when 'Körkarlen' is made, the special effects in this film are absolutely excellent. Filmmaker Julius Jaenzon used double exposure photography to create the ghostly, spooky silhouette of the carriage and its doomed driver. Even today, the end result is very effective. A particularly impressive scene involves the ghost car that travels to the bottom of the ocean to retrieve the soul of a drowned man. Another scene, reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining", involves Holm pulling down the kitchen door with an ax to reach his wife and children who were running away. <br /> <br /> and disturbing in its execution, the 'Körkarlen' by Victor Sjöström is an excellent work of cinema, which portrays successfully the constant alcoholic decline of Holm, his inevitable day of judgment and a hopeful final possibility of redemption.
