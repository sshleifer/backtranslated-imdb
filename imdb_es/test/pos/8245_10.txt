In my opinion, the film is an excellent example of the realities of the war and a tribute to the soldiers of all the nations that fought and bled to the floor Gallipoli. The lack of violence in no way diminished the magnitude of the story in question. He is honest, true and courageous, just like the men who fought and died in the Hellespont. The lack of brutal representations of violence is fair and adequate. These men suffered enough for freedom, freedom and the right to self-determination in a free and better world. They never wanted to see such scenes again. That is the legacy of the Gallipoli event. Suffering scenes of gratuitous pyrotechnics, blood and blood is not shown to maintain due respect for the combatants of this crucible of nationality. <br /> <br /> This film is glorified in the magnificence of men who fight for their lives, with honor, courage, dignity and irrepressible spirit and humor in the face of terrible adversity. This movie is not interested in making a show for fools to cheer up. The brutal results that emerged from these personal battles of these men are not something that those who survived would want to see on an entertainment screen. They saw enough of that at that time, and would rather never have seen it at first, and never wanted to revisit those scenes again on a screen with the name of "entertainment." The brutal horrors of the realities of the vicious combat fought in Gallipoli were scenes that persecuted their waking hours and sleep during the rest of their natural days. It was the painful internal scars that they, the men of all those nations that fought, carried within their graves. They all fought, and many died at the sight of everything and somehow they, those big-hearted men, managed to laugh in the teeth of constant and fearful death because they would not insult their companions by not being prepared to die playing with them . That's Australasia for brave, the game is, but it applies to all fighters to a greater or lesser degree, but the news of the boy who fought was that Johhny Turk was a game, that he is as brave, as you would wish him to be a soldier . be. <br /> <br /> ANZAC and the Turks fought to establish their place on the world stage, and from 4/25/15 onwards, their respective demands for equality in the Nation became known and are undeniable for that world. The director has made a masterpiece that truly honors the spirit and memory of those soldiers and serves as a reminder to future generations of all ages, since children can be taken without fear of frightening them by visual "horror" and It is morbid and useless appeal And children must attend this movie to learn what happened on that sacred coast before they were born. So they can remember. Because it is the nature of men, who soon forget.
