I saw him recently at TCM and, through IMDb, I discovered that there were seven "Crime Doctor" movies with Warner Baxter as a psychiatrist-detective. Baxter is a bit long on the tooth compared to his solid performance at 42nd Street a decade earlier. Not noir, and a little cheesy today, the film also has a touch of the supernatural possible. The plot, the black and white cinematography and the characters are much more complex than those of the series Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan. There are subplots, unexpected twists and appearances from a series of unconditional B movies that we all must recognize immediately (none of them reached state A). It's a wonderful, unpredictable 70 minute minute. <br /> <br /> I would love to see a series of DVDs in the box of these movies.
