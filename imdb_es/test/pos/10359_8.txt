This is a slightly uneven entry with an outstanding sequence that involves a gang on the hill reminiscent of the diner that once, thirty years before, was his hiding place; A ho-hum duologist between two aged rock muses; a noble kidnapping turned on his head and a sequence of opening (more epilogue) in which the aspiring artist Edward Baer and the current 'hot' property Anna Magloulis, who has his moments, participated. No film in which Jean Rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here it shines as one of the highest quintets on the hill. In fact, it's worth watching the movie just for Rochefort, but each of the sequences has something to offer and is definitely worth seeing.
