The main theme often goes through my head after all these years. I was never a great television viewer, probably because I was entering my teenage years when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it never became part of my life. But from the first episode of Lawman I was hooked, and it's the only TV show I've scheduled for my week. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, credible, well written and well acted, and John Russell remains for me the most beautiful man I have ever seen in my life. (Peter Brown was also not a dog: o) <br /> <br /> I agree that it is one of the most underrated television series of all time. I hope I can find some episodes for my grandchildren to see.
