I agree with the comments already published on this site by the previous evaluator. <br /> <br /> The first time I came across this movie was in the 80s, when I was working in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, many of the spines directed to the psychiatric profession come home. I especially enjoyed the ending, where the psychiatrist spoke through the door to the hospitalized Grodin. Trust me, it's quite accurate. <br /> <br /> Of course, doors in most psychiatric hospitals are not locked, nor are straight jackets worn these days, and any hospital MUST be licensed to have a "padded room". br /> <br /> But a wonderfully underestimated movie, and certainly one that is quite funny. <br /> <br /> Jeff
