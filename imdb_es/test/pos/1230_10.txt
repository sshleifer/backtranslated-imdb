This is a disturbing short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner offer performances that hurt, sound true and stay with you. Since this is called a tragic story, this is not a spoiler. But I wanted to change the result, although it is correct for the story, because I had already come to worry about these people. I can only think of some short films that have had that effect on me. Beautifully filmed, acted, edited. High-caliber work everywhere, even with the use of sound and / or music to advance the story. The final credit song ended the work, drawing even more excitement from me. This is the first class from beginning to end. Congratulations to the writer / director and everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is my first review of a movie in the comments section. I promised to do it in exchange for a copy of the DVD. The review can be good or bad, just my honest opinion. This is everything and it is the least I can do. I'm so glad I saw it.
