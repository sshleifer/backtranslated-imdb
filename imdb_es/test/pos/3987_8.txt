With Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet nuances is a great departure, surprisingly unexpected for Billy Crystal. This film has different serious, dramatic and dramatic underlying themes, particularly (with a scene with Steven Seagal). This film was entertaining and serious, a film about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband and wife, about friendship and values ​​with a good dose of humor, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy is not always maintained as in the new classic genre of this type, but the real message and motivation of this film remain solid. The discovery of Billy Crystal's character / talent scout in Romania from a human giant is revealing and the vision behind the actor's film scene is fascinating. However, the focus remains the sensitive bonds of love and learning about oneself. Eight of ten stars.
