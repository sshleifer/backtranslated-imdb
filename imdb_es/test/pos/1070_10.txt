This Christmas gift arrived courtesy of TCM. We had never seen the movie, even though we've seen most of Barbara Stanwyck's films. This comedy made us laugh so much, that sometimes we had to restrict ourselves to listen to the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that should be seen by people who suffer stressful situations, especially around Christmas. It would certainly elevate one's mood by letting it go. The movie would be a perfect gift in the form of a DVD or a VHS tape. <br /> <br /> "Christmas in Connecticut" was directed in great style by Peter Godfrey, based on a story by Aileen Hamilton. <br /> <br /> The best of the film is the happy couple of two of the most popular stars of the era: Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck always played with women with strong will, obviously, this was a change of pace for her. In this film, as well as in "Lady Eve", Mrs. Stanwyck shows a gift for comedy. She and Mr. Morgan, who played in many musical comedies, make a winning combination. <br /> <br /> There are no weak performances in the movie. Sydney Greenstreet, an actor known for playing the "heavy", is a delight to see the rich and fat, Alexander Yardley, the man who owned a media empire and who knew something good when he saw it. Reginald Gardiner, a successful English actor, adds sparkle to the star cast behind the two directors. <br /> <br /> S. Z. Sakall, is another source of continuous joy; He plays the Hungarian chef Felix, who has difficulties with his own version of the English language. In addition, Una O'Connor makes Norah perfect, the housekeeper at Sloan's perfect farm in Connecticut. <br /> <br /> When reading other comments in this forum, it is sad to know that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated. by some people After all, color was not used much in the 40s, and most classic films should be in their original format because, what would be achieved by "coloring" them? <br /> <br /> This film should be a requirement for anyone who wants to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at Christmas because total joy is assured. Look at it with an open mind and heart and maybe you would like to see "Christmas in Connecticut" every year.
