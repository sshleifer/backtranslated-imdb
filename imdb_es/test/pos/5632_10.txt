This may be the best movie of 1999. No, I'm not kidding. This documentary directed by Chris Smith captures the spirit of artistic compulsion. Smith does the smart thing that any documentary maker should do: he remains invisible and refuses to judge his subject. <br /> <br /> While the viewer looks at Mark and his efforts, no matter how stupidly aggressive they can try, to finish their films. He refuses to commit and suffers repeatedly as a result. But let's not forget, remember that Speilberg, Scorsese and others started with the same humility. <br /> <br /> And what a great theme you choose. Mark, his family and his friends are all fascinating characters, much more than any other character created in last year's fictional film products. This film oscillates between comedy, tragedy, sympathy and leads us to inspire any viewer with desire to create, despite the talent problems, to take off and do something. <br /> <br /> The film is about nonconformist artists and their passions. It is also about families, no matter how co-dependent and dysfunctional they may be, and how unique and beautiful the organism really is. Mark demonstrates in the film that he is totally dedicated not only to his dreams, but also to his family, and they to him. <br /> <br /> Why this film was not nominated for the documentary of the year surpasses me and is criminal (assuming I was eligible last year). This film must be sought and treasured.
