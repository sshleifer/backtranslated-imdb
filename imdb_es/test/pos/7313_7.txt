Norma Shearer dazzles when she transforms from a shivering, thin-skinned woman into a potential seductive divorcee. Most of the 1930s films have a screeching touch: camera work is sometimes quite slow, but we must forgive these pleasures that speak for their "qualities". As a guest of Marie Dressler, the eccentric globetrotter, Shearer mingles with a strange variety of crazy lovers, including her husband, who lost so long ago. The dialogue is fun, often intelligent and the performances at the right time. Shearer and Dressler are the brightest. Shearer even shows his piano experience in a musical brevity. His strange but attractive posture and his "camera adventure" are evident at all times, and he plays every emotional note, genuine and accurate. For your time. . .a good show.
