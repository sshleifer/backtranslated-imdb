I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost every day. There are good and bad in EVERY race, why make everyone bad? That goes for all races today. John Harper was an educated man, he graduated from high school, he even had a year of college under his belt before returning to the reserve. How can I know this? John Harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school, and he kept in touch with us the year after graduation. He was a kind and gentle soul, could be fun loving and could be serious when times were right. I was not very old when he left our house, but I can still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my own brother did not bother him. He even taught the third grade the year before his arrival in Winnipeg. None of this is mentioned in the movie, and Constable Cross's suicide is an admission of guilt as far as I'm concerned. What happened to John is unforgivable, not only in the native community, but also in the white community. Not everyone in Winnipeg thinks like the police do, I knew the person who was inside and how he was like a PERSON, not an Indian!
