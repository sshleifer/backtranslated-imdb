Aunt Cora had always been tactless, and her well-educated family ignored the comment she made after her brother Richard's funeral: "He was murdered, was not he?" They remembered him the next day, when Cora was brutally murdered with an ax ... <br /> <br /> For some reason, this year's POIROT films have been far from being true to the original book. I was disappointed with the changes made to CARDS AT THE TABLE: my favorite Poirot book. AFTER THE FUNERAL is my second favorite book by Poirot, and I was afraid that the story would be destroyed. It was not! The film was faithful from page to page, even the murderer's motive! All the actors were wonderful, but my favorite must be Monica Dolan, who provides a great performance as Miss Gilchrist, the companion of the late Aunt Cora. Without a doubt the best Poirot movie of all time!
