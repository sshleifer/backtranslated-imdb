The film is about the Battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who do not know anything about it, it was the worst battle in World War II. More than 1 million people died in the course of the battle. This is the only movie I've seen that seems to have captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked about this is that the two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were nowhere in the movie. Unlike most American films, Germans are not seen as bloodthirsty murderers, but what the average German infantryman was a person. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were transferred there to try to take the city. The film follows these men from August 1942 to the beginning of 1943. During this time, they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle. <br /> <br /> Throughout the whole movie, one feels The despair of the whole battle. Unlike "Enemy at the Gates," the filmmakers did not try to put a sappy love story or disguise real events in the battle. This film may be fiction, but it conveys what happened in the bloodiest battle in World War II.
