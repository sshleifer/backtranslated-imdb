I would probably say that this was on par with films like "Devil's Rain" and that kind of movie, although it's probably a bit better done. I love the horror of the 70s and this has most of the elements that make up other movies that I like, so it was quite easy to enjoy. A family on their vacation trips to a small town where people seem to be trapped by some kind of hysteria. It seems that the children have been disappearing. After an initial attempt to flee from this place, the family stops in some way on the edge of the city and finds its way back, but not before finding a house where the children have gone and mom and dad are dead . It seems we have a different kind of turn in a community center for senior citizens in this city, we are all Satan worshipers and they need children to renew their lives so they can continue in their service, I suppose. It is not that someone seems too interested in giving up their children for this company. This is quite elegant considering that it is frightening and spooky without gore cubes or the alarming events that attempt to make people jump into today's movies, which seem to have replaced the real fears. We have Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore) from "Green Acres" as Tobey, a deputy sheriff who reads UFO magazines, and LQ Jones as the sheriff, and a very familiar character actor as the father of the stranded family. And Strother Martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing a double task without his colleagues in the city knowing. This is pretty good, but a bit confusing at times, but in general it works pretty well and is recommended for horror fans of the 70s. 8 out of 10.
