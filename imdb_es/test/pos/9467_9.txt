This movie is a great movie, however, since most movies are highly predictable. Of course, the highlight of the movie is the star character Amanda Bynes, who is absolutely beautiful and funny. She is one of the few people in this world who can use the 53 muscles of her face to make the strangest and most shocking faces ever made. It is good for children and contains superior male nudity and suggestive nudity towards the end. In general, they did a good job of updating an old classic, and it deserves to rest in the spot of the movie along with O and 10 Things I Hate About You. The other actors also do a good job, in many of their debuts for the first time.
