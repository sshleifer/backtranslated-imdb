"Checking Out" is a very witty and honest portrait of a strange family that turns out to be Jewish. Judaism plays virtually no role in the film, but the culture and behavior of American Jews are sent deep ... it is a loving way. I hope the film will address the religious perspective on the issues it explores, because I think that would have been interesting. <br /> <br /> I've never been a Columbo fan, so I was not familiar with Peter Falk, it's very fun to watch. It's great to see Judge Reinhold, Laura San Giacomo and David Paymer again, why do not they work more? They are all hilarious. The script is fantastic, with a lot of memorable phrases that I will use with my own family. Watch for Gavin McLeod (Captain Stubing!) As the goalkeeper.
