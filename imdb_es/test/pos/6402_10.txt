Agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show. I remember the series well, since I was in the Florida Keys when the show had its debut. I looked through old VCR tapes that were "guardians" and I found two that had approximately eight episodes. I ended up spending part of Christmas night (and the next) watching these shows. The singer was Bankie Banx; He saw his name appear in the credits. It is from Anguilla and has a beach front bar called The Dune Preserve. He's an old friend of Jimmy Buffett and Bankie's classic song "Still In Paradise" is featured on the latest Buffett CD / DVD combo called "Live In Anguilla" - it's track # 12 on CD 1 and # 8 on the CD. I would also like to see this short-lived series on DVD someday. Keep faith!
