Yes, I felt that I had been disemboweled after having seen it for the first time. But not until the next day did I begin to see the true splendor of this creation. I will not repeat much of what those who appreciate the film have already said, but there is a new area that I want to mention ... ** SPOILERS ** Why exactly did the teacher place the broken glass on the student's desk? pocket? Most reviewers have noted that it only reflected their cruelty and reaction to unsatisfactory performance. I must disagree Look at the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears when he sees his student playing on stage. The student is a pretty expressive girl (crying and vocalizing her fears), just the opposite of Huppert's character. There is a scene later in the film, after the girl is injured, when Huppert talks about the accident with the girl's mother. The mother, visibly annoyed, declares: "We give up everything to be able to study piano" and Huppert responds immediately "You mean that SHE renounced everything, right?" <br /> <br /> So I thought that Huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny. I did not want the girl to end up as SHE, repressed and hardened, condemned to a life of recitals ... gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection. Maybe he saw himself on stage years ago, before things got worse. Maybe he wished he had escaped when he was that age. Is it ruining the life of the student, or simply releasing it? <br /> <br /> For me, that realization made all the difference in what I experienced through this movie. Sparkly.
