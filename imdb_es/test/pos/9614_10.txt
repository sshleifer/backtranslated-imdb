Launched as KING BOXER in the UK <br /> <br /> This movie was essentially the FIRST Kung Fu movie to be released in the UK. Many of us had seen the amazing sand and dramas of Kurosawa, and we were used to the oriental movie. with beautiful shots and lighting, with a somewhat moderate rhythm, altogether like leafing through an album of very fine still photographs that by chance are moving. <br /> <br /> Along with Run Run Shaw and company. with its production values ​​of widescreen "home movies", and a surprising mature dub for parody and all the rules have changed. KIng Boxer was the first to enter through the door, leaving a clearly marked trail for others to follow with his feet firmly planted on the blazing steps. <br /> <br /> Despite the hokey frames, the pantomime, the cheesy jump - Western style spaghetti and zoom-step by step, this movie was wonderful. Beautiful without being opulent and with the brightest fight choreography I have seen on a screen. We love the sickly violence, the anguish, the testosterone. The martial artists among us found some of the fascinating, though extravagant and often silly techniques. It was very different from the Japanese things we all knew, and it had a lovely acrobatic grace that perfectly complemented the sickly violence and the bloody floors. Charming. <br /> <br /> The scene of "KIng Lear" was, at that moment, a great milestone in the dead end "Damn bastards .. My bitch !! Now it's rather less shocking, but still it's a little clumsy <br /> <br /> We did not realize that the females in sight were absolutely one-dimensional.After watching more movies of the genre, it now stands out as a sore thumb, but at the time it did not matter < br /> <br /> This film defined what would quickly become the clichés of the kung fu movies, all of them, look at it and remember that until this stormed the western screens, there was no genre to fit in. It was unique and impressive, it was the first kung fu movie and it remains, for me and for many others, the best.
