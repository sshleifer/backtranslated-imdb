If you are looking for an erotic masterpiece, it is not. If you're looking for a comedy masterpiece, it's not like that. If you are looking for something hard, it is not. <br /> <br /> That said, if you're looking for an example of the art of European erotic comedy from the early to mid-70s, this is the place. . <br /> <br /> I see that many people complain about quality, understand that it was done in 1974. Yes, women do not conform to the modern ideal of attractiveness. They are not in any way ugly women, but they do not have the same look that is idealized in our silicone culture. Yes, the dubbing is not excellent, but they speak German and anyone who speaks German will realize that it is quite difficult to double a word with 12 syllables. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the DVD before the last Release it is marketed with 2 covers of 80 and recently 90 adult stars. The film is a movie in R, so those who complain about hardcore must have realized this, the film is edited from the original BUT, but it was also edited before its release in the drive-ins at the end of the 70s. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was young and, judging from some comments, there are many in the same boat that Cinemax glimpsed. Many people get angry when later in life they do not live up to their previous memories. It is understandable considering the sense of nakedness and nakedness in today's erotic. <br /> <br /> If you compare the 2069 with a modern soft-core erotic comedy, you may feel disappointed. The film, although extravagant, is actually quite fluid and jokes, although in general insinuations and double meanings still hold up and can still make people laugh. If you compare it to a hardcore movie, you will feel even more disappointed, compared to today, you will see very little. <br /> <br /> Still one of the best examples, along with Bottoms Up and The Other Cinderella of European Erotic / Comic Cinema of the Seventies.
