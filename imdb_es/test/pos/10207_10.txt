The first time I saw this movie in the theater was in the 40s when I was a child and I always remembered the ending. There's nothing like the first impression, but some movies are always a treat every time they see each other. Something just resonates with them. This is one of those movies and I agree with another critic who said that Fritz Lang should have directed more westerns. To add to this I have always liked Randolph Scott and Robert Young. In fact, Robert Young stars in what I consider my favorite movie if I have to name only one, it's not easy to do. That movie is Northwest Passage. It led me to the superb historical novels by Kenneth Roberts. Western Union also took me to read Zane Gray's novel, which in this case turned out to be one of those rare cases in which I like the film more than the novel. It's not that Gray's novel is bad; I just like the history of the movie better. The movie in no way resembles the novel. It's a completely different story, one of the biggest games in a book I've seen. <br /> <br /> I can not add much to the other reviews, except to say that I agree with many of them. I also want it to be released on DVD. "Whatever happened to Randolph Scott happened to the best of me."
