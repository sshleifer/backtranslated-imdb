I found this movie on Netflix and I had to add it to my queue. I was not disappointed when I got it, since it's as fun now as when I saw it at a local theater drive-in back then. <br /> <br /> It is built to a very good climax with you glimpsing the various characters as they begin their journey across America on the "Honky Tonk, America on Wheels" highway. This was a strange comic role for William DeVane, since I remember him as Kennedy in the 1974 television movie "The Missiles of October" and I felt that no one could have taken that dramatic character as well as he did. <br /> <br /> It reminds me a little of Dick Van Dyke in "Cold Turkey" where Van Dyke played the local minister. DeVane's role as mayor, minister and activist was typical of small cities, so his character seems fun and real. <Br /> <br /> Howard Hessman and Teri Garr as the spoiled family in the RV also signed up at that time. Anyone who has traveled across the country with small children, (Are we there yet?) Will appreciate those scenes. <br /> <br /> The scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the small town where I grew up, but they handled it with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns. It is sad that many small cities disappeared due to the highway system and offer a realistic, albeit humorous, view of what they had to do to survive. (Does anyone use zoo animals?) <br /> <br /> In general, it is a light comedy that does not have a particular message, but a comical look at the United States in the early 1980s. It's worth seeing if you just need a bit of good cheer.
