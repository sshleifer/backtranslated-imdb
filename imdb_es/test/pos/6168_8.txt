I left the feeling "Dark Blue World" (sigh) "so sad", but it was definitely a movie that had to be made, and is really well made from the Czech Republic. It is entertaining despite the 'sad' premise. It is full of feelings, union and undeniable friendship between the two main characters: a mature pilot lieutenant (Ondrej Vetchý as Franta) and the young and always anxious pilot in the making (Krystof Hádek as Karel), the inevitable love triangle. , and the reminders of now and then of the prison situations in Czechoslovakia in the 50s. Everything is in a film organized by the father, the scriptwriter and the director of the team, Zdenek and Jan Sverák (the previous achievement is the adorable "Kolya "). <br /> <br /> It's not as long as "East-West" (French "Est-Ouest") 1999, which was a heartbreaking and multi-layered story about a returning Russian doctor and the wife's bad destiny French after the Second World War in Russia. The plot of "Tmavomodrý svet" (title in Czech) is quite simple and has a touch of light humor. Music, World War II songs sung in Czech, modest special effects of pilots and planes in the sky, not as elaborate as Hollywood, there is no need to be bing, bang, boom all the time when scenes of air battles are shown . The sadness was explained at the beginning (two paragraphs in English) and was completed with follow-up paragraphs. The film is not fully subtitled, only when translating the Czech conversations, the rest are in English, either very British or with a Czech accent. (So ​​it's a foreign movie with English language and includes British actors). <br /> <br /> The three main performances, especially of the two Czech riders, were presented beautifully. There are nuances between the two, although it is the constant maturity in front of anxious young people. I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald: yes, there is "Brassed Off" from 1996 with Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite; I remembered her from "Hear My Song" 1991 along with Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty; along with Hugh Grant in "Sirens" 1994 and "The Englishman Who Went Up to Hill and Came Down to Mountain" in 1995, in addition to his appearances in the PBS Masterpiece Theater series. <br /> <br /> 'Very sad': the fact that the heroes who defend one's country can be mistreated and for so long (40 years). Thank God for the memories that are worthwhile and the traces of unforgettable friendship. Hence the pause for a sunbeam through a stained glass window (ironic or coincidental that it is from a church where hard labor was carried out) - symbolic of hope, never give up? <br /> <br /> Other recent films that have stories must be told: "Kandahar" (with Nelofer Pazira as Nafas, the Canadian from Afghanistan who travels to Kandahar with a personal "mission" in mind) more than she finds eye behind a burka of the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. "Everything Put Together" (with Radha Mitchell as a new mother in front of SID - sudden infantile death) insightful film of the Swiss director Marc Forster, and his much commented controversial film "Monster's Ball" (I have not yet caught) with Halle Berry, Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. Watch movies without previous expectations or comparisons with previous movies. Only veil
