It is possible that Iron Eagle is not the plot of the most credible film, but the characters are well written and act very well. If you can not believe the characters, the movie is a failure. <br /> <br /> I think photography, especially aerial photography, is excellent. I think it is far superior to Top Gun with which it compares infinitely. It is one of the best pieces of aerial photography that I have seen. The soundtrack of Basil Paledouros (forgive the spelling) is great, and juxtaposes well with the melodies of rock. I wish that part of the soundtrack was available. <br /> <br /> Jason Gedrick does well as the teenager who suddenly has to grow up in a hurry and the realities of life, death and responsibilities. Lou Gossett is fabulous as Chappy, both hard and human, as he remembers the deaths of pilots. <br /> <br /> There are many movies out there that you see once and you do not mind looking at them again. Then there are those movies that give you one aspect or another and you can see them again and again. Iron Eagle is that kind of movie!
