The mystery of the 1930 comedy about "The Crooked Circle," a band of hooded delinquents who set out to plan the murder of someone who swore to oppose them. A nice little movie but really uninteresting, the movie works simply because the cast led by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (who would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver retired from that series) and was supported by a large cast of actors and actresses that you know but maybe you do not know the name of (so, I do not need the name). Throughout an hour of breeze, the film does not make much sense with mistaken identity, secret passages, ghostly music and people who are not what they seem. It is the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a nocturnal evening when one feels nostalgic for the late show.
