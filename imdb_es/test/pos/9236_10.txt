After watching "A Texas Tale of Treason" you feel a renewed disgust for the nature of the Hollywood beast. Within the interviews and conversations of all those involved in the project there is a common sense of camaraderie and rebellion that includes background, social classifications and even geography. This can be attributed to the hard work in the eternal commitment of all the production with the project and the love for the history of the original film, and the complete creation of emptiness that is its creator. The scale of people involved in "Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday" was amazing for me, with a production without budget or glory. There were no trailers or craft services or services, and yet everyone involved stayed there. If nothing comes of this project, Antstuie Productions has established its foundation to be a serious and honest company that will never sit, sell or sell and make a movie just for money. I would like to see any LLA director go through the guerrilla process to get an opportunity. The most realistic and faithful to life cinema is lacking in this era of CG and green screens. The masses can enjoy their entertainment spoon that is provided in small pieces of censored calm, but there is a large group of people here in the world who share the views and views of the filmmakers who still make films for the love of material. Or the love of storytelling, not DVD or box office sales. I loved this documentary, and I hope that IFC has the phones to pick it up and transmit it so that maybe, just maybe, one more person decides to take a camera and shoot something from real life so that the viewer can have a temporary understanding that everyone everywhere is the same, and anyone anywhere can be a true storyteller.
