Writer / director John Milius takes a little-known incident from the history of the United States and extrapolates it wildly in the right way. The result is a great adventure story that shows two of his stars in memorable roles, larger than life: Sean Connery as the ingenious Arab sheikh with an inexplicable Scottish brogue, and Brian Keith as President Theodore Roosevelt, craving the opportunity to Put that "big cane" for good use. <br /> <br /> Helped enormously by the glorious widescreen cinematography of Billy Williams and a superb score by the always reliable Jerry Goldsmith, this initial effort seemed to be the harbinger of a talent to classify with contemporaries Lucas, Coppola and Spielberg . Although Milius offered glimpses of his skill in screenwriting for JEREMIAH JOHNSON and APOCALYPSE NOW, his career seemed to take a downward turn shortly after he began directing, and eventually sank into a dreck like CONAN THE BARBARIAN and RED DAWN. <br /> <br /> Here he is waiting for him to find his way again.
