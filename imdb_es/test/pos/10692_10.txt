Wow. I have never seen or heard of this movie. He has just arrived on television (2:00 a.m.) and I am completely amazed. Architecture: a group of rich fat cats are playing golf. One hits a ball in the rough. Landing for a NINJA !!!! A man in a tuxedo comes to pick up the ball. The ninja grabs him. He crushes it in his hand. The man pulls the gun. Ninja pulls a gun. Ninja blows the dart in the barrel of the gun. EXPLOTES OF ARMA !!!! This is just the beginning of greatness, people. Everyone should see this movie. 10 big fat stars of confidence.
