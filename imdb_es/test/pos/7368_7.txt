I recently bought this movie for three dollars at a garage sale, and although I'm glad I did not have to pay the usual $ 19.99 for this DVD, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. <br /> <br /> It is configured as an anthology of terror, divided into 5 stories, including the story of the 'connector', which involves four teenagers whose car breaks a dark and lonely road in the middle of the night. Apparently, these children like horror stories, because that's what they decide to do until the morning: tell scary stories around a campfire. Each character takes his turn to tell a story, after which his own story is wrapped up with a small twist. <br /> <br /> The first story, "The Hook" is a waste of time, a bit dull and boring. Luckily, this is not one of the main stories and only lasts about 5 minutes. It is simply intended to present the film and it is easy to overlook the originality of this piece. <br /> <br /> The second story, "The Honeymooners" is, uh, it's fine. It's about, you guessed it, two people on their honeymoon! They are traveling around in an RV that heads to Las Vegas. They decide to stop somewhere to spend the night, but a mysterious stranger quickly warns them to leave the place or they risk being attacked by some dangerous and unknown creatures. This story has a pretty good configuration, but simply an "acceptable" delivery. Basically, it's quite entertaining and mysterious until the monsters appear, then it's a bit iffy. <br /> <br /> The third story, "People Can Lick Too" is my personal favorite. This is a girl whose parents are going out at night and her older sister is leaving for a party. So, she will be completely alone, a fact that lets an Internet friend know she has. The problem is that that internet friend? She is not exactly a thirteen-year-old girl. The conclusion of this story is a little less climatic than I would have liked to see, but it is still pretty good. <br /> <br /> The final story, "The Locket" is definitely the most charged of atmosphere. Located in a spooky mansion on a dark and rainy night, it is the story of a young man (played by Glenn Quinn) who travels on a motorcycle that meets this house just at the moment when he conveniently has a problem with his bicycle. Meet the mute girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first sight. Unfortunately, not everything is fine and elegant, and could have something to do with that medallion that hangs around your pretty neck ... <br /> <br /> After the stories are wrapped, they present us with a twist. involving the four teenagers in the car, a turn that, in retrospect, should have been obvious, but that really did not seem to come, and it's a pretty nice conclusion to the movie. <br /> <br /> So, all In short, a good movie. Rent it if you can, because unfortunately I do not think it has much courage to look again. But the next time you're looking for a vaguely spooky little movie like "Tales of the Darkside" or something like that, take this movie and some popcorn, turn off all the lights and treat yourself to this amazing and Little ingenious movie.
