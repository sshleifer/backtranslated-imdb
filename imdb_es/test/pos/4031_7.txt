This movie is not really a new version of the 1949 O'Brien movie (which is excellent). He borrows the main premise: a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the movie trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English teacher, instead of a private imbecile, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves fast enough to keep you awake. But what spoils this film is a strange old-fashioned quality (probably due to the horrible original 80s musical score) combined with an affected "noir" feeling. Dennis Quaid smiles inexplicably throughout the film at odd times, but remains convincing in general. Meg Ryan is fine as a student assistant / love interest. When the movie gets bad it's when Dex (the teacher) meets the British bodyguard / chauffeur and his duels are pretty ridiculous. The bodyguard works for the rich widow (played by the charming Charlotte Rampling), but those scenes are too "unconscious" to help the film, although the "plot" of the family is quite interesting. Dex also keeps appearing in the same place and finds this bodyguard, which is more of a coincidence. In the last part of the film, a man is shot through a window, and from the outside he sees himself jumping out of it, which is a pretty bad direction. But aside from some of these obvious flaws, I think it's still fine. I certainly did not predict the end, so that was good. There is a twist, and although some posters here think they were deceived, I thought it was a beautiful and credible ending. Dennis Quaid, with his strange smiles and black eyes, is nicer at The Right Stuff, Great Balls of Fire, Inner Space and Cold Creek Manor. But here, like Dex, he's supposed to be a jerk, so he did it right. Pretty decent movie.
