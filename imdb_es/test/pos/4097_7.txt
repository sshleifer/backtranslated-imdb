I really loved this movie and I spent several years trying to get it. It just is not available and has not been on television for many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because I had something different to say and it made you think how each person sees something from different perspectives. In addition, we often do not appreciate something we have until it is no longer there. <br /> <br /> My 12-year-old daughter has just discovered music and is fascinated by some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the movie so she has the opportunity to see it. (Oh, I'd love to see it too!) <br /> <br />
