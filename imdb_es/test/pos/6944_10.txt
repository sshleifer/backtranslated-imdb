After traveling around the world, I realized that Australia really lacks one thing that other countries have: history. <br /> <br /> Fortunately or unfortunately, Australia did not settle after a war, has not had a civil war. The war and most of its political history is quite boring. Nothing "big" happened to mark some kind of turning point in the history of Australia ... until the dismissal of the Whitlam government by the Governor General of Australia, John Kerr. <br /> <br /> For those who are Australian, you can skip this paragraph and move on to the next one. This is for the benefit of the non-Australian curious! Australia was colonized by the British. As time passed, it became clear that Australia was able to stand on its own feet. As a result, the United Kingdom granted permission to Australia to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts, etc. The law and policy of Australia would no longer be provided directly by the British; rather, Australia would be led by Australians in their own right, although courts, precedents, parliament, etc., are based largely on the British system. This change was codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the constitution legally establishes Australian governments, legislative procedures, courts (but for those who are curious, there is no bill of rights), there are two "pro crown" sections that were included and remain there until the present day. These are more or less considered as the "reserve powers of the Crown (King / Queen of Great Britain)". The first group of sections refers to the creation of the office of the Governor General. Briefly, the governor general is considered the principal representative of the Queen in Australia and is described as the "Executive" branch of the Australian Government. When the Australian Parliament passes a law, the Constitution provides that it only becomes law when signed by the Governor General. As such, the Governor General is considered by some to be nothing more than a rubber stamp that performs an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the Crown. In theory, the governor general can refuse to sign a law passed by the Australian parliament if he considers it appropriate. For example, if the parliament passes a law allowing the police to kill any Australian over the age of 50 (hypothetically, of course), the GG could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the country. However, this power is theoretical and (to date) has never been exercised. By "convention" (which is the buzzword of the events that led to the dismissal), the Governor-General acts virtually at the behest of the Australian government and, therefore, if the government approves the law and the Prime Minister instructs the Governor-General so that Signing it, will do it, almost always without questioning it. In fact, by "convention" the Governor-General acts in accordance with the advice provided by the Prime Minister of the time (and only the Prime Minister). The second aspect is article 64 of the constitution, which establishes that government ministers have a charge in the "pleasure" of the governor general. Now, the events of 1975, which are covered in this film, led to a precedent in this particular section: if the governor-general is in any way "disgusted" with the government and / or the prime minister, it would seem that this section it legally allows him to dismiss the government (what happened in 1975 ... hence the title of the film "the dismissal"). If 'the Governor-General's pleasure' can be interpreted as "the unrestricted right to dismissal" it is a controversial point that, however, led to rather heated exchanges among Australians at that time, especially considering that the Governor-General is not chosen by the people of Australia. <br /> <br /> Now that this background aspect is out of the way, let's go back to discussing the film. It was well done. The pace was patient, but it did not drag anything. The drama was well contained and very realistic. He did not dramatize the events too much and, more importantly, he did not present his point of view from a political perspective. On the contrary, I felt that it was fair and balanced, although the final text before the credits indicates that the filmmakers probably did not approve the Governor General's decision to dismiss the Whitlam government. But I would not describe the film in general as a bias in one direction or another. <br /> <br /> In terms of accuracy, it was virtually successful. The filmmakers certainly did their homework and evidently read the books and writings of all the main actors involved. There were a number of finer details that skipped a bit, largely because they took a long time to explain and, ultimately, had little impact on the events of 1975, so I forgive them for that. Also, I think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post-Vietnam era era, but Noyce practically did it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was pleased that the film tried to come up with individual policies on both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or critical of them. In addition, any of the ones we have raised, for example, the Connor pipe, had a lot of relevance to the story. The filmmakers realized that their task was to tell the story of the events that led to the dismissal and not to present a political endorsement or opposition in relation to the policies and points of view. This was clever because it meant that the film can not be accused of twisting policies on one side. <br /> <br /> The dismissal is probably the most incredible part of political history that has happened in Australia in its short life. I'm glad it was crystallized on celluloid. Essential visualization for any Australian.
