This film is about a group of four friends who destroy a car while driving. They make a bonfire to spend the night and wait for help. To pass the time, stories of fear are told. Talking about that would ruin the movie, so fix it and enjoy it! <br /> <br /> I'll say it starts a little slow, but every story gets better and better. This film stars some of the best actors of today, Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movies), James Marsden (Disturbing Behavior) and Ron Livingston (Office Space). So you can see that there are stars of big names, just not the biggest ones!
