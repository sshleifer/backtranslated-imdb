In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the first installment of their series "Silly Symphonies", "The Skeleton Dance". Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 1920s, in Disney's cartoon series "Laugh-O-Gram"; however, their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer from a competitor to leave Disney and start their own animation studio. That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued to develop his style and technique (and where he created the Flip the Frog character). While his work maintained the same high quality, it was not really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to their old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. <br /> <br /> "Skeleton Frolics" of 1937 is essentially a remake of 1929. The classic "The Skeleton Dance", the movie that won him fame and fortune. Like that short film, it is located in an abandoned cemetery, where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play. The dead rise from their coffins, ready for the show that is about to begin, as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy melody. Now, it is not easy to be a musician made only of bones, since some members of the orchestra have problems with the parts of their body, however, the band manages to put on a good show and another group of skeletons starts to dance . A lovely couple faces the same problems that worried the orchestra: it is difficult to dance with loose parts of the body. Everything ends at dawn, and just as the sun is about to come out again, the skeletons run towards their graves. <br /> <br /> Directed and encouraged by Ub Iwerks himself, "Skeleton Frolics" faithfully follows the pattern set by "The Skeleton Dance" years before, albeit with a crucial difference: Iwerks made the whole film in Technicolor. The brilliant shades allowed Iwerks to create a more attractive film in view, and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney, creating effects of depth and dynamism even better than those he had conceived before. Without a doubt, it is a more experimental film than "The Skeleton Dance", although, unfortunately, this does not mean that it is necessarily a better film. For starters, the movie is almost identical to the one he made with Disney, and the only differences are music (more on that later) and the effects of color. It looks beautiful, no doubt, but it definitely feels unoriginal after all. <br /> <br /> However, it is not the originality of the concept that really hurts the film (after all, Iwerks runs it in a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is quite uninteresting and lacks the lovely elegance and whimsical fun of the one made by Carl W. Stalling for "The Skeleton Dance". In other words, while DeNat's melody is effective and appropriate for the subject, it's easy to forget it quickly, while Stalling's song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film, this is of great importance, so the mediocrity of music reduces Iwerk's impeccable animation work. Personally, I think that with a better musical accompaniment, "Skeleton Frolics" would be remembered as fondly as "The Skeleton Dance" despite not being so innovative, as it is still a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> It's kind of sad that most of the work that Iwerks did after leaving Disney has now been forgotten due to its limited success, however, it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (the main rival of Disney), did not lack the quality of the films of those companies. It was probably just a case of bad luck that made the man who gave life to the Disney mouse for the first time to face the failure of Disney. Despite its shortcomings, "Skeleton Frolics" is very funny and visually impressive. film, which although not exactly the most original and fresh film (one can not stop thinking about "The Skeleton Dance" while watching it), definitely reminds us that the skeletons of Iwerk are still here to persecute and inspire us. <br /> <br /> 8/10
