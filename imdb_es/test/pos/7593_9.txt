I am very surprised that so many people do not like this movie. I think it's much better than most teen movies that have recently premiered: Ten things I hate about you (can we say a teen movie and what was the beginning of writing those porn novels?), Cruel intentions ( where a character abandons her virginity due to a fun car trip), and She's All That (mediocre). If you are looking for something that is fun, I tell you "I have never been kissed". My mom loved and hates movies (one of her favorites is BEACHES). This is a great fantasy about what you would do differently if you could go back to high school. People who were marginalized in high school probably like this movie better. Reminds me of 'Romy and Michele's high school reunion'. And the end puts me in a better mood. Surely the plot has been made, but how many recent movies can you honestly say that they have not been done in one way or another. The cast is also charming. And for those who think Drew can not be a geek, she gets it just great. Another good teen comedy that I recommend was recently made is CHOICE, but it's more like a satire about school and politics.
