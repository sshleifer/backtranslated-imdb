Maybe once in a generation a movie appears that is perfection. For me, "The Railway Children" is that movie, a timeless classic that was directed and performed in the best way. It represents everything that is worthwhile in humanity and culminates in the conquest of love and faith over cruel injustice. Each performance is a gem, although Bobbie stands out and, like Judy Garland as Dorothy before her, Jenny Agutter makes it impossible for us to imagine someone else on paper. <br /> <br /> The world is much better for This movie and the children of today would be much better to see it. <br /> <br /> Of course, like many young people of my generation, I fell hopelessly in love with Jenny Agutter and her dominance was so strong when I had the great fortune to meet her a few days ago, the captivating smile and the voice like Dripping honey was still there to send me on weak knees like they did for the first time so many years ago!
