Yesterday I saw the film and for me it was an impressive combination of films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The best of the best. He was never bored and he always moved, every hour there is another character that bothers him (trying to kill him). You never know what's next. In a word TERRIFIC !!!
