Many more eloquent criticisms that have described the performance, casting and the quite spectacular style of this film. It seems that the only negative criticisms focus on a perceived imbalance in the handling of the film's central moral issue (euthanasia). <br /> <br /> This film is, except for the final scenes, meticulous in emphasizing Ramon's belief that it is not. doing something important, but simply that, for him, a life without dignity is a life that is not worth living. We, as spectators, see an enormous dignity in their life: we see family, friends, culture and, except for their physical limitations, a life fully lived. The center of the tragedy of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks that Ramon's life is not worth it, and that is him. <br /> <br /> To see this movie and say that the only argument against it comes. The visit of a clumsy priest is nonsense. The visit of the priest is pure farce, a direct assault on the simplicity of the response of the Spanish Catholic Church to the issue of euthanasia. However, the sister's farewell words to the priest momentarily expose the powerful "pro-life" feelings that quietly prop up the entire film. They constantly encourage us to see the hope and beauty of a life lived with love. As the film progresses, we can gradually encourage ourselves to understand Ram√≥n's reasoning, but we never reconcile with his decision. <br /> <br /> I do not remember a movie that moved me and provoked me as much as this.
