First of all, I'm not a fan of movies. I saw Friends in the 70s when it was released for the first time. I was about 17 years old at that time. Even now, at 50, I can still remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too docile for teenagers today, but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves than the one they had at home. At that time it was quite risky to have a movie about a couple of young fugitives who successfully established the house and had a baby on their own. I'm not surprised by the movie and Elton John's soundtrack is almost unknown today. The music is beautiful It was unforgettable.
