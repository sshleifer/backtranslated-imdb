The Thing has to be one of the best movies of all time. Of course, it was the innovative special effects at the time of its release that impressed me so much, in 1982, it just amazed me, I had never seen anything like it! However, although the effects themselves made the film more horrible, it was the story itself, the musical score, the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Antarctic, as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the research station condemned what makes it a classic. <br /> <br /> Movies can not be better than this! In the initial scene, with the helicopter chasing this husky, you simply assume that it was some boring scientists of some season who left some steam. However, when you see them continuing their pursuit on the American base, then you think that the Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme tension from cabin fever. However, this is offset by the threatening opening music that sets the pace. You only know that something is not right! At this point it is a mystery until "the thing" is revealed. <br /> <br /> However, the mystery returns because it becomes a kind of sci-fi style of Agatha Christie "who dunnit" (that is, ten little Indians), since members do not know which of their equipment is really an alien. Suspicion continues to go back and forth between them, as one by one they are eventually shot down or revealed as aliens. The distrust between the station team is being absorbed as the film progresses to the final showdown. <br /> <br /> After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film production, the special effects in "the Thing" do not carry the same weight as in 1982, but apart from that, it remains very Fine all year long with some great performances by the cast.
