This is a great German slasher, often quite suspenseful and creative, with a funny story and solid performances. All the characters are great, and Benno Fürmann is a great killer of psychopaths, and Franka Potente offers a fantastic performance as the main character. It took a little time to start, but it was never boring, and it also had some good death scenes, plus the music is wonderfully spooky. I was lucky to get the subtitled version, instead of the copy, and I thought that all the characters were quite nice, besides that it is very well done and written too. It also has some really good plot twists, and the effects are very well done, and the ending is excellent. The end is especially suspense, and Franka Potente was the perfect choice for the casting in my opinion, plus I wish that Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey (David) was not killed so soon, because he was a really cool character. Actually, there were a couple of moments in which I felt uncomfortable, but in a good way, and I must say that this film deserved all praise, besides that although it has plot holes, it is not enough to hinder the film. This is a great German slasher, often quite exciting and creative, with a funny story and solid performances. I highly recommend it! The address is great! Stefan Ruzowitzky makes a great! Work here with excellent camera work, very good angles, excellent close-ups (see the initial sex scene), doing a great job of adding a spooky atmosphere and keeping the film at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There is enough blood and blood. We cut corpses, there are many very bloody surgery scenes, many bloody stabbings, people are dissected while they are still conscious, fingers are cut, mutilated, destroyed, throat is bleeding, many corpses are frozen , with a lot of blood and more. . <br /> <br /> The acting is very solid! Franka Potente is fantastic as the main character, she was very nice, she was cold under pressure, she was vulnerable, easy to see and we can take care of her character, the only time she seemed to suffer was when she had to do it. it provoked a bad dialogue here and there, but that was not very frequent, it was wonderful! Benno Fürmann is excellent as a psycho killer, he was just relaxing, and wonderfully OTT, it really gave me the chills, and he was an effective killer! Anna Loos played her role very well, like the clever fox, I dug her. Sebastian Blomberg was great here as Caspar, he was quite nice and had a mysterious character, his chemistry with Potente was also active, and in the end there were a lot of twists that involved him. Holger Speckhahn was as good as idiot Phil and did his job well. Traugott Buhre is good as Prof. Grombek. Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey was great as David, he had a really cool character and I wish he would not get killed so soon. The rest of the cast does it well. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this great German slasher! *** 1/2 out of 5
