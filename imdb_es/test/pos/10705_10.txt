The producer, Matt Mochary, stumbled upon the theme of the film, Anderson Sa (leader of the AfroReggae music movement), during a trip from the Hewlett Foundation to Rio de Janeiro. Sa's story moved Mochary so much that he called his friend Jim Zimbalist, a filmmaker from New York City, who quit his job and joined Mochary in Brazil to work on a documentary about Sa, the favelas of Rio and the culture of violence. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film shows the culture of violence in the favelas of Rio (neighborhoods where the poor live) through images of police raids and assaults on residents. The images are graphic and impressive. <br /> <br /> From the negativity of the favelas is the charismatic Anderson Sa, who overcame a possible career in drug trafficking to start the AfroReggae movement, which combines elements of Afro-Brazilian culture. Reggae, ska and other elements in an accelerated style of percussion music that has spread to other parts of the world. You can not help but get carried away by the music, especially when you see local kids get involved in Sa's school, which he founded to keep kids out of drug gangs. The rest of the film follows Sa's meteoric rise and her positivity changes many of the children's lives to seek a life beyond drug trafficking. SPOILER: Just when the filmmakers thought they had finished filming, there is an incredible life-changing event from which the resolution must be seen to be believed. Then, the movie continues and you get stuck in your seat until the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is a response to "City of God" and is worthy of that. The grim situation depicted in that film is countered by a real example of how favela residents can overcome the terrible situation they are in and use their resources for constructive purposes. You can not avoid that you do not like them and encourage Anderson Sa to be successful. <br /> <br /> This movie has an excellent shot, has an accelerated pace and is quite absorbing. Judging by the overwhelming response from the audience in the SilverDocs screening the night before, the film should have domestic distribution in the US. UU And the soundtrack should also be released. Look out for this superlative documentary, it's excellent!
