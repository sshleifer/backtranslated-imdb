I remember this old movie. It is a terrifying, scary and terrifying image of a man moving to a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange events in the corridors at night. And there are even strange events that take place in the most familiar hedge maze in Hollywood. Yes, this is the labyrinth you've seen in every feature film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including "The Shining." But the key phrase in this story is the last thing you can imagine. I certainly did not see it coming. This is a good example of how good and convincing a movie can be even when the premise is totally crazy, it borders on the ridiculous. I would recommend it to anyone.
