I just saw this, a short film by Harold Lloyd that featured his "glasses" character on the Kino Video DVD of "The Harold Lloyd Collection." Actually, he is a swindler with Snub Pollard as his partner, who is discovered by Bebe Daniels, who performs fake sessions. What he discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard cheat many customers by dropping fake rings that are "lost." I'll stop there and say this was pretty fun, especially when Harold and Snub enter the place where Bebe works and they find some spooky gadgets and put on costumes like Snub trying on one of Bebe's outfits. Not too much slapstick but what is there was also quite fun. So on that note, I recommend Are dishonest thieves?
