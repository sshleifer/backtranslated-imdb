I was able to see "Anywhere But Here" last night as a free advance. I loved the movie! I was attracted by the realistic representation of a mother / daughter relationship ... there was definitely a connection between Adele and Ann. I think he talks a lot about the outstanding performances of both Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Sarandon was the right actress to play Adele and, after leaving the theater, she could not think of another actress in the role. Portman was also excellent as Ann. She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that I do not think any other teenage actress can. I think the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give credit to the expiration and nominate Sarandon and Portman for the Awards in the categories of "Actress" and "Actress of Cast." It would be a pity if they were overlooked.
