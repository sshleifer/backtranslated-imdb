I was part of the Space Odyssey cast, playing FIDO in the control of the mission. I just want to say that none of us, the actors, especially those in control of the mission who had to react to a green screen most of the time, had some idea of ​​how amazing it would be. I knew it would be good, if only because of the camaraderie and professionalism that the Impossible Pictures production team provided to everyone involved. but when we all saw it for the first time at the screening at Curzon Mayfair, well, on the one hand I felt very proud. I was so glad that none of us looked like we were on Star Trek. Joe Aherne, the screenwriter and director, is the most amazing man to work with. You almost get a good team and then simply trust them to freely do what they do best. I'm very lucky to have been part of this show. Who knew something so epic and complicated to understand would be so attractive to see. and my god is a beautiful universe out there.
