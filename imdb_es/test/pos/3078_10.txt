I love this movie! I know some people might say it was not a great movie, but I really do not agree. The comedy is the classic style of Mel Brooks and the actors were chosen superbly. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes and Dave Chappelle and the first impression they caused. Cary Elwes shines like Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood that matters to you. It has a great comic timing and the correct attitude for this type of movie. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first film and he did an excellent job as Achoo. All the characters were very well planned and they all added their little quirks to the film. I recommend you rent this movie and enjoy it with a good bowl of popcorn and some close friends!
