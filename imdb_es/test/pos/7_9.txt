Our family (and all the sneak preview audience sold) enjoyed "The Guardian". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave compelling interpretations such as the fictional rescue characters of helicopters, Ben and Jake swimmers. After watching this movie, you can not help but imagine how hard it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmers school and someday participate in real rescues. <br /> <br /> Although this is a fictional film, it offered quite convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and courage exhibited by all members of the United States Coast Guard. <br /> <br /> The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible. You really felt like you were participating in a real rescue. <br /> <br /> I feel that the movie could have been made without the "Hollywood" bar scene (when you see the movie, you can agree) from the truth. The Coast Guard does not approve of such behavior. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, very action packed, definitely worth seeing. Thank you, the United States Coast Guard and the REAL helicopter rescue swimmers, "So that others may live." I recommend this movie to everyone.
