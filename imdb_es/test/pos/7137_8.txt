Based on a true story . . . <br /> <br /> The premise of this film is to illustrate that, through fairly normal events, it is possible for a "decent" mother to be attracted to heroin addiction. <br /> <br /> *** semi spoiler *** Some of the scenes are quite inaccurate, while others almost make you want to 'fix'. <br /> <br /> The computational technique / graphic artist with a good relationship with his young adolescent son becomes entangled in an addicted colleague after work, which is a 'chipper' (- someone who can take it + enjoy it from time to time). when-). Then it becomes an addiction that eventually leads to take out the 'street' dealers after losing contact with their stable distributor. <br /> <br /> The scenes that show you are going down and "falling sick" are often VERY real, especially the first real "night sweat". Before all these events, began a relationship with a guy who just lost. his wife to the bottle, and insists that he has an internal radar so as not to get caught up with such women. Some radars! However, after some late turns and strange behavior, the boyfriend challenges her to "what is happening". His radar begins to have more with that and demands that she empty her bag; she hits the roof and runs away. <br /> <br /> Due to the excellent and open relationship he had developed before this tragedy, he is the first to "find" some real evidence in his purse; He then looks around the hose for his "stash" - apparently, his sensitivity comes from the school's lessons about drug use - and when he discovers a large stash in the bathroom, he cleans it. IT IS NOT A HAPPY WOMAN when she takes her next bath and is 'disappeared'. <br /> <br /> The girl holds it and places it on the food table. Then, continue with the denial. He admits it and says no. worse than the drug. <br /> <br /> The child does all the right things and calls her friends and usually puts her in a position where she has to be 'clean', if she forgives the play on words. <br /> <br /> The film takes the viewer through some rather difficult situations in which the danger is not far away. <br /> <br /> Successfully, he receives help from a professional organization and makes cold turkey. You will have to see the movie to see what happens next. . . .
