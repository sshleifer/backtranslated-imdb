Can you capture the moment? When do you hear rain on a roof for the first time? Some things are beyond the sum of their parts, expressing the poetry of life. The things that matter. <br /> <br /> The poet Dylan Thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible "A good poem helps ... extend the knowledge of everyone, of himself and the world around him." (Bob Dylan named himself for him). So why has it taken so long to make a movie of the great Dylan Thomas? A simple biopic could have lost the point. The writer Sharman Macdonald has adopted a different and better approach. <br /> <br /> In The Edge of Love, she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill poems so we can swim in them. The life of four friends. Dylan, who covets and loves to the fullest. Wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller), your firm support. The war hero William (Cillian Murphy), who saves him from a street fight. And then there's his girlfriend from childhood. Vera Querida Vera Take your breath away, Vera. She is Caitlin's closest friend. William's wife And, like a muse, the 'star' in Dylan's dark sky. <br /> <br /> It all starts at the London Blitz of 1940, with bomb shelters in the subway. Enter Vera (an impressive Keira Knightley) under improvised stage lights. She meets Dylan for the first time in years, her heart is flushed. His eyes shine through the smoke of the room. The purity of his old passion. Dylan (native Welsh speaker, Matthew Rhys) is not a sanctified and sanitized poet. Master of your vices, you must fully experience them all. He introduces his beloved wife and then continues courting Vera. <br /> <br /> The Edge of Love is a visual gift. The soundtrack leaves you wanting more. The performances are possibly the best of these actors in their careers. As an exuberant love story it is quite good. As a vision of Dylan Thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives, it is not bad. And as a tribute to a great man, inspiring. <br /> <br /> The production has strived to project the spirit of Dylan Thomas without compromising too much historical accuracy. Dramatic tension implies a tug between artistic freedom and conventional morality. Audiences seeking an experience based on the latter may be disappointed. And it will not be good for audiences whose boundaries are those of Albert Square. <br /> <br /> Sharman Macdonald seemed aware of the stubborn nature of artistic freedom and its limits when he spoke with the producer Rebekah Gilbertson (granddaughter of the real William and Vera). "Think of all the things you do not want me to write about," he said, "because I have to have carte blanche." For Macdonald, the limits were whether she should offend Dylan's memory. But for many artists, especially men, the limits are those that the wife and the family could impose on them. A woman is not going to let high ideals interfere with the practical problems of common sense, and even put the interests of her children above her own (this happens sometimes the other way around, like when Virginia Woolf, an imposing genius, refused to allow the loving Leonard to take her to reality). Earth - in Hours). <br /> <br /> Despite the tension between Caitlin and Vera, these two women become close friends. It is one of the main (and very beautiful) themes of the film. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film tell a story in themselves. In a gray era, Britain, Caitlin and Vera are vivid reflections in an ocean of grays. Shortly after meeting the person from the illuminated stage of Vera, we met Caitlin through her fiery blue eyes, shining in a dark railway car. His spectacular red coat crosses streets of colorless homogeneity, triumphing in a beautiful stairway when meeting with Dylan. But the red shine of Vera's lipstick is less durable. For her, marriage is the second best, even when she has possessed a genuine love for her husband. <br /> <br /> Exceptional cinematography extends to the use of montages to juxtapose images, in a manner similar to the juxtaposition of poetry of unrelated words to create greater meaning. The horrible war scenes in Thessaly are interspersed with Vera's cries in pregnancy. Is it giving birth or is it an abortion? We are not told immediately. Pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our days. <br /> <br /> The constant echoes of Dylan's poetry throughout the film take us beyond the earthly opposites. It reminds me of Marlon Brando reading TS Eliot in Apocalypse Now. A light beyond the horrors of the world. A different way of seeing things. "I'll take you back to a time when no bomb fell from the sky and nobody died," Dylan tells Vera as they walk along the beach. Elsewhere, Caitlin recalls childhood with Vera: "We are still innocent in Dylan," he says. <br /> <br /> There is a time to leave your panties at home or share a universal cigarette. (Not literally, maybe.) A time to be inspired. Enjoy what is possibly the best British movie of the year.
