This has become one of my favorite movies and, undoubtedly, one of the best western movies I've seen. Having a weakness for gender (westerns are "or were, since they are not done very often", moral moves that have often been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions), I bought the DVD, at first glance, because I had I read enough about the work of William S. Hart (much of which he wrote and directed) to pique my interest and I thought I should have at least one of his films in my video collection. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I approached the real vision with a little fear. My previous experiences with the "classics" of silent movies had left me feeling disappointed. The Phantom of the Chaney Opera, the Birth of a Nation of Griffith and The Mark of the Fox of Fairbanks were fine, but not as good as their reputation would lead one to expect. They were too long, too theatrical, or both. <br /> <br /> However, the Toll Gate emerged as a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> It is a story told in a simple and direct way. Black Deering (played by Hart), leader of a notoriously successful gang, believes that the time has come for the group to dissolve, before the end of luck. However, he opposes his main lieutenant, Jordan, who incites everyone to a final robbery by promising them great riches, but leads them into a trap in which he is an accomplice. All are killed, except Deering, who is taken prisoner. When his captors recognize him as the man who once saved several soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an impending Indian attack, they allow him to escape. Free, try to find an honest job, but it is rejected and ridiculed and, ultimately, you must steal again to survive. Soon, he is persecuted not only by the sheriff's gang but also by Jordan (now thriving with the reward money he has raised) and his henchmen. His flight takes him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mother and her young son. After some initial doubts, they take it to their hearts. Deering sees an opportunity for a new life but, with the gang and Jordan approaching, he realizes that this may not be possible. <br /> <br /> Hart was the first great star of the West and the first to inject realism into the genre. As one of the pioneers of filmmaking, he created many of the characters and situations that have become a cliché in Westerns for more than ninety years. However, what makes his films interesting is his ability to go beyond the cliché (perhaps his imitators were not far enough) to make the material look fresh and innovative, even now. Three of these cases in The Toll Gate illustrate this: <br /> <br /> 1) In one scene, your character shoots a crowd in an attempt to kill Jordan, and instead kills a bystander. A close-up of the back shows that he is clearly frustrated. However, the frustration is not due to the fact that he has shot dead a man who until now had not caused him any harm, but had not fulfilled his goal. <br /> <br /> 2) In another, while running away from the gang, his "borrowed" horse enters a Gopher hole and breaks a leg. Hart pulls out his gun to get the animal out of its misery but, before pulling the trigger, gives his head a sad and loving pat, as if to say goodbye to an old friend. <br /> <br /> 3) And finally, after he has strangled Jordan and thrown his body off a cliff, he returns to retrieve his weapons and sees his adversary's gun on the ground nearby. Take a step forward and give him a quick kick before riding his horse. It is a simple gesture, but it underlines the deep hatred he feels for the man who betrayed him and his companions. <br /> <br /> And I love the title, The Toll Gate. It is allegorical in its implication that a man can not start a new life until he has paid for the sins of his former. The payment of Deering comes in the form of sacrifice. Today's more sophisticated audiences may not trust that feeling completely, but they can still do so if you allow it. <br /> <br /> Viewers who like their videos in perfect condition will no doubt oppose the quality of the DVD image, especially the very spoiled final reel. I do not care at all. That there is a copy of this 1920 film is a miracle, since copies of so many other silent films have been lost. If you take it into account and consider the film as a piece of the story, its visual flaws are not so hard to accept. <br /> <br /> William S. Hart was born in 1870 in New York, but grew up in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian sign language. He told Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and collected paintings by Remington, so his knowledge of the West was first hand. If your vision seems too romantic by today's standards, it is rooted much closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s and the revisionist works that followed. Both the star and his films are behind in his re-evaluation.
