It is a pity that an important film like this is virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> I do not think Alan Bates has made a better movie than this one. <br /> <br /> It has never been seen on television. . The only time I can remember that was shown on British television was in the summer of 1998. I have recorded it, but unfortunately the quality is not excellent due to an unreliable antenna at that time ... <br /> <br / > I remember that I wanted to see this movie for a while before it appeared on television. It was shown on Channel 4 early in the morning, which ensured that it remained unseen, except for a very small audience. <br /> <br /> I was living in Bristol at that time and it was ironic that, when I finally saw the movie, I realized that I had walked past the VERY house in which it was filmed several times before. The film treads a thin line; a married couple who try to make light of their tragic situation of dealing with their daughter with severe mental disability by laughing at it and even involving the child in their jokes. <br /> <br /> The direction and the acting are so excellent that the film is always compassionate and moving, and never runs the risk of falling into bad taste. <br /> <br /> A couple of years ago I saw a video of the theatrical production filmed with Eddie Izzard in the role of Bri and Victoria Hamilton. playing Sheila. <br /> <br /> He showed Izzard improvising and stalking and Hamilton, jokingly, tells the audience to ignore him when he is like that. <br /> <br /> Maybe I take it out of context while I do it. I only saw a brief clip, but when reading the play and watching the movie, this is clearly such a sensitive subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Izzard was praised for his performance, but I felt uncomfortable with what I saw. <br /> <br /> It may be surprising that such a successful work failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best British films of the 70s and I hope it will be published on DVD someday.
