A great cast gathered for this remake that unfortunately was a box office failure despite a great soundtrack. I can not say that it was a fascinating entertainment, or a cure for insomnia. However, I enjoyed the movie, it gave me the escape I had after an afternoon. A good look for those who seek the ideal life, even if it is a fantasy. Expect some corny moments, few emotions and an occasional laugh.
