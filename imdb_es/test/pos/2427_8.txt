What I find remarkable about this excellent movie, is that Altman, the crazy and wild that is, took the novel The Day of Cold in the park and the character of Sandy Dennis was originally a man in the book. He was a mentally beaten isolated gay who looked out the window of his apartment when he saw the scammer. It's strange that Altman fans do not realize how smart it was to change the sex of the main character; thus avoiding the homo erotic taboos of gay life in the 60s and making Dennis' reclusive madness work even better in transposition. If you watch the movie again, it will be obvious how clever Altman's mind works ...
