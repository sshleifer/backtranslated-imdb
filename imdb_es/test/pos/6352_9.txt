Excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that really had some teeth without feeling desperate or worse, manipulative and artificially rewarding. It could also be a good double feature with American Beauty. The best performance to date I've seen of Anita Mui, and every actor in this looks like a powerhouse. Congratulations to Ann Hui for the direction and Ivy Ho for the brilliant script. Seriously, one of the best dramas I've seen in a long time, especially if you like classical literature, ALA poetry. Again, excellent.
