Sharpe's Honor for the Uninitiated is the fifth entry in a series of television films focusing on an English army shooter during the Napoleonic Wars and based on Bernard Cornwell's books (which I highly recommend reading). However, if you started observing this particular one, you would have the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the centrifugal force on which the rest of the army revolves. If that were the case, I would recommend starting with earlier chapters like Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a good option for a second visit. <br /> <br /> The story this time is all about the espionage side of things. With the French army retreating in disarray from Spain, Commander Ducos, the viscous espionage master sees an opportunity to change the situation. By attributing the assassination of a Spanish marquis to Richard Sharpe, hero of the British army, the fragile British / Spanish alliance will begin to fall apart and things will change again. However, when the Spanish nobles flock to Wellington crying for Sharpe's blood, the English general is not willing to hang his best soldier, so he feigns his death and soon goes on a secret mission behind the enemy lines to discover who raised the plot. Surprisingly, also for a Sharpe movie, there is a gorgeous woman to rescue along the way, of course. <br /> <br /> What this results, of course, is a more adventurous style approach. The concentration is less in the operation of the English army with Sharpe as the main figure and concentrates more on his escapes in the field, dodging French patrols, hobbing with the Spanish guerrillas and participating in daring escapes of fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper, his loyal right hand accompanies him naturally, but the rest of the riflemen remain in the camp without knowing that their leader is still alive. However, oddly enough, they receive more attention than usual, as they end up in their own secondary plot that includes the delivery of Harper's baby. <br /> <br /> This slightly different approach creates an intriguing episode, but it's only a good thing in the long run And if someone worries that there will not be a standard battle at the climax, do not worry, because once again the poor old Frenchmen receive a correct kick. Also, Ducos is a fantastic successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad boy you love to hate. It is a duplicate, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and also strangely reminiscent of that black guy from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out prominently when he has the opportunity to have more time on screen and appears as the kind of man who would like to give birth to his first child, even if he looks like an Iron Maiden member who was catapulted backwards in time by accident. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe is still as heroic as ever, but much more bitter and angry this time, given the events of the previous film. It is not the best introduction if you have not seen any of the other chapters, but it shows Sharpe a side we are not normally witnessing: the hero of action instead of the professional soldier. And if that's not enough for you to be tempted, it's also worth looking at just for the somewhat surrealistic vision of an enraged Sean Bean swinging a live chicken into a group of nuns.
