PRICE OF HONOR, also known as PRICE OF POWER, is an ambitious Western melodrama, based on action, that seeks to tell a version of the Old West of the JFK assassination. In 1881, the president travels to Dallas and is shot from a window as he parades through the city in his carriage. Corrupt officials have carried out the murder and have a humble slave who takes rap. Our hero, the serious but insipid Giuliano Gemma, intends to unravel the conspiracy. An attractive story, bold for its theme, but entertaining despite the lack of shooting action. The film is 7 out of 10, despite the poor presentation of the DVD, which is too dark with poor sound. Look for a good copy.
