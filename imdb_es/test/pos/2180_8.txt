FIVE STAR FINAL was one of the best films of the early thirties. It was starring Edward G. Robinson and it was a very rough story about a poor quality newspaper and its willingness to do anything ... ANYTHING to sell newspapers. In particular, an old story of an innocent woman is stuck in the pages and helps to destroy her happy life now, many years after having been inadvertently involved in a scandal. The reason why I liked the movie so much was that it did not work and did not make any effort, showing how low editors could be to sell items. <br /> <br /> Here, in DOS AGAINST THE WORLD, is a remake of the five-star final - with some changes. Instead of Robinson, this film stars Humphrey Bogart and he is the head of programming at a radio station, not a newspaper. Otherwise, the story is essentially the same, except that it is a little less daring and lacks the sharpness and sensationalism of the original. This does not mean that the movie is bad, it just does not have as much impact as the first movie. In other words, if you must see one of these movies, see the first, although this movie is quite powerful and enjoyable as well. As for me, I loved the story, I saw both films and I enjoyed both. <br /> <br /> TWO AGAINST THE WORLD begins with the owner of the UBC radio complaining to his chief of programming (Bogart) that all the "high eyebrows" shows that he has been getting low marks. The owner demands muck, a lot of muck to get more listeners. One of the ways in which they argue is to perform a dramatization in several parts of a famous murder that happened two decades ago, even though the murderer was acquitted and she only killed in self-defense. However, they decide to play the story as if she were guilty and even go so far as to send a writer to the lady's house, pretending to be a minister (!), As well as to transmit her current name and whereabouts. Needless to say, this ruins the woman and leads to a horrible tragedy. Then, and only then, Bogart feels a real remorse for producing so much garbage, which leads to an excellent end to journalistic integrity and decency. <br /> <br /> Well interpreted, a great idea of ​​history and a message that is as important today as it was in the 1930s, this is a story that must be seen. In particular, observe the wonderful and very emotional scene of confrontation where the daughter attacks the owner and Bogart, is a great example of how to act and write.
