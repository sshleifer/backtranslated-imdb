I have to admit that I have a special predilection for the humor and storytelling style of British films, although not all of them, of course, are successful. <br /> <br /> This movie made me think and left me at the end with a quiet smile on my face. It is about the development of the character and relationships, the truth and the lie, and if love sometimes simply is not enough. Some actors very pleasantly underestimated, especially the two leaders, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of fuss over Gosford Park, but with this piece I feel that Fellowes actually produced a better movie, although it has not been a major release. <br /> <br /> A mature and intelligent story about real people who undoubtedly have shortcomings, but who are also capable of performing acts of genuine grace.
