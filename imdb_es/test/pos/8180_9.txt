Another piece of the era for Chen Kiage ... (I can not remember making a modern movie!) ... <br /> <br /> Good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises. None of the fight scenes of HK, or the kind of Hollywood heroes, but it's good for that. The characters are strong, I really felt it for them. <br /> <br /> Understanding mandarin definitely gives English subtitles the advantage. The movie is 3 hours, but it did not feel like that.
