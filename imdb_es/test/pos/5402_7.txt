so. I was completely in love with this movie. Gaga why, even with all the twists of his plot ... but the only thing that seemed really disturbing was the connection between the two best friends of Tim and Kyle. While the writer of the film gave us such a moving moment between the two, and his experimentation / sexual confusion, he gave us a twist of the plot that makes them half brothers?!?! (Although the subject was not mentioned in the film ... and left unexplained and unexplained), I simply thought it was in poor taste, and the fact that it was not even discussed is even worse. (Oops, we have created a taboo ... now we do not address the situation, because it really would not be the CP). Otherwise, it would be a spectacular movie.
