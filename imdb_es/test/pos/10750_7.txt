This movie would be considered controversial today, but it's still very funny. Racial stereotypes are made from the point of view of humor and not hate. This film gets naked and shows how corrupt politicians were already in the 1930s. This movie shows that it started before the 1970s and later when it accelerated in the United States. Lloyd is still in his typical genre here, even though his character was raised in China. <br /> <br /> The meaning of the leg of a cat in this case is a person who is running for a political office, but is being used by the established political machinery to advance their agenda. In other words, they think that this guy (Lloyd) is harmless when he is running for office. Then, when he is chosen, he surprises them. <br /> <br /> This same theme is used later in the James Stewarts movie, Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Stewarts is more famous and has a stronger message. This film is more intelligent and subtle than the commercial brands of Harold Lloyds. <br /> <br /> There is still the heart of romantic comedy hidden in the fa√ßade of the film, but the public today would still appreciate political humor and the end is priceless. I wish someone could beat today's political system in this way. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie and I found myself wishing that Harold had done something like this during the thirties. <br /> <br /> At least we have this one. I think the person that is most mentioned in the movie is the fiction. I always thought that Confusicus was the wise one, but this makes me believe that the wisdom of China was not limited to him and it is a vast comedy field that Lloyd extracted in this film.
