In the 1980s, patriotism and, in some cases, jingoism, was quite high. "Can we win this time?", A famous Rambo line: First Blood Part II, could almost summarize how many people felt at that moment. A longing for the style of movies they grew up with, throwing balls at the wall "we're fine, your bad ... now let's fly something, and we go home" While Rambo, Rocky, and for the most part Top The gun she seemed more prepared to attract a larger crowd. Iron Eagle went directly to the children. Canadian writer and director Sidney J. Furie brings to light all that you love and hate from that period of time. The kick in the pants shakes the anthems of the 80s (never say die, Road of the Gypsy, etc.) to the top, and, sometimes, an almost incredible action adventure. Iron Eagle was successful for a reason ... it was F.U.N - Fun. It's the kind of movie you can turn on, sit down and enjoy every ridiculous 80s moment. You do not have to think if it really could happen, or if the acting is really credible, it's just fun ... and that's all you can ask in this kind of movie ...
