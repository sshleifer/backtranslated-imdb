I have read about 10 reviews of this movie, but I have not taken any of them "seriously". Harrison Ford is being criticized for everything from his haircut to his earring, and I really do not see what any of these things have to do with the movie. As I recall, I had bad hair and bad reviews in Blade Runner, but it is still a favorite among the videophiles. It is slower than most of his previous films, but it is not worthy of the garbage he has received. <br /> <br /> I would gladly pay $ 7.50 just to see a bald Harrison Ford mow his lawn.
