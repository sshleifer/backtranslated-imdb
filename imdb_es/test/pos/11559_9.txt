I'd like to know if anyone knows how I can get a copy of the movie "That's the way of the world." I've been watching this movie for about 30 years, and I'd like to see it again. Earth Wind & Fire transcends the nation worldwide with its music and inspiring themes. It was unfortunate that this group did not take off like its counterparts in the early 70s, but as stated earlier, there was a racial tension in the United States that prohibited equal exposure for African-American musical groups. It's good to see that Earth Wind & Fire continues its success. I would like to add this movie to my collection. Someone please help me if possible. Thanks for your attention. Milton Shaw
