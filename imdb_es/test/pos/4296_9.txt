Well, what's wrong with the title "Separate Lies" (accused elsewhere of not being "exciting"). It is clever, subtle and a little poetic. (Of course, there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi movie called "Separate Lives," which are mentioned here.) <br /> <br /> But the real point is the ethical dilemma of telling lies at different levels than the film probes. Okay, it's not a hilarious title "in your face", but then it's not a hilarious movie in your face. Please, give British films like this one an opportunity. They try to make people think of important things, like here: how far does it go to protect their life (even if it's a bit rotten) against an unexpected disaster? Maybe you tell lies. Maybe you ignore the lies of your loved ones. That can wear down a lot of people. <br /> <br /> American films on this subject are plentiful, but they usually go much further by involving the use of firearms, which are not part of everyday life in Europe. <br /> <br /> We may not be so "exciting" here, but we do not expect movie titles similar to slogans for films that are not aimed at a mass audience.
