The cinema of the sixties was as much a time of revolution as politics and music. The filmmakers dared to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects that were only allowed before in exploitation films. Beginning with the American cinema "Sin Aliento" and underground underground (like Kenneth Anger), the films became increasingly experimental. All this was accumulated when Hollywood realized that they had a massive commercial appeal with "Easy Rider". One of the best (and most surprising) results of this era was also one of the least successful initially. "Head" was made when the career of The Monkees was in serious decline, which is what condemns one of the best psychedelic films ever made. <br /> <br /> The argument? Well, there really is not one, as many have said. It's about The Monkees going from one surrealist stage to the next. However, all these sequences are obviously tinged with LSD and basically make fun of how the Monkees were fed up with being confined to their slight reputation for prefabrication. It is a pity that the film has not found public. The teenagers who loved them had moved into a new fashion as they always do. The psychedelic crowd / Haight-Ashbury who was granted the film would never be caught in a Monkees movie. It is all your loss. This film may be a lesser argument, but it is certainly not meaningless and very intelligently united. The team later made "Easy Rider" and "Five Easy Pieces." The film was later revived in a retrospective of Raybert in 1973 and obtained a very positive response, which gave it the cult it had deserved for a long time. Ironically, the Monkees would be victims of the same commercialism that protested in this film with their subsequent meeting of the 80s. (10/10)
