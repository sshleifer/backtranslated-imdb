I really enjoy this movie. I was nervous without being a sociopath. Vin Diesel gave life to the character of Riddick and made you feel good and bad with him on different levels. <br /> <br /> I also saw Iron Giant and Vin is perfect. (The snowmobile movie, oh yes, it's called "Triple-X" or "xXx", was a weak example of his work). In Pitch Black he plays an antihero to the fullest. I do not think you can be wrong when Vin stars in a movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood could typify him as a movie star of adventures and adventures. Wrong! I think the "XXX" script was weak so Vin could not act. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Pitch Black is a great scifi, look at it! <br /> <br /> Zafoid
