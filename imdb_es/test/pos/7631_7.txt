I have read a couple of reviews of this movie, which has recently been released on DVD by Eclectic. Apparently, the initial titles are in mailbox format, but the rest (most) is in full screen. The first release, in 1982 by Planet Video, is completely mailbox. Although it was a primitive release, he got the right compositions. The later releases had a sharper and better image quality, but were in full screen as is the DVD. Any release of this movie must be in a mailbox, as it significantly increases the visual experience of the old Planet tape.
