The film Classe tous risques directed by Claude Sautet was not a film, to be honest, I had heard until the Film Forum in New York said they would have a 2-week screening of the film, with new English subtitles. When I also read that I was in the vein of the classic French films about the crime of Jean Pierre Melville, I took the opportunity to prove it (in the best of cases, it would be up to their great works, and at worst, I would get something good). popcorn in a large theater). It was worth the admission, since Classe tous risques is one of those types of French films that are waiting to be rediscovered (or discovered for the first time). With a tremendous and tense diligence, Sautet maintains the suspense in a tight tone during the first forty minutes of the film, maintaining a good (though not excellent) central section, and then ends with what is always expected with these films, but with Fascinating motivations through the characters. With a movie in the vein of this type, you know how it will end, but what counts is the fresh and observant journey. <br /> <br /> The film presents a performance with a certain truth and honesty, in the middle of "The old school criminal code, of Lino Ventura as Aldo, who at the beginning of the film (one of the best beginnings of a film in this genre and country) steals a large amount of money with his partner in crime.) When there is a sudden and ugly turn of fate on a beach late at night, Aldo flee again with two small children He gets the help of Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo, a role in harmony with Le Doulos only with a little more humanity and charisma), who is also a thief and takes him to Paris, but there are some problems with some of the Aldo's old business partners, and an old score may be the right ticket.A couple of times the plot may seem leisurely, but it is not.As Melville, Sautet does not allow anything fat in its history, and it is a very structured, with some good doses of humor here and there (sometimes I was smiling at the audacity of criminals in the chase sequence at the beginning, and with a particular woman who had a delicate thing with her cat and a fish). <br /> <br /> Along with a great score from the great George Delerue, exceptional cinematography and a mood that is rarely found, let alone match now. To this day, Classe tous risques is a reminder of that bridge between the real old school cinema and the crime movies of the last days. The gangsters in this new kind of "thug life" movies have a 1000 of the class and the honor of the thieves in this movie, and it's a second banana for the works of Melville and Jules Dassin (a compliment, I assure you ). Having a good realistic moral touch, it also helps.
