Ghoulies 4 is a pretty macabre sequel. The ghoulies look very different from the first three ghoulies, but they are still fresh. There are some nice flash backs, from Ghoulies the first movie. Jonathan is back once again in this. Although it was not in parts 2 or 3. The movie is low budget at times, but it's fun to watch. You have Tony Cox as Dark Ghoulie and Arturo Gil as Light Ghoulie. The ghoulies in this movie are really good, instead of evil as in the first three movies. Both Ghoulies are very funny characters in the movie. Then you have the hot Alexandra! It's a great dark and funny comedy! Any fan of the ghoulies movies will enjoy watching Ghoulies 4. The DVD will finally be released this July 2007! Hopefully one day Ghoulies III will be on DVD in the United States. I would really like to see a sequel to this movie one day too. Although I doubt it will happen. It's 2007 now and there's no trace of a sequel yet. If there is ever a sequel, I hope Jim Wynorski will achieve it. <br /> <br /> I give Ghoulies IV a 9/10
