Dolemite is a blaxploitation movie about, well, Dolemite and her army of killer kung fu women, directed by Queen Bee. He struggles to reclaim his club, The Total Experience, from Willie Green using his kung fu skills and devotion to him. I liked this movie because of the ingenious dialogue and also the use of Rudy Ray Moore's ability to preach to his brothers in rhyme.
