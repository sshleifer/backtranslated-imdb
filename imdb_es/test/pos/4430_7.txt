I rented this movie because it was a documentary and highly qualified. It is more a study of a bastard son who tries to find out who his biological father was, that nothing about architecture. <br /> <br /> More than anything, the underlying theme of the film is that we have an eccentric, highly praised theme, possibly a genius architect who had little regard for something or someone outside the profession is. <br /> <br /> The tragedy of the movie is the broken families he left behind. Their baby mothers presented themselves more as despised admirers than irresponsible women, which can only have negative results for children. <br /> <br /> That said, Nathaniel, the film's producer and son of Louis Khan, realized As quite stable and curious, if not bitter. The people who interviewed were, of course, more interested in talking about Louis Khan's buildings than in their personal problems, but I think the mix of themes made the film interesting. <br /> <br /> As for their buildings, I found them abstract. Art: strange, impractical, and generally only appreciated by so-called critics.
