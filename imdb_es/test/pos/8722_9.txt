What an absolutely lovely movie. The cast is wonderful, and the story is witty and fun. A pleasant cinematographic experience. Although the plot is somewhat predictable, it does not make the story less pleasurable, in fact I did not want it to end. I have always been an admirer of Ingrid Bergman, and I was interested in seeing her in a comic role. I was not disappointed, it's fun to watch Ingrid Bergman's performance as Dickinson. I loved his interaction with Toni at the music store, as well as his dancing and doing "the dentist". She only showed what she already knew, that she is one of the best actresses of all time. Goldie Hawn is also a delight to watch. His fun, kind and friendly Toni is the driving force of the film. You do not even question why she was so worried about her Finacee's wife, you just accept that she's just that kind of person who would not be happy unless she knew that everyone else was happy too. And Walter Matthau is as good as Julian. Their actions never create a sense of animosity for the viewer, in fact, they almost make it more lasting. There was not an unpleasant character in the group. This film has definitely stood the test of time, I saw it last night and I think it's one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in my life. If you are looking for a fun, cheerful and romantic comedy, look no further.
