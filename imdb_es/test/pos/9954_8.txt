People have often been uncomfortable with "The Merchant of Venice," due to their anti-Semitic theme. Fortunately, this film avoids that, opting instead to show how anti-Semitism reigned in sixteenth-century Europe. The story, of course, is that Antonio (Jeremy Irons) needs money to help Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) to ask for the hand of Portia (Lynn Collins) in the marriage. He gets the money from the Jewish usurer Shylock (Al Pacino), who demands a pound of Antonio's meat if the latter does not return the loan. When Antonio can not pay the loan, Shylock is determined to get what he is owed. <br /> <br /> We hope this cast does a good job, and they do not disappoint. It is another testimony of what a great actor Al Pacino is.
