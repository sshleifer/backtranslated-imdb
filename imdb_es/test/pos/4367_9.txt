Turning Isherwood's somewhat dark and absolutely brilliant novel into a light comic game could easily have been a recipe for disaster, but somehow it was not. The story moves at an incredibly fast pace and the black and white images are magnificent, as are Harvey and Harris as they make their way through a mad Weimar Berlin. Funny!
