If you want to see a little horror comedy with a strange feeling, this is yours. If you're waiting for a film of blood and guts that will scare you, then it's not for you. <br /> <br /> For the budget in which this movie was filmed, the music was particularly incredible! Even though the film was shot on a tight budget, the music and audio were definitely better than most movies with a big budget! <br /> <br /> The story was really well done and the director is worthy of praise. There is an almost perfect mix of comedy for horror in this movie! The performance is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel that I'm definitely looking forward to! I have no doubt that this movie will become an instant cult classic. <br /> <br /> In short, this film tells the story of the life of a child who enters the race to become a grave robber. Tell the story in a flashback of each of the most fantastic experiences that the thief duo meets. Vampires to zombies and even extraterrestrials! Our stars start out as simple grave robbers who steal jewelry, but they quickly become body snatchers for a mad doctor (Angus Scrim) who needs bodies for his medical practice. When the duo find a way for a vampire to displace their cruel employer, grave robbers discover that the traffic in undead corpses is far more profitable than the simple theft of normal corpses. The only problem is that there is another gang called Murphy's house that competes for the same undead corpses, and that's where both gangs of assailants come face to face with terrible consequences. <br /> <br /> This movie is One of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies I've seen in years and it reminds me of Evil Dead. Do not miss it, you will regret it!
