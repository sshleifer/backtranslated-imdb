If this film is examined closely, it is a bit sad. It is detailed enough to address very real problems of children, who grow up in poor and dysfunctional environments. However, it retains its comedic value, with energetic performances by Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones. The sadness lies in the struggles and dysfunctions of the mother (Carroll), who can not really help their children, not because they do not want or try, but because it is obvious that they do not know how. Remember, this is a comedy, but if you've never seen this, or if you've seen it, watch this movie and see humanity, in the characters. Good movie.
