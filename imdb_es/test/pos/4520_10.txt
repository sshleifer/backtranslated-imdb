Recently I was lucky to see "The Kite Runner" in a small theater, surrounded by experienced people who knew how to enjoy a masterpiece of such sophistication. With all the controversy surrounding the central scene of this film these days, I expected a raw and violent piece. But the way Mr. Forster handled the sensitive issue was moving and truly moving. Although the credits of the film indicated that China was the main location for filming, he could have sworn that he was watching Kabul throughout the scenes that are destined to take place in Afghanistan. The performance, both of non-professionals and professional actors, is excellent and the casting is magnificent. So, this is a film that I would see again and again, because although it is undeniably sad in its subject, the masterful way in which it has been made awakens a new hope in modern cinema.
