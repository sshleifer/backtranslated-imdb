As a child I loved the song "Never smile at a crocodile", and if I found myself in this state of things, which is really inspired by real events. Smiling would be the last thing on my mind. Since the initial installation, I've never been so entrenched, trapped and finally exhausted as when I was watching this limited-budget independent Australian horror film, about three people in the Northern Territory trapped in a mangrove with a very intriguing crocodile waiting. in the water below them. What really made the film come to life was how realistic it was to convey the fear and uncertainty of the characters' situation to the audience. The semi-documentary camera work with a disturbingly disturbing background and authentic performances take him out of his comfort zone. What we get is a story of survival for the patient that only a bloody attack of creatures without limits. Think of "Open Water (2003)", where the budget and the time limitation ensured that it was kept discreet, but this minimal barrier improved the experience. <br /> <br /> The history of slow development could be black and white, but it never seemed to become disposable, nor to succumb to the formulated patterns. Well, not very much, and the connection between the characters was emotionally appealing even with a simple and direct script. Although you can say "less is more", the actions and expressions that illuminate persistent thoughts plague their minds. Calvary is absolutely terrifying, because the threat is very alive and never seems to loosen up. This is what drives the chaotic adrenaline of the film, and where it lasts (even when it stays buried) until the end. <br /> <br /> The economic orientation of the writers / directors Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich alienates and intelligently chains along the viewer with their psychological traits of tense and heartbreaking rhythm. In certain patches, the notch rises, with suspense induced by pressure and amazing images. The way in which the nighttime sequence is executed is immensely chilling and pulsating. The menacing crocodile manipulative toys with their fresh meat in an agonizing and disconcerting approach. Of course, some moments felt improbable, but they never get in the way or get distracted. FX sound is the key, and sometimes the lack of anything just corrodes you. The musical score of Rafeal May is simple and does not get much into the mix, but when it does, it creates an organic sound quality. The cinematography of John Biggins is very well designed and is quickly aggressive when the mood changes. It was always moving and claustrophobic, but none of these sudden movements. The editing was handled sharply, and the effects were attended professionally by an excellent hairstyle of images of live crocodiles. <br /> <br /> Something like this production would also have to rely on its cast to sell the story credibly and they do it. Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda and especially Maeve Dermody are persuasively good. Much of the responsibility falls on Dermody, and she strongly fulfills an inspired turn. Now, this article could make some comparisons with another killer crocodile movie "Rogue (2007)", but the two could not be different in what they want to be and how they end up. However, if I had to choose, I lean more towards this exit because of their great participation to attack you. <br /> <br /> A remarkable effort on all fronts, with all those involved that show the potential to be truly outstanding.
