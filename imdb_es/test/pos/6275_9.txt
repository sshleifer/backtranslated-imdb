Miles O'Keeffe once again assumes the role of the powerful Ator in this first sequel to the original film. <br /> <br /> What can I say? - This represents quite a B-Movie Nirvana! <br /> <br /> The plot is absurd, the script is terrible, the acting is silly, the special effects ... well, do not even go there! - In general, this movie is a real delight! <br /> <br /> The highlights of the film include Ator and Thong (his silent partner, not his underwear) being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave (no doubt kept in the fx budget there! ), Ator fighting against what must be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid, and of course, the infamous scene of hangliding! <br /> <br /> There is a question I have ... at the end of the film, we see a great atomic explosion when Ator supposedly destroys the Geometric Core (as the narrator tells us) ... How the hell did Ator destroy it? and managed to get out alive? Did you design some form of primitive timer / detonator or something like that? <br /> <br /> Well, such an illogical ending really only adds to the general charm of the movies, they do not do it that way anymore!
