This is a short Stooge in particular that actually uses satire along with the slapstick, a rarity. As mentioned, the title and concept of this short film were "borrowed" from a movie of the same year with Clark Gable called "Men In White". Basically it is about the trials and tribulations of the inmates and their sacred cause for "duty and humanity". I saw this recently and I almost treat it like the Stooge version because it takes a little too seriously. In any case, "Men In Black" is so well written, directed and without mentioning the original, that he borrowed nothing from Chaplin or any of the others, so the Motion Picture Academy nominated him for a prize as the best Short Comedy of 1934. A stinky short called "La Cucaracha" overcame him and stole the prize. The brother-in-law of some producer must have been on the electoral board of the Academy. "Men In Black" mocks the whole concept of the medical profession in the same way that Marx Bros. always did at this time. It may not be a fair comparison, but I can see the Marx Bros. in this short film. In fact, in his article "A Day in the Careers," there is a scene in which there are "medical things" that occur and cause anarchy as usual. I guess this particular short was judged in that sense and therefore why it was nominated in the first place. In fact, try this: see this short film first and then see "Duck soup" or "Day in the races" with the Marxs and then see if there is not the same great quality of comedy.
