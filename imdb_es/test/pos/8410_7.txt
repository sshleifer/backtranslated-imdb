<br /> <br /> It's general knowledge and it's been said before: nobody can play Scarlett and Rhett as Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer (who was no longer divorced from Kilmer by her ex-husband Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a repetition (God forbid!), She still can not live up to the occasion (that is, her voice sounds evil on several occasions, she has brown eyes [Scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green] and her vocal power was not up to the job either. Southern Belle, therefore, has an incredible talent for flirting (as she did in SCARLETT, the novel and GWTW, of course) and to be a great flirt like Scarlett is, you most likely need a sharper voice, like Vivien Leigh. <br /> <br /> I guess I'm comparing Kilmer too much with Leigh but when someone plays a role as masterfully as Leigh did with Scarlett, you just can not stop criticizing any new prospective Scarletts Timothy Dalton should not to have had no accent whatsoever, due to the fact that both Margaret Mitchell's Rhett and Gable in the film I have none. His performance has never been truly worth mentioning (except, perhaps his representation of evil, cheating King Philip of France in THE LION IN WINTER) and gives his Rhett very little (if any) freshness or vitality. <br /> <br /> Outstanding in the cast are the most notable Tina Kellagher (an actress born with great authenticity in her release) as the tragic victim Mary Boyle. And then, of course, Sean Bean is cold, calculating and not to mention, the devil almost diabolically Lord Fenton, the nemesis of Mary and the eventual rapist of Scarlett. One thing I could not forgive the writer was the fact that Scarlett was raped in this movie (a fact that never happened in the novel, Lord Fenton is cold and of bad reputation among the Irish in the book, but it is not so discourteous as its counterpart on the screen Another omission of the novel, but written for the film, is the character of Belle Watling, played more horribly by Ann-Margret in a cameo, that we all could have lived without him, since The book was such a bestseller without the need of any help from Mrs. Watling. <br /> <br /> For a film in itself, SCARLETT is very good, but not quite at such a high place in terms of being GONE WITH THE WINDs sequel Another actress was very necessary for both Scarlett and Rhett. <br /> <br />
