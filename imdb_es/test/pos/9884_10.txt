Take someone you love or want to love and go see this movie. <br /> <br /> It's your turn in all the right places. <br /> <br /> All the other critics here have said it all. <Br /> <br /> Maybe the cynic will not be impressed. <br /> <br /> It seems that they only like the things that leave you depressed for days. <br /> <br /> This movie is Ga- directed to stay with you for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> I am very pleased that the Director is not trained by USC. <br /> <br /> This validates my premise that there is too much mediocrity and conformity in the film these days. <br /> <br /> It is due to the mentality of the USC lock and inbreeding. <br /> <br /> Hurray for Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus, cast and crew. Well done!
