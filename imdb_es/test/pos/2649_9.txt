Dear readers, 2001: A space odyssey is the best thing about Kubrick ... although I can not really say that as Space Odyssey is the only movie I've seen. But still, it's a good movie. Strange, but good. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three acts, very similar to the novel ... which is not surprising since the author wrote the script. Anyway, first we start with the simple but spectacular opening with Also Sparach Zarathustra at full volume on the speakers. Then comes the boring sequence beyond the belief 'Dawn of Man'. Then there is the strange sequence of 'Finding of the Monolith' on the Moon, played on Strauss' Blue Danube. Finally, things become good with the spaceship scenes and HAL goes crazy and kills people. After that, things go off and we have the sequence 'Entering the Monolith' that was too long and the ultra-weird ending. Although, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a good movie. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator or The Abyss, but it's amazing. My compliments to the chef, Mr. Kubrick. <br /> <br /> Signed, the Constant DVD collector
