One of the threads of the IMDb message boards had two women talking about Colin Firth, how they saw the movie just for him. Obviously these were two young women; But what caught my attention is how little this audience has been appreciated by the general public. The brilliant performances, and I mean the brilliant ones by Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were barely noticed, not only by the audience, but by the Academy and by most of the critics. <br /> <br /> I think I know why. First, the plot, or really just the configuration, is a kind of bastardization of Shakespeare's King Lear with the dying and insane patriarch and the three intriguing daughters they will inherit. Their names even begin with the same letters, Regan, Goneril and Cordelia: Rose, Ginny and Caroline. And I guess "Larry" (Jason Robards) works for "Lear". The apparent idea imagined by Jane Smiley in her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was to tell a story similar to that of Lear from the point of view of the daughters, and to tell it as a realistic form of the late twentieth century that was not considered by the bard . The problem is that, in the story of Smiley and Moorhouse, the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses, while the father is the most despicable character without many qualities to redeem. His only strength was his ability to make a financial success of the farm; however, we can even rule that out since his father and his grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it. <br /> <br /> The second problem, and this is a problem that I can not personally confirm, having not read Smiley's novel. Is that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel. Even so, it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances, can not be faithfully transferred to the screen. The vision and audio demands of the film drown the subtleties of a narrative, while time constraints do not allow the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist. Given five or six hours, maybe Moorhouse could have made a movie more in line with Smiley's novel. <br /> <br /> A third problem is perhaps that of Moorhouse. She began her career as a director with the very good Australian film Proof (1991) starring Russell Crowe. He followed with How to Make an American Quilt (1995) that celebrated women, especially women of a certain age. However, it was a bit clumsy and clear and decidedly a movie for girls. In a sense, A Thousand Acres takes off from there, showing us not only the point of view of women, but it does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some. Larry Cook is clearly an evil, bad daddy. He beat his daughters and had carnal knowledge of them. He ran the house with an iron fist. Jess (the character of Colin Firth) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a little fun. And then she turns to Rose, who is clearly going to be the power behind the new property, and hooks up with her, while prompting her husband to end his life in a drunken accident. The rest of the men are unidimensional characters without nuances, as they usually appear in romantic novels. I think that most audiences were discouraged by incest, adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into history. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, I think the critics and the public are wrong. I think the management was biased against men, but in this story it had to be. I think Moorhouse did a good job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were not too nice. And the performance of Pfeiffer and Lange was sensational. They seemed to feed on each other in a way that seemed absolutely authentic and profoundly moving. In particular, Pfeiffer was fascinated while projecting her hunched anger and hatred. The way Moorhouse allowed her character to reveal herself gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director, as well as Pfeiffer's outstanding performance. And the ability with which Moorhouse guided the change in Ginny's character from "ninny," as she called herself, to someone with self-awareness and some understandable bitterness, was also excellent. The fact that she left her husband was as embarrassed as anything else. I needed to go find her and forgive her and bring her back. And Robards in his intensity and madness was also very good. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie, which was bombed in theaters, will be better appreciated in the coming years as people see it on DVD. My question is, what happened to Moorhouse? His talent is obvious, but he has not yet directed his fourth feature film. When he does, I hope he remembers what he believes, but also to be fair. I think that, in fact, he was fair to the two main characters in this movie, but he did not pay enough attention to the others. In addition to the uneducated father, Caroline, of Jennifer Jason Leigh, was not finished, which makes us wonder why she did some of the things she did. And husbands had to be something more than mannequins. They needed to be committed and involved.
