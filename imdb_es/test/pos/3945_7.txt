Another round with the king of the monkeys going west ... more or less. <br /> <br /> Starting in the middle of some action, the movie only goes from the first frame onwards. <br /> <br /> Monk and his three disciples go to a city to obtain the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and speak to the world. But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all the children of the city. The force of evil wants the monk because if you eat it, you will live forever. The retainers fight against the forces of darkness before forcibly expelling the monk for security (the monk believes that he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys). The monk ends up with a group of lizard imps that plan to eat him at some point ... however, the bad guys arrive and he is out of odyssey with the ugliest of all. <br /> <br /> Can a movie start? Out of the rails leave the rails? Do not misunderstand. I really liked this movie, but it's so scattered and everywhere, the plot and the logic just disappear, since some scenes simply focus on the middle action without knowing how we got there (the final battle to rescue the disciples is completely outside the left field). This is one of the most messy movies I've seen in a long time, but it made me laugh and smile as if I had not left. The movie starts and you have no idea where things are and, then, what appears on the screen is interesting or funny and you just keep going with that. How can we get from one thing to another often overcomes me? It is full of strange appearances and strange references as we pass from heaven to the ocean, to space, to the rib cage of some mythical beast, to God knows where. This film floats all over the place, which helps to keep it fun, since you do not know where it will end (and that's the reason why "I keep the details to a minimum) and it's fun, a lot of fun sometimes. <br /> < br /> And the action is very good, even if a good part of it is a brazen CGI animation (which provides some great images, the golden staff, the spider attack formation, the flying angel ...) And it's Very aside from action and comedy, this is actually a wonderful love story, it is the story of an ugly wicked and a monk who end up falling in love (and having other complications) It is an interesting look at the nature of love and what is true, love, you will be moved. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoyed it, I was still annoyed by the construction of the scattered shots, the inability of the films to hold together their ideas and tell a story complete really hurts the movie away from the disfr ute every time we hit a bump in the road, the potholes take you out of the movie and make you realize e, how much you get from other sources. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing because it has many moments of choice, just prepare for some bumps and have a good time.
