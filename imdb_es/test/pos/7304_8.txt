I really liked this movie, but the feeling that I came out more was the memory of how much I enjoyed the novel. The film features two of the best actresses working today: Jessica Lange, who is excellent here, and the divine Jennifer Jason Leigh, who does the best she can with the barely-drawn character she is given, plus an amazing surprising. Michelle Pfeiffer and a stable Jason Robards. The adaptation is basically true to the book, at least as faithful as it can be in one hour and forty minutes. The film does not really dazzle, except for certain scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer, but it does a very competent job of visualizing this marvelously tragic story. As for the films adapted from the novels, this was definitely one of the best. If nothing else, he sent me to my shelves to rediscover the favorite passages of the excellent novel by Jane Smiley, and King Lear to review the minor characters to see how deep the parallels are. It's worth your time as a movie, definitely, and hopefully enough to remember that reading good literature is also a joy.
