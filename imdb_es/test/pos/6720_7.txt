Like several other critics here, I am surprised to see many negative reviews in this movie. The previous effort of Dan O'Bannon was the innovative 'Alien' of 1979. Because 'Star Wars' introduced the stylistic approach of 'Used' or 'Dirty Space' in art direction for this kind of characteristics, it does not mean that This was the only way to produce them. <br /> <br /> Instead of dismissing 'Lifeforce' as a kind of primitive locking and exploitation feature, it is important to recognize that the film is based on the 'esteemed' British horror and science fiction traditions: specifically Hammer and American International, like Quatermass (specifically 'Quatermass and the Pit', 1967), Doctor Who and 'The Day of the Triffids' (1963), if not the works of Gerry Anderson. ('OVNI', 'Space: 1999' and 'Thunderbirds'). But none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized the academic appreciation of writer O'Bannon for 'Queen of Blood' (1966) and 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space '(1958): the immediate sources of' Alien '(1979). <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie has some 'inherited' elements, but it might be worth comparing this film with the most immediate one. comrades - 'An American Werewolf in London' from 1981 and 'The Company of Wolves' (1984) - other films from the' 80s that share a 'look-back' while adapting those stories to the 80s zeitgeist. The three films are they based on previous incarnations of the same, but they improved their subjects sexually (because they could) and, at the same time, they recognized the comic aspects of their projects. <br /> <Neil Jordan's "wolves" played with many of the psychoanalytic memes that floated in the 1980s, while "the American werewolf" matched his theme as a "coming of age" movie. It's called artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the drama of the last days inherent to the 'Scream' franchise, 'I know what you did last summer' and 'Final destination'. But these films directed by teenagers seem to be part of a box office trend, while the films of the 80s like 'Lifeforce' belong to a British science fiction canon, even if it was written by an American. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this movie is much better than the films of disasters and alien invasion ('Independence Day', 'Armageddon', 'Deep Impact') in which the 'solutions' do not they reside in arms. Battles, payloads and testosterone. At the opposite end of the pole, it's unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron did not examine Tarkowski and Lem more closely before redoing 'Solaris' ... <br /> <br /> The purpose of this movie was fun, no heaviness or stupidity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
