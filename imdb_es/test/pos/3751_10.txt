I liked it better than House Party 2 and 3. The cast was fun and fun at the same time. Chris Stokes, who directed the film, has a very humorous cameo as a car repairman; he looks for his mother who plays the main character, John John's grandmother. And you can hear her rap the title of the song "Down to the Last Minute" at the end of the movie as the credits advance. She is very funny and a very good actress, too. The young actors who star it (the main trio), and who are actually part of the IMx music group, did an excellent job. Before this film I had not paid much attention to this group of R & B. Now I am a fan. The number of music in the House Party scene alone is worth watching the movie. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved.
