My sister, a friend and I went to see this movie for my birthday on September 24th. We had all seen the first "Jackass" movie a while ago, and we all enjoyed it. We were anxious for Number Two. <br /> <br /> We were not disappointed. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, I laughed hysterically. However, it's just as surprising and fun, and it's definitely not for those with weak stomachs. It's obscene, but it's also an innovative American cinema ... well, maybe it's too big a compliment for a movie in which men intentionally stick their writings to ice sculptures, but it's innovative because it shows us obscenities if we like it or not, things that no other "decent" American movie released all over the country would dare to show us. <br /> <br /> There was only one scene in particular that I felt was unnecessarily obscene, and involved a horse - I will not give more details. <br /> <br /> I laughed, almost choked, and was about to cry (for a physical reaction to see a scene that included a leech and an eyeball, not sadness). In my humble opinion, "Jackass: Number Two" is THE movie of '06. <br /> <br /> Does that make me an imbecile? Maybe. But if he does, I could really care less.
