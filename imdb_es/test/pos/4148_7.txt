An interesting look at the experience of immigrants, told as a fable with very strange images. <br /> <br /> I was attracted to this movie because it talks about immigrants from Sicily who traveled to the United States. I imagine the same as my grandfather at that time. Traveling in direction to provide ballast to the boats, I can not imagine that it was very comfortable, as shown in this film. <br /> <br /> There were laws restricting immigrants. I suppose these laws were stricter for those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free of contagious diseases or hereditary diseases. In the film, we see physical and mental exams, the latter due to the opinion that low intelligence is hereditary. Single women could not enter the country, on the assumption that they would become prostitutes, so most of the single married men who are already in the country, as agreed in advance, on Ellis Island before of the entrance. a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who marries a poor Sicilian (Vincenzo Amato). He is trying to get his family to talk to a son who is mute and a mother (Aurora Quattrocchi) who considers himself weak. She was fantastic on paper, by the way. <br /> <br /> You will also see the character actor, Vincent Schiavelli, in his next appearance. I do not know if his latest film has been released. He plays a matchmaker, and he is also very good. <br /> <br /> It was a strange movie, but nice. It is not for everyone, since I imagine that those who have no interest in the experience of immigrants will find it quite slow.
