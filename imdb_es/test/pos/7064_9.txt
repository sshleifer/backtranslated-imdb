Meatballs have been a mainstay in my family for over 26 years! We watched this movie when it first came out and we've seen it dozens of times since then. Bill Murray is at his best and is most poignant in the scenes in which he approaches a lonely preteen boy and befriends him, while taking his CIT to a once naughty scheme from one to the other! The cast of characters is fun and funny and you really care about them and the relationships they have between them. This is not another sleazy and silly teen sex festival. It's fun and sweet and just fun. Anyone who sees this will have fun. It is a must. Beware Spaz, he is by far the best character! (Especially during social camp, while Bill Murray teases for the camera, just look at Spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he chooses to dance with!) By far, one of my favorite comedies of all time!
