This is the only Christopher Guest movie that rivals Spinal Tap and Princess Bride for its entertainment value, but somehow never comes close to recognition. The plot surrounds the contestants, the dogs, and their owners while venturing into the world of competitive dogs ... Well, it's a dog show. The owners are truly characters, as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs. That's all there is to be done, but that makes it fun enough. <br /> <br /> You would never be able to convince me that a mock lie about dog shows would be fun before capturing the hilarious scene in which Levy and O'hara visit Larry Miller's house on television. But that is really all that is needed to convert those who doubt. Spinal Tap was an uninterrupted hilarity, joke after joke, while Best in Show had a few more moments of calm (and with that I mean, 3 minutes in PLUS, where something wildly funny does not happen), but the big laughs are still bigger. <br /> <br /> The casting in this one is excellent and even the one that is usually out of place in, uh, movies in general Parker Posey does a good job. In fact, his tirade to Ed Begley Jr. and the owner of a pet store for a lost dog toy is probably the funniest joke in the movie. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this movie for me is how the writers. Somehow, I managed to weave a plot, simple as it was, around these great jokes so that it really felt like I had an address. I suppose there is freedom in having such a minimal plot. Everyone's role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely exaggerated. The realism of how pathetic they seem to strangers is what makes it more fun than Mighty Wind or the uneven Guffman. In fact, I meet wierdos like this once in a while. If you like Guest's things, you should have this.
