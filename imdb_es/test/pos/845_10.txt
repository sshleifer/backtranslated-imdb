I regret to see that it has been rated so low by many people. The series started very well and after the first season it was not so good. <br /> <br /> People tend to forget the beginning of something and just look at the end. This is not good, you should look at the total, not the final result. It is sad that many of the "usual" characters died, but, damn it, we had many NEW nice characters. <br /> <br /> Please, do not attach to some characters, but to the series, the plot. Please understand that I did not like it when Boone died, when Augur died, but hey ... you have to do it. Can you imagine that everyone continues to live the whole series when they are in danger all the time? Come on, accept it, if they did not die they would be invincible. In this way you will always maintain the tension, will it survive, will it die? I realize that people join the characters, I also do that. My favorite character was Augur, who could enter every computer he wanted. He was the one who was mysterious, could do things with the computer that nobody else could do. <br /> <br /> I want to make a statement to all the people who vote negatively, does a series that started so well deserve to have such a low rating? Should we look at the final season instead of the total? Should not we see how good the series was when it started? Should not we see how much we enjoy it?
