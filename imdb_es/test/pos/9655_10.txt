This is a great movie, a must to own. I really liked all aspects of it, from the fight with swords, romance, costumes were very well made and together. The landscape is absolutely beautiful. I also loved mystery and magic. Also the message of the power of love, that love is the greatest power that exists. I really like the king's heart in the sense that he wants peace instead of bloodshed and hatred. I wish I could live in such a world with flying boats, with castles in the sky. I also think it was very nice how they brought the animals to the movie. I also thought that the cook was very funny. I've seen it many times in a day and I still can not get enough of it. I just wish they brought it on a DVD.
