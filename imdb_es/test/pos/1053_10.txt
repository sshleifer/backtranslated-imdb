Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly fused in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens's carol in his sensibility. The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the character of Alexander Yardley. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he exercises control over his employees, until the Christmas spirit surpasses him. The paper is a "walk in the park" for Greenstreet, who had been one of the great stage Falstaffs when he was part of the Lunts company. Greenstreet had only entered movies five years earlier when, at age 61, he appeared in what would become a film classic, the first and best film that John Huston directed: "The Maltese Falcon". Sakall 'Cuddles' was probably never better in his traditional role as the embodiment of average European gemutlicheit. The attractive ensemble used in most of the film is a jewel pleasing to the eye.
