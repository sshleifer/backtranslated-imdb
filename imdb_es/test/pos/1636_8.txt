Yes, I know that my title stinks. I could not think of any other title. x] Ice is a brilliant episode of the first season. Very interesting idea and good acting too. In my opinion, the whole aspect of a worm was really creepy. I've never been a fan of insects, so all the bugs episodes are creepy for me. x] Anyway, let's continue with the good and bad things of this episode, <br /> <br /> The good: the parasite. Awesome! <br /> <br /> Scully finally trusting Mulder. Awww ... <33 <br /> <br /> It was a good idea to put another parasite in your ear. Even if someone told me I had to put that thing in my ear ... I think the whole cabin would be dead. <br /> <br /> The bad: How was the dog alive for so long? <Br /> <br /> How did Huffman not get those black spots? Or maybe he did, but nobody saw him ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Very good episode, especially for season 1. 8/10
