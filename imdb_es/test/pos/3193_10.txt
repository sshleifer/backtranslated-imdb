This was a television program that I saw during the 1960s when I was a kid and I was captivated. In the many years that have passed, I have often thought about this program and how good it would be to see it again, but bearing in mind that things from the past are not always as good as you remember them. This was a great show in the 1960s and has not lost anything, even now in 2007. Sure there are some strange production errors that you see when you watch old shows, and it takes a couple of episodes to get used to the voices bent, but having done that, I was as enthralled as I was in the sixties. The Samurai is played by Koichi Ose, who plays the role in a very humble way. I remember that during the decade of the 60, due to the popularity of the program here in Australia, he made a tour with swords, etc., and was overwhelmed by the interest in the program and in him. It was great that one of my favorite shows of all times had the magic it had during my childhood. You have to watch series.
