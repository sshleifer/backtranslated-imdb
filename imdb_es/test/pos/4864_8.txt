I picked up a DVD on 1 ?? discount, I have no idea what it is (but at that price I can not resist ...) In short: I was positively surprised. <br /> <br /> So much that I did a lot of research. In the German DVD (part 2 of a series of 3), the episodes were recombined into two parts of 85 minutes, and out of order. Here are my results, based on the list of Wikipedia episodes: <br /> <br /> "Doomsday" is In My Boots + The Voice (final episode). <br /> <br /> "War of the Machines" is Hel & High Water (1, 2) + Pod Listener + Juggernaut Down. <br /> <br /> Well, what can I say? Of course, naked little girls are interesting for older men. I never saw Charlie's Angels so much, so I can not compare, but the more I watched, the less I looked at bikini tops and their fillings. Instead, the characters (both m and f) became more interesting. I imagine that feminists will also have fun with this. All in all, maybe a guilty pleasure, but it was a pleasure: ^)
