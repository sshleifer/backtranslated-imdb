I remember when this NBC miniseries aired when I was in high school. After reading the novel, I thought about reviewing some adaptations. I did not expect much from a mini TV series, but now I might have to review a little more. This is really excellent, and the best possible movie version that could be made. The writer Simon Moore, who wrote the teleplay game for the original miniseries of Traffic, on which the Soderberg film was based, presented a brilliant narrative concept that helps the story flow smoothly: it frames Gulliver's adventures as flashbacks , with the real story beginning when Gulliver returns home for the first time (everything that happened on a trip). Gulliver, played by Cheers' Ted Danson, seems a little crazy when his wife, Mary Steenburgen, receives him back at his home. Unfortunately, the house is now owned by the local doctor, James Fox, who has designs in Steenburgen. Gulliver seems simply disturbed at first, but when he starts telling stories of tiny people, that's all the evidence that Fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum. The four trips of Gulliver are related in this version, in the same order as the novel (the only time it has been done in the film). I love the way your current situation reflects your flashbacks. Gulliver's little son, whom he had never met before, reminds him of the Lilliputians. The doctors who observe him in his cell from a mezzanine loom over him and remind him of the Brogdingnagians, and the scientific investigations of the doctors remind him of the crazy science experiments and the theories of the Laputans and the professors of the Academy. Finally, when they judge him, he is reminded of the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos. The cast of this thing is incredible, and includes Peter O'Toole, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest flaw in the miniseries is that the acting is really uneven. You have all these good actors, but the minor characters are often played by actors who were probably good in the episodes of L.A. Law, but they do not do well in a costume drama. Ted Danson is not particularly good, although he has some sequences in which he excels. It's probably better if he did not try, but all the other characters in the movie speak with an English accent. Steenburgen is pretty good at that, and it's pretty good in general. Another flaw that the series has is that the adventures happen a bit too fast. It is not credible that Gulliver has spent eight years away from home, as claimed. But, in general, it captures Swift's tone and purpose very well, while, with its structure, it adds a new emotional level.
