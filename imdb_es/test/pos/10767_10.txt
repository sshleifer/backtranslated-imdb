I attended a screening of "Fierce People" at the Woodstock Film Festival in 2006. I hesitate to label it a "premiere" of any kind, since it was filmed in the spring of 2004 and had its world premiere at Tribeca in 2005. He played at several festivals that year. The liberation seemed imminent, then disappeared. Fagot. Disappeared Or at least that seemed to the public that went to the movies. The rumors of a theatrical release or DVD have appeared from time to time, but all have been unfounded. Then this screening was announced. Maybe one can call it a "re premiere?" I certainly felt as if I witnessed a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was. <br /> <br /> I suppose one could characterize "Fierce People" as a come-of-age drama. But it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. And a little farce thrown. In short, real life. That makes it difficult to pigeonhole, which places him more in the category of an indie rather than a Hollywood movie. But its high production values, the big budget sensation and the star-caliber cast seem to be at odds with the independent label. So let's call it a hybrid. And, maybe, that's why it has been "lost". Challenge categorization. <br /> <br /> Meet Finnish Earl (Anton Yelchin), 15, whose father is absent. In fact, Finn has never met him. But he sees it and listens to it through the collection of home movies sent from South America. Papa is a renowned anthropologist and has made a name for himself by establishing a shop with the Yanomani, the tribe of "ferocious people" who live to kill and, well, procreate. All his activities are based on those two "tasks" and Finn is captivated by them. Mom Liz (Diane Lane) is also somewhat absent. Although physically present, it is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. So Finn becomes an adult in his little lonely world with his movie reels. <br /> <br /> One summer, Mom decides to drag Finn along with her to the nature of New Jersey. As a massage therapist, Mom has cared for a wealthy client, Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland, in a tour de force performance) and has invited her to a prolonged home visit on her palatial estate. The "tribe" of Osborne includes an assortment of rich and eccentric children, servants and idiots of the people, among whom Finn will find himself as part of his own anthropological study. Will your experience with dad movies help you survive the life as a visitor of this tribe? Will it be accepted? Or will he be seen as a stranger, struggling simultaneously with his own identity as a teenager? Such is the theme of fairy tales, and I suppose this would be if it were not for the darker part that director Griffin Dunne and writer Dirk Wittenborn have infused into this magnificent story. <br /> <br /> With the voiceover of Anton Yelchin, exchanging pieces of dad's home movies, Finn must learn to be the teenager he never had the opportunity to be, to stop being the father of his Mother, let the newly-surplus mother be her father and learn responsibility on the road to adulthood the way it should have taken place all the time. However, he needs to make this transformation into a dark and dangerous world where playing with fire is madness for this fractured family. <br /> <br /> This is, first and foremost, a film guided by history and Griffin Dunne emphasized both In the introduction to the film. He bought the rights to Wittenborn's novel even when it was being written, and Wittenborn's own script comes to life in the hands of Master Dunne in a way that is a wonderful work. <br /> <br /> This is also very much a character-oriented movie, and Sutherland has never been better. His star rotates when Osborne surprised those around me and will probably leave you surprised too. The character of Diane Lane finally exhibits so many personalities that it is hard to imagine another actor who is doing so well. She is impressive But more than anything, "Fierce People" is Anton Yelchin's film. He has a long resume as a child actor, but very little as a teenager. Apart from the little known "House of D" (also a gem), it is better known as Byrd in "Huff" of television. In January, he will be seen in "Alpha Dog" (also sitting on the shelf since 2004, a movie I saw at Sundance this year and in which he is the "heart and soul"). His performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young, and it is spectacular. <br /> <br /> This complex and peculiar film has been out of sight long enough. "Fierce People" is a treasure full of light and shadow, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but above all wonder.
