I suppose that those who have been in a unilateral relationship of some kind before will be able to identify with the protagonist Minako (Yuko Tanaka), a 50-year-old woman who is still in good health, as evidenced by her diary The grinding routine to wake up very early in the morning to prepare for her milk delivery job, where she has to carry bottles of Megmilk in a bag on a route around her city like a clock, to change empty bottles for full ones, and to pick up Payment and receipt of issuance. And there is always a delivery stop that is right at the top, which needs to climb a long flight of stairs to achieve customer satisfaction. <br /> <br /> And curious enough, that stop happened to be a stop to deliver a man she has been in love with for most of her adolescent and adult life, and who did not appreciate the product, but who I threw by the sink. Having gone to the same school, we see that they do not talk to each other, and in their daily lives they always seem to be so close physically, but so far away. There is no visual contact, except by casual looks by chance, and little recognition of the existence of the other. We learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all the notions of being together, where the previous generation prevented the attraction between the two from developing. <br /> <br /> Although I thought that Minako was an interesting woman in herself, someone who has kept her feelings repressed for so long, one can only wonder what kind of harm it would cause. If I read that the original Japanese title means "At some point in the days that you read books" and it is correct, I felt that the film had a wonderful ending with that photo of your bookshelf well stocked, probably alluding to the fact that it is not alone afterwards. everyone, and probably had resorted to her crutch to deal with the pain of being alone, and return to a lifestyle that had already been used for 50 years. In addition to immersing himself in two jobs, he has those books that serve as a form of escapism and, on occasion, he dedicates small notes to the programs dedicated to songs on the radio. <br /> <br /> Yuko Tanaka did a commendable job as emotionally The strong woman resigned herself to her fate and her decision not to love anyone else, her object of affection, Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe) was a more interesting character than It has more facets. Staying true to the marriage vows, he spends a lot of time on the screen taking care of his sick wife (played by Akiko Nishina), while juggling his social welfare work in the Department of Children's Affairs at City Hall. I felt that, like a couple without children, the work provided a means to care, not for their own, but for the children of other people, the problems that are neglected and left to fend for themselves. In a rare moment of anger, we see how he angrily reproaches misguided parents who do not appreciate and waste the lives of their children. <br /> <br /> The story of Kenji Aoki offers little quirks to make his characters look more attractive. they also tried to give them many more glimpses and dimensions, for example, how Takanashi is a haiku poet with no hope despite being a member of the Haiku club, and secondary characters such as the elderly Minagawa couple, where Masao (Koichi Ueda) loaned some moments comedians, although sad, while slowly becoming senile, while wife Toshiko (Misako Watanabe) narrates and takes us through this love story of a single woman at age 50. Even Akiko Nishina's performance as the bedridden wife was nothing short of amazing, with the enlightened state character of knowing her husband's past, and making selfless and painful decisions in her sickly state. <br /> <br /> It's what you can expect from a typical Japanese romantic movie, without young, nubile leads as star-cros. Be lovers, but with all the other elements in place, such as romantic arrangements, love songs and those restrained but affectionate behavior par excellence. I thought that history was in danger of going down the well-worn path when unrequited love is consumed, but director Akira Ogata managed to avoid the usual melodramatic moments in such stories, although the story required an obvious development of the plot in the final act that you can predict, especially if you've already spent your movie Romance 101. <br /> <br /> Not being your average story, I thought The Milkwoman told a strong story with unrequited love as the central theme and, frankly, a romantic movie recommended (although counted at a moderate pace) if you are in the mood for some bittersweet memory, reminiscence and search to live without regrets.
