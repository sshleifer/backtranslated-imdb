Ok, I love this movie !!!!! I saw it again and again. It's so hard to say who the attacker is. You still think it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. He is so full of suspense that he wants to move his television to the end to see who he is. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and abandoned in her home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped. She goes from meeting her stable boyfriend, to her teacher she likes, to her ex boyfriend, all the different stories, all the suspects. But who did it? <br /> <br /> I love acting, they have great talent here. The suspense is wonderful and the configuration is excellent. If it comes on television, look at it. *** 1/2 stars 10/10
