Choose your destiny: the terrible children of the fourth form, playing practical jokes involving axes, or ... ummm ... well developed girls of the sixth form, who discovered cigarettes, gin, sex and how easily. Men can be diverted. The problem is that one set comes with the other. Everyone is there at St. Trinian's, that surprisingly simple English school for girls directed by Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). As Miss Fritton likes to point out: "In other schools the girls are sent quite unsuspecting to a ruthless world, but when our girls leave here, it is the ruthless world that has to be prepared." Miss Fritton sounds like a mix of Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt, and she definitely has Sim's comedic genes. <br /> <br /> At The Belles of St. Trinian's, a sly and chaotic comedy by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat's team, St. Trinian's is, as always, on the brink of financial disaster. However, salvation may be available when a wealthy sheik sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive an adequate education in English. The Sheikh also owns a horse and one of his award-winning runners, Arab Boy, is being trained near the school for a race. It is only a matter of time before the girls in the fourth form form a group of races and bet heavily on Arab Boy, with Miss Fritton adding to the group the funds that are left to the school. (Much of the girls' money from the fourth form comes from the gin they produce in chemistry, then they are bottled and taken down with a rope to Flash Harry (George Cole), a Cockney repairman, for distribution. ... I do not know what, "says Miss Fritton as she tries things," but send a few bottles to my room. "<br /> <br /> Miss Fritton, however, has a brother, Clarence Fritton ( who, by coincidence of casting, is also Alastair Sim), a bookmaker who not only has placed a package on another horse, but also has a daughter, and has placed the precocious Arabella in the sixth form to keep him informed Soon, the sixth form has kidnapped Arab Boy, the fourth form has recovered the horse, Flash Harry has joined forces with Miss Fritton, the girls of sixth form are determined that Arab Boy does not leave the second floor of St. Trinian's, Clarence and his Homburg gang has arrived, the Parents are driving for Parent's Day and the Ministry of Education has arrived in the person of a very appropriate inspector. The total war breaks out in San Triniano. It is difficult to say which is more dangerous, the African spears or the flour bombs. <br /> <br /> Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton becomes a tour de force performance. Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a majestic chest, fond of long dresses with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with many feathers. You take everything in stride, even a fourth extra hitting something in the chemistry class and, after listening to an explosion a few minutes later, the results. "Oh, dear, I told Bessie to be careful with that nitroglycerin!" She is firm in believing that St. Trinian's is "a gay arcade of happy girls". Sim was one of the great eccentric actors of Great Britain. Apart from the mere chaos of all the little girls (and not so small ones) who do terrible things, he offers much of the pleasure of the movie.
