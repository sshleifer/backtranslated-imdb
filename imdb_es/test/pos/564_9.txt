You think the police are always right. <br /> <br /> You think that "eyewitnesses" are always right. <br /> <br /> You think prosecutors will not take a case to court if the lazy police have failed to perform 98% of a basic investigation. <br /> <br /> You believe that a city of the USA. UU it could have "few bad apples" in the application of the law, but that the "good policemen" will quickly end up with those who participate systematically in the evil of evil for evil. <br /> <br /> You believe that the possibility of a football lineman being installed as a detective only because your father is the county sheriff, and you are allowed to beat "Confessions" of randomly selected teenagers without any fear of the negative consequences for him could happen in the United States of the thirties, but not in the present. <br /> <br /> You believe that a judge will NOT send a case to the jury If someone with a brain in their head can see that the accused is a completely random passerby trapped by the police because it was hot and they did not feel like working . that day. <br /> <br /> You believe that all innocent people incarcerated here for six months or for 20 years have "exceptions to the rule", and an injustice like this could NEVER involve a member of your family, someone in the Middle Class, or someone like YOU. <br /> <br /> You think you are aware of every indisputable and terrible 100% indignation in the last 10 years in the United States, but you have not seen this movie yet.
