The young and ambitious nurse, Mrs. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work in an asylum in the middle of nowhere. In the course of 3 days, he encounters strange events, including a patient in his room looking at her, but he still stays. All mental patients are a little blank (especially by the judge), but my favorite was the crazy old man (Rhea MacAdams). The plot is fine at best, and the performance is surprisingly good, but after a while it becomes a bit too much. But, still, it's fun, quirky, strange and original. <br /> <br /> Note: The thing inside the basement is not horrible, so the title is a little banana.
