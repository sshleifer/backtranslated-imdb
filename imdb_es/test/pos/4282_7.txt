I gave him a seven just because the acting is good. And of course with that I mean Wilkinson. The other two directors were "decent". But the characters themselves ... what the hell was so bad about the character played by Wilkinson (James Manning)? I did not see him behaving like the martinet that Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an unbearable imbecile that I was praying and would meet with an extremely brutal and prolonged death. Who was kidding? Tom Wilkinson is not Paul Bettany, after all. So, what EARTH saw the character of Emily Watson (Anne) in him? She herself admitted that he was almost a piece of spoils in her treatment of her. Why would he want to be in the same CITY as he, to say nothing of the same "room"? <br /> <br /> I noticed some other criticisms, one person said he "cried" at the end, to Witness James tragedy. ??? What a tragedy. What do you mean you lose an imbecile who finds someone like Bill Bule? Give us a break.
