Big Fat Liar is the best movie of all time! It's fun, and great. Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) proves he was not lying and goes to Los Angeles to retrieve his document from Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Along with her friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes), it ruins her life since Marty will not call Jasons' father and will tell him he wrote the newspaper. But everything goes well and it's a good movie to watch!
