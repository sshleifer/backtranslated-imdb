This is a great show with total freshness and innovation. The usual host of the chair (the couch for a woman), the obligatory band that plays monotonous melodies, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the days of Nebuchadnezzer ... probably the boss of Johnny Carson, copied by all, Latterman, Leno, Conan ... Daly, this program does not seem to have any of these. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this program in the first 10 minutes and I'm going to follow it. Although it is too early to say that, this program seems devoid of any intellectual pretension that most talk shows try so hard to project, and I hope that is what makes this program different from the rest. I hope this program lasts a long time! <br /> <br /> Returning after months, I still love this program, and I love its self-deprecating humor (for example, its claim that only loners of cabotage would be the home of see your program on Saturday at midnight and, therefore, the jokes are fun only for the drugged types) that, however, do not involve the habitual use of Conan O'Brien, for example (I know it is a cardinal sin that must be repelled by O 'Las Brien's antics, but I really do not like his style and his repetitivity. <br /> <br /> I saw him again the other night with Tom Arnold in him.The Ferensen parody of commercial spouses (and Nanny 911 in a previous episode) are very funny, idiotic paparazzi are fun, especially when a security guard warns them not to take pictures of people and (if I'm not mistaken) they start taking their pictures screaming "Gary Coleman". <br /> <br /> Added on April 16, 2007: Returning once again, the veci No and your dog leaves me confused. I can not decide if it's a joke or a real thing. Either way, it was fun as hell. <br /> <br /> I do not expect Spike Feresten to read these pages, but maybe he does. He is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and, therefore, I'd better write down my suggestion here for him: I'd like him to do a full 30 minute show with Crazy Gideon, the star of the nightly TV commercial. I would like Crazy Gideon to have an interview on Spike's talk show, sing a song (and play the guitar), do a skit on the SNL line, and also answer questions from the audience about his possible mayoralty in Los Angeles ( I know Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this, but there are websites that detail why he would be the perfect candidate for the position of mayor of Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> God willing! <br /> < Returning on July 14, 2007: Someone wrote here that the people who praised the Spike program must be bribed by Spike, I confess that Spike really bribed me, but I must also confess that Rockefeller named me in his will and that last night I had sex with Cindy Crowford.
