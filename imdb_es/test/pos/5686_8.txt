Black Water, co-directed and written by David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki, is very simple in its execution, but effective. The film is a low-budget Australian film that unfortunately will not receive the recognition it deserves because, in regard to the characteristics of the creatures, this is one of the best that exist. The configuration is quite basic; Grace, her husband Adam and her younger sister, Lee, are touring some mangroves in the Northern Territory when a saltwater crocodile flips their boat and leaves them stranded in the trees. The whole movie is about their survival, while the crocodile is lurking waiting to attack. Unlike Greg McLean's Rogue (another killer crocodile movie released in early 2007), Black Water is not about the public having fun guessing who will be eaten next. about waiting and praying for the three people to get out safely. <br /> <br /> The three unknown actors do a great job with quite demanding roles, considering that it was filmed in a place with a real crocodile instead of CGI. The characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced. The suspense accumulates throughout the entire film, we do not see much of the creature, but knowing that it is close is terrifying enough. This is an edge theme of your seat and highly recommended if you enjoy original horror movies and (most importantly) scary. <br /> <br /> 4/5
