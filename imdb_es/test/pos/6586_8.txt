For Estonians, Finland sometimes looks like a land of dreams. A land where many of us want to go and work there or start a business. Find love, start a new life, etc. But ... Aku Louhimies has made this brilliant piece that shows that everything is not so good in Finland too. That Finland can be as Paha maa (the bad land) as any other country. It shows that people there can be as miserable in their lives as we are anywhere else. That sometimes there is nothing good. This film shows very well why Finland is one of the main suicide countries. It is not easy to live in the north. The cold weather changes us. Every time I feel more attracted to Finnish films and this is very good. The acting is also great. Jasper Pääkkönnen has become one of the best Finnish stars. Beware of the sex scene (if you have young children) and a little depression that could arise after the movie! 8/10
