What a great little movie, many good roles of some random stars. Basically, there are these potters who get entangled in a comic adventure. In points the movie makes you believe that everyone will end up dead! What adds to the comedy. When the character of John Lithgow (3rd Rock) reappears, it is impossible not to imagine the journey, this may have caused, as a total paradox. The movie is full of twists and turns that keep you guessing until the end. Billy Bob Thornton Astronaut Farmer) is brilliant, in fact, looking back, the character is quite similar in the fact that it holds together the family of pot breeders. Everyone involved in this movie should have a big thumbs up. <br /> <br /> As I say, 'the final scene is a dream; However, a nightmare at the same time. I love when Hank Azaria (carter) says at the end, do you think we should do this every year? I felt wishing they did. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to say that this movie is good for everyone, but as a lover of stoner movies, I give it 10/10. - My council has a board ready; Relax and enjoy!
