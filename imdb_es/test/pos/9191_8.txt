This existential thriller, in Portuguese with English subtitles, is a modern version of the American noire films of the 1940s, with a touch of surprise at the end. It is fascinating from start to finish. My only criticism is their poor production values. The film seems cheap, and probably was, so the black and white cinematography is much lower than Godard's in Vivre Sa Vie, to cite another black film more than 30 years earlier. The most maddening of all, the subtitles are often difficult to read. When will the filmmakers learn and provide captions in yellow so that they can be read on a white background? I would give it an 8 in total, although with better production values ​​it could have been higher.
