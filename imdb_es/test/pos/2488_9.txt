Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> This is a Peter Watkins movie. If one has seen his masterpieces of the BBC "Cullodden" and "The War Game", he will recognize the style (and his voice) in a few seconds after the start. Made in 1971, it is set in the very near future, when the Vietnam War has intensified further and now seems to involve China. Nixon is still president and civil disobedience and protest is dealt with with the violent use of drumhead courts (civilly with "ordinary citizens" as judges). Because "the prison building can not be maintained", an alternative is presented: The Punishment Park. Criminals can choose between severe prison terms and hunting for a man in a hostile environment, in this case an 85km trip through the California desert to 100 Â° F. If they reach an American flag at the end without being caught by the National Guard or the riot police, they will be released, or else they have to serve their sentence (or be dead, as we will see). The film is made in a completely documentary style with three European teams covering a court and the course of two groups already sentenced. The scenes jump between the tent of the court, the hunting troops and the condemned fighters. Watkin's scant comment gives us basic information (time, temperature, etc.). The court scenes show a kangaroo court on the one hand and a wide range of personalities on the other, ranging from real terrorists to "undesirable" to clearly innocent (for example, a total pacifist who can not even hurt the flies) . The defense attorney (who takes his job seriously) has to take abuse from both sides. What makes these scenes especially spooky is their resemblance to today's administration rhetoric in detail. Meanwhile, some unfortunate events in the desert make it clear that the 'rules of the game' do not really apply. The question remains open, whether it is manipulated from the beginning or arbitrary by the troops due to the events that lead to the outcome (I suspect they are both). In the end, we're back in square one with the next group going to "Punishment Park." This description may indicate a heavily skewed (or even demagogic) propaganda film, but that would be misleading. The behavior (all participants were non-professionals as usual with Watkins) seems and sounds real (the court scenes may even contain text material from contemporary real essays). I would say that this could be sold as a "real thing" without a problem. With "The Forgotten Faces" by Watkins, the reaction was: "We can not send that or nobody is going to believe in our real news (because this is indistinguishable from the real)." With "Punishment Park" it should be the same. Prohibited effectively in the USA UU As far as I know, this is a must-see that has not lost its power or relevance (especially today).
