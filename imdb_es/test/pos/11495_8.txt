I have the feeling that Lisa Krueger is easy to miss. Personally, his first film, Manny and Lo 1996, was a wonderfully detailed character study and the performances were uniformly wonderful (with special recognition for Mary Kay Place). The film was screened for a week or two in the main urban centers and disappeared. One or two critics really liked it, but many saw it as mild. The second film of Krueger, Committed, was released this year (2000) (after almost two years of delays) and disappeared in a similar way. And, once again, critics dismissed the film as mild and pushed it aside, at most praising Heather Graham's screen presence, but rarely her ability to act. And once again, for me, Comprometido is a solid success. I feel that Krueger has a genuine voice and a personal visual style, and these are traits that should not be ignored so easily, simply because he works in a very restricted scrutiny. <br /> <br /> The title has several meanings. , but mainly refers to the refusal of Joline (Graham) to let her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) fall apart and leave her. She follows him from New York to El Paso and becomes one of the most attractive stalkers in recent film history. His respect for his marriage vows leads her to Mexico's mysticism and self-discovery. And yes, the plot is that simple and, therefore, so easy to ignore. <br /> <br /> Joline, of course, is the crying voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate close to fifty percent. And for me, your personal revolution against unfulfilled promises and a legacy of deception is quite intelligent and powerful. Relying on the belief that people simply do not have enough faith with each other, Joline inevitably has to discover that her beliefs are not in tune with those of society in general. Several comments from her have referred to her character as one-dimensional and I'm afraid it's a simplistic reading of the movie. Or maybe even a bad read. If Joline was an innocent, it would be nothing interesting. It is the fact that she understands the world and refuses to play by the rules of the "normal" which makes her so interesting. Sociologically, she is a complete deviant. <br /> <br /> Krueger sometimes falls in moments of courtesy dialogues and his direction of this film has a rather strange dependence on images of clouds moving across the El Paso skyline. However, their mistakes are quite rare and in this film, as in Manny and Lo, it is the performances that carry the day. Graham has never been better because he has never had a character as perfectly adapted to her as Joline. For the first time in his career, Graham feels comfortable playing with an adult, even a slightly slow-developing one. She carries the movie perfectly. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (as Joline's brother) have a lot of good times, like Alfonso Arau, as a Mexican mystic and Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo, the truck driver a bit psychotic. As in Manny and Lo, the characters are part of their environments, totally organic creations well detailed. These characters can sometimes seem unusually extravagant, but they make sense in their context. Even Goran Visnjic, as an artist who was enthusiastic about Joline's devotion, fits in some strange way, even though his character's alien is never discussed. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a movie that gains depth looking backwards. Another commentator here spoke of the stereotyped Mexican representations. And again I'm tempted to call that a bad read. Joline is looking for self-justification. She knows that her commitment is out of control, but she is looking for any spiritual avenue that can help her make sense of herself. The character of Arau understands that most people do not believe in him and he plays his own faith when he sees a woman who respects him. <br /> <br /> I guess I can understand how this movie could be seen as unsatisfying, I just do not agree. It's always fun, often hilarious, and all the characters exude a warmth that is quite wonderful. <br /> <br /> I give this one a 7.5 / 10 and when I start voting here, it goes up to an 8.
