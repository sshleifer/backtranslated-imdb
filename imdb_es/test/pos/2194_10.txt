I can not beat the quality of the score, the book and the performances. This is the first production I've seen of Sweeney Todd, so I do not have another one to compare it with. But the impact is very strong, I just can not imagine anything better. <br /> <br /> First, there's the music: take "Johanna" (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing an intertwined vocal line that incorporates the melodies of three songs. It's like a Bach choir in that sense, just a masterpiece of composition. And the structure of the underlying chords and the voices are so perfect: a little melancholy, a little joy, a little yearning, all expressing the points of view of these three singers. <br /> <br /> Then - - the letter. The rhymes are so smart. Rhyme schemes sometimes seem random, but they always add up at the end. (The DVD, which I saw, has subtitles, which are indispensable to appreciate the dialogue and the lyrics). Sondheim deserves a literary prize just for his poetry. <br /> <br /> Finally, the performances. I can not imagine anyone better than George Hearn. Why have not I heard about him before? His singing, alone, is masterful, but the range of his performance is simply incredible. Angela Lansbury totally surprised me. The song about "you and me by the sea", who could do better? Your time is impeccable, the tone is perfect, every score stroke is taken into account; and the superimposition of this achievement in music is his comic delivery absolutely enchanting. <br /> <br /> It's a dark tale, but sometimes it seemed sweet to me; and the melody of "Johanna" continues to play in my head.
