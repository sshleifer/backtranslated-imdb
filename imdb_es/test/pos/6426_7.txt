Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a translator living in Italy, discovers that she has a memory loss and can not remember the last days. She begins to follow a trail of memory fragments, which takes her to the small town of Garma. The people of the city seem to recognize her and are beginning to suspect that the recurring nightmares of astronauts performing horrific experiments have something to do with their own amnesia. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting and the plot is good, but it is a bit slow and artistic for my taste. The plot has some nice twists and it's very difficult to figure out where it's going. Florinda Bolkan is good in her role (but even better in "Flavia the Heretic") and it is always nice to see the "star" child actress Nocoletta Elmi. The role of Klaus Kinski is too small. This is not a film for the gore hound or addicted to exploitation, but it is still a very good mystery of an hour and a half.
