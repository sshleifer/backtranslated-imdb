This is actually a very good surreal mystery movie, despite the description that tries to sell it as a science fiction movie. The Balkan stars are a woman pursued by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to reconstruct. She spends most of the movie trying to make sense of her visions. Very atmospheric and effective. It is true that Kinski does not appear much in this movie, but the actors are very good. There is only one English version available in the US. UU., And the dubbing leaves much to be desired, but the actors do a very good job. The cinematography of the winner of the Academy Award Vittorio Storaro is excellent. A previous Giallo by director Bazzoni, EL QUINTO CORDÃ“N, is also excellent and also has the Storarro lens.
