I have left a Coen movie before and I did not know how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so full of strange humor that I had to like him. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary daydreams with flying people and killer bowling balls that just did not seem to fit into the mold of the movie. Still, I liked the movie and now I have a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysteria, sometimes I was not sure why I was laughing so hard it made me cry, but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but after a deeper investigation, they were just real people talking about real situations. That's why the man with the shovel (or if it was a broom) was so funny when he told the police officer about a funny man who was at the bar the other night. And that's also the reason why the theater erupted in laughter when it says that some fun-looking clouds are coming in. (I also have a copy of this movie) The Coens have a way of masking their movie and their characters as something eccentric and maybe a little off the wall. But if you look more closely at some of those characters that look like crazies, you'll always find them in some strange way, they all seem to be true. That's what is quite exceptional about Oh Brother, where are you? This is a movie that is out there. I mean, he's not even in the same ballpark as a traditional movie. I reviewed the movie Shaft last summer and in it I said that Shaft was a good movie that I had seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother movie and you certainly can not say that about it. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything in it, from a jail break, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to what I can only assume are historical figures, baptisms on the banks of the river, bank robberies, violence towards the animals, songs of religious fanatics, KKK, flocks of lynchings, etc. Obviously, there are also many references to Homer's Odyssey here, but I would not know it because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. All other newspaper critics seem to know everything about it and believe that this cynicism and its almost false quality make the film much better. Well, coming from a guy who does not know anything about it, I can tell you that it's still an entertaining movie. There were times when, once again, as usual in a Coen movie, I was not sure why I was entertaining or laughing, but yes. <br /> <br /> This is an image of the road on which three men travel on the road. to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden his other two cellmates. He has to take them with him because they were also chained to him when they had the opportunity to escape. <br /> <br /> I like all the main actors in the film and many of them are friends of Coen. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro, who seems to have a place in all of Coen's films. It's a shame they have not found a place for Steve Buscemi, but that's a completely different story. But let's go back to Clooney. Man only has charisma. He is also a great actor and here he is not as crazy as the others, but even he has his own idiosyncrasy. His work here is quite impressive and I really hope that this shows that he is able to play at any character rank. <br /> <br /> Now, after accumulating all these accolades in the movie, let me say this too. I did not really enjoy the movie at the beginning. I found it quite tedious and a bit boring. There were too many ideas here and there was not enough care to take them for what they were worth. But then the movie started to grow on me. It took a while but it grew on me. I do not think this is his best movie, but it's still a good one and I'm giving him an 8.5. But the reason why I recommend this movie is only for a reason. <br /> <br /> Every day you can look at the paper and watch the movies that are playing and tell yourself, you saw it, you saw it. Oh, seen last year, that's the same as this movie and the same as that movie. Most of the films have been recycled in one way or another. Not the Coen movies. They have not been recycled and if they have, I do not know. That is reason enough to see something that they take out. Originality counts a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that is not common in today's cinema. Enjoy them while you are allowed to make movies. Because you do not get a vision like this in many movies, so when you do, enjoy it!
