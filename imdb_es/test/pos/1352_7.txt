Burt Kennedy wrote and directed this western taken from a novel. Kennedy was a good writer and well-known director, mostly westerns. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum was a star for more than 20 years when he did this. This role was like many that I had already done. One can see why he was a great star for so many years. <br /> <br /> He filled this paper easily like a well-worn glove. <br /> <br /> The main character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father, an excellent actor Robert Walker, died tragically at 32, his mother is actress Jennifer Jones). <br /> <br /> Robert was of little importance to build and although he had talent he only made a few films. (He was in Rita Hayworth's last film. <br /> <br /> ROAD TO SALINAS --- the same year and it was very good). <br /> <br /> He looked a lot like his father, but he seemed to lack the charm of his father. He made only a few more movies. He still lives and I wish him the best. <br /> <br /> Most of his scenes are with another son of a great Hollywood. The son of John Carradine, David, who is still making movies. They formed a good team. <br /> <br /> In westerns you always have a female character and usually she is a dance artist. (Today they call them prostitutes), Angie Dickinson evaluates this role very well. John Anderson and Jack Kelly also stood out in its western part: <br /> <br /> It was a movie in Old Tucson, just outside the center of Tucaon Az,. and the landscape is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Typical of the oldest westerns, there is not much action, there is good humor and the usual ending is triggered. <br /> <br /> It's an 89 minutes enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 10) 84 points out of 100 IMDb 7 out of 10
