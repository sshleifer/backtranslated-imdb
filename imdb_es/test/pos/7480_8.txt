Very violent film and very well filmed. Paulina is a sexy and bad girl who will show that men can also be raped. This movie has a lot of black humor. This guy will kill anyone just to forget that he used to be a gangster. There will be times when you would not know whether to shake or smile and think "Am I laughing at someone who is killing people?"
