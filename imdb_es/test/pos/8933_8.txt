I've been wanting to see this movie for a long time. Finally I bought it at E-Bay because it is very difficult to find it in the state. But the wait was ... a little worth it. <br /> <br /> I can not say that the movie was great. And I can not say that the movie was funny. But it was good and it has some pretty funny points. Apart from that, the shots in this movie are simply beautiful. And the entire cast, especially Brenda Blethyn (someone I had not seen before, unfortunately), was excellent. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a romantic comedy to feel good about and I recommend you review it, unless I just had a death in the family. <br /> <br /> In any case, the last chapter is worth it. > <
