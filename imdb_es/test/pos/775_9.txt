I saw this movie at ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. He was very observable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters receives a special mention as she creates a wonderful interesting character to watch. The character of Ben is somewhat shy and stoic, but Rupert Grint beautifully represents the changes he goes through. I would definitely say that he has a future in acting after Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney is very good in her role as the overprotective mother of Ben, the only thing they were wrong with is making her too ... Villain-y. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast with his mother, and in the end he is also quite honorable. The only character I did not like was Bryony, I thought it was a bit simple and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch. One of my favorite movies of the year easily.
