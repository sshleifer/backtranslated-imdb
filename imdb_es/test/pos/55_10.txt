Without blood, without sex (although it oozes passion), without special effects, but only one of those pearls that appear on the screen of your movie when you are not looking and it catches your attention. <br /> <br /> Great performance, great stages, good music, beautiful history. I wish they had made many more movies like this one! <br /> <br /> The scenarios move us through time and make us feel as if we were there. <br /> <br /> The acting seems to be real life, and it raises us to the level of consciousness of "Nanny", for whom no one is a lost cause, and less than all the inhabitants of his own house "Halfway through path". <br /> <br /> The best of all is that it is a real story of misfits learning to "fit in". I was kind of jealous of the good times everyone seemed to be having in the movie! Could we all spend some time at Nanny's house?
