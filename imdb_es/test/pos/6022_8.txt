If you want to see what could be classified as the 'stage' version of GYPSY, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy (ed) the recording of GERMY by MERMAN, then you really enjoy watching MIDLER as the mother of Gypsy, ROSE. It is my opinion that Midler has the volume, the vibrato and the gifts that Merman once had. <br /> <br /> It is not very frequent these days, when I listen to updated versions of musicals, that I have that tingling sensation that makes everything work. My neck trembles, but Bette Midler certainly shows her talent in this movie: see how she likes apples ... <br /> <br /> I know she may not like it, but for me, Mrs. Midler is The definitive. "Gypsy".
