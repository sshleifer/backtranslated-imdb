On the Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, the owner of a Louis Mahé cigarette factory (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is engaged through correspondence with Julie Roussel and he does not know her. When Julie arrives at the island to marry Louis, the wait in the docks, but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger ship and discovers that it is totally different from the image that had sent to him to Louis. They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis asking his sister to write him, Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie the one that is missing. In addition, he finds that the woman has cleared her bank accounts and left the island. The sister of Louis and Julie hire an efficient private detective Comolli (Michel Bouquet) and Louis travels to France in search of the woman, but he has a nervous breakdown in Nice and undergoes intense sleep therapy in a clinic. He recovers and discovers that the woman, actually Marion Vergano (Catherine Deneuve), works at the Phoenix Club Privé in Antibes and lives in the low budget Hotel Monorail. Louis breaks into his room and when he arrives from the club, she tells him that he was happy with him, but that his old and dangerous lover Richard had blackmailed her. Louis is still in love with Marion and escapes from her to the countryside. But Comolli is chasing Marion in France accused of murdering Julie. <br /> <br /> "La Sirène du Mississipi" is a black film by the great director / writer François Truffaut, with an unconventional love story of passion, murder and love that hurts. The fatal woman Catherine Deneuve is amazing, probably at the height of her beauty and it is a delight to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the room. Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic, and the sequence when climbing the hotel wall is impressive. Catherine Deneuve makes this movie worthwhile and lends credibility to Louis's passion and lust. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sereia do Mississipi" ("La Sirena de Mississippi")
