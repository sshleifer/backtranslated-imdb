Cuba Gooding Jr. is back on top! Jesus, he did a great job in this movie! I really liked that movie. It's one of those good movies that makes you want to run and volunteer on a mission or something. Anyway, I would recommend watching this movie in the blink of an eye! Well worth the price of admission. And as for Cuba Gooding Jr., just give him his next Oscar right now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
