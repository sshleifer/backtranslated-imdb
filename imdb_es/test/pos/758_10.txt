I was not sure what to expect from the "driving lessons", I was not sure if Rupert Grint could play that role, but in the first few minutes I was completely hooked. At all times, the music, the performance and the stage were absolutely impressive. Julie Walters, as always, had an excellent performance as the eccentric and old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, equally good, had a fantastic performance as the romantic Ben. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I was forced. in involuntary tugs, bursts of laughter and waves of joy when Ben broke free of his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie. A very controversial story, probably quite exaggerated, but nevertheless, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone looking for a good British movie and an evening to relax. just enjoy yourself.
