This is most likely the best image that many will not see. It presented a culture in a real non-plywood way. A must for all who like Indie and for those who do not. I think this movie will attract more to the Indie scene. The performance was first class! Alice's character was portreyed so well. With perfect impotence. This movie should be taken to the mainstream! I think I would do it phenomenally! ALICE is the most real aspect of an element of our culture that I have seen since GO ASK ALICE. A look that has not been touched by the hand of Hollywood. Movies like this show young people that these things are not glamorous, but that they are real and convincing. If you liked APRIL PIECES you will love this one!
