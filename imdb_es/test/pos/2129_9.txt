This is a story well done with beautiful music, a lot of dancing, a lot of interaction, big sister / little sister (almost all positive) and many wishes granted. There are fun times that older children and adults will enjoy, such as when King Randolph exclaims, "They're just SHOES! Are not they?" And tender moments like when Princess Genevieve consoles her younger sister, Lacey, after a mistake. <br /> <br /> The animation may not be as good as Disney's, but it's still very good. Facial expressions are nuanced, especially for Genevieve, King Randolph, Duchess Rowena and her servant, Derek the shoemaker and little Princess Lacey. My only complaint about the animation is in the dance sequences where the dancing princesses become absolute copies of each other without the slightest deviation, even the three youngest ones copy the dance steps perfectly. I would have liked to see a little more individualism in the dance, considering that these girls are not professional dancers or choral dancers. <br /> <br /> The resolution of the story is handled intelligently to get rid of a villainy without really hurting it. There is some violence against the guards in the story, and the villain monkey is bad with other animals in the story. history. <br /> <br /> My 4-year-old daughter loves this movie and has seen it several times, and I have found it quite acceptable for her to watch.
