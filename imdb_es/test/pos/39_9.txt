From the first time I met the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in "She's Gotta Have It" by Spike Lee, I have been sold in the ranks of this extremely talented but terribly underestimated actress. She received an Emmy Award for her performance here and saying that it is well deserved is a masterpiece of understatement. <br /> <br /> Here it simply shines as strength and guidance in your community. This was especially moving for me because I grew up in this same period of time. The detail of the production was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooooo wonderful memories of life and times during the 50s and 60s and of women like Merkerson portrayed. She was well and skilfully accompanied by a hot cast with performances that one would enjoy over and over again. The first time I saw Macy Gray's name was in the credits and I went crazy. Her performance was so good that I did not even recognize her until about a third of the way. I am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a sense of another beautiful time in the African American culture that is done with great pleasure. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times, but infinitely more in tune with the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the analysis final is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices. <br /> <br /> This is a dignified and elegant presentation of African-American life and is surely destined to become a classic. You owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collection. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
