Many of us who went to high school probably did it well without having to take a Physics course, I know I did not. But after watching this program, I wish I had done it. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a guide to the 'Holy Grail of physics': the search to unify all the fundamental forces of the universe into a single 'master equation' that eluded Einstein during the last years of his life . Brian Green, a professor at Columbia University, presents this hallucinatory theory in a wonderfully simple way and leaves us with an even greater appreciation of the universe in which we live. <br /> <br /> We start with the tempting possibility of a 'master equation' that could unite and explain everything ... * everything! * in this universe, including the four fundamental forces that we know exist: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force and gravity. Green takes us to a tour of how our understanding of the universe was seen with the work of Newton, then Einstein, and then the revolution of physics at the quantum level. <br /> <br /> But it is at this point that we encounter a problem that has affected physicists for years, and that nobody has been able to solve yet. How can we unify all these forces that we know together? We find, as Green constantly points out throughout the problem, that the answer to this disconcerting problem could lie in the theory of the strings. However, if we are going to describe the universe in terms of string theory, there is a very high price to pay. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the mathematical equations of string theory are numbed by the mind, which, as a consequence, we find that we could possibly be living in a full universe, not just 3-dimensional that you and I we see every day plus 1 (by time), but we can live in a universe of * 11 * dimensions. But the mathematics that emerges from that theory does not stop there: there is a possibility that there may actually be parallel universes; Some of them by your side and me! Could we possibly take seriously a theory that leads to such consequences? As Green points out; we still have to discover it completely, but we do know that the mathematics that emerged from these equations already show us that the universe still has a lot to show us. <br /> <br /> For those of you who fear that you will not be able to understand the concepts of this program, do not fear. Professor Green does a wonderful job of eliminating mathematics and the more difficult concepts of physics and, instead, focuses more on the * concept *, which, when you take away all the mathematics, transforms from a monstrous beast into a incredibly simple and, as Green constantly points out, 'elegant' concept. The spectators of this program do not need previous antecedents in science; The concepts are so simple that even a child could understand them. <br /> <br /> When you finish this program, you will really come to understand how wonderful and mysterious is the universe in which we live.
