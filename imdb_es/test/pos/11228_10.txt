The third film by the Polish brothers is their best, most beautiful and imaginative film so far. Although many audiences will have a problem with Northfork's lack of traditional dramatic structure, "Keep it up, Jack!" The plot is difficult to summarize, so you should know that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, God with a cowboy hat, the sale of angel wings and a sick orphan (but everything works). The extraordinary photography of M. David Mullen makes each painting exciting and wonderful to see. The performances of the actors, who work with the inspiring and extravagant script of the Polish brothers, are perfect and give the film an emotional blow. The audacious member will be moved by the mythology and the folktale of the story, the comic and moving actors, and finally the incredible courage and command that Michael Polish shows behind the camera. Once again, all these incredible and seemingly unconnected elements unite magnificently in one of the most incredible things that you must exhaust and experience. A great, great, great movie !!!
