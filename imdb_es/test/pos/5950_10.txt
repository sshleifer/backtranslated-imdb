This is the last entry in the long series of films with the French agent, O.S.S. 117 (the French answer to James Bond). The series was launched in the early 1950s and generated at least eight films (none of which was released in the US). 'O.S.S.117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies' is a fun little comedy that should not ... repeat NO, it should be taken too seriously. Our protagonist is in the middle of a spy chase in Egypt (with Morroco making a stop in Egypt) to discover a long lost friend. What follows is the James Bond / Inspector Cloussou type of antics. Although our man is something of an open, sexist, homophobic xenophobe, it is treated as a pure farce (as I said, do not take it too seriously). Although there is a bit of harsh language and cartoon violence, it's basically fine for older children (over 12). As indicated above in the subject line, just sit down, pass the popcorn and just enjoy yourself.
