If you are looking for a movie that is fast and does not bore you, this is the place. It's fast-paced and fun with a decent performance from the characters. It's always difficult for me to see Mark Walhberg as something other than Marky Mark. That image burns in my mind forever. As an actor although it is quite good. This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see some twists and turns. I'll have to pick up this movie one day and buy it.
