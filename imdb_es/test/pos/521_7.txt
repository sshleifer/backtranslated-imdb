Witchcraft, or witchcraft, as it is commonly known in Europe, the beings with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) wake up from a nightmare that involves a witch. Jane's Mother & Father Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying an old abandoned hotel on an island about 50 miles from Boston, renovating and reopening it. Together with Jane and her son Tommy (Michael Manchester), Rose and Freddie plan to travel to the island with an architect named Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to verify the amount of work that needs to be done, they also meet with the farm. agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) and they hire a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to take them to the island. Once there, they enter the hotel and begin to inspect the property when they return to the boat. Sam dies and the boat is released to sail in the distance. They discover two unexpected guests in the form of a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) and his promised virgin Leslie (Leslie Cumming), who is investigating a book he is writing about the horrific legends and superstitions that surround the infamous island and hotel. As the night looms in a furious storm, it isolates them from the continent as a mysterious "lady in black" (Hildegard Knef) continues to appear as the ancient evil that resides in the hotel seeks new victims for demonic possession, human sacrifice and satanic rites. ... <br /> <br /> The director of this American Italian co-production film is involved in a mystery, since the IMDb lists Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin, but there are rumors that Joe D'Amato made the honors, in any way To be honest, despite his bad reputation, I found Witchery quite entertaining in such a bad way that it's good. The script credited to Harry Spalding and Daniele Stroppa in the IMDb again is confusing as well, since the real credit in the film itself is Daniel Davis, anyway, whoever wrote this did a decent job, please stop laughing . Deep down, it's a horror of the haunted house, but it adds some bloody deaths and a surreal feeling to everything. The different groups of characters have reasonable motives and did not bother me as much as I thought they could, it is not very well graphed, it does not make much sense and the dialogue is not exactly top-notch things, but in general Witchery entertained me for its duration of 95 odd minutes simply and plainly. It's reasonably well-accelerated, maybe a little slow to get going, but there are a lot of awkward and strange surreal deaths to keep one entertained. A part of Witchery that destroys part of its credibility is the so-called storm, there is no storm in sight and the sea is probably calm enough to swim, the so-called 'touch' of Witchery did not work either. Take a look at the silly expression on Cummings' face in that final frame. The hotel offers a good isolated location and adds a certain atmosphere to the film that has the unmistakable and indefinable feeling of "horror" at all times, a cheap horror. Technically, witchcraft is not so bad at all, it was obviously filmed on the spot, so it looks good at all times and, although it is not exactly the pinnacle of cinematic finesse, its overall production values ​​are slightly better than the expected. Violence and blood are typical of Euro, a woman has her lips sewn and hung inside a fireplace so she can not scream while others light her, someone is crucified and then burned alive, impaled on a swordfish, the veins of someone expands & pop & a woman is raped by a man without lips. Witchery was filmed in English, so there is no dubbing, as far as acting, David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair in the same film, what else can I say? Yes, the Hasselhoff ladies take off their shirts and for the boys Cummings takes off hers. Both Hasselhoff and Blair are very easy to see in this, however, the little boy is very annoying and can not really act at all. I'm sure that most movie fans will disagree with my opinions, but I still defend the fact that I liked it and I would see it happily, Witchery is quite funny and definitely worth seeing if you like "bad" movies or your horror fan in general.
