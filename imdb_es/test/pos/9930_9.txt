The genius of terror, Dario Argento is one of my personal favorite directors, and his films "Suspiria", "Phenomena" and "Profondo Rosso" occupy a prominent place in my personal list of favorites of all times. "Opera" of 1987 is another tempting and brilliant film that no Horror lover can afford to lose, and that will keep him on the edge of his chair from the beginning to the end. This surprising and ultraviolent Giallo could well be described as the teacher's most unpleasant film, which is quite important considering that Argento's films are not known precisely for the softness of their violence. The violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes Opera a cinematic censorship nightmare. <br /> <br /> - Warning! SPOILERS forward! - <br /> <br /> Just when Betty (Christina Marsillach), a young opera singer, is becoming successful, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath begins to harass her ... The murders are truly brutal and of a particularly sadistic nature . The killer places needles on Betty's tied eyelids, so she has to keep them open and watch while he brutally murders people close to her in an abominable manner. When it ends with the butcher shop, the killer frees Betty and leaves, only to return with other friends of his ... <br /> <br /> As usual in Argento's films, the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized . "Opera" is truly a brutal movie, and it is an elegant and atmospheric film. This film is absolutely tempting and pure suspense from the beginning to the end. The performances are totally very good, especially Christina Marsillach is brilliant up front. Marvelous beauty and great actress alike, Marsillach fits perfectly into her role as the talented singer, whose fear and horrible experiences are slowly making her crazy. Other great performances include those of Ian Charleston as horror film director who directs an opera, and Argento's real-life girlfriend, Daria Nicolodi, who has a role in many of his films. The work of the camera is excellent as in all the films of Argento and The enormous Opera House is an excellent stage that contributes a lot to the beauty of the film and its permanently spooky atmosphere. The score, which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal, is also great, even though I slightly missed Goblin's bright progressive rock soundtracks, which are such a distinctive element of most of the other films Argento "Opera" is truly a terrifying and absolutely stunning experience of Giallo. This is a must see for any Horror lover, and I recommend it to any other movie fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely tempting!
