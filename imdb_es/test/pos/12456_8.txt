While it is not closer to the Tarzan of Edgar Rice Burroughs than, say, the films of Johnny Wiesmuller do have their own peculiarity, and entertaining, bias in history. It's a well-made film by Tarzan. Beautiful landscapes, good photography, functional continuity and a shout from Tarzan echoing that described by Burroughs. All the players perform well. The only bad points I found were, I think, related. It moves slowly in some places. That slow movement? It makes this image too long. It could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which I think would have helped with the natural flow of plot and character development. But the rest of the movie works well enough to move these two difficult points and leave the viewer satisfied with the movie. Short version of all the above ... It's a very good Tarzan movie.
