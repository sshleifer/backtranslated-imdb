If you have not seen this movie, do it. It's a genremix like I've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some fun funny things, a black movie, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The second best orgasm played in the movie, surpassed only by Sally), a tone by Orson Welles mixed in a play of art . As a work of art, it does not have to be logical in the end, at least not logical for everyone ;-). I had a TV show on VHS, but I lent it to a former girlfriend and now I can not get it back. But the movie should be released on DVD in Austria on 10.06.03 and be sure, I'll buy it.
