When I first saw Flatliners, I was surprised. It had all the necessary characteristics of a good movie: the cast was excellent, the plot was magnificent and, in the case of the thrillers, there were real "emotions" in everything. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland offered a wonderful performance as the male protagonist in the piece, portraying a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by committing suicide and then come back to life, essentially " stealing "the secrets of death. Kevin Bacon offers excellent performance as the most morally decent counterpart of Keifer, while Julia Roberts offers her most convincing role. William Baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and, apparently, in intercourse. And Oliver Platt, in another outstanding performance, presents the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent. <br /> <br /> The story is relatively simple, although original, and the acting is refreshing, without a doubt an outstanding film for the genre, and one that has set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
