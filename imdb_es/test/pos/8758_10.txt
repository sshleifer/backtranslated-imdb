Four stories about drug trafficking in Europe are intertwined throughout this 6-part miniseries. In Germany, a businessman is arrested on drug charges and his wife tries to save her family by continuing her husband's illegal trade. Meanwhile, the British Interior Minister travels to Pakistan to negotiate an aid package that hopes to stop the flow of drugs from that country. However, while doing so, her own daughter succumbs to heroin addiction, destroying her family. This is the miniseries on which the movie and the American miniseries were based. The original is much superior to its two descendants. The poverty and despair of the third world are portrayed very well. It is raw, intransigent and brutal.
