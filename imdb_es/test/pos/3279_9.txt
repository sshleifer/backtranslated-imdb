Thank you, Mario Van Peebles, for informing us not only about the existence of black cowboys, but for providing a compelling story that was easy to follow. <br /> <br /> The plot, the background, the music and the talent were top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the story of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Do you ever play a good boy? <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to expand their thinking. This is an excellent film and I feel privileged to have seen it. With luck, you will feel the same.
