This neo-film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth-century American films that seem to involve corrupt characters, fast cars, a ribbon of highways and, of course, a lot of weapons handled by people who seem to have never taken a weapon. Safety course. The actors are the best reason to see "Black Day, Blue Night". There's the afternoon, great J.T. Walsh ("Swing Blade", "Pleasantville", "Red Rock West", "The Last Seduction" and many more), which made many novels of neo-movies (see also "Breakdown"). Then there's Michele Forbes from the television series "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "Homicide." (In a supporting role, there is even the late Bejamin Lum, who also appeared in a Star Trek episode titled "The Naked Now"). A kind of spoiler: a clue really: only the most innocent survive, but innocence is a relative term in a movie like this, and you probably will not guess who is innocent before the last roll.
