During the Sci-Fi TZ marathon on January 31, 1999, this episode was the last one broadcast in the 20th century in my time zone (east). It was New Year's Eve, and when the clown starts singing, "We're here because we're here, because we're here, because we're here ..." I realized it was an intelligent nod from TZ. New Year's Eve because that melody is also the melody of Old Lang Syne. Coincidence? We will never know. <br /> <br /> I love this story for the little details: the dancer's tear, the clown's antics and the end of hitting yourself in the head. This and the Art Carney Santa TZ are the only ones that refer to Christmas. <br /> <br /> My five best personal episodes, after five characters ...: 1. The hunting 2. The later hours 3. The hitchhiker 4. The lonely 5. Lost girl
