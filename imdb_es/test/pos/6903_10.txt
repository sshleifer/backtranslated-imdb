(Note: I saw "I SELL THE DEAD" at the Glasgow International Film Festival on January 20, 2009.) "Selling the Dead" is a black and black horror comedy set in medieval times, starring Dominic Monaghan (Lost, Lord of the rings). Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Larry Fessenden (Session 9) and Angus Scrimm (Ghost). <br /> <br /> The film begins with the grave robber Willie Grimes (Fessenden), still indignant and without remorse, being dragged to the guillotine and executed. His apprentice and partner in crime, Arthur Blake (Monaghan) is locked in the tower waiting for his turn when Father Duffy (Perlman), a whiskey priest with an unhealthy interest in the occult, visits him with the apparent intention of recording Blake's final confession. However, it soon becomes clear that Duffy's main interest lies in the more ... supernatural side of Blake's exploits. Most of the plot here is told in flashback while Monaghan regains Duffy with stories of his macabre career. <br /> <br /> Initially, Grimes and Blake begin as simple body thieves with clever cunning, working on the macabre Dr. Quint (Scrimm), an insensitive and corrupt anatomist who uses blackmail as an influence on our two anti-heroes, and he loves his work in an unhealthy way. The couple has their first encounter with the undead when, one night, Quint sends them on a mission to a dark moor illuminated by the moon to retrieve a corpse that has been buried mysteriously at a crossroads, apparently according to an ancient custom. But there is something different in this corpse. This has been wrapped in cloves of garlic ... and buried with a stake through his heart ... <br /> <br /> After a terrifying encounter, they not only devise a plan to get rid of the intriguing Doctor's machinations, but they also discover a secret subculture of occultists who will pay a good amount of money for the corpses, and even better money for the LIVING SPECIMENS of the undead. This leads our intrepid duo to the hidden underworld of the "ghoul hunt" trade, where they are confronted not only with vampires, monsters and zombies (and another paranormal entity for which I will not ruin the surprise), but also rival ghoul hunters in the form of the inborn and murderous Murphy clan. <br /> <br /> I entered I Sell the Dead expecting a low budget, slightly distracted and low budget cooler. I was not prepared for the incredible imagination, the giddy mood, the quality of the acting, the great dialogue, the dense atmosphere and the pure personality that makes I Sell the Dead a strong early contender for my horror movie of the year. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a couple of vague aspects, the production values ​​are really fantastic for a film with such a low budget: it seems that it was made for around $ 20 million, and I was surprised when the director He told the audience that it was done for much less than half of that (although he was not willing to give exact figures since the film was still sold to distributors). The "look" and tone of the film is a visual comic somewhere between Tim Burton and Hammer Horror, with small insertions of Creepshow-esquire art. The plot is wonderfully surreal, but the idea of ​​a hidden underworld, which runs parallel to everyday life but that the general population can not or does not want to believe, is one that really makes a lot of sense within the context of the movie. /> <br /> The performance, as you would expect from this cast, is first class. The characters develop surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors present their lines marked with scripts with the right amount of deadpan language to make the dialogue hilarious and realistic. Angus Scrimm also performs well in a brief but memorable role as the violent and menacing anatomist who plays Dr. Quinn. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I loved it. It's been a long time since I was entertained with a movie. I struggle to find something bad to say about it. Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still discover and fall in love with 20, 30, 40 years in the future.
