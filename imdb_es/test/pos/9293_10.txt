This show is one of the best Comedies made in Australia, as it makes fun of almost anything, which is what many of our audiences want. Some of the best parts of the program are advertising tests that prove how an advertisement would work in real life. What is really great about the program is how original it is and the fact that there are people (persecutors) who love doing what they do and who does not. This program has a lot of fragments that can break someone like the advertising test that I mentioned, Mr. Ten questions where he asks 10 questions very fast in front of famous celebrities like Hugh Jackman and the Beach Boys, the temporary ones. as The Chasers Emmys and those who have been there since the beginning, such as What have we learned from current issues this week? In general, I qualify slim to show 98%.
