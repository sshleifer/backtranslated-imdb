I have seen this piece of perfection :-) during the fantasy film festival in Berlin and when I left the cinema I felt like "drugged". I have seen many movies, but there are some that I would call perfect like koyaanisqatsi or fight against the club: the subconscious cruelty is definitely one of them. Half of the people left the screening in Berlin and I can understand them absolutely! This is not a movie for "normal" people with dreams and illusions! A person who lives in their dreams day by day and does not want to see all the horror in our life and on our planet will be very surprised with this movie. If someone reads this now, he has seen s.c. and also thinks that it's great: just contact me, until now I have not met anyone who shares my opinion, it would be great! This movie earns 10 points out of 10 !!! Finally, I am very sorry for my bad English. I am not a studied person! (und das ist auch gut so * g *)
