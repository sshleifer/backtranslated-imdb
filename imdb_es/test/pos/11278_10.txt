This type of anguish can only be within a young person who is very serious about his religion and his place in this world. As the text says at the beginning of the film, these images are dead: they are already the past and they have been right from the moment the product was ready. But that is only for the manufacturer of these "products": perhaps for someone who is in the same state of mind (I believe that many people, at least those who are seriously interested in religion, go through the same terrible anguish and Doubts in his personal development). And that is, of course, the reason why art is made in the first place: identification and consolation among other human beings. <br /> <br /> This film uses the "classical" techniques of experimental cinema very well. And this is where those techniques are, in my opinion, of the best possible use: as an instrument to tell stories and create an atmosphere, not only as pure abstractions or as an end in themselves. These "tricks" have already been done many times. Some other films that I imagine have influenced / inspired this director, are "Eraserhead" and "Nosferatu". It is interesting how these techniques make this film totally timeless: there is nothing contemporary in this movie. Or nothing of any other specific time either. It could have been done a thousand years ago. <br /> <br /> It is interesting in this story how these people treat this newborn holy child: they use it selfishly for their own purposes, and they do not even try to listen to Him. They beat him, ripped out his intestines and castrated him. They drag their body (alive) by force from one place to another. And they do the same kind of violence to their mother. The story also reminds me of Borges' short story "The Brodie Report." Also the criticism towards the practices of the Christian institutions reminds me of the great "El Topo". <br /> <br /> Disgusting clock sometimes, but beautiful. Very simple, thought and concentrated. Very strong film, almost too strong. All human energy has concentrated on this. This movie also shows that when you have the passion and ideas, you can make a movie with a budget of around zero. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that it was a bit difficult to see a "contemporary" movie. viewer like me, for the experimental. It was so slow and demanding. But after all, it's worth the suffering. I have to give ten points just for the effort that someone makes in this type of film.
