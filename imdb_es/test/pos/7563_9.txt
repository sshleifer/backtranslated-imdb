What a great movie! It is a moving story about four high school friends growing up in the 1960s. Throughout the decade, friends are somewhat separate, but refuse to see each other from time to time. There are many tragedies, but there are also many happy moments that make you laugh and smile. It is a story full of hearts of life, love and friendship. Definitely a must for fans of the drama.
