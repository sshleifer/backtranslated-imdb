Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer and composer from Lubbock, Texas, left his mark on the modern music staff. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system to record her rock-a-billy sound. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with bop rhythms. Holly would take her place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as voices of teenage angst. <br /> <br /> This easy-to-see biography is not without its flaws. Some situations, events, places and even names were not correct for several reasons. What makes this movie so believable is that Gary Busey made his own song on Holly's part. A well-produced soundtrack became a multi-million dollar seller. <br /> <br /> Busey was nominated for an Oscar. Other outstanding stars are Don Stroud, Conrad Janis, Charles Martin Smith and Maria Richwine.
