Easily, Lucio Fulci's most respected film, "Do not Torture a Duckling" is well known for its thematic theme, its frightening images and its solid history. Terror comes upon a small Italian town when young people begin to appear murdered, involving the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in the mystery. Was the scary hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the whores? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to the frequent representation of the majority of fans in the violent content of the film, I consider it much more based on the plot; presenting only a real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and tables). In no way does this detract from the positive attributes that this film offers. Fulci is shown to be completely capable of developing a dark and disturbing giallo with murders of children, black magic and, of course, a good complete set of callers ... Although I am particularly more fond of the "Lizard in a woman of Fulci". Skin "and" New York Ripper "," Do not Torture a Duckling "dominates the giallo genre as a moody and convincing murder mystery.
