The Stooges are back and more fun than ever. In my opinion, "Brideless Groom" was probably the best movie of Shemp. <br /> <br /> Shemp has the opportunity to inherit $ 500,000 (which were probably more than a million dollars compared to today's) from his dead uncle. BUT! There is a catch. He has to marry someone that day at 6 o'clock. Shemp is a bachelor who does not have many admirers, except for one of his brave and aggressive singing students. But he does not want it, he wants someone a little more in the model Victoria's Secret model woman. But, obviously, he has no other choice, since he is not the same Collin Ferrel. But when he prints on the documents he will inherit all that money if he is married, his ex-girlfriends are in the attack "I want my man back". <br /> <br /> What a great puppet movie! This is up to the winners of all puppet films! <br /> <br /> 9/10
