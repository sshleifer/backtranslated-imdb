Miyazaki's studio Ghibli shows his wonderful touch animating, infusing life, into every little action of the characters in Ponyo. When Sosuke so carefully lowers his small boat to reach the red fish, you know you will have a great time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are interesting and really interest you. They visually recall other stories, Riisa looks like an adult Nausicaa with a son, an elderly woman in a wheelchair remembers the witch in Howl's Moving Castle. <br /> <br /> The presence of the elements, wind, rain and sea. With its large and powerful waves, it is so strong that I think it has never been evoked in any way in any other film. It is a simple story, vaguely inspired by "the little mermaid", and reaches the heart of the audience, like Totoro, the true masterpiece of the other Miyazaki. <br /> <br /> An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the final credits. Do not miss it
