I discovered this late one night at Turner Classics. I kept telling myself "I'll turn it off as soon as it's no longer funny", but needless to say, I observed it all the way. <br /> <br /> I'm addicted to movies but I've never heard this movie (or if I did it in 1971, I forgot it). It is worth seeing only because of Goldie Hawn's performance as the naive naive language. His performance is a revelation in this movie. Yes, the script is sharp and excellent (when was the last time they made a Hollywood comedy with a smart script?), But their performance is extraordinary. I never realized how funny Goldie could be, and that makes his later appearances in roles like Laugh-In and Private Benjamin a bit sad. In his later career, it is too exaggerated compared to his minimalist and perversely funny appearance. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to see the young Matthau, the great Bergman and the star cast, but it's Goldie Hawn that will make this movie worth watching again.
