"MY WIFE AND CHILDREN", in my opinion, is an absolute classic of ABC! I have not seen all the episodes, but I still enjoyed it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed. One of them was where Junior (George O. Gore II) got his driver's license. If you want to know why, you must have seen it for yourself. Before finishing this, I would like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the suits were well designed and the writing was always very solid. In conclusion, although it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend that you catch it in case it leaves the air forever.
