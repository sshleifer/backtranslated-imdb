This night I saw the new movie of The D in a special special screening, and I was so surprised by its sheer greatness that I felt I had to appear in IMDb and spread the word. It is true that I was already a big fan of D's work: I loved the HBO series and I listen to his music weekly (there's nothing better than singing), but this appreciation really made me feel more apprehensive when attending tonight's screening (Because "We've all been disappointed once or another for something we love when we tried to jump to the big screen." With "The Pick of Destiny" from Tenacious D, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> few words, this movie is more difficult than anything else I've seen and it's more fun and majestic than anything Peter Jackson, Pixar, and Will Ferrell could produce together, tell the story of the D before we got to know them, establishing intriguing stories of Kage and Jables education, their coming together and how they were inspired to write songs about things like Lee, Sasquatch and Dio, the most important thing is that they reveal the true inspiration of the world's greatest song, " Tribute ", and how it came to be (which is different from the version of the HBO series). After you've seen it, you probably can not remember it (hence the Tribute), but your mind will always be a change for its genius. <br /> <br /> I do not go to the cinema very often anymore due to the high ticket price and the hassle of parking, paying outrageous concession fees, etc., but I usually make exceptions when starring someone I really love or related with something of the same variety. "The Pick of Destiny" was so good that I have no qualms about seeing it again when it is published all over the country, and I plan to convince all my friends to go too. Last week we saw "Borat" and we loved it, but this is honest, goodness, TEN TIMES BETTER. For anyone who really loves rock music and comedic brilliance, watch this movie. The talent of these guys is so great that I should not hesitate to support their cause. They will not be disappointed and the Lords of the Rock will smile favorably.
