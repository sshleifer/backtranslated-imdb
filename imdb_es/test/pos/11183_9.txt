The Curse of Monkey Island has always been my favorite of the series. A vibrant visual aspect, an excellent soundtrack and a brilliant cast of voices create a memorable and humorous adventure. <br /> <br /> As for the graphics, the game is definitely not a disappointment. Although some corners have been cut, the overall feel of the game is reminiscent of Disney's Long Feature Animations. The gameplay is simple and even a beginner will understand it soon. The game also offers a bit more for the more experienced players with its Mega Monkey mode. <br /> <br /> The voice is one of my favorites. The compassionate voice of Dominic Armato makes Guybrush complete and Alexandra Boyd is just as charming as Elaine. Earl Boen becomes a wonderfully sinister but exaggerated villain, LeChuck. Also the charm of the game is added by memorable characters such as Wally (Neil Ross), Murray (Denny Delk) and one of my personal favorites Haggis McMutton (Allan Young, voice of Scrooge McDuck). My hat is also going for the late Kay Kuter and his memorable supporting role as Griswold Goodsoup. <br /> <br /> The wonderful and tropical soundtrack of Michael Land once again adorns the adventure of Monkey Island, which comprises some of the best Tunes in the business. The game is not perfect and some places are not as detailed as others, but I had no complaints with the simple end of the game that I found very satisfying.
