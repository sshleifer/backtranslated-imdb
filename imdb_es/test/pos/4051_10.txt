In the mid / late 80's, an OAV anime by the title of "Bubblegum Crisis" (which I think is a military slang term for when the technical team goes crazy) made its video debut, inspired by "Blade Runner", "The Terminator" and maybe even "Robocop", with a little bit of Batman / Bruce Wayne - Iron Man / Tony Stark and the power of the Charlie's Angel girl incorporated in good measure. During 8 episodes, the general story was that in the 21st century in Tokyo, Japan, in the year 2032-2033, the living machines called Boomers performed manual labor and sometimes caused problems. A special, SWAT as the force of law, the Advanced Police (AD Police for short) was formed to handle the boomers, but they were mostly ineffective, which led to the millionaire scientist Sylia Stingray, the daughter of the scientist who he made the boomers, to create four motorized combat armor (hard suits) that women must use to fight the boomers and fight against the evil corporation that produced the boomers, GENOM. That group is known as the Knight Sabers, and in addition to ring leader Sylia, her band of rebellious women included Priss Asagiri, a rock and roll galley with a passion for motorcycles and a disdain for police officers, Linna Yamazaki, instructor of aerobics with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends, and Nene Romanova, a young ADP officer and expert hacker (the first in a long line). Meanwhile, GENOM is represented by Quincy, a tall, gaunt man who owns the company, his youngest assistant, Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3) and an annoying boomer named Largo. Other characters included Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two AD police detectives (Leon appeared in an anime / anime prequel, "AD Police Files" that I heard was very dark), his overweight and bald boss, the boss , Sylia's younger brother, Mackey, and a fun little mechanic known as Dr. Raven, who apparently helps Sylia keep the costumes. Apart from the general history of Knight Sabers and AD Police VS GENOM, there was also another story involving a friend of Linna who was apparently the daughter of a large family of criminals, the annoying Largo who tried to usurp GENOM and several Prisons. quiere-vengange For a story about minor characters. Oh, and did I mention there were indications that Sylia could have been a boomer? <br /> <br /> Well, it was a big clock, full of chaos and chaos and even some very nice pop songs, but it was not without its flaws, some of which, unfortunately, were due to the fact that the series it was discontinued after episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in total. So some of the stories, like Largo's scheme (or the schemes), the family of Linna's unfortunate friend and the origins of Sylia, were never resolved. Another problem with the series was that at that time Priss was the most popular character, so a good part of the series focused on her, and unfortunately, most episodes focused on Priss were basically focused on Priss seeking justice / revenge for some. secondary character who had never appeared before, but who turned out to be a friend of hers, however, rarely went out of her way for her, the Knights Sabers, who always got her out of trouble and for some reason cared deeply for her. being (just to be fair, he went to rescue Linna in episode 7, and her boyfriend was killed by a boomer and the ADP acted badly in the investigation). This means that we really could not focus on the most interesting story of Sylia, or even the day-to-day antics of Nene and Linna. Linna had two episodes oriented around her, which referred to her friend with the Mafia family, while Nene managed to get hooked on the last episode for her, which showed that her eternal good spirits were a true spirit and not a vertigo. Nene also had to put a good use of his computer skills, or sometimes he just acted like adorable nonsense, which put his time on the screen and his character's development a few notches above poor Linna, who she was often pushed to the bottom with her alone. greed and its tendency to eat grooms to get their attention. Do not get me wrong, I like it and I love the general concept of all this, but it irritated me a little. In addition, this is one of the finalists of the characteristics of "worst voice dub in English of all time", which means that it is better that you stay with the Japanese. Some of the voices were good (some really matched the people in their characters) but others were simply flat and without passion or, in the case of Priss, they were really exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, Tokyo 2040 appears and practically throws all that out the window. A few years in advance, the story here is that after the earthquakes tore apart Tokyo, the GENOM boomers rebuilt the city into a great old paradise, except that the boomers still have a tendency to fly off the handle, which makes the AD Police is formed followed by the formation of the knights' sabers. So the general story is the same, but the background stories of the characters and the appearance and attitudes of the characters have changed a lot. <br /> <br /> 1) Originally, Sylia had short violet-black hair and brown eyes. she dressed like a severe business woman, her own and distant from others. Sylvia 2040 has a style more than a super model, dresses more provocatively and has white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color according to light (the range goes from blue to purple to silver and the eyes sometimes look purple or gray), and also 2040 Sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman who gets out of control when she is not in public, and possibly keeps even more secrets than before. Sylia does not take that much risk either on the battlefield, since it is rather a person who stays in the mobile pit here, but struggles when he has to. <br /> <br /> 2) Originally, Priss was a short woman with an afro and very bad temper, always fought with people who offended her, always bit more than what she could chew, etc. 2040 Priss, however, has followed the path of Clint Eastwood's solitary - very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original Sylia could say), so it is not really attached to anyone. In addition, her hair is more spicy and cat-like (a big improvement) and is dressed in leather like Trinity from "The Matrix" (although much less annoying than before, unfortunately, the writers screw her at the end when they reveal their reasons for hating the ADP). <br /> <br /> 3) Originally, Linna had this great black hair that was going for her, but now her hair is shorter, more brown and, well, more like the 90s. 2040 Linna is also a lady of the office that has bad luck with being sexually harassed. As if to apologize for the way it was treated by the OAV writers, the 2040 writers dedicated the first 6 episodes to Linna, writing her as a new country girl in the city but determined to meet the Knight Sabers and win a place with them. , what it eventually does. <br /> <br /> 4) Originally a girl with short red hair who was often the victim of teasing and eating lots of sweets. Nene is now a blond haired girl who likes to joke and drink. boat shots to ADP detective Leon McNichol (revenge for him playing with her in the OAV?) and other characters, including his older sister surrogate, Linna and Mackey, the "brother" of Sylia, with whom he feels in love. Cockey and arrogant, she still eats a lot of candy and is a master hacker, but she finally deflates and grows beyond her state of comic relief. <br /> <br /> 5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a tall, stoic man, stout and handsome with long black hair (he looks like Adrian Paul of TV Highlander), replaces Dr. Raven of the series before and now he is the man who gives maintenance to Sylia's hard suits. Nigel is also Sylia's lover, but you would not know by his behavior. He is a kind of father / big brother / mentor to Mackey. <br /> <br /> 6) Leon and Daley are back, but of course differently. The original Lion was a tall, pretty boy, built like a baseball player with straight, dark brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, skinny jeans, and always with a revolver that could magically pack more whallop than a howitzer. if required; although he was not really a bad guy at heart, he was a bit of an idiot, but it served mainly as a comic relief, since he was trying to pursue Priss in a romantic way (exactly what he saw in her is a mystery) but occasionally he and Daley served as information guide for important points of the plot. In addition, the original Daley was a rather muscular redhead who wore pink / purple suits, as he was an extravagant homosexual character who always hit Leon when he did not provide important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a pretty boy, but rather your typical strong and robust guy, with spiked black hair, brown eyes, muscular and tall sports, a brown leather jacket and blue boots (actually it looks a bit like to Arnold Schwarzenegger, or maybe a pumped-up Colin Farrell, or Hugh Jackman), and still carries a revolver, a BIG one, but it's not as powerful as before. Although 2040 Leon still has a bit of attitude attitude (especially when approaching Priss), he is not as stupid as in the previous series, but he has a bad temper and Nene and Daley easily annoy him. (He also drinks too much coffee). Oh, and Leon is still behind Priss, but he's a lot luckier this time. Daley, meanwhile, is now a taller man (but not as tall as Leon) more handsome with red glasses, a white suit, green eyes and light brown hair, and carries a large machine gun (actually looks like James Marsden from the movies of X-Men); Daley is much more intelligent and more assertive in 2040 than the OAV and, although it is not entirely clear, his homosexual tendencies have almost completely disappeared, except for a moment of what seems to be jealousy when he learns that Leon asks for the mail Priss electronic . <br /> <br /> 7) Brian J. Mason (what does "J" mean?) is back, and so is Quincy, but Mason is much more the main villain here, with Quincy as co-villain, since He is no longer an imposing figure of terror, but a vegetable with a lot of batteries and cables connected to him. Mason now sports smooth brown hair instead of black hair like he did in the OAV (he actually looks like OAV Leon in a suit) and is very from the Alan Rickman villain school. <br /> <br /> 8) Although he is a pervert in the first series, Mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. Of course, there are many different things about Mackey in 2040, but they will not be revealed here. <br /> <br /> 9) Sylia now has a partner, an Alfred-the-butler named Henderson, who cares about her and the gang. <br /> <br /> 10) In the original series, the boomers were like the Replicators in "Blade Runner" Armed with their own thoughts, feelings and ambitions, but in 2040 they are more of the kind of dumb monsters. Most of the time they are only big robots that do what they are programmed to do (heavy work, combat, cleaning, etc.) and have this tendency to "go malicious", which means trying to evolve and become a monster. in the process. <br /> <br /> What does remain is the theme of the technology of humanity VS (do machines have a soul?). Unfortunately, this series, although it is well animated and well written, only runs 26 episodes, so it moves faster than we would like, especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters, and unfortunately, it's still over. on a cliff hanger with unresolved plot fragments (which I will not discuss here.) What saves this program and makes it what it is, however, are the characters, a colorful cast of screwballs that are, from lonely stoic people , psychopaths, genocides Crazy, hard-collar police, sardonic intellectuals, wise sages and adorable innocents, much more diverse than before and with much more to play, are enough to make you want this show to have lasted longer. <br /> < It's not great, but it's a good watch, and the dub in English (by ADV) is pretty good, but not without some flat dots, but it's certainly better than the dub in the original.
