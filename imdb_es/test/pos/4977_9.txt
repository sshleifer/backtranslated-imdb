This is the western classic. The good one, Glenn Ford, the great hero, the ex-soldier, the man who would never hold a gun again. Finally, he has to defend the evil baron of the land, Edward G. Robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants it all. Then there's Barbara Stanwyck, the real ruler of the chicken coop. The wife of Edward G. Robinson, who will not allow anyone to get in his way, even making Edward G. Robinson look weak. She is so evil that everyone else pales next to her blind ambition and cruelty to govern the valley and everyone in it. The brightness in her eyes when she sees that people face death for her is disconcerting. The wait is worth it. Introduce yourself to a young Brian Keith and a few others, and you will have a drama that stands out on its own. With the necessary stampedes, shootings, ambushes and close-ups of riding cowboys and you have a great western. Without giving anything in sight, there are enough twists and turns so this is not just a standard cowboy. -above.
