If this movie had been made in the 50s or 60s, critics and fans would have praised it. Myself, I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. It's not a timeless piece, and it has not aged well over the years, but it's nice to see, though. As for the performance of Mrs. Ritchie in the movie? It's not the best on the planet, but it adds to the unique slapstick comedy aspirations of the movie, and shows Madonna's comedic sense (often underestimated). Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an ex-convict who was accused of a crime she did not commit. Griffin Dunne plays the unfortunate future boyfriend / puppet who is sent to accompany her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occur, thus creating the plot. (And there's one, friends!) Give the movie a chance. You may be surprised at how funny it is.
