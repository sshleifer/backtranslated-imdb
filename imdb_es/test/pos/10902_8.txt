After reading the comment made about this film and seeing it now, I can understand how the person felt about it. The decisions made were after listening to common sense. When the movie came out, I had heard the information about how it was produced. The story was made from a real event. During an award program, an actor, thanking the small people, attributed the award to a former school teacher, surprising the person. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people go out "out of the closet" more every day. Each exit is different for each person. In real life, the outcome of any individual will also be different. And being willing to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to achieve personal happiness. For those around them, joy and honest acceptance can make life much more fulfilling. For the film, the outcome of Howard's departure is much more comical than in real life. And the acceptance of the community showed the others that Howard was himself and nothing else. <br /> <br /> In general, the performances were crazy. Memorable quotes and the use of music add to the types of stereo in the world, but taken with tongue and cheek humor. It's a movie Sit, watch with an open mind and laugh.
