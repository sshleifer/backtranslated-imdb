I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and should have been a love job for Eleanor Bergstein. The main actors (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Beals, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) were very well selected and played their role with excellence. It was a very edifying movie that I wish would be available on tape or DVD. A rare jewel.
