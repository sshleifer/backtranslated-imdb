I just saw Northanger Abbey in the local library and did not expect much. Imagine my surprise at this gothic delight! Northanger Abbey is one of the most spooky places you've ever seen, with empty corridors and ornate rooms full of hidden secrets. The glory of the film is that it never reveals everything: your imagination runs free, running with the imagination of the main character, a Kathrine M. She is a girl of extravagant imaginations, a gothic fantasy reader that she brings (and our) real world. <br /> <br /> If I used a word to describe this excellent film, it would be surreal. The dreams are woven throughout the film, improving the mood. Sometimes, it is difficult to say what is real and what is not; I think this is intentional. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere reigns supreme. Music is not what you would expect from a Jane Austen movie: it is mysterious, based on flute and drum, high and obsessed by a current of fear. If you play a soft and pleasant melody in the Northanger Abbey, it would be a positive invitation. Now, it's a premonition, a palace of dark and stiff-walled madmen. (But! The characters! You'll have to see them for yourself!) <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a pleasant evening, look no further than Northanger Abbey.
