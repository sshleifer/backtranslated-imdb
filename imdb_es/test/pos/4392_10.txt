I thought that this movie was great! I saw this when it came out in theaters, so I do not remember all the details. I remember it was based on the story of Homer in Odysseus. The places and events of the names have changed, but you can still see the resemblance to the story. <br /> <br /> I found it funny how they got into trouble and how they got out of it. I really enjoyed this version of old stories modernized much better than the Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes. <br /> <br /> I'll agree that in some parts of the story sometimes it gets a bit silly, but in general it's all a great adventure with some renowned actors.
