Sometimes, reading the comments of the users in IMDB fills me with desperation for the species. So that anyone can discard 2001: a space odyssey as "boring" should not have any interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of making movies. Finally, I understand why most of Hollywood's productions are so shallow and empty: they comprise their audience. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, those who can not appreciate Kubrick's achievement are still a minority. The majority of the spectators can see the intelligence and the great virtuosity that contributed to the creation of this epic. This is the movie that put science in "science fiction," and its representation of space travel and the future of humanity remains unsurpassed to this day. He was so far ahead of his time that humanity has not yet caught up. <br /> <br /> 2001 is mainly a technical film. The reason why it is slow and full of minutes is because the objective was to realistically visualize the future of technology (and the past, in the impressive opening scenes). The biggest strength of the film is in the details. Remember that when this movie was made, the man had not yet reached the moon ... but there he is in 2001, and that's just the beginning of the trip. To create a vision of the future so incredibly detailed that 35 years later, it is still the best we have, and I can not believe how some of the shots were made. The only notable error of the film was the optimism with which he predicted the technological (and social) development of humanity. It's a shame that the year 2001 did not look like the 2001 film, not Kubrick. <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible special effects, the camera work and the stage design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food to think about what it means to be human and where the human race is headed. Yes, the ending is strange and difficult to understand, but that is the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke began the task of visualizing it, now it is up to the audience to continue. There is no orderly resolution, nor a definitive end point, because then the audience could stop thinking after the last roll. I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick is not going to let us go so lightly. <br /> <br /> I am pleased to see that this movie is in the 100 best IMDB movies. And I just wish he was even taller. Stanley Kubrick is one of the best filmmakers the world has ever known, and 2001 his best achievement. 10/10.
