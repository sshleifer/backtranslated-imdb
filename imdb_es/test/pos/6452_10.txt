City Streets is incredibly modern, technically modern, for a film made in 1931. In addition, the powerful magnetism of Gary Cooper captivated the viewer, which attracted public attention. The plot is quite elaborate and clear. The scenarios, the decoration, are exceptional in every detail. All the actors are above average. I keep guessing how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting, photography, could have been so brilliant. I could not find a fault, understanding that the scenes on the road (bumpy ride) with the large screen of moving images in the background was the best they could get in 1931. In general, I found this film excellent and very vivid thanks to Gary Cooper the charisma.
