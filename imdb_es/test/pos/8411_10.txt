I've always loved "Gone With The Wind" and I've seen it several times. However, his end left me not only "hanging", but depressed, with a feeling of hopelessness. Finally, in "Scarlett," Ripley led us to a very plausible and satisfying ending ("beginning") of the original story. <br /> <br /> It follows that someone of Scarlett's obvious intelligence (as originally written) will eventually grow up. Although, like most people, I fell in love with Scarlett at GWTW, I grew tired of her constant insipid childishness to the point of exasperation, and I was disappointed that Mitchell did not show Scarlett using that obvious intelligence to make an attempt to grow emotionally. . . Fortunately, someone finally did it. (After all, is not that annoying immaturity that was in conflict with her beauty and intelligence the reason why Rhett finally surrendered to her in the first place?) I think Ripley did an excellent job of describing that backward process, and Whalley ... Kilmer did an excellent job of portraying him. Joanne WK has all the fire, the exuberance and the smart spark, just like Vivian Leigh, and she is certainly at least as beautiful, if not more so. <br /> <br /> There was, there is and there will always be only one Clark Aguil√≥n. However, if I had to choose an actor among the thousands I have been exposed to interpret in his biography, it would definitely be Timothy Dalton. Dalton possesses the same elegant charm as Gable, which is essential to the character of Rhett. I can not imagine anyone else who can get close. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, both Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were superbly chosen and the only actors who could have played Scarlett and Rhett. I think his performances did justice not only to the late actors, but also to the spirit of his characters. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the whole cast. Julie Harris was her usual lovely presence, and Jean Smart was an adorable kick. Even Ashley's character was played very well by Stephen Collins, and the progression of his relationship with Scarlett was totally credible. <br /> <br /> The story got a little complicated in Ireland, but that's life, after all, and I still found it entertaining. <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoyed the fruits of Ripley's imagination. I wish I had written it! <br /> <br />
