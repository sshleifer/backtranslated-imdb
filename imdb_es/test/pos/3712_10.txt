A beautifully photographed and rhythm short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just before and after Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the visual aspect of the film: naturalistic and, at the same time, poetic. Great work from a great D.P., David Boyd. <br /> <br /> Despite being a family movie, the story never becomes a novel or a saccharine. We understand and believe the motivation that drives the young person in his or her odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and I do not question why he intends to do what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this moment of crisis. The boy is tough and Jonathan Furr's performance is excellent, as is Ron Perlman's veteran performance.
