This is a charming and charming epic fantasy with a lot of heart. I got lost in this sweet movie watching it at Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. It is really romantic with a moving message. The artwork and the effects are visually surprising and the fact that the director is an amazing artist is so obvious. Frames are like looking at art in movement. It also has a cast of strong and talented actors. What a wonderful surprise to see Joss Ackland, he is simply a perfect fairy tale King. Sarah Douglas is great as the villain and Christine Taylor and Tom Schultz make a lovely romantic couple. The fact that the film was made with a ridiculously small indie film budget just surprises me. It may not be the Hollywood spot we're flooded with, but it's a very good movie to rent and enjoy curled up on your couch on a rainy Saturday. Do not forget the microwave popcorn. That is my advice. Just enjoy it.
