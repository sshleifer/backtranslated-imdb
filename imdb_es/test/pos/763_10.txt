This movie is a great movie. The movie shows so many themes, all in one incredible movie. Driving Lessons centers around Ben (Rupert Grint), a shy 17-year-old who is coming of age. The film continues on how Ben is fed up with his dominant mother and how he just wants to be himself. Ben meets Evie, with whom he makes a very special bond. The two embark on a journey and, in the process, Ben finds himself and the relationship that he and Evie share. This is the movie you see alone or with someone else. No matter what happens, everyone will feel what Ben is going through in the movie. It's a very moving movie that only makes you think if your driving lessons were as emotional or as fun as Ben's lessons.
