Fado is a sad, almost blues style of Portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly throughout the film. As one of the main characters (Igor) explains, it also means destiny. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is destiny that unites the two main characters, Paco and Alex, and triggers the problems that arise. <br /> <br /> In general I enjoyed it a lot. It begins as a drama / road movie 'on the down and outs' and becomes a suspense / road thriller. <br /> <br /> There were two things that seemed unrealistic to me that prevented me from giving it a higher rating. Score (I gave an 8). The first is the main point of why Alex gave away things. Was she so desperate to get cash that she sold her passport for an insignificant sum and then gave away things that are worth thousands of dollars to a stranger? His explanation was not convincing. Also, how did they get through the door, where were the policemen?
