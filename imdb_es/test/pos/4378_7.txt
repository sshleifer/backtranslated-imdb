I can not say that I enjoyed this as much as "The Big Lebowski" or "Raising Arizona", and I felt a bit underrated, but "O Brother" is a nice movie that deserves some good laughs and a taste of Coen life. , twisted sense of creativity. The DVD edition contains the detail, and I was interested to discover that the Coens are fairly simple in their management techniques. That surprised me! Of course, this movie is not the best example (and I only say it in comparison) and it was not worthy of any Oscar (many believe it was stolen), but maybe it depends on the appeal. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed the former work of the Coens, I have never been a fan of old westerns or "The Dukes of Hazzard" or any of those things that show on TNN daily. I guess that's why I did not feel so excited about watching this movie, as it revolves around the people of the south. For all those from the South who are reading this, I do not want to offend ANY of their people! I'm sure you feel the same when you see movies about urban areas like "A Bronx Tale". When you live in the city all your life, it is difficult to get used to movies of this nature. But apart from the apologies, I found the characters funny and peculiar. I think John Turturro perfectly matched the accent, and seeing the way he speaks in real life, I find it incredible. Tim Blake Nelson was also good. Of course, George Clooney, who I assume is not the best to fake accents, judging by his decision to reject the idea of ​​working with a dialogue coach and develop a New England accent for "The Perfect Storm," naturally seems like a Little Miscast and continuously struggle with the accent. However, his performance was good. You can also see Coen's regular customers as Holly Hunter (on a short but sweet paper) and John Goodman (also on the screen for a short time, but he steals every minute). <br /> <br /> Although I do not normally I like country music, I liked the title song "A Man of Constant Sorrow". The DVD also contains the music video for that song. <br /> <br /> In general, I found the film entertaining and original, but it does not have the quality in the face that the Coens have shown us in the past. It is a lighter effort, but good. I still suggest you look at it. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
