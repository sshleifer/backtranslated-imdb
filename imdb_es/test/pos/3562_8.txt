This entertaining Euro-western opens with a scene that precedes a scene similar to the one Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for "Once Upon A Time in the West," but he could not persuade Clint Eastwood to appear. Three rough-looking gunmen enter a city. One dresses like the nameless man in a poncho. Another is dressed as Colonel Mortimer's "For a few more dollars," and the third is dressed as Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulling a coffin behind him with a machine gun. Our hero meets them on the main street behind a car loaded with three coffins. "Any Gun Can Play" is a spaghetti western with a joke about spaghetti westerns as the hero annihilates the three murderers. Apart from a little too much comedy, especially in the acrobatic wrestling sequences, this is an above average oater. <br /> <br /> The notorious Mexican outlaw Montero (Gilbert Roland of "Barbarosa") and his gang of happy gunmen activists steal an army train that transports $ 300,000 in gold coins across the border. Director Enzo G. Castellari of "Inglorious Bastards" organizes the support from a variety of camera angles that push him to the forefront of the action. The bandits take over the locomotive along with the coach who carries the gold and separate it from the rest of the train that houses the cavalry of the United States. While Montero and his armed men keep the Cavalry immobilized, Pajondo (Pedro Sanchez of "Sabata") takes the locomotive, kills the engineer and his crew and ravages it, leaving the other gunmen behind to get it fixed. Essentially, Pajondo crosses Montero twice and steals the gold for himself. Later, Montero reaches Pajondo on the Rio Grande. Before the bandit can reveal the whereabouts of the booty to Montero, however, a cavalry sergeant kills Pajondo by gunfire. Before dying, Pajondo tells Montero about a medallion that serves as a clue to where he hid the treasure. The furious cavalry captain (Ivano Staccioli of "Comandos") imprisons Montero, but he can not loosen the bandit's tongue even after he uses his whip on him. Enraged by Montero's reticence, the captain threatens to shoot the Mexican if he does not speak. Meanwhile, the jailers let a priest talk to Montero, but he is not really a priest. The six-gun stranger (George Hilton from "The Ruthless Four") poses as a cloth man and rescues Montero from a firing squad. Unfortunately, before Montero is rescued, Clayton (Edd Byrnes of TV's "77 Sunset Strip") removes the medallion and saves it for himself. Clayton is the representative of the bank that was sent to safeguard the gold. He is horrified that the Captain wants to shoot Montero. Clayton's career at the bank depends on his ability to recover gold. The Stranger lights a fire in the fort to distract the firing squad and Montero takes the Captain as a hostage and tries to escape, but the Stranger shoots him. Before the authorities can verify that Montero is dead, the Foreigner claims the body for the beautiful reward it will receive and leaves with the Captain's gracious thanks. As soon as they left the fort, Montero's men appeared to rescue him from the Stranger. From this point forward, Stranger, Montero and Clayton forge short-term alliances while looking for gold. Castellari and guitarist Tito Carpi, who has written several spaghetti westerns such as "A Few Dollars For Django" and another from Castellari "Seven Winchesters for a Massacre", rely on intelligent humor and surprises to keep the action fresh and fast. rhythm A great scene has Clayton sitting at a table about to eat his food when he hears some suspicious sounds behind him. Clayton pours his drink on the table and sees the armed men behind him with six sheathed cannons. <br /> <br /> "Any Gun Can Play" lives up to its title. In fact, many weapons play, and at least twenty or more corpses pile up before vanishing. This western is not so much a parody as an imitation of "The good, the bad and the ugly" by Sergio Leone. Of course, the bad and the good fall as often as ten bowling pins in a bowling alley, but their deaths are not represented in the brutal manner of a Leone western. "Any Gun Can Play" is not taken as seriously as Leone's masterpiece mentioned above. The three leaders jockey back and forth for supremacy. Each one has a piece of the puzzle that will take them to the treasure, but they refuse to share their information until the end of the shooting. The colorful panoramic photograph of Lenser Giovanni Bergamini is spectacular, especially the opening shots of the train that transits the train tracks with distant mountain peaks that rise dramatically in the background. Another great opportunity occurs when Montero proves the imperturbable calm of the stranger. This scene occurs after the Stranger has rescued Montero and Mexican henchmen arrive to save their boss's bacon. By confiscating the Stranger's firearm, Montero points to the rude guy with the poncho and empties the revolver, putting his well-aimed bullets harmlessly in and around the unbreakable gunman. Bergamini, who photographed the Castellari World War II thriller, "Inglorious Bastards," frames the scene with the Stranger in the background and his gun in Montero's hand in the foreground for a nice three-dimensional style shot. Meanwhile, the animated orchestral soundtrack by Francesco De Masi is as memorable for its own idiosyncratic melodies as Ennio Morricone's sonorous ones were for Leone's westerns. The opening song is reminiscent of a Hollywood western of the 1950s with its catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. Although it is not a great western spaghetti, "Any Gun Can Play" is always a nonsense nonsense with interesting twists in the plot and good performances, especially the infallible Gilbert Roland who was 62 years old at the time!
