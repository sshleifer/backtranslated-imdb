My Mother Frank begins as a warm and friendly comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short for Francis, played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes off the crisis by enrolling as a student at her son's university. Most of his friends and family are horrified, including his son (Matthew Newton), who is busy falling in love with his best friend's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile, Frank has increased the anger of his disapproving English tutor (Sam Neill). <br /> <br /> Matthew Newton is completely unarmed as David; Relaxed and natural on paper, even when the character is tense. It generates a goodwill valuable, directing the audience through some of the most comic and broad moments of the film. Not long after the midpoint, the writer and director for the first time, Mark Lamprell, deftly directs his film to a darker emotional territory and gives Cusack the real chance to shine. The welcoming faces (Lynette Curran, Sacha Horler, Nicholas Bishop) and all the directors (including Sam Neill more animated than usual) are excellent. While meandering towards the end, My Mother Frank offers more than he promises and is a real pleasure for the Australian public.
