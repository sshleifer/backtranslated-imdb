When I saw this movie for the first time I did not believe my own eyes. In front of me was a great and well-made parody of Valentino ... look at Stan Laurel's bullfight, that's how you see an excellent marksman in action! It's a very good parody, rich in ideas, with an intelligent and charming Stan ... old and good as whiskey. (or the drink after that)
