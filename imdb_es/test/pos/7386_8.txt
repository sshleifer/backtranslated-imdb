Some things to touch in response to the previous person's comment. You just have to pay attention to what is happening in the movie. <br /> <br /> (I guess they are spoilers) <br /> <br /> The red stuff under David's mouth? Poison ivy, the wife says do not scratch it or else "it will spread". <br /> <br /> David becomes "crazy" because the stranger is telling him to get out of the house, which probably proves David's theory of an affair between the wife and the stranger; he runs after man. <br /> <br /> David does not lose him in the woods, he just hits the stranger a couple of times and lets his wife pick up the pieces. <br /> <br /> Only the wife eats the mushroom. <br /> <br /> I must say, after that point with the wife and the stranger, I started to feel disappointed. But the ending was made for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And for that and for the last scene ... this is one of my favorite movies. I should have done it before, but let me deviate. It really surprised me, honestly. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting, to say the least. But if you're not seeing this because of the performances the actors give, I'd say it's better if you let it go, because that's all that holds this movie together.
