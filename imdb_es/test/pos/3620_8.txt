Obviously, done at low cost to capitalize on the famous "Mandingo", this mocking and carefree piece of carefree cheerful scrap of Italian sexploitation really pours over sordid things with a lack of taste and commendable restraint: the evil, arrogant white family that owns and operates a luxury the slave plantation spends most of the time on screen participating in the panky hanky both with each other and with their various slaves. The director Mario Penzauti and the scriptwriter Tecla Romanelli pile up this fetid filth with an abundant surplus of wheezing: we have an unpleasant rape, interracial intercourse (a white lady makes wild love to a muscular black stallion while she is tied to a cross), a woman copious nudity, brutal lashes, vile degradation, a lot of soft-core sex and a tragic and surprising ending that mixes elements of incest, murder and miscegenation in a questionable attempt to make a statement about the horrible inhumanity of the slavery. Special congratulations to the Fox actress Paola D'Egidio, whose lustful and uninhibited portrayal of the depraved and lascivious wicked bitch Rhonda positively burns the screen. On the other hand, Marcello Giombini's tribal and vibrant score hits the groovy place. The quite polished cinematography of Maurizo Centini also works. A piece of viscous seafood, satisfactorily dizzy.
