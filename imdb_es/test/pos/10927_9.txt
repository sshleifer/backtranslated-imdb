I just saw this in the PlanetOut movies. <br /> <br /> Starcrossed was a very sweet, sad and small movie about two brothers who are in love. There is a great subtle performance of both male protagonists. Many times, the films with this theme seem to be too caught up in the controversy and the value of the plot of the plot that they forget that there is a real story. Luckily, director and screenwriter James Burkhammer does not do this and, instead, lets the story unfold honestly. The sequences of the two boys who fell in love first are very sweet.
