I bought this movie thanks to Raquel Welch. She was beautiful in this movie while playing the role of Harry's girlfriend (Mike Wagner). Harry is a bad luck thief trying to make another steal. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a walk. When things do not work on the trip, they join mines to find the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica from there in the mafia. Rest and make sure that no matter what the gang pursues, the result will never be the same and will keep you on the edge of your session. The rest of the output you have to see for yourself. As far as Raquel is concerned, if you're a fan of here, then you should watch this movie because you never saw yourself better standing on the beach with a dick. I give this movie 10 weasel stars only in the body of Raquel Welch. It's no wonder why she was the hottest actress in the sixties. She was the sexual symbol that everyone wanted and nobody could get. Not only does it look good, it can act even better. If you like it, Raquel Welch will like this movie.
