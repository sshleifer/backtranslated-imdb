Director Jay Craven's adaptation of "Where the Rivers Flow to the North" by Howard Frank Mosher is one of the best transitions from literature to screen. Craven is an admirer of Mosher's work; He also directed "A Stranger in the Kingdom." <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal. Torn offers what could be the best role of his career: Noel Lord, the fiercely independent former lumberjack who is at the center of this story. Tantoo Cardinal's portrayal of the housekeeper's wife and the common law of the Lord is also online. I'm surprised and disappointed that none of them has been nominated for an Oscar when this movie was released. Actions of this caliber must be recognized. The only character that is a bit difficult to swallow for me is the power company executive played by Michael J. Fox. He looks too much like a child in this role. I suppose there is a curse associated with youthful glances, no matter how much people love them. <br /> <br /> Craven has done a good job here by bringing the early 20th century character in Vermont to the screen: locations, angles. , sets, everything is combined to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story. The filmmaker Paul Ryan was exceptional. The score of the Horseflies is also first class: it fits perfectly to the environment and the stage. <br /> <br /> And the story itself ...? One of the most compelling representations of the independent American pioneer spirit of all time: a trait that is in decline today. When it appears in modern times, the person is often viewed with distrust and disdain. In Noel Lord, we have a character that we can admire for his values, and even for his stubbornness. <br /> <br /> This is not a bulky "period piece", but a vibrant look to an era that no longer exists. , and a type of character that has almost disappeared. These are not heroes plated in gold, but real people, with strengths and weaknesses at stake within them. struggling in a hostile environment to live their lives and, at the same time, be at peace with the world in which they live. Like today, there are those who wield the power that they would have otherwise.
