I thought this was a beautiful movie, very brave. Those beautiful images, and I liked the use of broken glasses with applause. In addition, the way in which the best friend repeated the phrase about "... and she is a year older than me ..." showed that her friendship has been revived and grown, but maybe there is still some competition ... They loved the images of hands feeling the fabric. The dance concert was beautiful. However, the beginning seemed slow ... it took a while to feel the characters (the husband could have been more abusive), he just seemed absent, so when other characters talked about him, it really did not fit. The btwn issue. the best friend and husband seemed to be random ... the meeting of doctors seemed to imply that there was not much time left (to live ...), so when the infidelity was revealed, I did not feel so much sympathy for the character, more as relief! The end was so great, the lines sprouted. She and her husband, and the scene in which he stops is brilliant!
