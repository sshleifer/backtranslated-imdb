This movie was amazing! It seemed high budget but it felt genuine and original like an Indie. The most surprising part of this film were the amazing performances of David Beazely, Mark Hildreth and Paul Anthony, who plays the lead role. He brought this film with ease, humor and charisma balanced with great depth. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was really beautiful although some of the subjects were pretty ugly. It was not very realistic that way, but it did not have to be to make a broader point. It was really great to see Alan Cumming in this too. The script was tight and propelled very well with some of the best performances I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Go see this.
