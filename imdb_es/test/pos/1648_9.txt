Shtrafbat is the story that only the Russians could tell about the Second World War. The biggest front of the whole conflict has been, ironically, the issue that appears less on the silver screen after the war. While the war effort of the Western Allies has been represented in almost every detail and possible way, the East has been put aside or the work has been left alone for some old propaganda films, little more than the historical value of the images. <br /> <br /> There is no possibility that Shtrafbat can compete with Band of Brothers in all the details, but you also do not want to look at the screen considering the small visual effects. That the soldiers are Russian is reason enough to forgive the less captivating battle scenes and you can concentrate on the story that is the most interesting. So different was the war on the eastern front and the nature of the Russian army, that you may want people to produce more dramatizations from the other fronts and from the armies. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat is not the perfect way, but it has some rare specialties that increase the overall rating. Tends to crush the myths that people have about the Second World War, the real heroes were the Russians and not their leaders who sent them to missions where they could only perish. Another great blow of myth is that it presents the enemy, who does not raise his weapon, as an equal human being, an advance that has also been difficult to prove in many acclaimed films. Shtrafbat shows how the war on the eastern front was a war of survival and how the clash of the worlds turns people to dust.
