This review has been written by someone who has read it (several times) and knows what it is talking about. First of all, I read other comments and I realized that some of the objections were really stupid. People who have read the book and other Jane Austens or, for that matter, any good book, will know that adhering to the book is vital for them to trust an author what they do. If the viewer does not like BECAUSE he adheres well to the book, it shows that they do not understand Jane Austen and, obviously, they are not a true fan. <br /> <br /> First of all, if the viewer really loved the book or Jane Austen in general, observing it for four hours should not be difficult. Secondly, your society cared a lot about the look and the hairstyles so large and luxurious would show how rich you were, what in your day was a key factor to get along in a "good" society. I have to confess that the women's suits were not brilliant, but there were only a few bad ones and that the men fixed them, also this prejudice for the naval men who do not wear their uniform is, in pretty words, very silly. Today people do not go. without their school uniform or work because they have casual clothes and it was the same in the 19th century. Also, the acting is very good, it's subtle because that's how Jayne Austen writes. And the scene at the end is beautiful. You can not compare the shoot with the 1995 version, since the technology has improved so much, since it is ridiculous to compare them in that. The actress who plays Ann is too old, but her acting air and how it makes up for it. <br /> <br /> It seems that people prefer the 1995 version for some reason that I can not understand. It does not adhere to the book at all and, therefore, it is flat, the ending is sentimental, the main scenes change, the only good actors are the protagonists and I give you a good job for what they were given. Obviously, the people who really like it are (I'm sorry) stupid, since they do not understand persuasion and, therefore, they need to be exaggerated. The 1971 version is beautiful, romantic, it was written by an excellent screenwriter (the same one that Morse Inspector did), he had very good actors and it really is a movie that can be seen many times and in each of them he can be enchanted.
