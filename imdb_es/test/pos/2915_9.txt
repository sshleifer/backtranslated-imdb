This is not what one would call a happy story. The main character entitled (Edmund Purdom as the Egyptian) does not get the gallon, although obviously he gets (?) The word "last", the main tragic figure (Michael Wilding as the politically short-sighted Pharaoh) ends tragically, and the wrong guy ?? Even if it's Victor Mature, he ends up winning all the marbles. Peter Ustinov possibly had the best part (Kafka) and could have stolen something, if not the majority of the film, except for Jean Simmons, who is the waitress (Merit) a little brighter than the average, who possibly has more in the ball ?? intellectually and spiritually, that everyone else together. <br /> <br /> The meditative and pessimistic Sinuhe, the doctor (that is Purdom), is portrayed as a dark, cynical and tortured soul that spends the whole plot ?? His life, looking for the meaning of 'Life'. (By the way, and to paraphrase John Lennon, 'Life' is what happens while you are making other plans). Forgive the lack of philosophical depth in the previous parenthetic commentary, but, finally, the plot unfolds to reveal just that! <br /> <br /> And speaking philosophically, as if things were not bad enough and negative enough, John Carradine (as the nameless grave robber) appears in a cameo in the middle of the movie that says' Life 'It basically does not make sense and it's just worth living as a bad alternative to the final disappointment. <br /> <br /> So here we have more than 200 words and I really have not had a kind word, so why the hell did I rate it so high? Well, there's a lot of Shakespearean tragedy and a lot of moral courage. There are ethical contrasts, true friendships, true and unrequited (almost) love and, despite the limitations of the production capacities of the 50, it is very well (sound) on stage, pleasing both the eye and the ear, and is very well / uniformly accelerated. The performance is, for the most part, uniformly very good ?? given that it is a costume drama of the 50s, and the interactions are credible to the fatal failures of the characters, which abound, and do justice to the best of Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> There's something redemption, Sinuhe. Discover and hug your child? played by Tommy Retigg, who, despite Ustinov's best efforts, really needed Lassie to do it. Do a couple of other 'wrong' souls get their just desserts? The "foreign" meat of Nefer (Bella Darvi)? Apparently in Egypt with a work-study visa of carnal exploitation, whom she cruelly even rejected without mercy Sinuhe - \ and \ - the princess of the Baketamon dykes (Gene Tierney as the sister of Pharoah Wilding) who knew a deep dark secret about Sinuhe's ancestry, and then did he try to use it to put him against his friend, his brother the pharaoh? Good people, huh. <br /> <br /> Purdom's performance is really something to contemplate. Remove the nerve well enough so that somewhere before the end of the image you want to hit it on the puss, grab it by the lapels and say "look, fool, get in, the glass is not half empty, it's half full!" and then discover that you are personally disappointed in Horemheb, Sinuhe's best friend, (Victor Mature as Pharoah's Top Soldier) for having that flaw in his character that prevents him from succeeding in doing something positive. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the secret of the whole movie is that it is achieved very quickly and then the necessary "suspension of disbelief" is sustained and from the beginning it makes you understand and care about the characters, taking care of you point that you really feel sorry for them. and his lost opportunities of happiness; a happiness that otherwise was not so far out of reach. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why this is not already on DVD and I hope it will be corrected soon.
