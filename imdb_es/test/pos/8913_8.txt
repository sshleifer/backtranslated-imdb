There is more to this movie than meets the eye. If you are looking for an innovative originality or an easy comedy, you will be disappointed. But for an entertaining 90 minutes, this is fine. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is careful and precise. The sex scenes, which one comments as free, are anything, but each gesture contributes to the development of the characters. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of the main characters are not exactly adorable human beings. But the film makes an honest effort to show its interactions honestly, without being sensationalist (at least not by the urban standards of the early 21st century). And there are many very funny moments.
