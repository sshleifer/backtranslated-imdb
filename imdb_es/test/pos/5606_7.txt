Although it's not Hal Hartley's best work (my personal favorite is "Surviving Desire"), there's still a lot I like about this movie, especially for fans of Hartley's dialogues. Even for new audiences in Hartley, I would definitely recommend this film about the "Dogma" of the second year. This film is smarter, more faithful to its source material (the Bible) and more fun than any of the other apocalypse films before the millennium. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually part of the French "2000 As Seen Por." Series (2000 Par Vu); as such, it may even be a film with a lower budget than Hartley's other works. While the need for simple scenes taken with a digital camera is understandable in this context, the main problem with this film is the unfortunate overuse of the blurry / restless effect. I would love to never see this effect again in a movie; Especially at the beginning, it almost makes the movie unseen. But ignore this flaw, and you will be treated to a good movie. Especially remarkable is Magdalena (played by Fr. Harvey) who tells how Jesus saved her from being stoned to death; A short scene that I found surprisingly moving. (Despite the fact that it was NOT Mary Magdalene to whom this happened, the woman in the Bible had no name). <br /> <br />
