The Ghost Walks is an ingenious little mystery with a great twist, an agile dialogue and, best of all, a thought interpreted by Twitter by the actor Johnny Arthur, who never belittles or denigrates his character. Mr. Arthur is excellent in his role as Homer Erskine, which provides great comic relief as Broadway producer secretary Herman Wood, played by another great actor actor Richard Carle. <br /> <br /> They look great. <br /> <br /> Although the acceptable words of the sissy and cream puff era are used to describe the character of Homer, it is never petty or mean denigration, and is not spoken by the manly men of the film, but because of its employer, who dismisses him and warms him up again in any other scene and shows an affection almost exasperated by his devoted employee. <br /> <br /> There is a great scene in which Homer tells his boss that he has dedicated the best years of his life to him and has been anything but a mother to him. <br /> <br /> The mysterious angle of the movie is very entertaining, and the twist at the end could leave you on point. <br /> <br /> For an image of the low budget poverty line, this film has an excellent decoration and an excellent wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Direc Frank Strayer deftly handles his cast and this film remains much better than some of his other low-budget mystery attempts, but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to take it to cape. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must see for the devotees of the films of the poverty line, old mysteries of the dark houses (actually they managed to work on the lines "It was a dark and stormy night) and it has the additional advantage of being an early representation of a gay character in the movie where nothing bad happens in the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is available for download in the public domain movies section of the Internet Archive at archive.org.
