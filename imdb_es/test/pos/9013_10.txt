Lovers of original films can really love this show, if they just stop complaining all the time. <br /> <br /> The Emperor's New School brings some ancient jokes from the movie, like pulling the lever to Yzma and Kuzco's lab by pausing in the episode. But since it's a children's program, it's classic and in the right place. Although the style is much simpler, the animation and the characters keep their personalities very well and surprised me, really. Eartha Kitt makes an excellent voice acting for Yzma and J.P Manoux does a wonderful job for Kuzco's voice instead of David Spade, who played Kuzco in the movie. Excellent plots, funny moments and the incredible looks of Kuzco make this show worthwhile. (Just stop complaining about everything!)
