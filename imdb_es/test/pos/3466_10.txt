I got some free tickets through the Times to see this little Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing' ... I did not know anything about it, so I had no preconceived ideas before entering. <br /> <br /> The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheelchairs and live in a house. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal's palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from muscular dystrophy (excuse any spelling mistake!). They form a bond, since Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying. Finally, they leave the house to live in an apartment in Carrigmore for themselves. Immediately they use the help of an attractive girl (Romola Garai) to take care of them. The two friends finally fall in love with the same woman. It's the story in a nutshell, but there's a lot of laughter and tears on the way ... in fact ... I'm not prepared as I was ... I found that tears flowed too often! In fact! I do not think I cried so much watching a movie from The Elephant Man !!! This movie is a GREAT drain on emotions ... both in the fun and in the sad. The performance is absolutely perfect! James McAvoy is my advice for greatness ... he is a great Irish actor and I think he has a great future ahead of him. Steven Robertson, who plays Michael, was also excellent ... and it was not until today that I discovered that he did not suffer from Cerabal's paralysis and it was just an excellent performance! Brenda Fricker is also in this movie, and she plays the part of Home's Manager very well. The other big part should be Romola Garai, she was wonderful as the love interest, and I think we'll see her more on the big screen in the near future. <br /> <br /> What this cinematographic work does, is not only the synergy between the two drivers, but the script ... which is so ingenious that it literally is on fire. I still can not help repeating some of the lines in my head, even now. <br /> <br /> The photograph is good, although very grim, but then it is capturing a certain type of area of ​​Ireland. The music is also great in this movie, as well as the choice in Songs ... the use of the Johnny Cash version of the Nine Inch Nails song 'Hurt' is inspired! <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize this movie in one word ... it would be 'emotional'. This movie is very funny ... and then, when turning a coin, it's very sad! I still can not believe that even two days after watching the movie, looking back, I laugh and almost cry! This movie is amazing ... and I hope it goes very far! Although I can not see that, since your advertising budget is probably very small! <br /> <br /> So go see it! I exhort you ... you will not regret ...
