Great movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a great job of producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The soundtracks written by Sir Elton praised the film with a T. Rex Morris did a great job with the tenor sax in the song "Honey Roll" and the poem "I mean to do my work today" by Richard Le Gallienne was amazing! Congratulations to everyone involved in this fantastic movie! It was not a surprise that many of the people involved with this film became the best in their field.
