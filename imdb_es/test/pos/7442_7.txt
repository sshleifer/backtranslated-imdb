This movie was definitely scripted with FF VII ONLY in mind. I am someone who has never played the original game and saw it with a friend who was a fan of the series. From a visual and technical point of view, this film is as good as "The Spirits Within", if not better, but from the point of view of history, it was quite lost. One of the main weaknesses of the plot that caught my attention was the scene in which "all" children who died because of the geo-stigma were taken to the "meeting" of the three Jenovites. Everyone said that there were about 15 children in total ... Hmmmm ... I thought that this Geostigma was a disease of pandemic proportions ... I understand why they did it that way (time, budget, CPU), but it just seemed cheesy after all the explanation about how the bad guys needed to gather everyone who had Jenova cells so that Jenova could reincarnate. The subtitle version we had (some internet sub-fans) was a fairly direct translation and, therefore, probably added to my confusion. <br /> <br /> However, my interest in FF VII woke me up, and I spent some Hours on the FF VII wiki reading about the main characters and the plot. Once I read the Advent Children wiki, things made a lot more sense. If you are a video game or a science fiction fan, this movie is a good movie, but as one previous reviewer said, it is unleashed as a 90 minute fight scene. You never really know any of the characters, and the story seems to jump from scene to scene without much explanation, although some explanation may be necessary. Thank God for wikpedia.
