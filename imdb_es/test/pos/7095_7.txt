What impressed me most about "One True Thing" was how early it was when the daughter mentioned her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie. As depressing as the subject was, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blinded by the revelation about the deadly illness of a 2/3 character in the movie ("Love Story" "Terms of Endearment", etc.). <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt give very strong performances that do not exceed the limit. The characters that they interpret seem human; They are not perfect people. (It could be said that one can not say that about the character of "Martha Stewart" who plays Streep, but throughout the film, I found that his character is noble in a non-sadistic way, he is dealing with his situation of the best way that she knows.) <br /> <br /> "One True Thing" is a non sentimental and observant family drama in which the tears at the end were well deserved.
