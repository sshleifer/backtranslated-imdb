Rose and the good Doctor are in a space station that is on a planet that is incredibly floating in orbit just below a black hole. The crew of the station is as perplexed as the two new inhabitants are. Properly creepy in its atmosphere and improving as the Doctor and Rose find themselves stranded due to circumstances beyond their control and speaking through the submissive alien race of the Ood, something quite dark comes from beneath the crust of the planet. I have not seen the second part of these two parts. I can not answer that the end is so strong yet. But it is a terrible start. <br /> <br /> My rating: A
