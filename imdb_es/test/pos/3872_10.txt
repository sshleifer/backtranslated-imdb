by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who plays Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded bully recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after the death of his father, a preacher, Reverend Packer, left dead. Reggie was supposed to kill him, but him? Reggie killed the Reverend Packer or was it some kind of configuration? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes. Look, Reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter and J-Bone does not approve of her love demon. When J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, Reggie learns that love has to do with forgiveness. But what is J-bone doing, does it work? Does Reggie and his girlfriend separate, or do they unite them more together? I like this movie because it leaves you wondering what will happen next and this or that happened. I like movies with suspense! It makes you want to be in the movie so you can detect things. I also like this movie because everything falls into place, if you really pay attention to it.
