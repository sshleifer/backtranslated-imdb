This is a movie that took my breath away ... wanting to learn more about Afghan history and traditions. With the "evil" mantra that clouded reality, it was inspiring to experience the beauty of people and their beliefs. <br /> <br /> The casting was impeccable, the stage just wonderful. The performance was first class and the fact that the Academy has overlooked this (except their music) is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful and such an emotional journey. Causing an "ugly cry" from this observer. <br /> <br /> A movie that is worth seeing for the second and third time.
