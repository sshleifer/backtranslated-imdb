The manna of heaven is heavenly. This is a movie for the family: teenagers and grandparents can enjoy together. But it is not sweet, sweet or silly. The characters are really "characters". The plot is somewhat complex and you have to pay attention, but it's like putting together a puzzle, since everything fits in its place little by little. The beginning of the period is like looking at an old photo album, or remembering when. It is very well done with very precise hairstyles and costumes. The story moves quickly with twists, turns and lots of fun. <br /> <br /> A special gift is to observe the great cast of familiar faces, many of which we have not seen in a long time. Part of the fun is recognizing them and naming them mentally as they appear, although this can distract them. At the end of the film, Cloris Leachman looks like he has had a makeover on "Oprah." I had never seen Faye Grant in a movie, I only knew her as Grace's mother in the television series "Saving Grace". She was great, even less the southern accent. And I did not even recognize Shelly Duvall. The five sisters who created this beautiful film are a very talented quintet and Sister Teresa is a heavenly treasure.
