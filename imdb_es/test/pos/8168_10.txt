I am a sociologist / anthropologist specialized in the field of symbolic interactionism, and I must say that this film shows a high quality in the symbolic context throughout the film. For anyone who has not yet seen this, I recommend that you read "The Search for Man for Definitive Meaning" by Victor E. Frankl. I think you can draw some amazing correlations. <br /> <br /> That said, I would like to say that even though the main characters are gay, this is not a story about being gay. This is a story about how to seek and find meaning in life, despite the difficulties and challenges, the pain and terror that stand in your way. This is a story of searching and searching for balance and fulfillment and happiness.
