In "Hoot", a new child arrives in Florida from Montana. First you face the usual problems of mixing and dealing with the local stalker. Soon, however, he realizes a bigger problem: a chain of franchise restaurants is trying to build a place in the city, where several burrowing owls live. This movie looks like a family movie, but it is far more radical than it seems, as it shows with sympathy that Roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from breaking the law (including private property vandalism and brief kidnapping). from the manager of the restaurant chain) in the name of environmentalism (to save the owls, not less). Now, one could agree or disagree with those actions, but at least the film has the courage not to shun their convictions. A good solid movie, in general.
