The director, Ramin Niami, delivers the products with Somewhere in the City. This hilarious farce, I think, is in the tradition of a Mel Brooks comedy. Niami mocks New York society by creating the credible, eccentric and tragic characters of an apartment building in a building that gives them life from the first opening that presents them. The performance of Peter Stormare as Shakespeare's gay actor is absolutely worthy of a prize and the film in general does a good job of showing the hopelessness and laughter ability of egocentric ambition. Sandra Bernhard is perfectly chosen as the heterosexual and ego-obsessed therapist. I really enjoyed Sandra's performance, especially because until now I have not been a big fan. Bai Ling, Ornella Muti and Bulle Ogier complete an international set par excellence. I loved the scene with Robert John Burke and his gang of idiotic criminals who could not plan a robbery if their lives depended on it. With a cameo by Mayor Ed Koch and a solid performance by Paul Anthony Stewart, the child of the revolutionary mom, Somewhere in the City entertains without missing a beat.
