John Huston was seriously ill when he achieved his last achievement, and it is completely his testimony: intransigent, difficult, a thousand miles away from fashions and fashions, it will become the best "last movie" with which he can dream. A very austere script, without action, without real hero, but a group of people who face the vanity of life, fleeting years and death. The party does not fool people for a long time. It is true that warmth and affection emanate from songs and food. Complete with turkey and pudding. But the passage of time has partially ruined Julia's voice, first it breaks in the mirror. Then, the camera leaves the room where the guests gather and looks for the old woman's bedroom. By the way, his seems to have been a happy life, but it is a life that is coming to an end inexorably. An image is shown towards the end of the film Julia on her future deathbed. Maybe it's an unfulfilled life, because I was still an old maid, with no children to follow. Only some poor things, yellow photographs, bibelots and trinklet. s .... But, have the hopes and dreams of a human being been fulfilled? Look at Gretta. She is a married woman, about thirty-five years old, she is still beautiful and healthy, but she knows that something is broken. What Julia is today, she will do. I know tomorrow, for that reason, in his stream of consciousness, he returns to his past, only to discover how distressing his memories are: a young man committed suicide for her, a symbol of his youth that is now decaying. The final monologue, if we listen to it attentively, involves us all in this eternal tragedy, the condemned to the failure of the human condition, the masterful lesson of John Huston.
