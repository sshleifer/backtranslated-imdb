This is an amazing movie that starts slowly. It leads you to think that it is a family drama typical of Maudlin. Then, in the second half, there is a twist in the plot that transforms it completely into a profound story of global reach. <br /> <br /> If you're not used to Indian movies, the singing and dancing routines seem grafted in. There's no reason, stay with this movie. Especially from the second half, you will find this movie an incredible experience. <br /> <br /> *********** Minor Spoiler Here ************ * I have a complaint with the movie. The dialogue at the end (between Amudha and MDS) seemed very weak and lost the opportunity to bring war as a force that transforms the lives of people. All the time it was implicit, but there should be something about the importance of the struggle for the MDS.
