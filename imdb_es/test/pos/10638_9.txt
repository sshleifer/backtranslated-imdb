If you think that the piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in Michael Haneke's film "LA PIANISTE" is the maximum degree of impersonation, perversion and darkness, I have news for you: the piano teacher in the novel of Elfriede Jellinek "LA PIANISTE" (on which the film was based) is twice as "repulsive", "disgusting", "deranged" and even more fascinating, although there can not be enough words to translate the level of artistic competence that has reached Isabelle Huppert Here, about all the other deadly actresses in activity today. And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano / dubbing an actor could offer? <br /> <br /> In the novel as in the film, there are two great antagonists of "heroine" Kohut: his own mother (the wonderful Annie Girardot with shipwreck, in a part originally intended for Jeanne Moreau) and the own Austria. The mother personifies Jellinek's perception of her native Austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racist / fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression and, say, Ã¼bermensch ideals that are impossible to maintain today. without the danger of a mental breakdown. <br /> <br /> "La Pianiste" also deals with a very powerful and delicate subject: how dangerous it is to reveal your most intimate fantasies to which you believe you love. We tend to think that our own sexual fantasies should be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves, which can be a huge, shameful and, sometimes, tragic mistake. Here, Kohut learns (?) The lesson in the most painful and humiliating ways. <br /> <br /> It should be mentioned that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the most well-known and praised authors of Austria and Europe (well, now she has a Nobel Prize!) and those autobiographical passages can be inferred in her novel, since She herself was a pianist and had a difficult relationship with her mother. The novel also includes lengthy passages on Kohut's childhood and adolescence so you can understand how he became who he is now. Haneke opted to hide this information in the film, forcing us to ask ourselves how it came to be like this (do not we know Erika Kohut out there?). But he retains much of the fabric of the book in his film: unbearable honesty, to the point where the most secret and "horrendous" feelings emerge painfully: envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hatred, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion, etc. All of them unmistakably human. <br /> <br /> I thought "La Pianiste" was a moving film, very disturbing and provocative of thoughts, with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that's all I ask. films. He also made me buy and be delighted with the book, discover a fantastic author that I had not read before, and listen again and again to Schubert, so thanks to Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle !!! On the other hand, if you are looking for light entertainment, get away. My vote: 9 out of 10
