This movie was one that I've been waiting to see for some time. I was happy to discover that everything has been planned. The writing of this film has been elaborated and researched so finely beyond what the public sees. I found it funny that so many people who watch do not read between very important lines, but if not, the film will make sense in a different way and it is very bright. The film has many stories and characters united around this Kilo Character, a man who has risen from the streets in the midst of many evils and has become a very powerful criminal. After spending some time in prison, Kilo finds a gap in the justice system and, through a disturbing turn of events, he frees himself only to discover that everything is not at all what it seems. Kilo finds himself fighting against the higher realm of society and political royalty to clarify how important the Word of a man is and represents it. A war begins when the street is in arms against Lords of wealth and corrupt Power. <br /> <br /> An accumulation of explosive and powerful twists and turns without stopping. This movie will leave you fascinated. I found that the cast of this film is outstanding and it is not a film that is ignored. Excellent. Rent it today!
