Ok, then I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I LOVE her! What an innovator. I love that she has a kitchen section. I admit that from time to time I miss that part, just because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the shopping list the next day on your website. I love that he has regular assistants and that he has made some of his viewers become his regular customers. I love how nice it is and how creative it is. I also like how he makes his mysterious guests. She seems much more genuine than many other talk show hosts. She still has a bit of starstruck from time to time and I love that. I love that she talks about her personal life there and reminds people how happy she is. He's even mentioned tabloids before and it's a lot of fun! She also has the funniest stories! Anyway, I'm a fan for life. Even my 2-year-old son knows who Rachael Ray is and he loves her too!
