As a former Highland Rugby (HR) player, I think I can possibly answer some of the questions and confusion that has been raised. I think I am also in a position to offer a perspective of the club and the previous stories. Oh, and this will be a long post, I know. <br /> <br /> First of all, people who said that the film does not show real rugby, have a valid point. The movie is full of bad tackles, people in the wrong places and much more. If you want to know what a real rugby game is like, you will not get the best idea of ​​this movie. But the point is that it will not be satisfying to sit and watch an outstanding reel or jump into a game. It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Really, how many sports movies really make you feel like you're in the game? There are not many that I have seen. I think it's important to bear in mind that the film is about rugby players, much more than about rugby. <br /> <br /> Next, the Haka is VERY part of Highland Rugby. It's not something that they just released to the movie. To be honest, I do not know how the tradition started, but Highland emulates the All Blacks in many ways. The uniform is based on the All Blacks as well. The film did not do a good job of explaining the origins of the Haka, and to be honest, I do not think that's right. But I can tell you that each member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means. As for the person from China (?) Who said that only a Maori can perform a Haka, I would suggest they take a look at the All Blacks and tell me if they think they are all Maori. Believe it or not, Utah has a very large Polynesian community, and a good part of them like and play rugby for local teams. Me, I'm a Hawaiian part. Whenever possible, the Haka is run by a Maori. The team does not do it because they think they are Maori, they do it because of some of the problems that are shown in the film. The concept of unity and "those who have gone before" is an important part of the Human Resources culture, and the message behind Haka, for any of those who are familiar with it, supports those values. It is a song from a boss who thought he was going to die (Ka Mate), and those around him support him by telling him that he will live (Ka Ora) and he will impel him. How appropriate it is for a group of white boys is not for me to say, but that is the ideology behind this and why it is done. "Kia Kaha" is also a widely used team motto, even if the actors had a hard time saying it. <br /> <br /> Also, for people who questioned the ability of Highland's Rugby as a player, I just remind you that we were not really watching Highland in this film. Many of the extras were former Highland players and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. Believe it or not, Highland is really quite good at what it does and respected in the international community. Of course, some years produce better equipment than others (this is what you would expect with any sports team), but you do not accumulate the record of HR victories just for being right. The year after I graduated, (1998) Highland was one of the 12 teams invited to the World Rugby Championship of Schools in Zimbabwe. The teams were selected by hand from around the world and represented the best high school rugby talent at that time. Highland obviously did not win the first place, (New Zealand did), but they managed to take third place in the tournament, defeating the Tonga national champions in their last game. And while American rugby may never reach the level of talent that New Zealand or South Africa has, the third place in the world is nothing that is left behind. Highland also has a tradition of traveling through New Zealand every few years, and usually returns with more victories than losses. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters portrayed in this film are based on real people and real stories. I saw this movie with my brothers, who also played for Highland, and among the four, we were pretty sure we could identify ALMOST all the main characters. Nobody knew a white rasta. Of course, since this was not a documentary, Hollywood took some liberties, but to tell the truth, not as many as you can think. The film was quite accurate in showing the daily practices of 2 and a half hours, as well as the mandatory personal performance and weight training. Sometimes I was really running until you vomited. He also showed the service and other team activities (like the chuck-a-rama buffet) that were a very important part of the team's bonding. <br /> <br /> And finally the movie, in my opinion (obviously very partial), was a pretty good movie. And I think the reason is that I saw it as an inspiring sports movie. I did not think it would be a pure rugby movie or a drama awarded by the academy. It was just an encouraging movie about a rugby team, complete with morale, encouragement and a good dose of jokes released for entertainment. I hope I have addressed some of the problems that people have had with the film, and I hope that now you can enjoy what it was. <br /> <br /> Kia Kaha
