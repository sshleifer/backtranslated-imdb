<br /> <br /> After reading the criticism of the unemployed, I went to a screening of "Radio" without knowing what to expect. Fortunately, the unemployed critic now seems, to me anyway, a frustrated movie director / film critic. His criticism is insensitive and totally out of place! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will make you laugh, it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pause! <br /> <br /> Paraphrasing a line aired by actor Ed Harris in the final scene of Barbershop "... and all this time we thought we were teaching Radio, the truth is ... He was teaching us. try all the time, how we would like to treat each other, sometimes! "<br /> <br /> Yes, the film pulls on the strings of the heart. Yes, he is emotionally manipulative and yes Cuba Gooding Jr. (In a performance worthy of an Oscar) is sometimes a little exaggerated (see the Christmas day dance scene), but knows what? AND THAT! From time to time, we must remind the American community what tolerance can do for our great country. We need to be reminded of how big we can be. <br /> <br /> This is a solid cast. I was particularly pleased to see S. Epatha Merkerson, portraying Radio's mother, doing something outside of Law and Order. I have always wondered if Mrs. Merkerson is a great actor or if the quality of the writing is delivered, buy a strong distribution in Law and Order. After watching this movie, it is easy to see that she is really a very good actress. <br /> <br /> Besides joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles, Alfre Woodard is the director, Debra Winger in a race -Resolving the role of the wife of trainer Jones and Chris Mulkey as protagonist, Frank Clay . <br /> <br /> We can not overlook the performance of Ed Harris as coach Harold Jones. After reflecting on this film and having grown up in the deep south of myself, it is difficult to really appreciate Mr. Harris and his contribution to this film. As coach Jones, Ed offers a quiet and solid performance like that of a man on a mission. Coach Harris will not allow the city or circumstances to divert him from what he knows in his heart; it is right. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, be sure to wait for the final credits. You will receive a gift when you show the true "Radio" Kennedy of James Robert, now in his half of the 50, who still leads the T.L. The Hanna football team is in the field every Friday night. <br /> <br /> A final note. If you were a teenager between the mid and late 70s, this movie is worth the price of admission, just for the soundtrack!
