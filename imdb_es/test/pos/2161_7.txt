Take a look at the first 20 minutes, even though the suspense has not yet been activated. We look very well at the Los Alamos super secret just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end World War II. Except for the strict security, it seems quite unthreatening. Notice how a TV repairman, a normal and obvious guy, takes us through security. Once finished, it's like in any US city. UU., Beautiful houses, quiet streets, children who go to school and a family television in the blink of an eye. Later, we see little Tommy and little Peggy frolicking the streets full of impressive-looking facilities separated by closed doors. The movie seems to be saying, "Well, we're tough, just because we have to be, but basically, we're still people." <br /> <br /> Now, I suppose it was a comforting experience. message to the Cold War hearings that are not yet accustomed to the government's "doomsday" investigation. It is a clear effort for popular tranquility. The darkest note is when Tommy's mother (Clarke) worries about her son's mental state. He does not say: "When I grow up"; instead, it is, "If I grow up." That note of doubt not only reflects a reality of Los Alamos, but also a national one that in 1952 had just seen images of the apocalyptic H bomb. Also note, how the FBI agents are portrayed professionally, a standard feature of the McCarthy era rate. When brute force is needed, it is not them, but the private citizen Gene Barry who reviews the information, an early version, I suppose, of the "interpretation" of the modern era. <br /> <br /> Once the kidnapping occurs, the suspense does not give way. The intrigue is handled very well with colorful locations in Los Angeles that keep us guessing. The climatic scenes around cliff dwellings may not be plausible as hiding places, but the view of northern New Mexico is excellent. Also, the old stone apartments represent one of the most exotic scenarios of the decade. Consider also the extensive use of the police helicopter that is beginning to be used as a tool to enforce the law. Among an otherwise moderate cast, Nancy Gates remains a bright presence as Professor Ellen Haskell. Never glamorous Hollywood, she was still an excellent unknown actress and a winning personality. I also hope that this has been one of the most successful film efforts of director Hopper, and although people have become accustomed to the nuclear threat, the film remains a revealing and fascinating document of his time.
