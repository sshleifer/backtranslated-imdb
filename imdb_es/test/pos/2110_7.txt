First I am a teenager. OK, and I have to say that this movie was pretty good. I think any child 10 years old or younger will like it, but people my age and older can be a little, um, a, well, we would describe the movie as LAME! But I liked it. I might still act like a child, or visit a cattle farm every weekend, but this movie was cute. I liked that the actors were like children, not little blond cakes, with three layers of clothes, a fashionable hat and a thousand memories (like most of today's shows, to name a few, Drake and Josh, Lizzie Mc Guire , well, any show for children.) And the stage was perfect, but there was a flaw. The family was in debt, right? Why in the world did you see your inner house as something taken from a "Western" store? That was a failure. <br /> <br /> Cameos are great, there are around five hundred of them, and the only explainable one is that Julia Roberts is the main aunt of the girl. How the hell did they get everyone else? This movie seemed to have a tight budget. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, it was very fun to watch and I thought some parts were unlikely (like a cow that sells for $ 750,000? Ha! my butt a cow sells for a lot!) But otherwise it was good, I liked it and could see it again. But I would never buy it, there are not even special features on the DVD! What's up with that? But rent it, especially if you have small children running around the house.
