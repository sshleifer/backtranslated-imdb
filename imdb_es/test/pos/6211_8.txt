The first time I saw Colleen Moore was in the excellent series about silent movies called "Hollywood". There, in 1980, her hair moved defiantly like in the twenties, a bright, witty and charismatic old woman, the same definition of "presence." Then I saw her fabulous silent comedy work in films like "Ella Cinders" and "Orchids and Ermine". Then the disappointingly dark talkie "The Scarlet Letter". And now here she is in "The Power and the Glory", which offers an amazing performance, working expertly with one of the best actors in the cinema that speaks: Spencer Tracy. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie did not have brightness. As for the story, but Moore and Tracy offer performances so brilliant that the story does not seem to matter. Both actors age from youth to old age in the course of the film, and this is mainly done through acting alone with a minimum of makeup and hair changes. Moore is almost unrecognizable as the old wife, and the scene in which she discovers that her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most magnificently interpreted scenes I've seen. She does most of the scene without dialogue, which is where her silent acting experience gives her the edge, even over Tracy. Contrast this with her charming comic that plays in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and Tracy is struggling to propose something to her. Amazing! What this film reveals more than anything else is how embarrassing it is that Hollywood let this remarkable actress slip through her fingers and spend most of her life in retirement.
