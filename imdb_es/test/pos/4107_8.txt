This was one of my favorites as a child. My family had the soundtrack of 8 tracks! It took us years (until I was about 20 years old) for us to get a video of the movie (my dad recorded it on HBO or something like that). Every summer when we go to the beach (my mother, my brother, my sister and I) we lie down on the beach and sing all the songs of this movie. I LOVED!!!
