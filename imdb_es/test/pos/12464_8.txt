This is an entertaining and moving version of the classic tale, also quite intelligent, which is not at all the school "Me Tarzan, You Jane". <br /> <br /> It is the famous story of a child raised to adulthood. In the jungle for the monkeys. A titled British couple (the pregnant wife) is stranded in the African jungle after a shipwreck. After the death of the parents, the baby is raised in the jungle by the monkeys. Twenty years later, this young man (that is, Tarzan) rescues a wounded Belgian explorer, taking care of him until he regains his health. The Belgian discovers evidence that his rescuer is the young Lord Greystoke and returns him to his rightful property in Scotland, where he must adapt to civilized society. <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into two parts. In the first half, we see Tarzan in his jungle environment. Not being an expert, I ignore the realism of his representation of the life of the ape community, but it is certainly entertaining. For me, the most touching section is the second half, when Tarzan must know his real family, develop his linguistic skills and adapt to the aristocratic British society, while at the same time courting Jane (Andie MacDowell). He is presented as a "noble savage," whether in nature or in elegant Edwardian salons. In contrast, the upper crust is described as often much more barbarous than the jungle left by Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert is fantastic in his friendly representation of Tarzan both in the jungle and in civilized environments. It conveys a real sense of their confusion and conflict, torn as it is between the two very different worlds, their original ape family and their new human. Sir Ralph Richardson, one of the ancient British legends, is brilliant as always in the role of Tarzan's grandfather, the Sixth Earl of Greystoke. <br /> <br /> The film focuses more on Tarzan's struggles to adapt to civilization and its internal conflict than on its exploits in the jungle. This unusual take on the old classic makes it both the typical dramatic adventure and also, above all, a moving personal story. I was not surprised to notice here that its director is the same individual, Hugh Hudson, who also directed Carros de fuego, another brilliant film.
