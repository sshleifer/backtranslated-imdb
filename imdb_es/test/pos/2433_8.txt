Doing this short and to the point. This movie was great! I loved! In fact, I picked it up in a Hollywood video for $ 3 on VHS and I saw it about 5 times in the last two weeks. I'm a big fan of Bogart and I clung to this movie. I thought the song was fun and now I have it as a ringtone on my phone. Robert Sacchi is great and brings out a good Bogart. His nose is a little big, his voice is a mix of Bogart-Columbo, and he does some things that are uncomfortable, but otherwise, it was fantastic and this movie was wonderful. Nobody can be a perfect Bogart, but it was great. Remember, Sam Marlow is a Bogart fan and will not do everything he did. He mentions many other movies and does some things that were never part of Bogart's true character. But, it's so funny and hilarious and has a great cast, including some beautiful women. Watch it and have fun!
