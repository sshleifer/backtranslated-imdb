There are, as many comments have observed, a strong dark streak in this movie. The director who reminds me the most is John Landis (yes, go ahead and howl about the peasant that I am). Arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a somber and gray way, then turning around and exploring the horrors of life with a joyful touch. <br /> <br /> The cast is, without exception, above average. Thomas Gibson, like David, stands out as the capricious and self-deceptive center around which the other characters revolve. A good nihilist speaks, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge. Gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993. It was hard to look at him and see Greg Montgomery, let alone Agent Hotchner of Criminal Minds. <br /> <br /> It may not be the best scene, but the one I enjoy the most, my "rewind scene", is the section in which Candy waits for a visitor, and one uninvited person after another appears in the door. As Candy's interpersonal environment spirals out of control, David becomes more bloated, more cheerful and more enthusiastic, like a gaunt Gen-X "Tigger."
