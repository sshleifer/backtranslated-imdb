There are a lot of movies that we say should be seen twice. In most cases, this is mainly a recommendation: you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing, and seeing it a second time helps you capture the twists of the plot that you just did not notice. However, for Mulholland Dr. this is different. The sequence that worked for me was: see it for the first time, spend a day on the Internet trying to figure out what this is all about, and then watch it a second time. Otherwise, most likely you can not enjoy this movie in its entirety. Then you begin to understand that this piece is ingenious, the camera work is impressive and the aftertaste follows you for weeks. <br /> <br /> 9/10
