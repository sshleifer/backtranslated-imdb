The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign films I've seen in my life. All the technical aspects are, in my opinion, perfect (lighting, acting, direction, rhythm, etc.). The HISTORY is impressive. <br /> <br /> Apparently beyond death, our main character is living in a world without beauty, passion or anything that is remotely pleasing to the human senses. His work is cold and uninteresting; his relationships are numb and uninspiring, and when everything becomes too much, he seeks to end up in front of a train. But it does not end, you can not leave this strange world by suicide! Working back to a man who seemed to feel the same isolation and loneliness, our main character joins him to dig a stone wall in hopes of revealing the source of a strange and wonderful smell and music. Just when they break, and I will not reveal SO MUCH, everything ends and the movie ends as strangely as it began. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that you will love this movie or that you will hate that. I feel like it's like a magic poem, open to many different interpretations and all as valid as the next one. If you enjoy new experiences in the cinema and you want to take away the Hollywood party, try this movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10 (and I do not qualify easily!) Because in spite of its darkness, this movie left me with a feeling of something bigger ... something mysterious and beyond ourselves. Well done!
