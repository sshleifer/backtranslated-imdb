I do not think there really are spoilers here, but as I do describe a couple of funny scenes, I'll check the box that says 'it could contain spoilers' to be sure. Now ... <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start. By now you know the basic outline of the story: horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) take on the job of guiding a Mormon wagon westward to their "promised land" and on the Path meet with a variety of essays and interesting characters, especially the Clegg family outlawed. <br /> <br /> Anyone can enjoy this movie. You do not have to be a westerns fan so you like this one. On the one hand, Johnson and Carey are two of the quickest friendly characters you'll see in any movie. Carey, in particular, is lively and extroverted, almost like a big boy, while Johnson is a bit more calm and wise, something like a big brother figure. I loved the scene where they sell the sheriff one of his "soft horses" for ten dollars; then inform him that the horse has "some peculiarities, you could say faults" ... Travis nudges Sandy, who releases a high-pitched whistle, which causes the new sheriff's horse to get into a fight with him in the chair. The look on his face when the horse finally lets it fall and goes galloping is priceless. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the music ... even if you never thought you would be a fan of the Children of the Pioneers, listen to "Shadows in the Dust" while the train of wagons is on the move with some of the people walking between the wagons. It is a truly beautiful song. Too bad that only half a minute or so is in the movie. I want to hear everything at some point. <br /> <br /> One thing that impressed me a lot about this movie is that a lot of it must have been almost as difficult to do as the real situation it represents. Teams of six horses that dragged cars along steep mountain trails, striving to reach the top, was not a simple and easy movie. It must have been risky for actors, specialists and animals as well. In addition, this movie has a lot of authentic-looking action that involves the movement of the train of wagons. It is worth mentioning that both Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were extremely competent, both with many years of experience riding, making ropes and doing all kinds of cowboy things. Carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many Navajo Indians and, in fact, learned to speak Navajo before learning to speak English. There are no strass jeans in this movie: "Travis" and "Sandy" were really real. <br /> <br /> Watch for the scene when Miss Denver throws the water tray out of her car, hitting Travis's horse. in the face ... the horse begins to wobble, and finally throws it. Look at Sandy's expression when Denver tells Travis: "I'm sorry you fell off your horse." Another of my favorite scenes is when Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) gets into a fight with one of the Mormons. They are working back to back preparing their equipment, and after Sandy gets upset with the other teammate, the two get into a rear crash match that quickly turns into a fist fight rolling on the floor. . Even after the old man (Ward Bond) lifts them up and separates them, the two fighters continue to try to confront each other. The Mormon (called 'Jackson' in the movie) gets a final kick in Sandy so high that it hits his shoulder. It's a very funny scene from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else I can say about this movie, other than that it has a good story, very attractive characters, beautiful landscapes and a lot of balanced action with humor and a bit of drama. Oh, it has been colored, at least in the version I saw; It is not the most beautiful color film I have ever seen, but I think I prefer it to black and white film. I give this one ten and I do not give many 10's. One of my favorite movies, without a doubt. And, judging from the other comments, I have a lot of company in that evaluation.
