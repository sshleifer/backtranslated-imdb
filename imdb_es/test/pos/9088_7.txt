Countless television screens and the memorable appearances of 4 of today's mega-stars (plus Hope Davis' screen debut) keep the Flatliners prudent. The plot is about a non-academic investigation of five medical students who pursue the crazy idea of ​​discovering the secret of death, and learn what there is after death, and then come back to life. However, the plot has not been as fascinating as the idea of ​​the plot. <br /> <br /> There are popular stereotypes to develop a regular script for teenagers in Flatliners. There is Nelson who creates the idea of ​​deciphering death, Rachel, beautiful but introverted, David, who cuts the Gordian knot fortunately not to be fired from school, the lord of the ladies Joe and finally the intelligent Randy ("I did not go to the doctor school to murder my classmates, no matter how disturbed they may be "). They unite completely in an experiment in which Nelson's heart will stop and be scolded. Then they decide to continue this experiment in strict confidentiality in the night hours of the campus. Not long after Nelson's experience, they all begin a race by having the wildest and longest death experience, risking their lives one by one. However, they soon realize that their daily life is affected by the experiences they had. The visits to the other life give us back their delinquent feelings of the memories of their childhood. Depolarizing their deep subconscious vigilance, they begin to have somatic delusions and visual hallucinations. <br /> <br /> When the time comes for the explanation of the subconscious, the director Joel Schumacher omits that all of humanity has a subconscious personality of which they are not aware. . This inner personality prevents one from being disturbed in the loss of identity. If you lose or depolarize this subconscious personality, you will certainly lose your identity instead of refreshing the memories of childhood. I wanted to add this as an error of the film, which has already been mentioned through the critics of the film in the previous 90's. Obviously here in this film, Schumacher made the actors less affected. So, why do you hesitate to continue with the experiment after learning your lesson, as if death were designed by God? David had been presented as an atheist, now he turned to believe in God when he remembered a flashback of his childhood. After witnessing this 180-degree change in David, it is clear that Schumacher's film was so conservative and with a liver lily; Ultimately, that's why it's never classified as a science fiction work. Oh! He had good potential. He even tried to distinguish the unconscious maturation from having an experience of death, beginning to believe that death is so natural and is only part of a human's life. <br /> <br /> More than what's in the movie, it was also memorable to remember what happens with the movie. Jan de Bont as the director of photography, who had almost always worked with Schumacher, creates a dreamlike atmosphere as if it were a gothic horror movie. The blue color schemes on all the walls that are reflected on the faces of the actors provide first class lighting, which is perfectly adapted to the film. The close-up shots of the gargoyle statues in the campus buildings, the Catholic frescoes on the walls, the stop-motion cameras and the dynamic speeds of the cameras all belonged to Bont's abilities. <br /> <br /> Flatliners became a cult movie in time with its sociological pencil portrait of the younger generation X, especially through its futuristic editing style with storyboard connection sequences, as part of a music video very aesthetically. Those were the times when video clips of fast-paced video and multiple sequences increased. This style was very rare to find in those years after his pioneer, Tony Scott, "The Hunger (1983)".
