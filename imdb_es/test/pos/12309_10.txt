James Joyce, it could be said, could write some of the best sentences in the English language, and his story, "The Dead", which ends his collection The Dubliners, contains "in its end" perhaps the most perfect paragraph of English. language. It is fitting that John Huston, who restrained himself while trying to film this story, ended his career with that. As with The Red Badge of Courage and The Man Who Would Be King, Huston revered the literary source, but made the film adaptation. And with "The Dead" (which was completed after Huston's death by his son, Tony Huston) we got something almost perfect in the marriage of literature and film. <br /> <br /> Appreciating everything the cinema can do, as one of the commentators points out that "this is not the African queen" (nor is it necessary for it to be), this is the kind of film that is inflexible for an audience. All of us crawl through the Portrait of an artist in school, and one needs to achieve the maturity of appreciating how words and images in themselves can touch us. As with silent movies, Huston looks for something pure here, and works with the confidence of many years and leaves the world a masterpiece that is equal to Joyce's original. <br /> <br /> Many veterans of the Irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a man full of personal importance (and mock doubt) that is reinforced by the hosts of an annual party on the eve of the Feast of the Epiphany. What awaits Gabriel Conroy is a night of celebration, singing, dancing, poetry in which he is asked to give an annual toast to the two sisters and their niece who are the hosts of the party. He is distracted by the task that wants to be up to the occasion, and this distraction leaves him vulnerable to a devastating experience, which his wife gave him. While his ego is affected when he hears a story from his wife's past, it is also a gift in which everything that seems to have mattered throughout the night is dragged down by the realization of an imminent mortality for all who they live. <br /> <br /> And instead of trying to make the last famous paragraph of the story "cinematic", Huston brings a voice and we hear those incredible words recited while observing that "the snow falls weakly through the universe and it just falls. " It is the perfect solution for the adaptation of a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The cast is everything we expect. Since this is basically a testimony to the power of the written word and how it unites us through common experience, each interpreter seems elevated by his role. Anjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy has a great variety to play, and her story of a boy who once loved her is not only for Gabriel Conroy, but also for the audience. <br /> <br /> When I think of Anjelica Huston, it's the transformation he makes in this film; and when I think of his father, first I remember this movie.
