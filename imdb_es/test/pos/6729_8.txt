I remember seeing this as a child as part of the specials of Friday's movie Film Fundamentals for Children at CBBC and I have recently come across a copy. <br /> <br /> In the twenty years I've seen for the last time, this movie has not been lost. <br /> <br /> It's an atmospheric tale that draws folklore from Cornwall and adds elements of really spooky images of the ghost of young miner Billy. <br /> <br /> Filmed in wonderfully picturesque scenery. In the Port Loe area of ​​Cornwall, the film uses the mixture of steep coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the stage really believable. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of content in this CFF drama, something that has long been lost on children's television today. It's worth checking out if you can track a copy.
