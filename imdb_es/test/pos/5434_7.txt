Not all the lines in a comedy are fun. This film takes a serious subject, the deprivation of rights of voters and holds it to light while telling jokes about it. It's the movie The Daily Show would have made if they wanted to make it into a movie. I discovered that Robin Williams was much more fun in this movie than he in RV. And while my wife and I share some opposing political views, we both burst out laughing in various parts of this movie. The writers here could give Fox News some fair and balanced lessons. Lewis Black was fine on his part, but in reality he never seemed to be able to highlight his particular brand of comedy for his role. Christopher Walken was also good, playing his fairly common and moderate support role, driving a story.
