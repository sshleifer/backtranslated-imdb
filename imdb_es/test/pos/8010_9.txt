"STEP BY STEP", is my opinion, it is a pure success of ABC! I can not remember all the episodes, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always fun when a mishap occurred at school. I always laugh about that. In fact, I think almost every one of J.T. The lines of (Brandon Call) and Cody (Sasha Mitchell) were fun. It would have been nice if Penny (Patrika Darbo) had stayed on the show throughout her career. They all always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope it never stops issuing in syndication.
