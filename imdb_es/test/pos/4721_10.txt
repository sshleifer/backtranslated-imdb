This film should be seen by as many people as possible, since it focuses on human rights issues in Burma. The first time I saw this movie in the mid-1990s changed my life completely. He knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or his democracy movement. It affected me so I wanted to understand more about the situation. Any movie that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job correctly. Patricia Arquette is excellent as the American lady who, due to personal tragedy, has become imprudent with her own life decisions and is caught in the ensuing conflict. It is a powerful film on a subject that deserves more publicity. As the film itself says, the massacre of activists for democracy Pro in 1988 was not televised and, therefore, went unnoticed by the world. I implore everyone who reads these comments to take the time to find out more about the current plight of the Burmese. <br /> <br /> It is time for this film to be released on DVD. Can you do something?
