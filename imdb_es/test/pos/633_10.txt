Man, I never laughed so much this year, and it's hard enough to make me laugh. Although I was waiting for a movie like a hostel, the smile came to my face even from the beginning. This film inside the film shows a stabbed "victim" that dirties the whole until finally "dies". His exaggeration drives the director, and his funny reaction tells viewers that Mute Witness is not a typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> The main character, the mute American makeup artist Billy Hughes, is played. For the beautiful and talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. His performance is first class; his character can not speak, so the body language and emotions on his face must compensate. And, oh boy, did a wonderful job. His sister (Fay Ripley) is the girlfriend or girlfriend or the wife of the "director of the movie" (Evan Richards). Both were very funny most of the time. I will not spoil more, but the scenes that followed the time of the bathtub, with them two, the fake cops and later the angry neighbor were simply a brilliant black comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot twisted near the end, possibly Deceptive at a particular time. But do not worry. Such a delicious movie can be seen as a family or with your child.
