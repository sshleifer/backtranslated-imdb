I saw the original external limits in real time, when they were broadcast for the first time and since then I have seen the whole original series over and over again on reps and on DVD. I think the New External Limits ARE MUCH MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as suggested by some of the more adolescent commentators. <br /> <br /> With seven (7) years of programs versus only two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have undoubtedly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a television series ( by cable) much longer and very well produced. The plots are intelligent and scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the future, sometimes frightening and imminent. <br /> <br /> While most Hollywood producers and directors ignorantly consider that science fiction is indistinguishable from horror and fantasy, this series returns to the origins of science fiction in logical, moral and philosophical of the new technologies in their possible short-term realizations. This series does very well and remains unique by mentally avoiding the monster of video games "shoot-em-up" of much of the current generation. It has brain, history, message and good entertainment. It is a series for adults without unbearable adolescent fantasies of know-it-alls. Hurrah! <br /> <br /> Now, if we can only get MGM to launch the entire New Outer Limits series on DVD instead of just the six test discs and the 1st season is now only available.
