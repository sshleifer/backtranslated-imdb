I've always liked Sean Connery, but as James Bond I've always favored Roger Moore. However, it was Connery who set the Bond standard and although in 1983 he had established himself as something other than James Bond, the money must have been irresistible for him to make an appearance more like 007 and save the world from the evil designs of Specter. <br /> <br /> And what designs they have in Never say never ever. SPECTER with the help of a young and foolish Air Force officer who is the brother of Kim Bassinger, stole two nuclear missiles during a war game exercise and now SPECTER, led by Blofeld, played here by Max Von Sydow, threatens the blackmail of the world. <Br /> <br /> The type of operations of Von Sydow is Klaus Maria Brandauer, who is also courting Bassinger and is a little crazy. And he has an assassin who works for him in Barbara Carrera, which makes Angelina Jolie look like Mrs. Butterworth as Nora Croft. <br /> <br /> But before Sean Connery can start, he has to deal with a new 'M' running things in British intelligence. Edward Fox thinks that Connery is antiquated in his methods and it costs too much money to the British taxpayers with their violent forms. I really enjoyed Fox's performance, he's like the great-grandson of Colonel Blimp. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed Carrera, she is something to look at and quite ingenious in her methods. When you're diving with Connery in the Bahamas, notice how you put Mr. Shark in the 007 case. <br /> <br /> Will Connery go back to James Bond? He was widely quoted as saying that, who would have chosen him for this moment, Roger Moore's father? But I think Connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair.
