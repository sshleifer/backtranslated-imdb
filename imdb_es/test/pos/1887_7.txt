Okay, so I love silly movies. If you like silly science fiction movies, the best movies or if you are a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, I would go see this movie. This movie is everything I wanted it to be. Being a fan of the most important films, this fits perfectly. Every time I thought to myself "this movie would be the dumbest, the best movie in history if it happened * blank * ..." as I thought, it would happen in white *. It's a wonderful silly movie. If you are a Campbell fan, I would say 'look', bring your friends, laugh about it. It's fun. It's not classic, or anything, but if it's on television some night, look at it. It has become, for me, a film that I will archive under "Indulgent Films". Movies that may not be good, but after a hard day at work, I could go home and watch, (this list also includes "Harold and Kumar go to the white castle", "Army of darkness" and "intolerable cruelty") . br /> <br /> If you feel like an exaggerated movie, wonderfully slightly bad, look at this. If not, go rent "Bubba Ho-tep"
