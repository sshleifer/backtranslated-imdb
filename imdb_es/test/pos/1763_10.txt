Could this be one of the first films in color? Actually, it is the second one. This is a very beautiful film produced by Thomas Edison. This was one of many of his other films. <br /> <br /> I think this is the most beautiful of all Thomas Edison movies. It shows a girl dancing and moving her dress around her, which turns red with the movie. It is simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> You're watching the story when you see this. You are watching what began to make great movies of the day! It may not have an argument, or something very interesting, but this is the second color film in history. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone, especially if you are teaching the students to film or something like that, You have to show them what the movies in color started!
