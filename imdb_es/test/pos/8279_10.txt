I have been an avid fan of squirrels listed since the late 70's - early 80's. When this movie came out, it was a must see it. And after seeing it, I went directly and bought it! The film is great, I love the animated action it brings, and the music is great (yes, I bought the soundtrack on a CD ...) A recommended video for everyone to see and enjoy!
