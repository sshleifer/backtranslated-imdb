I saw this movie on a big screen a few months ago. I did not know what to expect with precision, and for the first ten minutes I was afraid I would not enjoy this movie. It started very slowly, quietly and almost banally, which was less exciting since the sound was bad enough and the subtitles were sometimes impossible to read. <br /> <br /> But I definitely do not regret having continued to see it. It's one of the most beautiful Bergman films I've seen, at the same time as human, ruthless and psychologically so compelling. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen actors play so wonderfully, with such intensity in their faces: Liv Ullman's performance is unforgettable and Sydow is also excellent. <br /> <br /> There is always psychological violence in Bergman's films, and this may be the most physically violent of all. The tense relations between man and woman evolve in parallel with the physical violence that surrounds them ... <br /> <br /> Finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly surprising human depth. An excellent Bergman. <br /> <br />
