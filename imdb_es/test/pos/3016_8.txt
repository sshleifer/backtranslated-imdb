I do not want to go into a critique of the movie, which I think it is, for a big budget movie, quite exceptional and daring. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to comment that I'm really sick of the studies. The policies and laws of different states that treat their viewers as children. In the database we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to the execution time. But, of course, there are likely to be many more different cuts. <br /> <br /> The result is total confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie (unless you live in Argentina, where the movie runs 115 minutes, which sounds pretty complete). <br /> <br /> Later, on DVD and video, the studios try to steal us more by selling us an alleged director's cut (in Germany, there is already a version of this type, running approximately 110 minutes). <br /> <br /> It would be good if the studios not only think about the money they earn with their films, but also think of their products as a work of art, even at risk. of an unfavorable rating, so that I, as a spectator, do not have to feel cheated and take me seriously, not just as a money resource.
