You do not check James Bond movies, you evaluate them, you rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things that one expects, including the demand for a Bond movie and each individual effort fulfills or not. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond movie a Bond movie. And though he NEVER SAYS AGAIN AGAIN is not technically part of Bond's official filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery who returns as 007 makes him more than just an honorary member of the series. Anyway, this is how it is classified on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Title: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: the intelligent title has no apparent link to the real story, but is a reference in jest to Sean Connery's vow not to play OO7 again after having been lured once before because DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. In any case, it is a catchy title. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Pre-Credit Teaser: Maybe trying to avoid any obvious parallels with the official EON Bond movie series, there's no Teaser; The initial scenes are only shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: another fake "oh-no, Bond has been killed". 4 points <br /> <br /> Opening Credits: Apart from a screen full of little 007s, they did not even bother trying to animate the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 point. <br /> <br /> Theme song: as written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall, "Never Say Never Again" would be a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's just fine. 6 points <br /> <br /> "Bond, James Bond": Appropriately, since this movie sees Connery return to serve as Bond after a break of a decade, the story begins with 007 in front of the question of whether Bond / Connery is still up to the job. Happily, Connery proves himself more than ready for Bondage. Although it is a little more gray, has a little more circumference and takes a toupee a little more obvious, does not seem to have problems to return to action. All in all, he is one of the best and most relaxed characters in Connery, like the character. 9 points <br /> <br /> Bond Babes: Even in the best Bond films, female characters are not given much dimension; They exist to a large extent as necessary accessories for the use of Bond. The future Oscar winner, Kim Basinger, has plenty of room to maneuver to create her character Domino Petachi and the film benefits from it. She does a good job, and it's not bad to look at either. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Villain Bond: reports of his death are obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back, at least for the moment, showing that he has more lives than his precious kitten. Once Jesus, the villain turned into a stereotyped villain, Max von Sydow does not have much to do on paper, but it is still a silky presence. But it is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a series of banal villains of Bond, it is very refreshing that Brandauer has given a performance that is both subtle, but at the same time very colorful. Fun without being a camper, ruthless without looking caricatured; his Largo is located at the height of Auric Goldfinger as one of the best Bond villains. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? When playing with all the audacious style of a particularly extravagant drag queen, Barbara Carrera traverses the film, showing a mixture of funny evil and more than a bit of pure psychotic madness. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of deadly women, most of whom have been so easily eliminated that they existed more as a fun gift than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flash by the dramatic or so fierce determination. Even his premature demise is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Sinister of the plot: like a new version of THUNDERBALL, the film seems a little done there: the nuclear missiles are stolen and the most important real estate will disappear if all the countries of the world do not pay a multimillionaire rescue. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky to find himself forced to redo one of Bond's weakest adventures. By comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film is successful on its own. 9 points <br /> <br /> Production values: the film begins with an uncomfortable style, like a television movie that tries to be more than it can. But as the story progresses, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, which makes it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bonus points: there are several strange changes that differentiate this Bond movie from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly recognized; played by Edward Fox, "M" is a grumpy growl that does not respect the "Double Os", an omen of how Judi Dench would play the role later on; and "Q" suddenly has a cockney accent and is Bond's friend. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as the substitution of Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that fits intelligently into the story. And a great rescue near the end is on horseback, a tribute to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points <br /> <br /> Summary: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas, it is more than valuable thanks to the hero Connery, the villain Brandauer, the murderer Carrera and the damsel in distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; As apparently unimportant as the opening credits, the theme song and such seems, the film lacks due to its absence. Everything comes out like a fake Bond movie; a very good substitute, but a substitute, nonetheless. <br /> <br /> Bond-o-meter Rating: 78 points out of 100.
