I loved this movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good spy parody and who thinks Johnny English was a shame. This is the movie that JE should have been. But it's based on a series of old French films, so it's not really related to Bond. <br /> <br /> The production is brilliant, you will almost believe that the film was recorded in the 60s. It even has the same kind of pastel color that the coloring films had in those days. Jean Dujardin does his part with just the right amount of stupidity and naivety, not pantomime nonsense like Rowan Atkinson. And if you do not like the movie, you'll want to see it for Berenice Bejo. Oh la la! She is the warmth ...
