... "Inglorious" since our local theater decided to show its title in its marquee, minus the second word. It is a fantastic cinema. <br /> <br /> I have no hesitation in recommending this movie to all but the most apprehensive. May they never know what they are missing. <br /> <br /> I hesitated to give it ten stars because of my experience with previous Tarantino movies. In all cases, except Reservoir Dogs, they have improved with additional observation. <br /> <br /> So, although I gave it ten stars, I did it reluctantly. It does not let me "up" to go. <br /> <br /> Yes, Christoph Waltz is the Nazi that we have all imagined would be the worst. He is cultured, sophisticated, gentle and very sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who snuffs out his cigarette in a strudel, crushing it in the whipped cream as if he were crushing his heel in a victim. <br /> <br /> To understand the Tarantino movies, you just need to have a sense of dialogue, color and rhythm. The colors are as bright as necessary and, when necessary, brighter still. In the French farm of the initial scene, they are dull and dark, but in excess. Outside a bright sun shines, but in the only room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliant scenario for an interrogation of Waltz, as the "Jew Hunter" of the SS, who detain the host French farmer on the precipice of revealing what he can not reveal many times, then what they push back with lines of friendship and understanding. <br /> <br /> A second German sadist, well played by August Diehl, later works as an important actor in the final turn of the plot. Diehl's biggest Nazi, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz ... almost. <br /> <br /> The film classes will study a lot of this film. They should look fondly at the magnificent rhythm. Tarantino knows how long to draw a scene, creating suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then at the breaking point, suddenly arriving at a resolution. <br /> <br /> For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish owner is organizing a surprise for senior leaders of the Nazi leadership. <br /> <br /> We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, waiting for the hated German dignitaries who will arrive for a preview of the film The Last Masterpiece of the movie Deutsch, a propaganda about a German hero and his doubtful achievements. <br /> <br /> Laurent is framed in a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the magnificent theater, his red lips and his low cut dress. Reflecting everywhere the intensity of your designs on your guests. It is a single shot that would be worth a full movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately there are many more images of this kind, many more scenes of exquisite dialogue and suspense. <br /> <br /> In summary, look at it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again.
