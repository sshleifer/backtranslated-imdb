One day I found The Last Stop in a video store and they sold it for only $ 2. I decided to try it and I bought it. It was pretty good, I enjoyed it. The story is about several people trapped in a cabin somewhere out of nowhere due to a snowstorm. There's a police officer, Nancy, his ex-girlfriend, two brothers who just got out of jail, an older man and his lover, a black man and the couple who own the cabins and their son who never speaks. Suddenly, someone is killed and a bag full of cash is found. Everyone is suspicious. The Last Stop is a good thriller, I would give it 8/10
