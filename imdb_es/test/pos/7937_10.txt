There is a version of "Nevsky" that is shown with a live symphony orchestra, chorus, soloist and film. If it was ever done within a day's travel, see "Nevsky" done that way. The Oklahoma City Philharmonic did it with the OKC Canterbury Choir (one of the best anywhere) a couple of years ago. I think I cried through all this, it was one of the most emotionally powerful film experiences of my life. I'm listening to "Nevsky" on the radio right now and it still makes me cry. There are films that I love and pieces of classical music that I love, but I can not think of any combination that approaches the impact of "Nevsky" in real time.
