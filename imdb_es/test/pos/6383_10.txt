This movie was rocked !!!! I saw it in a screener a few weeks ago. It's a strange story, where James Franco plays this idiot who marries Sienna Miller just to leave the country and they go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. I do not want to give it away because the movie has not been released yet, but it's totally great and you would never expect what would happen. I thought I would hate it because it's a romance, but it's also a little twisted and I like that a lot. The acting is really good and Sienna Miller is totally smoker and plays this very sweet girl. I think she should do more roles like this. James plays an imbecile, but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is really good. David Carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. I gave this movie a 10 because I came out of the movie I really liked it and wanted to see it again, which I did not expect and my girlfriend really liked and she cried. good appointment for appointments
