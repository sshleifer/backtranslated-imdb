This has to be the last movie for girls. We recorded it on TV a few years ago and I've seen it about 30 times over the years. I had not seen him for about 12 years and recently I saw this movie. I'm not lying, I cried from the initial credits to the final credits. This movie really breaks your heart, even if you do not have children.
