"Pearl Harbor, friend." This movie is brilliant! Surely it does not flow exactly like a multi-million dollar comedy, but the jokes that are thrown constantly are incredible. I'm one who goes for nonsense, like "Dumb and Dumber," "Airplane" and "Wet Hot American Summer" and I have to say that this is easily located there. Movies are no longer written with this type of sporadic comedy. Too many jokes in this are a surprise to the viewer that it is truly amazing that they do not know and praise this slapstick masterpiece! When you are watching this, you will easily find more than 20 quotes from it and you will find yourself quoting below: and then, to see it again, you will find even more!
