I never published anything here before, but after seeing Noroi I felt that I had to write my thoughts about it. <br /> <br /> First of all, do not compare this with Blair Witch, this movie deserves much more than that! In short, Noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies I've seen (and I've seen many!). <br /> <br /> I really liked that the movie does not present itself as a standard horror movie. , but like a documentary filmed by a reporter (I think?) called Kobayashi and his cameraman. Without spoiling much about the plot, I can say that it starts with Kobayashi investigating a series of apparently unrelated events, which turn out to be connected to something much darker and sinister. <br /> <br /> While the story might not be so original in itself, what really hooked me with Noroi was the incredibly mysterious atmosphere. If you are looking for scenes of fear and scenes that jump from the seat, this movie may not be for you. This film has to do with the mood it presents, with disturbing images and a general feeling of suspense. The style of documentary filming only makes it more credible. <br /> <br /> This is also a great help for the performance, which is excellent, although it is not perfect for the general part of the movie! Much better than in most other movies in this genre type. <br /> <br /> Well, ranting about me, I highly recommend it to everyone, it's suspenseful, spooky, well-acted and the first movie that has scared me in years.
