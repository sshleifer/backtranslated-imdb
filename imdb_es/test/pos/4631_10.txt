I think this movie is one of the most fun I've seen in my life. I think Debbie Reynolds is hilarious and the chemistry between her and Glenn Ford is perfect. There is not a dull moment in the movie and Debbie looks beautiful as always. <br /> <br /> The story is about a showgirl Maggie (Debbie Reynolds) who meets a penniless soldier Joe (Glenn Ford). She takes an instant dislike, but after he accidentally rips her dress, he gives it back to her on condition that she goes on a date with him. They end up getting married the night they have their date after just one kiss. Joe and Maggie move to Spain and discover that they have nothing in common except physical attraction, so Maggie proposes that they live for a month, but not as husband and wife, which means that Joe can not kiss or sleep with Maggie. , to Joe's frustration. . A hilarious plot and a wonderful movie. Do not be surprised
