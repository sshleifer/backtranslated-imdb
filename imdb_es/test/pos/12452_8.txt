Although the films about Edgar Rice Burroughs, the famous hero of Rousseau, Tarzan, have been seen by the spectators for almost a century, this is the definitive version of the story. Greystoke is the true story of the origins of Tarzan as established by Edgar Rice Burroughs in the second decade of the last century. The experts have assured me. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and Sherlock Holmes are probably the most filmed fiction heroes in history. In fact, I have no basis to say that, just a hunch. The most popular Holmes was Basil Rathbone, the most popular Tarzan was Johnny Weissmuller. And the films they made with both characters will be criticized endlessly by the purists. <br /> <br /> But Greystoke is the real deal, a faithful adaptation of Burroughs' first story about the origin of his hero. I can not think of another movie that shows that Tarzan learned French before English, but that is shown here and it is natural, since it was a French survivor of a slaughtered safari played by Ian Holm, who discovers Tarzan who was raised by the apes . since his parents who were shipwrecked on the African coast died there after his mother gave birth. <br /> <br /> His parents were, in fact, the son and daughter-in-law of the Earl of Greystoke and the surviving Earl, played By Ralph Richardson, of course, he is delighted to know that he has a grandson. Of course, there are others who do not welcome the new heir into society. <br /> <br /> One of the ones that does not is Andie McDowell playing, of course, Jane. She does not communicate with Tarzan in response to her monosyllabic grunts and commands. Tarzan speaks concise English, French, and also understands the language of the apes. As for the language of love, Tarzan and Jane do not need lessons. <br /> <br /> Greystoke earned three Oscar nominations for best makeup in regards to the apes, best adapted screenplay and a posthumous nomination for Ralph Richardson for Best Supporting Actor. He should also have qualified a nomination for the cinematography of the scenes of the jungle in Cameroon and the scenes of the British aristocracy in several emblematic places like Hatfield House and the Blenheim Palace. <br /> <br /> For Burroughs purists, Greystoke is the real deal. .
