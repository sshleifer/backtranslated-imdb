Accepted ... let's see. The only reason why I chose to watch that movie was the hot dog shown in the commercials when Shrader (sp?) Said: "ASK FOR MY SUPPLIER". After that I had to watch that movie and saw it with a couple of friends ... and incredible WOW. One of the best movies of the year. The whole movie was laughing at me like crazy! The plot of this story is that Bartleby (Justin Long) is not accepted in any of the schools he requested, so he creates another false university for himself and his friends, so that he can trick his parents into not doing so. . Then he makes the final touches and tricks his parents ... until, more students look at the website and see the clicker (ACCEPTANCE IS A CLICK), and all these rejections come to this school. They face many problems and it seems that they can not do anything right. 10/10 LOVED IT NOW LOOK AT IT
