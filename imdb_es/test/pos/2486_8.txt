Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect, specifically some of the actors. However, I think this is probably the most important movie of the era of the "war on terror". I grew up hating hippies and in some ways I still do. It was not until the United States began the path of an unnecessary and deceptive war in Iraq that I began to see the world through their eyes. I can feel what they must have felt. Although the film is somewhat antiquated, seeing it brings to the surface those uncomfortable emotions about our current situation. It is pretty clear at the beginning of the film that Punishment Park is designed to be a concentration and death camp for all the "unpatriotic" elements of American society. This is certainly an exaggerated and extreme vision of our polarized society, but it is CREDIBLE. Sometimes I think the United States could easily fall into fascism. While watching this movie, I could only think about how I hear similar feelings from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost daily. This film is a crude and concentrated distillation of the current political scene in the United States. I am impressed and saddened that something so relevant (and yes, accurate) has been filmed more than 30 years ago. If you take a more moderate view of the film and decide to believe that this could not happen here, look more closely at Guantanamo Bay, some of our "enemy combatants," the alleged secret CIA prisons and the many incidents similar to the of the movie. in Greensboro, NC in 1979 (8 full years AFTER the making of this film).
