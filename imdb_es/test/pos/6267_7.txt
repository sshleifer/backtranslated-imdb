A very sweet film about a young Chinese man in love with Western technology and an Englishman who tries to make his fortune by showing films in China. It is a very interesting story that is presumably based on real events, although I suppose it is more fantasy than real. It has a fairytale quality that is rarely obtained in real life, and it is also credited to 8 people by the script, so they must have been inventing things to the right and to the left. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice movie. That conveys how magical the film was to people who had never seen it before. It is not an especially profound film, which deals briefly with the loss of tradition and the invasion of Western culture, but mainly it is a pleasant little film. Actually, it's a movie that I enjoyed and that already begins to disappear from my mind 15 minutes after seeing it. Light as a souffl√©, but I enjoyed every minute.
