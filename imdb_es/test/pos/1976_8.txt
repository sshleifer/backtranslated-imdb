A little the case of "the movie in the film", or as the theme is a virtual game here, which is the reality or even more terrifying, that reality is the "real". Like any Cronenberg there are organic things, like the capsule and that. Wonderful idea: the organic pistol, a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoots the teeth. If there are some slower moments, the sets, designs and ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution. You may not like it because the way the movie is happening is quite unusual and, sometimes, annoying, but it's definitely worth it.
