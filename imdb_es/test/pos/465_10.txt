One of the BEST movies I've seen in a long time. Bechard has a way of seeing things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you guess all the time, and with the seemingly taboo subjects treated, it keeps you glued to the screen. There are no bad or good guys, Bechard makes sure of that. The characters are so complex that you feel them for each of them, you care what happened. <br /> <br /> The use of Bechard and the attention to detail are unparalleled in this world of "FAST FOOD MOVIES" and, although some Some of the themes can make some feel uncomfortable: you love the feeling it gives you. <br /> <br /> I have heard too often that there are NO NEW stories to tell. Thanks Gorman Bechard for proving it's fake. <br /> <br /> Run, do not walk, to see this movie.
