A man arrives in a strange, beautiful and sterile city where no one feels emotions and obsesses with interior design. The essential resemblance of his days reminds him of "Groundhog Day"; the strange passages that enter and leave this world remind us more of "Being John Malkovich". But, in truth, this is a Scandanavian film, a piece of self-satire that also has a Scandanavian style: the tone is austere, and even the most fantastic scenes are reproduced directly, challenging you to laugh at the absurd. In my opinion, the combination is not entirely successful: there are not enough genuine laughs to compensate for the difficulties of taking the piece as pure drama. It is certainly original; Maybe my problem is that the world that satirizes is not one that I recognize. Maybe I should move to Scandanavia!
