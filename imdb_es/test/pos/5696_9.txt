Although many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic, I really connected with it. There is no plot as such, rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped in a tree with a crocodile that feeds on men somewhere in the water below them. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought The performance was mostly very good, even though the roles were quite demanding at times, and I felt a sense of warmth for the characters. The situation they were in was pretty scary and I really felt nervous about them. I found the whole movie quite nervous due to the impotence of their situation and the constant threat to their survival. <br /> <br /> The crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget movie, and believe me, I've seen my fair share of unreliable crocodile films. The creature moved well and had a real threat and, although the audience I was with did not seem too interested in the film as a whole, they still jumped and gasped each time the crocodile appeared. <br /> <br /> As for the writing I would have made some changes, particularly towards the end, but this was not a major problem. For fans of the survival horror that burns slowly within the realms of reality, this will be an attractive movie, but unfortunately I think that for many audiences looking for an exciting journey and higher production values ​​from their cinematic experience, this point will simply be overlooked.
