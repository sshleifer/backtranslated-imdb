For the most part, I just enjoy the kind of movie that allows you to escape from the current time to the future or the past. This movie is pure escapism. The dance starts almost immediately, and Debra Paget with her "purple purple" bikini dress simply has no equal in the film in my opinion. Her dance, although sensual, is surpassed by her dance at Fritz Lang's Tiger of Eschnapur, available on DVD, where she played the ballerina of the Seetha temple. <br /> <br /> A problem with the movie is the closed stage. There are few outdoor scenes, and in addition to other scenes they are a bit claustrophobic. The same places are used again and again, but with some secret passages and interesting waterways. His double secret identity is totally incredible with a beauty of that magnitude. Debra even manages a saber and has 2 enemy soldiers at bay on a ladder, she could do it all. <br /> <br /> What works is Debra Paget as a princess. With its beauty, it would certainly be the center of attention anywhere and at any time in history. This movie, when we expect it to be available on DVD, will be a must buy. In general, taken with a little humor, I loved it. <br /> <br />
