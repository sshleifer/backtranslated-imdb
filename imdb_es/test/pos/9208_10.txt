I would like to express my displeasure at NBC Canceling Las Vegas. The show had been Top Notch for the past 5 years. Tom Sellecks was great too. He really brought a good fresh addition to the show. What does NBC have now? Lame reality and night game shows. I mean, come on, keep the old and tired law and order? Not even putting Jack McCoy as DA can make the show interesting. Are we going to maintain a quality program like Deal or No Deal or ED? ER must be put to pasture a. NBC is worse now than in the days of Pre Seinfeld Cheers. With cable and the internet, NBC can not afford to fall flat on its face. PLEASE RETURN TO VEGAS! I remember when Homicide Life on the Street ended up like it did. At least they had a two-hour final of the series. Hey CBS, are you listening? Please, pick up Las Vegas is a great show.
