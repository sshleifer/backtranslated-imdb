True stories make the best stories, right? There's always something nice about a story, whether it's a novel, a film or whatever, just because it's real makes the story even more fascinating. This film is based on a true story of two young Americans, one employed by the government and hawk enthusiast, Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton), and the other, Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn), is a drug dealer. These two begin to sell government secrets, mostly from the CIA, in 1975 to the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the human aspect of the two men, as well as on their growing personal problems (especially Penn's character with all of life). (worsening drug addictions), instead of glorifying their status as traitors to the United States, which would undoubtedly harm the credibility of the film in the United States. Boyce gradually becomes more cautious and, finally, becomes frustrated and paranoid as his relationships grow longer and deeper into treacherous territory. Daulton becomes more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened, and more desperate to maintain control over a situation over which he has no control, plus he already has problems with the law. The torment of the families of Boyce and Daulton for the way they lead their lives is also well represented and adds to the idea that espionage against their own country, even if it is thought that it should be done with justice, leads only to major problems and the ruin of lives. ? Including the degradation of friendship and trust between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Here is the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> --Hutton and Each of the two did a thorough research on the characters to grasp their individual appearance, so they are represented with great depth and realism. <br /> <br /> - The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> - The atmosphere of paranoia develops quite well. <br /> <br /> - The story is fascinating and, of course, as one based on real events, it has a bit of additional advantage. <br /> <br /> - Nice games. <br /> <br /> - The Soviets who work with Boyce and Daulton are very well represented, and they are not stereotyped or have a bad conscience just to make them look bad. <br /> <br /> no Hurt It, It did not help: <br /> <br /> - The music is fine, although nothing is perfect. <br /> <br /> - Sound effects are occasionally a bit dubious, as was the case with many films from the seventies to the eighties. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) has a relationship with a woman we barely know. Due to Boyce's problems with the US governments. UU And from the Soviet Union, your life can be put in danger, but this is not as widespread as you think it should have been. However, a minor problem. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a bit disconcerting. Nothing like a constant state of immobility so that the masses feel as insecure as possible. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - See the first report of the CIA accidentally sent to the wrong place with The reason is "The hard night". <br /> <br /> This was another film that suffered great delays due to the controversial content of the story. The studios and producers did not see how a movie about two American traitors could be accepted by the American public. Fortunately, it is filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality. Of course, it helps that the traitor antiheroes are not heroically represented, more like a couple of young men who have committed serious errors of judgment in their lives. As such, it becomes a very human drama, and one portrayed very well and very credibly. <br /> <br /> Acting: 9/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Character development: 9/10 Special effects / Makeup: 8/10 (small amount, high quality) Nude / Sexuality: 2/10 (a scene in a strip club) Violence / Gore: 7/10 (no gore, just a little violence) Music: 7/10 Address: 9/10 <br /> <br / > Cheesiness: 0/10 Shit: 0/10 <br /> <br /> General: 8/10 <br /> <br /> If you like movies about spying and spying, then you can not go wrong here. If you like dramatic films with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters, this may also work for you. Highly recommended <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
