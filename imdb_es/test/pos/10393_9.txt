Beyond the Clouds is, in many ways, the rarest movie I've ever seen. Not for its cult appeal, nor for its ideas, but for the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema. Beyond the Clouds was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, one of Italy's most famous directors. However, if you gave this movie just a quick review, passively, I mean, it would seem like one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances. This film deserves great attention, to the point of covering all its cheese. By cheese I do not mean a slice, but a whole brick of cheddar cheese! It seems that the music comes from an Italian porn, the story and the dialogue are from a Japanese comic and the metaphors are so obvious that you will want to hit your head. <br /> <br /> But once you understand it. After all this, you are engaged in an existential work of art. The cheese feeds the subtle filming and draws our attention, perfectly, towards what is needed to know. The basic plot is four chapters, unrelated, and all about love. What we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said, people can not communicate with each other. Instead, they can only communicate through the other. I guess that's why the dialogue and the plot are so corny, because the conversations are too irrational with the lack of causality and the reaction of the people too melodramatic. <br /> <br /> I left that movie thinking of myself; Maybe all life is a great melodrama. We judge our feelings towards others as real and determined. I hate, because I'm right. But what does the hated think? Maybe they think my hatred is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic. <br /> <br /> Then the melodrama is actually an existential function. A corny romance is simply human interaction placed under a magnifying glass, which allows us to see the futility of who we are and what we do. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I recommend it to everyone!
