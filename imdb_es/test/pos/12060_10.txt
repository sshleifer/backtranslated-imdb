I've noticed that many people have commented that the nature of this program is racist and homophobic, but I do not think that's what this program is about. <br /> <br /> The program is about parents who were not ready for children and now is not ready for teenagers. This program helps bring humor to a very difficult subject that is sometimes overlooked: fatherhood. <br /> <br /> Yes, we have all had programs with families, for example: Family affairs, Step by step, Family Ties, Full House ... but you would always have the same old recipe for your episodes. "Steph" cuts out of school and is trapped by her father. They have a heart to heart conversation and the music plays and ends with a two-week base that after an "aww, dad ..." gets a smile and the show ends. Where is the comedy in such a situation? Where is the realism? With The War at Home, you get real situations from a real father type figure. Most parents who watch this program listen to some of the phrases that parents say and laugh (because they know they said it!) Or nod their heads (because they know they've thought about it and never had the guts to do it) ). Say it!) The War at Home has situations that make a great comedy look like a father who thinks his son is gay. It does not sound funny, most think it makes the father homophobic, but the comedy appears in the clumsy father who tries to talk to his son to open up. What father knows what to say, especially in a situation like this? I highly recommend this program to anyone I know who has a sense of humor, and especially to those who are young or young parents when they had children. You relate to a show like this when you're fine.
