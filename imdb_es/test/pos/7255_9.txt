When I went to the video rental store, in the days when the DVD was almost unknown to me, I had seen all the movies in the store that interested me. Or so I thought! The man behind the counter told me he had something for me that I would definitely like. He gave me "Plunkett and MacLeane." At first, I doubted it was a good thing, but I trusted your advice and ... man, I'm sure I've taken this gem! This is one of the best adventure movies in years, if you ask me! Of course, with Robert Carlyle as an important part, how bad can a movie be? Surely, Liv Tyler does once more what she does well and nothing more: be pretty. But still, you can clearly feel that the cast apparently had a lot of fun doing this movie.
