In a world very close to the future, a corrupt government constantly watches everyone with computers and surveillance. A man has managed to evade assimilation and operates outside the system, fighting to preserve his freedom. An attractive and imaginative story and a very interesting editing and camera work. There are some confusing and slow parts, but in general, an excellent example of what a small team can do with intelligence and talent with a reduced budget.
