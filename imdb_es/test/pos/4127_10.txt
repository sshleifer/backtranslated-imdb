This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance at home. It is a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts, but mostly music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly continued, although her pastor, her parents and the Nashville producer told her no. Buddy Holly did not give up what he liked. I did not know much about Buddy Holly until I saw this movie. I've been to the Surf Ballroom where he played for the last time, but I did not pay much attention until I saw this movie. It's an amazing movie with lots of fun, so stand up and watch this movie.
