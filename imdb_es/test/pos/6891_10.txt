Although it has been off the air for 6 years, Promised Land was one of those programs that are presented once or twice in a generation. Good cast, cast (including Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis) and crew. The plot is credible with McRaney packing his family and simply saying "to hell with everything" after being subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from Vietnam years earlier. I think many of the veterans of the Vietnam era, including myself, could really relate to McRaney's thinking process to finally decide his course of action. Many of us did exactly the same thing in real life, after returning from that war and finding that the United States was not the same place we left. The show imparts not only values, but also a look at what happened in the life of a veteran. Only in those two aspects, I think it is one of the most moving television series of our time. Why this program only worked for 3 years is beyond me.
