I would say that this movie is disturbing. The brutality is described in a very sick way, it is like a psychosis in 40 minutes. At the same time, it is a cruel introspection in human behavior. The scenes are fierce, starting with the butchery of the horse and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. All emotion is exploited to the maximum, the butcher's frustration, the love for his almost incestuous daughter, the anger when he discovers that he has been mistreated, every feeling is so natural and so bad. This film offers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way. The message of the film is that a person's life can change in a second as a consequence of their behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine their performance. I loved the unique way of filming, the simplicity and brutality accompanied by the silence in which only internal thoughts penetrate.
