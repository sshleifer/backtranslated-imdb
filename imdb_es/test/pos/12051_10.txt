The movie is a very good movie. One of the best films of Yash Raj. The address is incredible. The script is great. The story is excellent. He tells about Rahul, who is obsessed with Kiran, his friend from the university. psychopath doing things like talking to her mother on the phone (she died anyway 15 years ago), etc. Kiran is committed to Sunil. Rahul does everything possible so that he can catch her. He even tries to kill Sunil, but he survives. He even goes to the place where they go to their honeymoon. The movie is a delight for everyone. Shahrukh is excellent, Juhi is pretty good, Sunny is average, Anupham is fine and Tanvi is also good, Dalip did well. The movie belongs to Srk. The dialogues are brilliant (Shahrukh and much, if not comedy and comedy). "Jaadu Teri Nazar" and "Tu Mere Samne" are absolutely melodious tracks.
