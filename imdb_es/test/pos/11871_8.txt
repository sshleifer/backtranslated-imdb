This movie will never be on a list of the 50 best movies of all time, but if you are compiling a list of "funny movies", this is not a bad place to start. Liv Tyler is amazing, captivating and exquisite, and everyone else is right about their parts. It is a 21st century counterpart to "Tom Jones," in other words; Simply good, fun. I think this may be Tyler's breakthrough film on his way to mainstream stardom. Without nudity she oozes sex in this movie. No wonder all children give him toys. How could they help but do that for a helpless and innocent person like Liv's Jewel?
