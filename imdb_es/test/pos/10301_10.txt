This film is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people. There are only three locations (the school, the store and the coach's house) that are actually used. However, it is mainly in the home of the coach. A film does not need special effects or incredible views to be amazing in itself. <br /> <br /> Four friends who had joined during their basketball days meet. One is rich, important and has no real love outside of money. You want to be mayor again, but your competition is making you bitter. You want to be a superintendent of the school and take care of your family. One is an alcoholic who travels. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love the actors in this movie. All of them have been very well known names for me. They proved their worth here. <br /> <br /> One of the most crucial moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, explodes in the coach. He screams and complains about how the coach cheated in the winning game. The coach's whistle sounds and he shouts his words again: "Forgive me, father, because I have sinned!" It's amazing to see it, with an energy that gives you chills. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for anyone who understands human emotions and does not need bright effects to interest them.
