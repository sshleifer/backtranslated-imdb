This is one of the best vampire tales of all time! I really love this movie. The characters are great, including the places and the history. In fact, the image is not a big budget production, but it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Well, there are some flaws (especially Castle Names and Locations) in this movie, but those mistakes are Usually, and they're almost in every horror movie. <br /> <br /> The scenario fits perfectly with the story and is close to reality, I can say it with sincerity, because I visited them once when I was in Romania on my vacations. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best part of the subspecies series.
