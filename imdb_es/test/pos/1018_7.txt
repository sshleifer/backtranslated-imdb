"Are you in the house alone?" It belongs to the days before cable television when networks were anxious to offer an alternative to popular television programs. It's a well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. Kathleen Beller plays a high school student who receives a series of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think it's just a joke, but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller's parents, Ellen Travolta (John's sister) is the principal of the high school and Dennis Quaid has one of his first roles as a rich and conceited child. It is a competent cooler with a social message still relevant. Beller is charming: if you are 30 years old or older, you will remember that he was very popular with young people. Blythe Danner, whom I generally do not like, offers a really touching performance. Nice little movie
