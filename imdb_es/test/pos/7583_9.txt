In the history of cinema, each great filmmaker had to create a first film. Many times, when they are seen after they have become a success, a light bulb goes on in our heads. The connection is made and we see the solid base from which they started. The same goes for HORSES ON MARS. It is the subtle humor woven around an apparently simple narrative that tells a great story, but that allows you to enjoy the images at the same time. In the images, I found great attention to detail and a polished production that is rare in any student film. <br /> <br /> A young filmmaker always has improvements to make. But if Mr. Anderson continues on this path, I think we will someday remember this movie as the beginning of a great career. <br /> <br /> You should definitely watch this movie. Nothing surpasses the greatness of the big screen.
