The twentieth animated film by Walt Disney was the last to be illuminated by the great man (he died at the end of 1966) and is generally not considered among his best results. The main problem is that, on the surface, the film seems to be simply the feline version of LADY AND THE TRAMP (1955) or 101 DALMATIONS (1961), which are certainly more loved by the fans. Even so, they are an animation. and lover of cats, I dug this reasonably inflatable mixture in which a coveted cat (voiced by Eva Gabor) and her three kittens are thrown into the streets of Paris by the wealthy butler of a lady (Hermione Baddeley). Fortunately, they encounter a stray street cat (Phil Harris) who guides them on the return trip and are helped along the way by a feline jazz band (directed by Scatman Crothers) and two helpful and amicably crazy dogs; Meanwhile at home, Edgar, the butler, celebrates his supposed heritage and the mouse and the horse do what they can to help their fellow feline pets. Legendary artist Maurice Chevalier was removed from his retirement to sing the lead song (which includes a verse in French) and the Scatman band indulges in a windy number "Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat".
