Based on the true story about Christopher Boyce (Hutton) and Daulton Lee (Penn), and his involvement in the sale of US secret government documents to the Soviets during the 1970s. Boyce works for the government, and his job is to protect these documents in particular, which finally disappoints him about the affairs and practices of his country. Then, he recruits his drug-trafficking friend, Daulton Lee, who has become a wanted man, to be the messenger of these confidential documents. Lee infiltrates the Russian Embassy in Mexico and gets in touch with Alex (Suchet), and both begin to play the game of espionage. <br /> <br /> Lee's interest is purely money, while Boyce is acting out of anger towards the system in which he is involved. Alex believes that Lee is the internal man of the US government. Things begin to become a set when Lee's drug addiction and reckless behavior in handling the courier position compensates both Alex and Boyce. Lee becomes more paranoid, and the initial spying game becomes more deadly and consequential for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is a true spy thriller without the cheesy action. The motives of the characters and the analysis of the subjects of real life are nice but they are very well written, and the film intertwines real-life events with underlying political themes about human predatory behavior. Where a larger nation uses its political power to control the smaller nations. Well directed, and intense in parts, especially when the protagonists become immensely crazy in the spy game. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give amazingly fascinating presentations in a film that questions authority, and yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of that system. The difficult situation of the protagonists becomes the underlying message within "The Hawk and the Snowman", and turns it into an intelligent political thriller with a moving element about society, human relations and the American system. Great movie! <br /> <br /> **** 1/2 of *****!
