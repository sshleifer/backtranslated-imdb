I rented this movie without knowing what to expect, but I loved WHOA! <br /> <br /> For anyone who, like me, was expecting a good movie that combined horror and science fiction, it's time to Rejoice because the wait is finally over. Write, act, film and direct: all first class. I hate to admit it, but actually I cried in a moment (when Dracula was talking to the crippled man). Truly an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. The corridors of the ship provided the perfect setting for this story and the actors could really make their fear come alive. And Coolio as a vampire ... very good! <br /> <br /> And believe me ... as good as most of the movie was ... the ending will LEAVE YOU! I know this movie gets really weird on this site for some reason, but I know that NONE of you saw the end coming. Sparkly!
