Excellent performance There are still good actors around! Also great direction and photography. Very loyal to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans. Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monologue (briefly turned off, turned off). It gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it more interesting. Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady, Macbeth, who can be very cheerful at times and, sometimes, looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. If you love death and decay, and the lyrics of Shakespears ... this is the only one.
