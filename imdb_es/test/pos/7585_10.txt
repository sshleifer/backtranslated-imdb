Horses on Mars is a wonderful journey made by very small creatures. You do not have to try hard to keep your attention and the characters are really memorable. Most of the credit goes to Eric Anderson for his visual style and for writing an interesting story, but Anuj Majumdar also deserves credit for the narrative and the wonderful musical score. These choices obviously were not an accident. If you can, see it in a 35mm range for the greatest impact. It's a pretty beautiful movie!
