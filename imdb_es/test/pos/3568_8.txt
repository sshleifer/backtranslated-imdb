"When I die, someone will bury me, and if they do not, what's the difference? Who cares, huh?" Therefore, the philosophy of life (or the lack of it) is summarized once and for all in this classic less than fun, but nevertheless fun of the "Trilogy of dollars" by Sergio Leone. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, three obviously evil men travel to a western city and, with threatening looks, intimidate all the normal pathetic people hiding in their homes. The observer observer will notice that each of these three has a striking resemblance to Leone's characters, for a few dollars more. There's one guy in Eastwood's poncho, one in Lee Van Cleef's black suit and another who seems to act like Gian Marie Volonte's Indian. But this movie is not about these guys. They hardly go to the city when they are killed by someone even more awesome than them, a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the unknown. <br /> <br /> No. This is a completely different story. <br /> <br /> In an obvious copy of Leone's good, bad and ugly, three armed men compete again for a hidden treasure. Once again, there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandit. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressing like a priest. He is behind the reward for the bandit Monetero (Gilbert Roland). But when the Monetero gang steals three hundred thousand gold coins, the Stranger deviates from his normal line of work. <br /> <br /> To complete the trio is the corrupt bank executive of Edd Byrne, Clayton. He also wants the money for himself. But after the money is hidden, the only man who knows where it is is shot. Now, the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest. The game is also finding the treasure before anyone else. And any weapon can play. <br /> <br /> With a lot of gunfights, fist fights and double crosses, the action takes these three to the ultimate confrontation scam, a three-way draw for the hidden treasure to the alo, the good, the Bad and ugly, but with a touch. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good as Leone's, of course, but in the end who cares, huh? This movie is fun: nihilism of the 60s, spaghetti western style. There are no rules, no lasting loyalties, neither correct nor incorrect, only the treasure and what is necessary to obtain it. And, although the film is not classic, the ending surely is. Hey, maybe we can all get along, for a hundred thousand a piece. <br /> <br /> If you like spaghetti westerns, take a look. It's fast, furious and worth it.
