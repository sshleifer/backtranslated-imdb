This is one of those games where you love it in pieces or hate it in strips. Even being a Mario fan can make you not like this game. You can hate it because it is short and a bit boring and easy. Or you can love It's because it's a mix of incredible graphics (not a great enthusiasm for Nintendo fans), music or games. I know a lot of people who say it's amazing, and others who think it's the worst Mario of all time. It really depends on the type. You're a Nintendo fan Personally, I love this game and I think it's the best Wii game, but you must determine it for yourself. So, I think you should get it if you're the right Nintendo fan. But if you love The Classics too much, you may not like it. So try it yourself.
