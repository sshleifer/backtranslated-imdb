Another that slipped through the radar of most anyone. This little gem produced by B is so full of new ideas in an ancient genre and so absolutely refreshing and inventive, that a terrible feeling about the lack of balls in today's cinema outweighs your body. The final set is so innovative in its configuration and style that it prefigures everyone, from Tarantino to John Woo. Oh, and if you think "dying lines" are clich√©s, wait for the dying FF line. A piece of dialogue that could have torn you with laughter will take your heart. A real pleasure. Look for it and look at it. You will not regret.
