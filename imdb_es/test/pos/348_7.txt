What exactly do people expect when they see a movie by Al Adamson? Do you expect a classic cinema that is wonderful beyond what you can believe and will leave lasting memories? You would think so for some of the criticisms. Al Adamson movies are of poor quality, sordid and cheesy, not much more, so if you know them knowing that it helps, you do not need to take them at face value, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value . First, this starts by ripping the music out of the final subject of the outer limits, so that you know that things look promising. This is the story of a crazy cult that lives in the hills and when trying to raise a corpse, the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital. Of course, Nurse Sherri serves her needs and everything else, and when an operation is needed, she simply spends time in the operating room when the guy passes by, so her spirit invades her. And Nurse Sherri begins to change. She is no longer the good nurse, she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. There are a couple of small parallel stories like people trying to burn the dead cult leader's body and a blind soccer star that has become the love object of one of Sherri's coworkers who also gets into voodoo . This is not bad if you are a fan of cult movies, but it can be bad if you are a fan of "Spiderman" because you will not like it. Sometimes, this actually leans toward "respectability" (for Adamson, anyway), but then "does not redeem himself: with some ridiculous event." If you enjoy Adamson's films and similar trash, maybe you like this, for anyone who may be looking for a lost treasure, keep digging 7 of 10.
