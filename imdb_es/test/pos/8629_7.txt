So I guess Bud and Lou just liked messing with the classic stories (although they had some interesting results). In this case, they are taking care of a bad boy, and Lou tries to read "Jack and the Beanstalk", but he falls asleep and dreams that he is the butcher of Jack and Bud, and they go up to the stem to rescue the prince and the princess. of the giant (Buddy Baer). <br /> <br /> I think my favorite scene was when Lou was trying to make a giant tortilla, and ... well, I'll let you see what happens. Since this was a movie by Abbott and Costello, they had some unnecessary songs, but other than that, it was pretty funny. For other interpretations of the classic history, "Bewitched" and "Gilligan's Island" had episodes that portrayed her.
