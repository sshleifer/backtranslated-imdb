Michael is probably too tender for most fans of action movies and also Hollywood for the intellectual crowd, but I found it extremely funny and very touching, even though it is both monotonous and formulated. <br /> <br /> When three skeptics are sent to investigate a man who claims to be an angel and ends up escorting him on a great tour of the middle side of the western field, only to discover that each of their hearts is the that needs investigation. <br /> <br /> By taking this apart from the movie, as with most movies today, there is not much new material, but when taken together, it has an original and refreshing approach and is sophisticated enough as to entertain one so far. <br /> <br /> While it is not a "Family" movie, it is suitable for all ages and a good movie to share with the whole family or that special person. <br /> <br /> "Michael" is not a great movie, but it's definitely a good movie, a moving movie and well worth watching. <br /> <br /> KWC
