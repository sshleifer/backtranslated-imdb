While watching this movie once again, I think it belongs to the best Hitchcock films. The first time I saw it I was amazed by the suspense, the action and the images. It has the exciting end, the deranged killer, the innocent man framed or victim of circumstances, some great shots in place, for example. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Central Penn in New York. He also has great supporting actors with Hitch's daughter, Patricia, in the role of Ruth Roman's younger sister and unconditional Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock films. The merry-go-round episode near the end is one of the most stressful of nerves in Hitchcock's work. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony (his last full movie) gives a great performance as the deranged A stranger on the train, who gets into the life of the carefree tennis star, Guy Haines (Farley Granger ). Granger plays the good boy who is caught in a messy divorce. The film begins with the camera showing the shoes of two separated men when they leave their taxis to board the train. Eventually, they meet and history takes over. The stranger has an unusual interest in the tennis star and, as the movie continues, the stranger becomes a stalker. The action changes from one place to another, including Washington, the fictional small town of Metcalf, the Forest Hills tennis championship and a passenger train that carries the two leading men back and forth on separate missions. Towards the end, the rhythm of a tennis game is woven into the plot as they race against time. The camera cuts the faces of the athletes while they volley and serve in a series of remarkable shots. When the contest ends, climatic persecution is carried out. Hitchcock loves trains and it's great to see Penn Station, it's been a long time since he left. The trains appear in the 39 steps, the lady disappears, the shadow of doubt, the spell, the north by the northwest and this movie. <br /> <br /> This classic Hitchcock thriller took place at the beginning of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense, the 1950s and I am convinced that one day it will be released in the Hall of Fame of Hitchcock. .
