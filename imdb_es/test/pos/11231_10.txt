In 1955, in a small town in Northfork, Montana, an incredibly atmospheric dream movie is made. Government officials arrive to evacuate the city that is about to be flooded by a new hydroelectric dam. There are other visitors in the city, the angels of another era, but they were only seen by a dying child, Irvin. A local priest (Nick Nolte in a quiet harrowing performance) takes care of the child. Irvin begs the angels to leave the place with them ... <br /> <br /> There is a supernatural quality in the film, a worthy duel and a sublime sadness when suddenly you realize the inevitable purpose of everything : humans and their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. Death and birth have something in common: we go through them in maximum solitude. <br /> <br /> I can not remember the movie that affected me in the same way and as deeply as "Northfork" did, the film so beautiful and so tender, so silent and so powerful, so heartbreaking and moving. Even now, after several weeks since I saw it, tears come to my eyes when I just think about it. <br /> <br /> After I saw it, I had to talk to someone about it. I sent a PM to one of my friends and asked, "Please, tell me what I just saw?" And my friend responded with the words: "You have just seen one of the best movies of modern times, one of these days others will see the light."
