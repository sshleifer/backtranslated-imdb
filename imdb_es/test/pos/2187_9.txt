SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET by Stephen Sondheim opened on Broadway on March 1, 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the lead roles. Although it virtually swept all the prizes imaginable, the box office did not meet expectations and the original production ended with 557 performances. However, fortunately, the play went on tour, and on the way it was filmed. The result is a remarkable capture of the work with George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury in a close approximation to the original staging of Broadway. <br /> <br /> There is, however, a flaw. In short: the plays are not filmed very well, since a performance that works well on stage must fill the theater and, therefore, is very, very large, and when placed on a movie, such performances at often they seem slightly static, oppressively aggressive, or both. . SWEENEY TODD is no exception. Seen in the film, it has a quality of "stop and sing", and although both Hern and Lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the sake of the camera, such is not the case of Betsy Joslyn as Joanna; his greatest performance as life reads in the film as unpleasantly frantic and his extremely operatic voice feels out of place when contrasted with the voices of the cast in general. <br /> <br /> Taking this effect of stage-play-on-film In consideration, however, this is really an exceptional rendition of a unique and macabre comedy musical in the style of the operetta. Lansbury is amazing, a mixture of stupidity, stupidity and clever wickedness, while Hern really possesses the role of the psychotic hairdresser whose clients "go to their impeccably shaved graves." The general cast is pretty good and although the film does not allow us to see enough of the set, there is enough on display to make it impressive. And music! Who can discuss what he considers most the best work of Sondheim? The story itself is extremely well known, particularly in England. In 1846, Thomas Peckett Perst improvised several urban myths for a short story that he titled A STRING OF PEARLS; in about a year he adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET, and at a time when he knew little about the copyright law, variations of the work soon appeared throughout England. However, each one was more or less the same: Sweeney Todd, a barber, kills the men who come to him to shave; Mrs. Lovett, her partner, bakes them and feeds them to an unsuspecting public. Sondheim's version is based specifically on a 1973 version of Christopher Bond. <br /> <br /> The story is very great in Guignol, with lots of blood, bodies that fall into the slides and grotesque humor; at the same time, however, the music, lyrics and secondary plot of an innocent in the grip of evil open the subject to numerous lyrical charms that one would not expect. Sondheim's lyrics are often ironic, but never more than here; He intertwines a lot of perverse satires in industry and capitalism along the way, and you certainly can not criticize the strange but Victorian of his complex music. <br /> <br /> Like the "concert version" starring Hern and Patti. LuPone, this particular film also gives us several selections that were eliminated from the 2007 Tim Burton film version, in particular the "Attend the Tale of Sweeney Todd" opening, which works as a thread throughout the play. It's also, in my opinion, considerably more comical than the movie, which tends to underestimate comedy in favor of an even greater blood sample. Whatever the case, if you're a history buff, this is the legendary Broadway show on tour, and it's a knockout. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
