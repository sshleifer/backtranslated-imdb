At the same time, John Russell was playing against ranch owner Nathan Burdette, trying to free his brother, Claude Akins, from Sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo. I was working on the other side of the law on television. These years were probably the highlight of Russell's career, his most prominent role on screen and his most famous role on television, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie in Lawman. <br /> <br /> Russell kept law and order in Laramie in the same way that James Arness did in Dodge City in Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed all the supporting characters that gave you the feeling of Dodge City at that time. Instead, he concentrated on Russell taking care of business and learning the business of the law with his young and eager deputy Peter Brown. <br /> <br /> Brown played deputy Johnny McKay, who was a very respectful young man, constantly referring to his boss as Mr. Troop. He was quite skilled with an iron shot, but he was inclined to be impulsive. The good thing is that Marshal Troop was close. <br /> <br /> The other usual series was Kitty Russell from Laramie, Lily played by Peggie Castle. This is where Lawman looked more like Gunsmoke. There was a tacit agreement between Russell and Castle that even the smallest of children could not have missed. And he was not the youngest of children when Lawman was in his first race. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Peggie Castle developed substance abuse problems after Lawman's career ended. I remember that a small obituary marked his death in the first half of the seventies. She was a beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Lawman was good without Western nonsense from that golden age of western adult television. It was one of the best.
