I love this movie. I saw it again and again when I rented it from Netflix. It had a lot of substance and meaning for me. I think a lot of people will enjoy it. I have read and seen several lesbian stories over the years and I am happy to say that they are getting better and better in the way they are presented. They tend to have a more positive sense of lifestyle. and the feeling of gay women. It's nice to see two women meet and be as happy as others in this society. I think it is evident that more and more films with this theme will adorn our theaters and television screens. Many producers and directors are realizing that lesbians live full and healthy lives and that we have wonderful stories that both people and families should see and can see without hesitation.
