It's 1969. Phoebe (Camilla Belle) is an 11-year-old girl who grows up with an idealized vision of her 19-year-old sister, Faith (Cameron Diaz). Faith is the doer, the seeker of truth, the repairer of all evils in the world. Then, one day, Phoebe and her mother Gail (Blythe Danner) receive the news that Faith is dead. Faith has committed suicide. Both Phoebe and Gail are overwhelmed by this news and, although sad, Gail laments. Phoebe can not let him go. Phoebe decides to go to Europe and find out what happened. <br /> <br /> Now it's 1977. Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) is 18 years old and decides to go to Europe because of her mother's objections to discover the truth. When she was alive, Faith was inseparable from a man she called "Wolf" (Christopher Eccleston). Although Wolf claimed to know nothing about Faith's last days, Phoebe convinces him to tell her everything. A few days later, Wolf realizes that he had not abandoned the past and joins Phoebe on his pilgrimage to Portugal. <br /> <br /> In the end, Wolf is able to talk about Faith's faith in drug abuse and His own guilt for not preventing suicide. Although angry, Phoebe realizes in the end how it really was human and fragile faith. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. I am old enough to remember the robberies of Red Army banks and I was 10 years old in 1969. This story was familiar to me. I can still remember the young people who tried to decide whether they should go to Canada or not to avoid recruitment. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but it probably happened several times in real life during that period. Camilla Belle was pleasant and fun to watch as she portrayed the young and beloved sister excited about what was happening around her. Jordana Brewster slipped easily into the role of the old Phoebe. Blythe Danner was the mother who always supported her, a role with which she is very familiar on American television, unfortunately. I would have liked to see it with stronger material to work with. Cameron Diaz perfectly interpreted the immature anarchist. Although sometimes, her performance as an activist of the 1960s seemed to come off a news story. Of all the characters, it was the wolf of Christopher Eccleston that grew the most. When we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the film, we can see that he is a worldly man. He is a patient and kind man full of anger for the injustices of the world. In the end, he realizes that the direction in which he and Faith are heading is wrong and begins to "grow" by deciding that he must fight injustice in his own way. Faith refuses to join him in this and eventually leads to his death. The wolf of Eccleston is the most real of all the characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It was nice and stimulating. "The Invisible Circus" is rated TV-MA, but there are very few curses, sex or violence in it. The theme of the film is the reason for the rating.
