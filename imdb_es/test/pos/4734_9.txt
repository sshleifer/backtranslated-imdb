I watched a television movie about the destruction in Waco, Texas. Obviously, he was strongly inclined towards the claim that David Koresh was a murderer, a child who raped a cult leader bent on killing as many policemen as he wanted and taking his people to heaven on a bloodstained staircase. <br /> <br /> The film was little more than propaganda detailing what we had already read in the newspapers. I am more and more sure of that since I saw the great documentary Waco: The Rules of Engagment. It is not that every statement made in this film should be taken as the truth of God, but that it tells the whole story instead of regurgitating only what the police authorities decided to tell. <br /> <br /> For those who have forgotten, Koresh was the spiritual. Leader of the religious movement called The Branch Davidians. The charges for drug use, kidnapping, illegal possession of weapons and legal violation (among others, I am sure) raised suspicions of the local police and after the application of federal law. While trying to fulfill a search warrant, the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) and the clan participated in a shootout that left the dead and wounded on both sides. <br /> <br /> That's when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) got involved. The communications between the two were energetic, but finally broke. The FBI prepared for an invasion by assaulting the building with explosive grenades and gas. When the building caught fire and killed many inside, including Koresh, the FBI refused to admit responsibility and said the "cult" inside had set it on fire. These images heard from Jim Jones and other violent religious organizations. <br /> <br /> The image puts on many masks to tell your story. It starts with a sample of the Congressional hearings, maybe the "truth", as far as registration is concerned anyway. What opens the eyes is how partisan politicians remained even in a difficult and serious situation like this. The Democrats were concerned with nothing more than defending each of the actions taken by the police. It was the Republicans who seemed to be open to the other side. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to relate all the new information and the analysis provided by this documentary. In addition, a list would remove the opening of the movie as it progresses. An example would be the heartrending fact that the children died inside the complex. The filmmakers are probably on the side of the Davidians in general, but they remain relatively open on both sides. In this case, the feds seem to be guilty of mishandling a situation involving innocent children. But, on the other hand, parents also have to take some of the blame for leaving their children in this harmful situation when they could have handed them over to any number of local authorities. <br /> <br /> Probably the most damning new information. He arrives late in the film and involves the FBI's claim that they did not fire on the building. This is left to interpretation, and I will reveal nothing more than saying that it is disturbing and shocking what can and can not be said. <br /> <br /> Federal officials are not held in a critical or corrupt light. more than Koresh. The biggest condemnation seems to be directed to the media, not wanting to tell both sides of a story. This element seems to prevail in recent documentaries, so I think. It is time for the media to retell stories and leave this incessant search for what will attract the largest audience and ratings. <br /> <br /> It's hard to ruin a documentary. In most cases, turning on a camera and editing interesting pieces of life is common and tells an incredible story. What few can do is throw a new light on a subject that their way of thinking is modified forever. Waco is that kind of movie. *** 5 out of ****
