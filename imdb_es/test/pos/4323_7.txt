Woaww Is it only now that you notice the links between all the characters? Of course it's Libby! And for the guy in the hatch with Desmond, any deja vu? Yes! It was the "same" guy who gave Sayid money after he killed or tortured the other soldier in episode 14 of Season 2: One of them. Well, actually it's not completely the same guy, his name is Joe in episode 14 and Kelvin in the last 2 episodes. Twins ?? :) Who knows ?? JJ Abrams ... mmmm, I'm not even sure about that :) There are hundreds of links like this among all the characters. <br /> <br /> But that was only in response to Libby's comment. <Br /> <br /> I found these 2 episodes much more interesting than the whole season 2. During that whole season I felt that there were many things that I had missed and very few things I had learned. Especially at the beginning, the first episode of the second season is excellent, and then the second is a kind of backward movement from the first ... I found it disappointing, even if I'm pretty sure everything in Lost tends to have a meaning. That was just one example of how I got frustrated when I saw those episodes. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the last 2 episodes. I think we have learned more new things in those 2 episodes than in the whole season. But all we learn are small pieces for the next puzzle, like the participation of the "relatives" of Desmond (sorry if I spoil too much, believe me or not, I do not try), for example. So many things evoked in the last 2 seasons are not yet clear or have been developed once and then nothing. And still, there is new material as if all the holes in the image were not enough. We all want to see the big picture of all that, of course, but I think we'll have to be very patient. I hope there are only 3 seasons. I'm not sure I'll watch more than 3 seasons anyway. There were also many actions in the last episode. And a good cliffhanger at the end. <br /> <br /> Basically, yes, I loved the last episode ... and yes, I want to see the third season.
