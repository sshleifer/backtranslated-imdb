While I can not say if Larry Hama ever saw any of the old cartoons, I think that writing such cartoons, file cards and some of the comics would tell you something. <br /> <br /> For the fans Of the old caricature, this is more or less a continuation of it, except with a few new characters, and a Cobra Commander more insane. <br /> <br /> We also have all the old favorites too, but on a personal level. note, one thing that always irritated me was this "Duke in charge" thing, when there are thousands of other * officials * in place. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences are also similar to the old series; The main trick here seems to be the CGI. In general it is quite good, if not a little exaggerated.
