Years ago, when I first read John Irving's book, according to Garp, I was surprised that most of the young adults I came into contact with did not like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was a thing of age and experience. I experienced a bit of déjà vu as I read some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by the younger viewers. To fully enjoy Separate Lies is surely a matter of age and experience. <br /> <br /> In this film, the viewer sees an apparently happy middle-class couple: he is a successful lawyer, she is the perfect wife of a successful lawyer. They have a house in London and a house in the country. Everything is fine until the "villain" enters, disguised as the son of the richest man in town. This guy seems to be a member of the word, "Go." Despise everyone and everything, including their own children. In the traditional way of good guys who end last, the lawyer's wife gets involved in an affair with the beater. You see that the lawyer really is a good guy, but with the killer trait of an organized perfectionist. Although he really loves her, he is boring his wife to death. The bad boy is much more exciting. <br /> <br /> All this is entangled with the death of a man in the village where all the facts point to the cad being the driver of the vehicle. . <br /> <br /> It is easy to determine that this film does not have a happy ending, however, it leads to a very satisfying ending in which the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and will probably be able to Drive your personal lives in a more successful way. <br /> <br /> Three excellent actors play the main characters of this film, and it is the presentations that make it a pleasure to watch them. Tom Wilkinson is perfect as the husband. His interpretation shows us a kind man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost contact with the world. Emily Watson shows us a woman who has been so caught up in the role of a perfect wife that she has almost lost her knowledge of passion. That passion is reborn by the character skillfully played by Rupert Everett. <br /> <br /> If you have reached that point in life where you understand that everyone has feet of clay and that everyone, even with the gifts of intelligence and opportunities: take many wrong decisions, then you are likely to enjoy watching these excellent actors creating the lives of three of these people. This is an adult film beautifully performed and directed on realistic adults.
