E. Elias Merhige's Begotten is a unique and surreal representation of the treatment that humanity gives to religion. There are a couple of different ways in which you can interpret things, but the plot itself is simple: a god diverts himself, and mother earth emerges from his body. Mother Earth then imitates the corpse of the post-mortem god, and then imbues it with what remains of its seed. After this, she gives birth to a figure of the messiah who trembles, probably in childhood, but possibly with terror when brought to life on earth. All this happens in the first 15 to 30 minutes, and after that, the rest of the film consists of robed figures that drag the Messiah (who trembles or seizes ceaselessly) through a desert landscape. The robed figures stop only to brutalize the messiah, then continue to drag him around. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of ways to interpret this, depending on your level of optimism and your view of the world. It can easily be interpreted as a somber nihilistic atheist allegory about the total lack of apparent power that Christian "deities" can perceive as having in a modern society that only invokes their names to promote their own selfish goals. Or he can interpret it as a postmodern pro-Christian allegory, in which he considers that the film deals with how humanity has distorted the message of Christ so much that its original purity and innocence can no longer be relevant in a world where that message and image They use inappropriately to support everything from interpersonal violence, to war, to totalitarianism. <br /> <br /> The images of this movie are phenomenal, and you will not see anything like it. If you can, watch the original VHS release, I recommend it. I'm not sure if the images have been changed on the DVD, but I've seen clips of this broadcast on You Tube and the effects have dropped considerably. In the VHS version, Merhige achieved a BINARY TOTAL CONTRAST. Which means that, basically, there are no midtones, except some grains in some of the shots. Apart from that, this film offers the rare opportunity to see PURE white and PURE black, and the result is impressive, amazing and quite disturbing. This film makes Film Noir look positively washed and mediocre. The shots fade each other in a surreal way reminiscent of Un Chien Andalou without having completely imitated it, for an effect that has been called a film Rorschach test. <br /> <br /> That said, the film can certainly prove Patience and commitment of the viewer. There is no dialogue to begin with. The only sound throughout the film is a fairly constant loop of crickets, punctuated occasionally by the noise of gurgling and the death of dying deities, and an amelodic synthesizing texture. Personally, I think the movie is best enjoyed listening to industrial experimental music such as the NIN instrumental remixes of the Downward Spiral era, more abstract noise / experimental music such as F * ck Buttons and Odd Nosdam. It also works pretty well with apocalyptic black metal. Basically any music with extreme textures and / or hypnotic rhythms. This is one of the most surprising and versatile aspects of this film, it is PRIME for postmodern recontextualization, how to project it during a presentation of avant-garde music or to compose avant-garde music to accompany it. <br /> <br /> Once the messiah figure is born, there really is not much change for the rest of the movie, which means that you're basically sitting for at least 45 minutes or more of the messiah figure being a drug in the desert and beaten. It looks grimly beautiful, but in reality there is nothing new in development. It helps to cement the intentions of filmmakers to communicate that, for thousands of years, people have been using the name and image of Christ for personal gain, but they can be tedious for a casual viewer or for someone with a period of attention brief. Basically, if you're looking for a modern horror movie with suspense, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a unique cinematic experience and you do not like conventional Hollywood cinema, this could be your shaky messiah.
