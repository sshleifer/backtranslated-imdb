I just saw him last night and it was great. I can see why some people have bad feelings towards him from the point of view of a fan of rugby and Maori culture, but apart from that I have no idea what is so negative. The movie is great It has a lot of heart Very inspiring and encouraging for all ages. Great family movie! They did a good job considering it was a budget movie. I love movies based on real stories / events. I grew up around rugby all my life, it's a great game, but they never attracted me because (forgive me if I offended someone, nothing personal, that's how I saw it) I thought, their workouts are not so ruthless or hard, the players are not so disciplined and did not seem as serious as other athletes and it seemed that everything was just muscular and flourishing fighting each other, etc. But after watching Forever strong, I was like, wow! I was proud! He did good things for rugby (well, changed my vision of rugby) and also the New Zealnd Haka. Actually I cried. I'm not even New Zealander and I was proud of their culture. I did not even know what singing meant until this movie. The film is NOT about rugby or rugby techniques, not even about New Zealand All Blacks or Haka or etc ... Mother of pearls !! hahaha SHUX! <br /> <br /> So, for all of you, beautiful negative people, you are missing the point! I am sure that if they had the means, it would have been better, the haka is there because that was part of the culture, the tradition or whatever you want to call it Highland Rugby. <br /> <br /> Therefore, any new member on this site like me, please do not be discouraged by those negative comments. See it yourself! You must see the movie! There is a lot you can learn from this movie, people of all ages. It definitely makes you want to be a better person and be humble! This film reminded me of many things that I already knew and with which I grew up, but I lost a little on the way! I loved! Happy reading ppls and all the best! <br /> <br /> Muawha!
