This movie surprised me. It was so realistic and the story was incredibly moving. They speak German and Russian, which makes it more credible and real. This is a movie that must be seen. The actors are also great. Really a good job. The plot takes place within a German troop in the Second World War. They have to go to Stalingrad, Sovjet, to fight against the Sovjetian armies. You connect more with each soldier in this group and follow them through all the dangers as they are captured in Stalingrad. They meet face to face with death, blood, pain and coldness of Russia. This is a movie you should see and you can not afford not to see it.
