A family of very close musicians, a rude father and four vivacious teenage daughters, is rooted, first, by the appearance of Felix, a young and handsome composer, and, second and profoundly, Mickey, his insolent and attractive orchestrator friend. <br /> <br /> Michael Curtiz takes a while to get this piece of Americana to float. The first part seems almost a paraphrase of a cereal commercial, not without a certain highly bourgeois and picturesque charm, and then John Garfield comes on the scene like the damned Mickey, making his first appearance in movies, with messy black curls. Slumbering, disoriented, rude and disheveled eyes, the opposite of Felix, the madly persuasive Jeffrey Lynn. Garfield is complete, and is needed DIRECTLY, counterpoint to the rest of the family ("Nothing I would do would surprise me", he reflects), and suddenly the film becomes interesting, although I agree with the critics who find that the plot revolves insufficiently motivated. <br /> <br /> The four sisters are played quite softly and are seriously insured, but Claude Rains as the father of the family has his moments. <br /> <br /> Look at him for Garfield, however, he is the only one really lasting thing about it.
