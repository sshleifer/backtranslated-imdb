Start a little slow but give it a try. In the spirit of the "Wackiest Ship in the Arm" and the "Pink Sub", this film is about a not so orthodox group involved in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone. Rob Schneider is priceless as an LT that is taken too seriously, resulting in a failed riot attempt and the "pirate" crew making him walk the plank. In contrast, Kelsey Grammar (similar to Cary Grant) takes nothing seriously except work. This movie is more about lines that plot. From the "frosty" fisherman in the port of Charleston to the "whale" lure, his antics took me by surprise and I laughed out loud.
