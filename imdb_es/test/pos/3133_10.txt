Two horse merchants arrive in a city and meet the leader of a group of Mormons heading to a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the city where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate the prices, and Bond presents the idea of ​​them (Johnson and his companion interpreted by Harry Carey Jr.) directing the train to this valley, are some of the best in The movie, like Johnson, a real cowboy, cuts a piece of wood while joking with Bond. Once on the road, they meet Joanne Dru, who maybe John Ford saw in Red River, and offered her a much better part in this movie. On Morman's train there are a number of notable characters. Mormanes are a peaceful group that are challenged along the way by a group of truly low-income outlaws. In his case (the outlaws), in the case of the people on the train, and later in a band of Navajos with whom they meet, and in the well-written characters played by Ben Johnson and Ward Bond, the film completely evades the stereotypes, while the camera seems to spend so much time giving the viewer the big picture of Monument Valley framing the train as it proceeds with some water crossings on the road, in black and white and then returning to what is happening in this community, all To the accompaniment of the beautiful vocalizations of the Sons of the Pioneers.
