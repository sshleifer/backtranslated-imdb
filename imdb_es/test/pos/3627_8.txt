The subgenre of the "old dark house" that dominated the first talkies rarely disappoints when we see the oldies of today. Here is one that provides so many suspicious characters that you have to ask yourself how you can tie all the loose ends in the 6-roll race time. <br /> <br /> The Crooked Circle is a band of forgers and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of his ranks to jail. They decide that he must die that same night. Meanwhile, the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs. This does not suit Thelma (Irene Purcell), the fianc√©e of the club member Brand Osborne (Ben Lyon, at the end of the mega budget HELL'S ANGELS (1930)) who wants him to leave the club and stop endangering his own life . Brand promises to resign after saving Colonel's life. Everyone heads to the newly purchased Walters mansion on Long Island to wait for the killer. <br /> <br /> The Colonel could be the new owner of Melody Manor, but it's an old dark house with eccentric neighbors (like Raymond Hatton as a local hermit) and maybe even a ghost. Zasu Pitts, the best billed, is Nora, the housekeeper who expects to see a spirit in every corner. Add a policeman (James Gleason) who is certain that Brand is a criminal and we have an image that is full of action and surprises. <br /> <br /> You will notice that the writer of the script did not have the opportunity to do so. Create too much dialogue because many characters repeat the same lines over and over again. Yoganda (C. Henry Gordon), a Hindu mystic (with whom the films of that time were loaded) says: "Evil is on the way". Many times and I lost count of the frequency with which Ms. Pitts says "Something always happens to someone!". There are many suspects and two characters (Mr. Gleason as the silly police stereotype and Roscoe Karns as Mr. Lyon's friend) that serve as comedy relief. The house itself has a spooky aspect (in fact, I think the same set was used in THE PHANTOM (1931)) with many secret passages and violin music that comes out of the empty rooms, but somehow you never have a feeling the dangerous. Maybe it's because nobody in the movie, and I mean nobody, is what they seem to be. However, everything goes well at the end; but going into more details would spoil it. <br /> <br /> Watch for Robert Frazer (from WHITE ZOMBIE) and Frank Reicher (best remembered as Captain Engelhorn from KING KONG) to appear among the suspects. <br /> <br /> THE CROOKED CIRCLE is a fun movie. Some aspects of the plot are predictable and, again, several others are not. I suspect you will enjoy it.
