15 PARK AVENUE is the address of "Mithi / Mithali" (Konkona) that is being searched since the beginning of the films. "Prof.Anu" (Shabhana Azmi) is the extremely affectionate and loving half-sister of Mithi from the previous marriage of Mithi's mother. The film revolves around these characters and analyzes the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the spectator the imaginary world of Mithi, through his continuous talks to Anu and others. <br /> <br /> Konkona does not deserve one but thousands of prizes (which I'm sure you'll get) for this interpretation of Mithi in this movie. You can see the appearance of a patient written on her face, by the drooping lips and the sleepy eyes, from the first scene. Rahul Bose has done a good job, but it has been reduced to half of the film despite its importance in his life. <br /> <br /> Look out for the intense relationships that are shown between the characters in the movie, Mithi. & Anu, Anu and the mother of Anu and between Anu and Sanjiv (Kanwaljit Singh). Shabhana Azmi, as usual, has made a fascinating presentation to be remembered as the sister, who sacrificed her life for Mithi. <br /> <br /> The movie may not be your usual hive of Hindi, but it can certainly make people see schizophrenic patients in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> As usual, Aparna Sen takes the film to a different ending instead of any clich√©, we can think. Congratulations to her, for this great movie!
