I bought the DVD a long time ago and finally I was able to watch it. I really enjoyed watching this movie, since you do not have the opportunity to see many of the highest quality and most serious Bollywood movies like this one. Very well done, but I would say that you should pay attention to what is happening since it is easy to get lost. When you start watching the movie, do not do anything else! In fact, I would advise people to read all the comments here ... including those with spoilers, before watching the movie. Raima Sen gave his first great performance I've seen. Aishwarya was easily at her best. All the performances were strong, direction and cinematography ... look at it!
