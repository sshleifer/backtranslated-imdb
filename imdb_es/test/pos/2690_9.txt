I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We do not usually warm up in a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we do not begin to see KoQ until almost the sixth season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Apart from the fact that we are not big fans of television "dating". Our schedules are such that we do not like to commit to watch series every time they are activated (and we do not have a DVR yet). So I guess it was not until TBS started running reps in their daily lineup on the nights that we started to see them constantly. <br /> <br /> At the moment we were hooked, there were only a couple more seasons left before the series was canceled. But we still see it almost daily in TBS. I almost prefer to watch series like this, because you can watch several episodes day after day and it helps to build continuity and what is happening with the characters without having to wait a whole week. <br /> <br /> But the episodes Stay alone at the moment when the stories are not transferred from week to week. But that's fine with me, because you can watch an episode, then lose weeks and keep recovering. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that writing was not always consistent. Some episodes would be outrageously funny, and then some would just be funny. So, I'm not sure I had the quality of writers that Seinfeld or Raymond had. But I loved the casting and the characters are pretty believable and realistic. Kevin James is just fun to watch! So even if the plot is not so good, James' body language and expressions make it worth seeing the show. Leah Remini is great as the wife "play-it-straight". I think it's more difficult to interpret the direct character for laughter than the comic character, and she does a great job. She has a knack for sarcasm and insults like nobody else. She is a hard cookie! And who can forget Arthur as Carrie's father, who lives with them in his basement. <br /> <br /> This is a great series and I was sorry when it canceled. But many thanks to TBS for keeping the King alive in the reps!
