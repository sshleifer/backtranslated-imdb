This movie was a romantic comedy, sickly and sweet, exactly like the one I do not like, but this one was nice enough to keep me interested. It was really fun in a moment (probably that's why I liked it) and then just as seriously in the next. Also, I had Ellen in her and I always had a weakness for her. <br /> <br /> Basically, the owner of a bookstore, Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old sofas in her store. She thinks it's for her and goes crazy trying to find out who sent it. She has isolated herself from the world, which is what really makes her lose her way. Eventually, almost everyone who is related to her finds this letter and everyone receives mixed signals, which creates some really fun moments. <br /> <br /> As I said, I'm usually not one for this kind of movie, but it really hurts. Enjoy it and I highly recommend it.
