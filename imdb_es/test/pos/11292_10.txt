The visual effectiveness of this movie is unparalleled with anything I've seen. And the work required to achieve it must have been incredibly long and tedious (do not just stick "Kodak Grainy Film" on your camera to get this look). Do not watch this movie to entertain yourself, see it to be visually stimulated, watch it to challenge it and provoke it in your thoughts about the film and on any other topic that comes to mind, religion is probably a thought. <br /> <br />
