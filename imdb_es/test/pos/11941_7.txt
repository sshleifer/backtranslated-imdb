Peter Coyote was the only name I recognized from the list of actors, so I was not so interested in watching this movie. The only comment on IMDb was positive, so I saw it on the night of the night. I would recommend this movie as a good evening evening. It's better than a lot of this genre. The plot is excellent, the performance is not brilliant, but it's not bad. Normally I do not like flashbacks, but in this movie they work. As I said, I did not recognize any of the cast members by name, but I recognized Michele Lee, who had a decent and hard-working performance, like the woman who wants to be by her man's side, who is lying to her. (Was it Knots Landing?) Anyway, she is using very well. Note: you can enjoy it more if you lose the first few seconds of the credits. I did it and it helped me. When you see the final credits, you will get what I want to say. The character of Wayne Kennedy, who is really strange, takes this to a 7 instead of a 6.
