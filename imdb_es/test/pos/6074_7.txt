The English Patient is one of those films that mostly deserve all the highest praise. I mean, most of them, because this film, although very serious, intense, profound and really reflective, still has some drawbacks. First, why, oh, why are modern movies so long? This lasts more than two hours and from time to time it becomes very difficult to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot. I say that if the movie were an hour shorter, that would only be good. However, we have what we have. The winner of several Oscars, The English Patient is still very good. It is a profound and insightful treatise on the human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and courage. Ralph Fiennes is an excellent crushing actor. His hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready for everything just to save the life of his lover. It's great, though half the time it's a misshapen cripple. He is the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is as usual very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot with her excellent game and the plot of the love story with that Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all huge and all very strong. And then there is the desert of Egypt, then there is a deep cloudless sky, green groves of Italy. Nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, landmines explode. The war is also here. It's obvious, terrible, and bloody. Then there are corpses, horrible bloody bodies, then naked bodies, adultery and everything. I do not know what to say. As much of a splendid work of actors, so much of realism, so much of brutality that brings the war. This is not a movie for relaxation. It makes you think.
