I love the Thackeray novel on which this film is based. And while this modern version of Becky Sharp's story is a B movie, Loy's casting, in her first first-rate role, is quite fascinating. <br /> <br /> Before Loy became the good MGM girl in dozens of genteel people and comedic roles, she was an actress. VANITY FAIR was Loy's next film for EMMA, in which she played a brat and greedy daughter who almost destroyed the loyal housewife (Marie Dressler). <br /> <br /> Loy's Becky is much more unpleasant than Miriam Hopkins version 3 Years later in BECKY SHARP. Becky, from Loy, is very much a Pre-Code movie character with his pronounced necklines and his amoral forms. It's the kind of character that Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could have easily interpreted, but Becky is still supposed to be in the elegant ensemble. That's what makes his fallen character so tragic. <br /> <br /> In counterpoint to Loy's understanding, Becky is Amelia's friend (Barbara Kent) who is not an interesting character. Mary Forbes is as good as Mrs. Sedley. Most of the other actors in this version are quite blah: Conway Tearle as Rawdon; Walter Byron as Osborne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others are almost Dickensian, it's their peculiarity: Billy Bevan as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; Montagu's love as the marquis; Lilyan Irene as Polly the maid; Elspeth Dudgeon as housekeeper. <br /> <br /> Loy is front and center in everything. While the ending is quite shocking, it has several excellent scenes, like the casino game scene where you try to steal another woman's winning roulette bet. The more Becky de Loy morally descends, the more beautiful she becomes until she is finally "trapped". The conclusion is that this is a very solid performance of Loy in a movie that should be seen.
