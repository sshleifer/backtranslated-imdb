We have advanced well beyond this tentative foray into a forbidden area, drug addiction, for the 1950s. As such, the movie may seem antiquated. The man with the golden arm fulfilled his function: he is removing a layer from the bottom of society, a revelation for a boy from the southern field in 1955, when I first saw this film in the theater. After a serious consideration about being too young, I was allowed to go. It was powerful and affected then and still maintains some sharp and painful moments of the stripped soul. Like a movie that describes solitude at the center of being, it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Filled with anguish, Frank Sinatra, in his best role, creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathize with the viewer. He transmits his impotence and ineffectiveness in a beautifully restricted performance. As a voice of common sense in the urban jungle with no way out, Kim Novak like Molly is pretty good. She is compassionate and yet is on solid ground. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays a viscous character and he does it very well. Eleanor Parker is extremely irritating and painfully insecure in her role as the pathetic Zosch, Sinatra's crippled wife. Arnold Stang is another unlikely survivor of the street. Considered as regrettable and despicable, his character Sparrow provides sour comical moments. <br /> <br /> Music is almost the star of this meditative, frenetic, moody, moving film. Elmer Bernstein's score perfectly accentuates the tensions of Frankie Machine's spiritual weakness and the physical need for heroin. Molly's theme is bittersweet and auditorily captures what the film visually represents. I do not know of any other soundtrack that effectively complements the tension and defeat within a man as effectively as this one.
