First of all, I vaguely remember that they told me this story in elementary school, about 6 or 7 years ago, so I am familiar with the story. <br /> <br /> However, much of that has changed, and there are many differences and mistakes (sometimes unnecessary) in the movie that fanatics fans will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> However, all in all, I really love this movie. I saw it for the first time around Christmas about 2 years ago (well, the first part) and then I saw it all again at Christmas, probably on the same channel. <br /> <br /> It impressed me a lot, sometimes it can be a bit overdrawn and long, but with a captivating story, a decent performance (especially from Fonda and Hobbs freeze) and beautiful landscapes, costumes and little touches of magic make This is a really special movie, which for me really reminds me of Christmas. <br /> <br /> Despite the differences with the book, I think that the film should incorporate new themes and ideas (autumn seasons, winter, etc., I think a new thief character to represent the fall) in all the images once you notice that it is quite amazing and brilliantly executed. <br /> <br /> I live in the UK, so I waited a long time for the DVD, and luckily I saw an ad that showed a series of free DVDs that were offered in the Daily Mail newspaper, which usually does not I got it, so I got the problem yesterday and finally I have my DVD. If you missed it and you want this rare DVD for Region 2, I suggest you pick up the Daily Mail tokens and send them, since your DVD will be delivered at Christmas. <br /> <br /> So for a little escape in this year's holiday season, catch fire, get dressed and watch this, as you and the kids will probably enjoy this great movie. If you do not have it, it's likely to repeat on Channel 4 this Christmas, so record!
