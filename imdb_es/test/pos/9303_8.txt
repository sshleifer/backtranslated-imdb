I find it surprising that so little has been done with the history of the atomic bomb and its development for decades after the Manhattan Project was completed. My suspicion is that this was due to serious fears in the film and entertainment industries (from the 1950s to the 1970s) with "McCarthyism" and phobias related to national security (including the Hollywood blacklist) . There was a movie in the 1950s (with Robert Taylor) about Colonel Paul Tibbits, who blew up the Enola Gay in the Hiroshima bombing, but otherwise nothing more. One could take a look at a tragedy related to the issue (the sinking of the US in Indianapolis shortly after the delivery of the bombs to Tinian) in Robert Shaw's description of shark attacks on survivors in JAWS . But the real trials and tribulations of Groves, Oppenheimer and his team were not considered capable of filming. <br /> <br /> And then, in 1989, two films appeared. I have already reviewed one (DAY ONE) that I believe is the best of the two when discussing the protracted technical, emotional and political issues in the Manhattan Project. The performance of Brian Dennehy as General Groves and David Strahairn as Oppenheimer was first class and perfectly balanced. Small side vignettes related to the anti-bomb crusade of Szilard (Michael Tucker) help to complete the story well. <br /> <br /> That is the problem here. Paul Newman is a great actor (as is Mr. Dennehy), but Newman approached Groves in a different way that, while not terrifying, is less than the clever but gentle military brass of Dennehy. Newman seems too surprised by the possibility that the weapon is the biggest stick to face the other children in the after-school playground. Yes, it certainly was, but the real Groves would have been more like Dennehy keeping his mind not on that great toy of the future, but on the business of creating that great toy. <br /> <br /> The acting of Dwight Schultz as Oppeheimer helps keep the film's basically interesting and good production, with the help of Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. But the most interesting aspect of this film is the improvement of the two tragedies of Daghlian and Slotin, particularly the last one, in the character of John Cusack's Merriman. Inevitably, in all technological advances people are killed. It's just that these two tragedies (in addition to the tens of thousands that were lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) brought home the dangers of the new unleashed power, even in the so-called peaceful and controlled experiment. The two tragedies (especially the slow and dying death of Louis Slotin for radiation poisoning) showed how much attention was needed to use atomic energy, and how the slimmest possibilities could still cause a disaster. The only really different thing I saw in Cusack's performance (and the script) and the real incident with Slotin was that Slotin really took a while after the accident to find out where all of his fellow researchers were when they were hit by the accident radiation (he could show that you only got the full effect of the accidental explosion, so that others would only need relatively minor treatment). Maybe the whole story of Slotin's actions was too technical for the screen, but given the enormous pain he suffered in the end, he took time to think about the others and proves he was a first class person.
