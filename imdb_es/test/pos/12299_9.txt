A rare exception to the rule that great literature makes disappointing films, the beautiful farewell of John Huston to life and cinema is almost totally true to the narrative and spirit of James Joyce's tale, a tender meditation on love, the death and time expressed in the events of a Twelfth Night party in Dublin's middle class around 1910. Although the material may seem unpromising, the film is successful because of its willingness to tell the story in its own calm terms, seemingly inconsequential, instead of forcing a conventional cinematic form of plot points. and dramatic incidents about it. Only once is the wrong note played, when the old Miss Julia (a trained singer and music teacher whose voice is supposed to have been deciphered by age, does not break) sings so badly that the audience laughed when I saw it at the cinema. Fortunately, the feeling of quiet and peaceful melancholy is restored with sufficient time for the moment of revelation between the married couple Gabriel and Gretta Conroy in a hotel room when the snow begins to fall. It's a sad story, I suppose, but the kind that makes you feel better, not blue. Especially recommended as a dating movie, for people in love who are not afraid to face the sweetness and sadness of life.
