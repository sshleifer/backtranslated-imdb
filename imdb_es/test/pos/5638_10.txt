This documentary is the most hypnotizing film I've seen in a long time. I must have had it for a whole day. The selected material included in the piece flows surprisingly well and develops three characters that are impossible to forget. The different layers of these people are removed to make a strangely moving film about perseverance, loyalty and determination. These characters ended surprisingly fascinating and the film is unforgettable.
