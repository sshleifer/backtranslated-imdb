This is halfway to being one of the best movies. The opening section, which simulates Hollywood's "social message" movies is absolutely brilliant. It is a disturbance from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The second section, which introduces us to the main characters in the story, is also really great. We received many configurations of great comics, first level performances and the dialogue is really dynamic. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Warning!) <br /> <br /> The one that really bothered me about this Although the movie is the end, I think it contradicts everything that happened before. My interpretation was that this film was eliminating all the stupid prejudices and innuendoes of the gossip of the small cities and the sensationalism of the national tabloids. I loved that the film defended the cause that a person's sexuality is NOT determined by their hobbies, idiosyncrasies, fashion sense or whatever. And then, the ending continues and reinforces all the gossip and stereotypes that the film managed to fool in the first place. It turns out that everyone was 100% good! (Oh my God!) This was very disappointing for what was really a great story.
