Wesley Snipes is perfectly presented as Blade, a half human, half vampire known as the daywalker. He has all his strength and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since joining Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), he has hunted vampires who have lived among us unseen for centuries, but the omnipotent Lord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with humans (foods like him llama) and he plans to awaken the god of blood and take control of the world. <br /> <br /> This film is well planned, written and directed; Make sure that the viewer has an exciting journey from beginning to end. Packed with excellent fighting sequences and slippery dialogues, Blade is certainly more action than horror, but it definitely delivers. <br /> <br /> 8/10
