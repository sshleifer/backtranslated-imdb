I saw this movie when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it from time to time because of the nostalgia factor. When I was younger I loved the movie because of the entertaining story and the interesting characters. Today, I still love the characters. Also, I think about the plot with greater consideration because now I see the moral and symbolism. Rainbow Brite is far from being the worst movie in history, and although it is outdated, I am sure that I will show it to my children in the future, when I have children.
