... the world will never know. (The movie that took the Oscar for "best animated short" that year, "Anna and Bella," is very good, but it's not "Big Snit." Both are available in the "World's Greatest Animation" compilation by Expanded Entertainment, case that I would like to compare.) <br /> <br /> "Snit" and its director, Richard Condie, have attracted so much attention that there is little to add. However, I would like to point out that the film contains one of my favorite "shots" in an animated short, in which the man opens the door to let the cat out. I do not want to reveal the real events that are shown here, but the first time I saw the shot, I was jumped from one mood to another, then, seconds later, to another. That shot has never failed me that way since then. For this photo, and for the way that Condie accumulates for that set of moments, "The Big Snit" deserves the label of "masterpiece".
