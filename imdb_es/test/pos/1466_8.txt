A strange relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual who will soon be a woman. Charlotte and Venorica, both trapped by their inanimate lives and do not know how to get out of them. Charlotte owns a beauty clinic, has broken up with her aggressive ex-husband, moved into a single apartment with all the furniture packed, except her big bed. Veronica lives below with her poor dog. She is sensitive and desperate because of her mother's visit and the bad relationship with her father. Her only hope is that the next transsexual operation will turn her into a real woman and then everything will be fine. All you can do now is wait for a certificate of approval. <br /> <br /> Then, these two people meet by chance and are gradually involved in the lives of others, there are some flashes between them, but no one is brave enough to face the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as most people do. Finally, the ending is quite satisfying and leaves us with some imagination to think about it. <br /> <br /> The great work of the director gives me a great impression, she manages very well the development of the characters, the emotional environment is quite full. and intense. I'm also so obsessed with the tenebrous lights of the whole apartment, Delphic but with much desire. <br /> <br /> Two main characters are played by Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik, they are incredible in their roles, a very impressive performance and the chemical reaction between them is genuine and convincing. <br /> <br /> This Swedish indie movie is about finding and changing, no matter whether you are gay or straight, male or female, the rarity of life exists everywhere. every time you fall into it, you will be indecisive and bewildered, but at least do not be afraid, follow your heart and choose the right path.
