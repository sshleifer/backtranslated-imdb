Having grown up in the age of typing and dealing with office politics and the men who were willing to make a feast of beauties in a delicious meal day by day, this movie comes to reality. Good afternoon. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work on this film to play against the magnificent Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be there and I think it has worked well and has been maintained over time. The best screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd. <br /> <br /> It may seem that none of this is plausible, but in reality it was and probably still has the fear of sexual harassment. I thought the film was well chosen, except for the horrible performance of Evans. What a ball of fat, but found its niche elsewhere. Apart from that, all approached the plate.
