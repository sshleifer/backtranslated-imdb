"Beyond the Clouds" is an artistic group of four vignettes, each of which offers a glimpse of a male-female relationship from dim to turbulent. Although the film offers excellent cinematography, exquisite visual beauty and a cast of excellent artists, there is little flesh in the bones of this fragmented work. The flavor of a relationship can not impart its fullness and synergism suggests that much more can be achieved with a story in 2 hours than with four. However, "Beyond the Clouds" will be the forage for the dilettantes and a visual feast for everyone, even superficial, with stilts and lacking in substance.
