I had the privilege of attending the UK premiere of Inglorious Basterds tonight! Having seen the advances, I had high hopes, but I had doubts due to a series of indulgent movies (come on, let's be honest, indulgence is his second name Tarantino) <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find out that he had taken the cat of the bag with this. The film is full of interesting dialogues, a perfect comedy with a hint of brutal murder. <br /> <br /> The supreme glory of this film, however, resides in Christoph Waltz, to whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create real tension in the audience while remaining quite "theatrical" (I could not think of a better word). He definitely deserved his award at Cannes and he is definitely heading to an Oscar! Hoping to see you again soon!
