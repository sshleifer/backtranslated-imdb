Normally I do not go out of my way to see romantic comedy, and maybe I'll do it in the future after seeing Return to Me. The plot was simple and not secret after the publicity. You do not have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the cast take you to a world where "chemistry" abounds and good guys win, and you can laugh and have a good time. I LOVE this movie ... and I have the DVD in order!
