Okay, Paris Hilton sucks (the typical Malibu Barbie), but the rest of the actors are great! I watched the movie last night and it kept me totally throughout the whole movie. Chad Michael Murray is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and is just a top actor. Man total hero. The main girl who is Nick's sister (Chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's very different to film your movies these days, mostly to go with psychopaths, possessions, ghosts, but here you have a theme about wax. I got vines for the wax models in the house, although they seemed very real. I still do not have the story with the twins at the moment, I'm just waiting to get the DVD and then watch it again. Thumbs to a great movie! 11/10. To all the people who do not like it, please do not bother criticizing my opinion, since almost everyone thinks it's great to do it. I also think that the Paris scene when you take off your underwear is totally inconvenient. Why not make a dog run with a cat ... be more entertaining than that? When the scene of the death of Paris arose, I thought that it was poor, since she continued running although a knife simply climbed up her foot. Hmm interesting. <br /> <br />! CHAD ALL THE WAY!
