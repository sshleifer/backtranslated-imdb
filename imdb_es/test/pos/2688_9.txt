I think the problem with this show that does not get the respect it really deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld, after ELR and after Friends. Those three comedies were the star programs of his time. <br /> <br /> The KOQ arrived at the end of this special time on television. <br /> <br /> But do not let that dissuade you. <br /> <br /> King of Queens is as good or better than two of the three mentioned. <br /> <br /> Seinfeld Everything started and it was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so much at Seinfeld. But the KOQ are very close. <br /> <br /> When it comes to laughing, I have to qualify KOQ as second only to Seinfeld. ELR has to be the second place, since the creation and the interaction of the character are more attractive. <br /> <br /> Either way, KOQs is the top ten of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The only other situation comedy Mentioned now is Two and a half men who does not really hold a candle to the other four, but that's all we have left.
