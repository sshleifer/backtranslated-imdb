NO SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> After Hitchcock's first successful American film, Rebecca, based on the exuberant novel of Gothic romance and intrigue by Daphne DuMarier, returned to some of the more familiar themes of her early British period: mistaken identity and espionage. As the United States settled into World War II and the large-scale 'war effort' of civilians building aircraft, armaments and other necessary militias, the boom of the film entertainment business began to become paranoid thrillers and often jingoistic with wartime themes. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and trained operators working in the shadows among good and respectful citizens. Knowing that the director was at home in this genre of espionage, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock to run a property on his property that dealt with corruption, sabotage of war and a helpless hero in a vortex of coincidence and wrong identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of the literary expert Dorothy Parker (during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in New York), who co-wrote the script, were a perfect combination for the sensibility of Hitchcock <br /> <This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), 25, who, while working at an aircraft factory in Los Angeles, runs into new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd ) and moments later it is framed to commit itself. sabotage. Fleeing the authorities who do not believe in his crazy story, he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally to New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of useful 'fanatics' and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) of which, during the worst crisis of her life and national security, she falls madly in love with the! Of course, in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the alleged saboteur Barry, falls in love with her captor, which adds a romantic tension to the mix. <br /> <br /> In good shape for this exit, Hitchcock creates a national network of elderly Dure√±as, average Joes and respectable businessmen who double as terrorists of secret agents who harbor criminals, throw weapons and detonate bombs to keep the things in motion. It is a fantastic plot that takes time to advance and once lit, culminates in one of Hitchcock's most memorable finals. Incredibly look for life as the tourist attractions of New York (all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the "prohibition of shooting" during the war on public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's best-known films, it's a popular B movie that is certainly solid and engaging, with many intelligent plot twists and, as always, terrible Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for the Hitchcock cameo out of a pharmacy in the second half of the movie. Hitchcock's original idea that he was shot (he fighting in sign language with his "deaf" wife) was rejected by the Bureau of Standards and Practices that he feared offending the deaf.
