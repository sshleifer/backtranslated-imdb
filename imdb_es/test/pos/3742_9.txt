From the first time they came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I've lived here all my life), I waited for this movie to come out. And I mean wait and wait and wait more than a year and a half for this movie and for me, it was worth it. <br /> <br /> The film is different from the book, but in my opinion, it is still a beautiful Work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that destroyed me. I laughed and smiled so much. It's a great movie with a great story. <br /> <br /> It's about never giving up on finding that one, the one that will change you forever. The one that will shape your soul and awaken you to a new vision of life. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it is possible to meet someone and make them change your life forever, which is the character of Gere. did to Lane's. I knew the love of my life and immediately I was completely captivated that I never forgot it or that I fell in love with it until I "met" it again a year later. For me, I could relate to this movie with all my heart. I think if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes, you'll see what I'm talking about. It's never too late to find your true love, great job, Miss Lane and Mr. Gere!
