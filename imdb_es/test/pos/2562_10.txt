Initially, I postponed the rental of this film due to the cover of the DVD. In fact, this stayed true with friends of mine who did not rent it because of the art and the mental image (s) I conjured up from being a movie that had little or no interest for me (or my friends) . But, I rented it, I saw it and I was really surprised. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comments of other users that this movie is not for everyone because of blatant sexual inferences, so it's definitely not something I would like little kids to see (and seriously doubt if they would understand it anyway). <br /> <br /> I enjoy movies like this one in which the personalities of the characters and who they are are genuinely defined in a direct way and without nonsense. Teasers to indicate that they will go wrong. The performance ... was acting? Ricci and Jackson performed so well, I was attracted to this movie without even realizing that they were acting. The same with the story ... it may seem crazy, but it was done very, very well. It reminded me of another movie with Mel Gibson, Tim, where each character had limitations, whether mental or circumstantial, so they were well defined. <br /> <br /> I found a lot of depth in this movie with the character involved, so I feel that everyone involved (from the cameramen to the actors) should be congratulated for a perfect result / setting. After watching this movie, I had talked with a couple of friends who had a negative approach to see it as I did, so after listening to my comments, they rented and saw it. They were also surprised at how good it was. It is a pity that the art of the jacket has been done in the right way, since it is off. Now I can see how art is applied, but I had not heard of this film before, and art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys DVD sales / rentals. <br /> <br /> These characters had been given more depth and a good time was assigned to give an audience like me the time to absorb the "feeling" of each one. I felt I could trust that the film would flow well, and it did. Then, with the art of the jacket aside, I would recommend watching this movie.
