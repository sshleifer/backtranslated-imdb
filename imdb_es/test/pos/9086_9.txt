It can not be much stranger than Flatliners. This dark and deep film had my heart beating along. The lighting is dark and will put you in the mood for an experience that defies death, literally. Keifer is in top form as he is today in 24. He is a great actor and plays a very convincing and impressive role that he will not forget in the coming years. And what can be said about the rest of the cast? A star lineup, Julia is sexier than ever, Will, Oliver and Kevin light up the stage in this thriller that will keep you grabbed from your seats. It is a refreshing spectacle to see a true thriller, with professional actors of the first level. You will not regret seeing this 2 hour seat bender. -JL
