He was five years old when the show made its debut in 1958 and at a later time, he was a regular spectator. I remember that I really enjoyed the show, along with "Leave It To Beaver", "My Three Sons", "Ozzie and Harriet", "Dick Van Dyke", reruns of "I Love Lucy", "The Real McCoys", Now I'm enjoying the first season of "Donna Reed" on DVD and I've seen the first two episodes. Donna Stone is shown as an intelligent mother, educated, problem-solving, serene and housewife, similar to June Cleaver and in contrast to Lucy Ricardo. In episode 2, I especially like how Ms. Reed becomes a surrogate father, changing her dress for hoodies and boxing gloves, while teaching her son how to physically defend himself against a much bigger bully. While none of the mothers in the neighborhood I grew up in, including mine, met exactly the idealistic standards presented by Mrs. Reed, it is refreshing to see that good manners and intelligent decision making prevail at the end of the day, in contrast to today's accepted standards of vulgarity, selfishness and indifference among neighbors. I can not imagine her parents telling Jeff and Mary Stone that entering their neighbors' yards is okay, leaving a dog outside to bark all day is acceptable, or telling her mother to "calm down" in a supermarket in front of everyone.
