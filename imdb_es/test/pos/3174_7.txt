An extremely practical "Rodeo", well done and well done. Here you do not need bounded stars, since all the cast members were normal people who told a true story about a rodeo swindler and his entourage in the 60s and 70s of the West. But I take the hat off to Slim Pickens for what I think was his distinctive performance, especially since he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere role of clown, as he dealt deeply with all the "ups and downs" of the rodeo's hard life and the psychological devastation that so often surrounds that lifestyle. He and Mr. Coburn joined extremely well as partners, not only on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the corral. Also, check out Anne Archer as the Native American interest of Coburn in the last part of the movie. It must have been one of his first roles. <br /> <br /> It's not as flashy, maybe, as "Junior Bonner", but it's also an interpretation of the heart and shocking. Thanks to Encore Western Channel for showing from time to time this true grit of an underestimated movie.
