Combining the conventions of Western and Gothic horror, and often directed as if it were an art film, this is one of the best collaborations of Siegel and Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who, after being wounded during the Civil War, takes refuge in an isolated southern seminary for young women. Far from the world, women project their romantic fantasies towards him, and he responds with an insensitive male manipulation. But jealousy and resentment raise their heads, and they find themselves in a world of brutal revenge. And the boy is brutal revenge. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed by Bruce Surtees, and carefully careful, "The Beguiled" is a disturbing and elegant work that seems to have influenced the problematic sexuality of "Play Misty for Eastwood" for Eastwood. I "and" Loose Rope ". <br /> <br /> The film is an exciting depiction of a fierce battle of the sexes and oozes a dreamy mixture of horror and sexuality.All characters are ambiguous, they show features of both good as of evil, leaving us to choose who we should support. <br /> <br /> Don Siegel left a great legacy of fine films, everything from "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" to "Dirty Harry". that his first black and white paintings have aged well, most of his color films look grainy, outdated and poorly shot, his harsh "realism" must have seemed fresh and kinetic 40 years ago, but when I see him today, I think they have passed the test of time. <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled", however, is in a different league, a mature shot, ambiguous and stark, it is a pity that is not better known. Evolving technology and technique have made most thrills Siegel's action-packed rs of action become obsolete, "The Beguiled" still captivates audiences today due to its surreal atmosphere and unique theme. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10 - Better than the similar theme "Black Narcissus", this is, in my opinion, the best Siegel movie. Partly horror, partly drama, part sex odyssey, "The Beguiled" is a surprisingly artistic film (especially when one considers that Siegel saw that his films were, quote, "nonsense"). A large part of the art of the film is due to Clint Eastwood, who, from this moment, will make an effort to choose mature material.
