Meryl Streep may be the best actor that works today. His chameleonic representations never cease to amaze; It seems that they are actually the characters he brings to the screen. In "One True Thing", she gives life to a deceptively simple and deeply complex woman who does everything possible to play the hand that life has given her. Surviving cancer is not an easy task, and not just surviving, but continuing to live life is even more difficult, and this is precisely what Kate Gulden (Streep) wants to do. Renee Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire") not only stands in this exalted company, but shines like the daughter of Streep, who learns to see with a new light the life of his parents and his. Streep is a powerhouse and deservedly received an Oscar nomination for his work here; his dialogue "I'm only going to say this once" with Zellweger will leave you devastated. However, Zellweger is the true revelation: his face transmits every emotion, every conflict as he begins to know the many truths about the strengths and weaknesses of his parents. Director Carl Franklin ("Devil in a Blue Dress") handles extremely difficult story material with safety and delicacy.
