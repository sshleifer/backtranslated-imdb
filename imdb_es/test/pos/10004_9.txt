I saw this movie on September 1, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that shows films for its Truly Moving Picture Award. A truly moving image "... explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values ​​of life". Heartland gave that prize to this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a golf story in the first part of the 20th century. At that time, it was the game of the upper class and the rich "gentlemen", and the workers could only participate as caddies in country clubs. Against this backdrop, this story based on a true story unfolds with a working class young man who faces the golf establishment and the best golfer in the world, Harry Vardon. <br /> <br /> And the story is inspiring Against all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of "Holes") comes to compete against the best golfers in the United States and Great Britain at the US Open in 1913 Francis is ill-prepared and has a son for a caddy. (The caddy is hilarious and motivating and steals all the scenes in which it appears.) But despite these disadvantages, Francis shows courage, spirit, heroism and humility in this world-class event. <br /> <br /> And, we learn a lot about the first years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden poles, the arrangement of short holes, the manual board, golf players swinging with their mouths in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the game is not Cancel even with torrential rain. <br /> <br /> This film has an impressive cinematography and direction of art and editing. And without big movie stars, the story is somehow more credible. <br /> <br /> This adds to the inventory of great sports films in the vein of "Miracle" and "Remember the Titans". <br /> <br /> FYI - There is a website of Truly Moving Pictures where there is a list of previous winners going back 70 years.
