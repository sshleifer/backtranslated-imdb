It would be something to try to tell someone what Fata Morgana is about very simply. Or maybe it is not: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby towns to film varied landscapes and locals. But this is only the broader blow. It's a feat you surrender to, or you do not. He delves into the form of the world that surrounds him completely, without a story, linked only to certain aspects of written poetry, since his camera (filmed in supposedly discarded film material) wanders as in a notebook of pure travel. One could even reach that easy conclusion, by placing these immense landscapes, then move on to a rougher civilized culture (though not to the "normal" culture itself), and at a point level too abstract to be able to convey it correctly here. . Sometimes it takes a while to get it right, close to a purity through the "creation" section, but a purity in the way parts are manipulated either by nature or by decomposed machines. Soon, the narration, readings of the Popol Vuh (which, by the way, makes music for most of his films), with the gradual procession of really stylized shots, adds a completely different level. It is a hybrid film, and it is not easy, but the rewards are what best approximates Herzog's idea of ​​"ecstatic truth", images that have come out throughout his career. <br /> <br /> One wonders if the images end. above, for when the second section, Paradise, guides the spoken words, or if it is the other way around. His eyes move along with the photos and trays, and the writing is almost a religious script, but there are also the musical options, how extravagant singing and discreet classical music are joined by Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith. I think that each side ends up congratulating the other, and it's something that still does not seem to work. Maybe that's what attracts, the possibilities of going through the desolate terrain and the smaller sections of any kind of civilized life (in this case, the desert huts), which make it so fascinating. If only for the cinematic sense is a wonder, too indescribable for the amateur of casual photography due to the molds of the technique, and some of the strangest images of any film Herzog. There are pans, there are long shots, there are hands in hand as you drive through the cities, there is a bus dozens of miles away that by the mirage seems only a couple, there are many close-ups of fire and a man holding a reptile and talking . On his radar (the truly classic gonzo comedy), there are people who stand still in false postures, and a man and a woman who play insane music. But, what is more important, it ends up feeling, at least for me, natural by the personal nature of the approach. <br /> <br /> I am sure that only Herzog would know with certainty why he made this film, by opposition. to the simple 'how'; I was already filming Even Dwarfs Started Small, and ended up going through many dangers to finish it. However, this is what makes Fata Morgana such an amazing feat: it will attract one depending on what someone adds to it. It is definitely disturbing, but there is a temptation to want to see it again soon after, only to experience all the ideas and realities that have become strange vibrations (yes, the word 'vibrations' is applied here). It is one of the truly spectacular "art films" ever made.
