Hitchcock once gave an interview in which he said that he likes to direct film scripts that had an ordinary person who took care of his own affairs, who accidentally got involved in a terrible chain of events that they can not leave until The evil plot that is behind your problems is solved. That way, the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero. We certainly do it in this good movie. Barry Kane is only trying to help his neighbor by performing acts of kindness and consideration, such as helping Fry pick up the letters he left at the factory. Barry even returns a lost $ 100 bill to Fry later ... that was the GREAT money in 1943! It is Barry's acts of Christian kindness that get him into trouble and soon, he is unfairly accused of sabotage and murder and will probably hang if it can not be clarified. Similar to The 39 Steps in plot, the hero travels across the country where he discovers plans for new acts of terrorism by fascist cells, an archivillano that no one could believe is a costume Nazi and a beautiful blonde, Patricia Martin. who first suspects and hates then falls in love with Barry Kane. The hints of humor characteristic of Hitch are also here. Patricia is a model of billboards whose various advertisements on the road are a help and comfort for Barry, as it hooks with the bad guys, from Las Vegas to New York. We meet a truck driver who is a one-man comedy. "Someone convinced my wife that it was smart to eat three meals a day." Field employees of the fascist spy gang complain that the "suits" forget them or ignore them as if they were working for some legitimate business. During a chase scene in a movie theater, audience members laugh at the action of a boring comedy / gangster movie while the saboteur cell really shoots off with the good guys and accidentally kills a laughing patron of the movie. Terrible for the old dead man, but funny! Hitch liked to use famous monuments in his films and this is the best example, with the Statue of Liberty as background and ironic icon! It works even better than the Mt Rushmore scene in NBNW.
