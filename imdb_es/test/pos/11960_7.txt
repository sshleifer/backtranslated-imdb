It's a simple fact that we are many of us from the generation of the 80s who grew up loving those crazy John Cusack comedies made by Savage Steve Holland, and although I prefer other, more bizarre and extravagant movies, Better Off Dead, it's hard for me not I like One Crazy Summer, a movie that I grew up loving wholeheartedly when I was a child in my teens. OCS was a follow-up to Better Off Dead, and returned to Cusack and Curtis Armstrong from that movie. <br /> <br /> Cusack is Hoops, after the graduate, Joel Murray (George), to Nantucket during the summer to have fun on the beach. Hoops finds himself embroiled in an enmity with a blonde blond punk named Teddy Beckersted, whose lascivious father plans to demolish the houses of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium. One of the houses, which needs your mortgage is Demi Moore (Cassandra). There is a sailing race that could be his only hope of saving the house of Cassandra's grandfather (... he had recently passed), but Teddy has won it over the years, and Hoops has a mortal fear of the boats that They find on the water. But, with the help and motivation of Nantucket's new friends (like Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as automatic twin brothers!), George and Cassandra's budding friendship, maybe Hoops can accept their fears and win The race to save the neighborhood. Armstrong has a supporting part as the son of an ingenious maniacal weapons salesman, General Raymond (SCTV's Joe Flaherty in an inspirational casting), Ack, who uses his father's training to help Hoops and company in your goals to win the race. <br /> <br /> Memorable scenes include the Bobcat stuck in a Godzilla suit (!) running at full speed through a complete model of Aguilla Beckersted (Mark Metcalf, barely recognizable as Teddy's condo), despite that Hoops is pursued by upset puppy explorers who wish to perform first aid, George, a victim of toxic flatulence, the growing madness of Bruce Wagner, Uncle Frank, every time he tries to improve his chances of winning $ 1 million from a radio show, and the wonderful Billie Bird as George's grandmother who actually bills the group after a meal! Jeremy Piven is (you guessed it) a brutal imbecile who associates with Teddy and causes problems for Hoops and his gang, the delicious Kimberly Foster as a Cookie (The Teddy girl who tries to kiss with Hoops while attending a lunch with her father), and the only William Hickey as Old Man Beckersted, who will not reward his son and grandson with an inheritance if they lose the sailing race. Demi Moore is cute, but this is Cusack's vehicle, although Bobcat and Villard steal most of the scenes. Once again, lovely animations of Holland are scattered throughout the film (Hoops is an artist, appropriately). If you like your movies, I highly recommend what you underestimated, How I got to college.
