I'm not really a t.v. vigilant, except between the ages of 6 and 8 and "General Hospital" still had Luke and Laura, but there are some exceptions and I definitely think "King of Queens" is one of them. Each decade has its classics and I think this show will be (or damn, should) be among the best of this decade. His comic time is impressive and, at times, it can be quite strange. In a more 'serious' note, the actors more than manage to transmit subtle - and not so subtle :) - complexities in their characters without becoming too stupid. One commentator wrote that it may take a couple of episodes to enter and I agree; It is definitely one that grows in you but once you are inside, you are quite hooked. And with good reason!
