I have seen the progress everywhere before deciding to see it. And what do you know, I really liked it! It has a new twist on 18th century England. Although the music in the dance scene was obviously modernized and also the colors of Liv Tyler's clothes (although it's pretty!), They fit perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you just want to have a good time, you should check this out. Very different from other detailed films of the eighteenth century.
