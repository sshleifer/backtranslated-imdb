When Melville's "Pierre; or The Ambiguities" came to bookstores in 1852, its first publication since "Moby Dick" a year earlier, the audience response was similar to that found in the IMDB reviews of "POLA X". The newspapers even published headlines like: "Melville Insane!" which, of course, was not. But, when comparing the styles of writing found in "Moby Dick" and "Pierre", there is a clear deviation from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former. Clearly, he was imitating the overly florid style of the now forgotten Victorian Romances that were easily selling more than his immortal "Moby Dick". However, he was not happy with the type of product his editors wanted, and that he surely would have sold. His version of a Victorian romance was twisted, cynical, perhaps, but brilliant in its synthesis. The alternative title: "Ambiguities" is quite appropriate. As Pierre seeks and believes that he finds the truth, we increasingly have doubts about who and what to believe. While looking for happiness, it becomes increasingly miserable. <br /> <br /> "POLA X" is a fascinating adaptation of this novel, set in modern or almost modern France. Although, in a way, it leaves little to the imagination and graphically shows us the incestuous relationships that Melville could only hint at, the ambiguities that make the novel and its message so appealing are perfectly intact. The questions he poses are the ones that few films have thought to do, but the answers are left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I recommend a reading of the novel, which is much shorter than "Moby Dick", before watching this movie I hope more people discover this tempting movie.
