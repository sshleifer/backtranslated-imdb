Watching both movies at the same time is not a bad idea to get an idea of ​​early film production and act for camera styles. I give the go-ahead to Garbo (but not much) regarding his naturalness. Robeson is majestic. But his performance is directed to a large proscenium theater. Something else that caught my attention was the cinematographic themes of empowerment for women and minorities. So far, no Hollywood films had been released that allowed the voices of marginal characters such as Anna and Brutus to take center stage. These were very progressive films for their time. It is very likely that O'Neill saw the writing on the wall before everyone else did about the future of America.
