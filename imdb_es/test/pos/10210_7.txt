While escaping from a bank robbery, outlaw Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) helps Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), the chief engineer of Western Union who watches the Wild West and had an accident with a horse. In 1861, Vance is regenerated and hired to work for Western Union with the team that is installing the posts and cable from Omaha to Salt Lake City. Vance and Harvard engineer Richard Blake (Robert Young) flirt with Edward's beautiful sister, Sue Creighton (Virginia Gilmore) and she chooses Vance. However, his past haunts him when outlaw Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) steals Western Union cattle disguised as Indians. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" is a good but predictable western run by Fritz Lang. History shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph through the West, in front of thieves and Indians. The entertaining story has action, drama, romance and funny situations, but with the exception of Jack Slade's identity, there are no surprises in the story. Randolph Scott gives another great performance with a great cast. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Conquistadores" ("The Conquerors")
