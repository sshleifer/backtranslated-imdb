I hope Robert Redford keeps making more movies like this one. Hillerman's books are wonderful, and when he was a child raised in the Southwest, his stories come home! Adam Beach is a highly underrated and underused actor. Wake up Hollywood, not everyone thinks that your Mel Gibson are great! Today, many viewers want to watch movies that make you think. I've seen all the Redford / Hillerman series. They are thoughtful, scenic and have large plots. I hope that if enough people write to Robert Redford, he may decide to do some more! Thanks to Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for their great entertainment! If someone has the opportunity to read Tony Hillerman's latest book, do it! It's great. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop at each viewing site and set the stage for Hillerman's books. Amazing experience
