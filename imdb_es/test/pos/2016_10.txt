I really liked that movie. It's a very simple plot and from what I understand it is based on a real story. Growing up in the 80's with hard rock / hair metal may have something to do with my love for this movie, but even apart from music, it's a very fun movie to watch. Try it, you will like it unless you are the most critical of the critics and you only like the films of the caliber "Citizen Kane".
