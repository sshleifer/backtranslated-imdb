This movie reminds me of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'Garden State', not because of the content, but because it is one of those movies that are not heard except through word of mouth, or you read the back of DVD in the video store and think "why not". Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised (as in the films mentioned above) how good it was and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> He looks better with little knowledge of the film and only with intrigues that guide him to really see that. It also looks better with someone else or if you know someone who has seen it, you'll want to talk about it! It's a beautiful movie that stays with you well after watching it. It is also a smart watch that requires little effort to discover parts by yourself. <br /> <br /> Just enjoy it :)
