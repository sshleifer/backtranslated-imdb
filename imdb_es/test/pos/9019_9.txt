Well, I tend to watch movies for one of three reasons. Unfortunately, there are no Transformers in this film, so I can recommend only about the value of comedy and beautiful women (read girls) <br /> <br /> Yes, it's fun, I know it because of the amount of people in The cinema that laughed regularly during all the time. Personally, however, I loved it because of Laura Fraser, that IMHO is FIT!
