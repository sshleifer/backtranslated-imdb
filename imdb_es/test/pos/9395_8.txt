Okay, it's easy not to confuse this with the Stuart Gordon movie, called "Death Bed," which came out a few years ago, because this is "The Bed That Eats." And how do I begin to describe this? Well, to begin with, there is obviously a bed that you eat. This is as a result of demon tears, which of course affect most things, I suppose, in a negative way. The bed is in the rooms of an old servant or something, and has been responsible for the disappearances of many people in his time. We have a narrator, who is a ghost who sits on the wall behind a painting, and collects all the inedible goodies (jewelry, etc.) that the bed transmits. He died of consumption, one of the few people who lay down in bed and who was not devoured, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, while we see him cutting blood in tissues ... bleah. What happens with this movie is that it has a very strange sense of humor, but everything is quite expressionless. The film is divided into several "acts", I suppose, "Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and just desserts". For fans of the unusually strange and weird, well, this might be right for you. All I can say is that you have to see it to believe it, it defies the description quite well. 8 out of 10 stars
