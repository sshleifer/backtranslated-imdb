CHIPMUNK AVENTURE <br /> <br /> There are some movies I could watch all my life and never get tired of them, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was a 1987 attempt to return the old favorites to the forefront of animation, this time on the big screen. At a time when Disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation and box office quality, THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE stands as one of the best animated films that Disney did not produce in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and elementary, with Alvin, Simon and Theodore competing in a race around the world with the Chipettes (Janette, Eleanor and Brittany). However, when the chipmunks find exotic dangers, they are unaware that they are the pawns of a great diamond robbery. <br /> <br /> CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE never was nor will it be a film that rises thanks to a fascinating plot. And for people who did not love him when he was a kid, the movie will probably never be more than a nice but forgettable animated movie. But for me, it will always be a little-known masterpiece. Something about the movie just clicks for me in a way that few movies do. <br /> <br /> Each song is fun, happy and harmless. The highlights include the Chipettes in an Arab dance a little high to calm the snakes. There is also a very sweet song in which the Chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we can see them in the main points of reference around the world. One thing about the Chipmunk characters is that, despite the potentially annoying vocals, the composers always managed to write songs that were catchy without being scratched. This film is no exception ... actually, it has one of the best soundtracks of animated films of the 80s, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Every joke is cute, sincere and fun. The bits between the bad guys and a pampered puppy are very funny. And the surprise of seeing the Chipettes almost forced to marry by a child emperor is also. The comedy manages to constantly touch children so they do not miss anything, but everything remains charming for adults with enough nostalgia to keep them entertained. <br /> <br /> It's really a fun trip that is completely humble in your ambitions. CHIPMUNK AVENTURE never pretends to be something more than what it is, a harmless diversion. I will be the first to admit that this is a partial revision because I have such a nostalgic affection for THE CHIPMUNK AVENTURE that I would never be able to give it a bad review ... but nonetheless, it fills me with such a childish satisfaction. As you watch it Everyone has their favorite random since childhood that no one knows, and for me it is this movie. And any movie that I can watch again and again if I am 5, 12, 23 or more years old is a great movie in my eyes. <br /> <br /> ... A- ...
