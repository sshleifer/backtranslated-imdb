I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (until now known in the United States as 'The Golden Door'), and I was very impressed by the dreamy and sometimes surreal story of a family that emigrates from Sicially to the States United in the first days. of the twentieth century. It also worked like a middle finger (proverbial) stuck in the National Security eyeball (preferably up to the third knuckle), in its description of the mistreatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were receiving from their original mother Earth. The (mostly) Italian cast, with some exceptions, works well. This is a quiet and discreet movie that is lovely to watch (the occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure), while the script is well written. This is a movie for those who are sick and tired of a meaningless Hollywood escapism that serves little more than selling popcorn (not that I have any problems with popcorn, of course! I love things ). It would be wise to look for Nuovomondo / The Golden Door (or what is titled in your area).
