The first time I saw this movie at least thirty years ago, and it's still one of my favorites of all time! It's a classic: the intriguing plot, the great characters, the suspense and the surprising end of twist (all in the context of the beautiful coast of Monterrey / Big Sur) never get old. Roy Thinnes plays Johnny Brant, a captivating character who becomes more mysterious as his true identity develops. The acting is big and credible; Viewers get caught up in the network that develops between the work-addicted husband, the disenchanted wife and the strange seducer (Thinnes as Brant). I've searched for a copy to buy for years, but TV movies are not released to video, unfortunately. Great movie, see it if you can find it.
