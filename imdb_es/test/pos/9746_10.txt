Flash Gordon was a first class series. I know there were some mistakes, however, I did not observe it for defects. Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon. He was not a trained actor, but he gave a very good and convincing performance. Jean Rogers is pretty and at 20 years old. The old man did, in my opinion, a pretty good job. Charles Middleton as Emperor Ming, is excellent. I was in many other films, quite versatile, I could sing and dance. His interpretation of "Ming The Merciless", in the 3 series of Flash Gordon, was first class. The rest of the cast also did a very good job. Well, boys and girls, eat some popcorn, relax and enjoy.
