I will not bore you with any synopsis, you probably already know them. And I hope you are already familiar with the work of Park Chan-Wook. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I disagree with some of the other commentators when saying that "Park has not gone beyond the trilogy of revenge, blah, blah, blah." Because you know what? He has!!! To begin with, the trilogy of revenge was different from one another in terms of style, how can you compare the grimness and subtlety of "Sympathy For Mr Vengeance" with the frantic and extravagant "Oldboy"? Park Chan-Wook has an incredible style, but his films do not share the SAME style! That has been true and remains true with the release of "Thirst". <br /> <br /> "Thirst" is an amazing image, it literally has EVERYTHING you want in a movie. Amazing violence, blood of good taste, great humor, incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes. The story is so crazy that at no time can you guess what will happen next. I am very happy to say that Park is back in top form with this fantastic love story of dark and comical vampires. Look at it as soon as you can!
