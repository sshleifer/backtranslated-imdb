"Jaded" assumes the complex issue of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands, it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct video. However, this director has managed to carry out a multi-layered textured study with a decidedly different point of view. <br /> <br /> Given the fact that the director / writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. We are also women, this could have become a very un-male film. It is not. Being a sexual predator is gender neutral. The nudity of this movie is not erotic. Rape is brutal non-sexual. We are looking at the victims and not at the excitement. <br /> <br /> The talented cast sounds real. For a film so little known, I was surprised by the quality of the performances. They are good. Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are incredible. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this movie was lost. Maybe he's too smart for his own good. It is a "should see". Highly recommended. The sexual thriller of a thinking person.
