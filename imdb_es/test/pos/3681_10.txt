The first time I saw this movie in a queer film festival. 10 minutes after the movie ended, a gay couple came up to me and asked if I needed help. I was still sitting crying like a maniac. The movie is corny, it's weird, it's exaggerated, it's gay, but it's amazing. I think that each character is plausible. The character of Everett is bad for a woman who only tries to help, he brutally throws his (terrible) friends, has a bad temper, can hurt a fly, the "fly" that killed the love of his life, doubly. Bates is a miracle, she is perfect, like a paper. A woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she even loves the homosexual lover of her idol is for me the essence of true love. I even understand Max (the husband), he is bored with his life, he has a crisis of middle age. He moves, tries to lead an exciting life, only to realize that it is the really boring part of the relationship and b) that he loves his wife. I love the fact that she comes back to him at the end because I think it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality. Because in the end he is her husband and may not be as exciting as Victor, but he is real, he is the man she loves in a very realistic way. I've seen it about 50 times and I love this movie, everything is unconditional. By the way, I just read Rupert Everett's autobiography and UL is the only movie he talks about as one of the best movies he's ever done. For me it is the best movie he has ever made.
