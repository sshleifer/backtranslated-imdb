Some martial arts purists think that comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to the old school kung fu movie; and it is true that the introduction of comedy in the genre marked the end of the "chopped" period in the Hong Kong film. But the fact is that one can only perform a primarily physical display of skill for so long, then everyone gets bored with it. And that's why chop socky died and how the Hong Kong action movie "New Wave" was born: the producers, the actors, the directors got bored of hitting people for ninety minutes in a row. <br /> <br /> Given this, and given the fact that Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a considerable list of films on his resume, this film should be seen as more than just another kung-fu comedy. Rather, it is a comic movie within the genre of martial arts and, in fact, one of the best that has been made. <br /> <br /> What Liu has done with this movie is really a pleasant surprise: he has taken a martial ceremony. The works of art draw it and reconstruct it following the line of a Hollywood-style musical! Complete with singing and dancing episodes! It was at the time of the making of this film that some filmmakers and film fans began to recognize that the cinematographic representation of martial arts (really derived from the acrobatics of Chinese opera) has more in common with dance than with the struggle . . (I will continue to point out this connection until most Americans realize what they really should look for when they watch a martial arts movie: well-choreographed body movements, using the plot of an action movie as an excuse for their performance). Anyway, clearly Liu Chia Liang made this connection and decided that he would explore it close to its limits. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredibly charming entertainment, full of wonderfully human characters who try miraculous kung fu (and trip over their own cords as often as not when they do). and the film that premiered in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, gives Liu the opportunity to explore the nature of Westernization and modernization of China that greatly contributed to the creation of the China we know today. So the film also has considerable historical significance. <br /> <br /> In addition, fans of Stephen Chow's recent Kung Fu Hustle should really watch this movie carefully, as Chow learned it before making his own movie. br /> <br /> A very funny and well made movie. Oh, yes, and kung fu is really good. <br /> <br /> Purists will not admit it, but this is probably director Liu's best film.
