Dan Finnerty and the Dan Band are so good, you have to see them to believe. Does anyone out there have a copy of the Bravo concert on sale? Please, if there is a next release, let us know. I checked Bravo's site, but there is not a future scheduled date for a repeat of the performance of the most attractive kids ever choreographed, Dan's band. What great energy they exude, throwing themselves with the cute attitude of an American boy, based on the sensibility of the butch wrapped in sequins and tears, causing both men and women to fall in love with them. I hope that enough people can influence the powers that be in Bravo to bring the show back to our lives, as a biannual special.
