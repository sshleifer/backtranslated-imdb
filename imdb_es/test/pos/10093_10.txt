If you consider yourself a fan of horror movies, you have probably seen Hideo Nakata's Ring and Dark Water. They are excellent, and Ring is moving smoothly in Hollywood (maybe Dark Water will adapt too soon?). While Ring is almost 100% pure, the heart beats and breaks the nerves, a tale of two sisters breaks the nerves and the mind turns. <br /> <br /> Along with The Other, I consider this Korean film to be a brilliant and intelligent horror film. . The only flaw that this movie has is that some people think that their first 20 minutes are quite slow. It is actually typical of Korean and Japanese films. I consider it carefully planned instead of slow, consider it a "moment of calm before the storm". With the complete introduction of the characters, the imho viewer will become more intimately involved with the character, one of the strongest points of the Korean and Japanese films. <br /> <br /> Like Ring, a tale of two sisters who do not exaggerate with a horrible appearance. Rather let our mind do the intimidating work itself. That way is more frightening and horribly elegant at the same time. I would not be surprised if Hollywood remakes this movie after bringing Ring and Grudge / Ju-On (this movie is not so good, by the way, I rate it with 5.5). Do not miss it!
