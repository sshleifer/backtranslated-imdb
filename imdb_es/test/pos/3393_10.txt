This movie is VERY LONG, but it's worth splitting it up for several nights. He has a cast of stars, and if you're a Patrick Swayze fan, this will make your heart beat! :-) My mother is fond of the Civil War and a history teacher, and every summer we watched this movie (we had recorded it on television) for several, several nights until we finished everything. We had all the lines of the film memorized, hahaha. Pop some popcorn, sit back and enjoy the action and romance. It is a great movie for those who like action, war, blood and guts, but also for those with a soft and romantic side. The clothes the women wore were SUPERB! Sometimes I think I was born in the wrong era, hahaha.
