I found this movement beautiful, pleasant and uplifting. Initially, the local movie sites, which were filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me. Later I found myself lost in the power of the movie. How do you pay for a gift from God? The ability of the characters to rise above their basic natures and respond to the touch of God warmed my heart. The entire audience applauded the conclusion of the film. I left the theater with an inclination in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race. What else can a movie do? Hollywood, I hope you pay attention. America likes positive and optimistic films.
