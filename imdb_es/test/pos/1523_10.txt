This is the hardest movie I've seen in my life ... the emotional content is horrible, but unforgettable. A woman accused of being a political activist is taken for questioning. The whole movie revolves around his interrogation. Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve the Oscars for their performances.
