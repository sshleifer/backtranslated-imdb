I've seen this movie many times. I read the book, Englar Alheimsins, written by Einar Már Guðmundsson, who received the Scandinavian prize for books for work. The movie does not start in the same place where the book begins. It happens in Reykjavik and the main character, Páll is young and is having a good life with his girlfriend. But when she breaks the relationship with him, he starts having some headaches that make him angry and angry. And soon he starts to have big mental problems and then the movie starts. Soon they place him in the Mental Hospital of Iceland called "Kleppur" and there you can see some great characters like Viktor who thinks he is Hitler and Oli who thinks he writes all the songs of "The Beatles" and sends them with his mind. the transport Ingvar E Sigurðusson, who has the role of the main character that Páll does, works so well that it leaves you breathless. Also the music in this movie is crazy for SIGURRÓS and just for the cost of the music you should see the movie. In general, a great movie to be seen.
