The first minutes of this movie do not do it justice! For me, it's not funny until they get on the submarine and those funny characters start to get blocked. I was born and raised in Norfolk Virginia and met my part of "different" sailors. I even married one! Most of my favorite movies are just fun, not thematic, they do not depend on sex or violence and they are fun every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still fun even after I know the memory dialogue. Kelsey Grammar with her "God I LOVE this work" was sincere, genuine and kind. Rob Schneider is hysterical when the crew turns on him for being annoying. I'm still surprised by the size of that fishing boat next to a submarine! I can see why the people who live this life realize the uh-oh, but it's not a documentary, after all, it's a comedy, and I love it!
