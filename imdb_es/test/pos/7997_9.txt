So, what is 'Batman Returns'? <br /> <br /> It was marketed as an action movie, and many people who have seen it seem to think they have seen an action movie, but in reality, there it is. It's not much action, and Tim Burton just seems to be interested in it. <br /> <br /> People often align it with the 'more sordid' superhero comics of the late eighties, but honestly, if you've read 'The Dark Knight Returns', that seems a bit absurd; The excessive imagination of Burton has more in common with the television series of the sixties (the Penguin handles a giant plastic duck, for God's sake). <br /> <br /> Burton's style is often described as Gothic, and that's a little closer than what we see on the screen; the penguin, deformed, malignant, with a tangled story and an underground lair, is a Gothic threat dressed in more respectable Dickensian clothes: Udolfo disguised as Uriah Heep. <br /> <br /> But what about Catwoman? It can be resurrected from the dead, but that PVC suit is decidedly 20th century, and its alter ego, the world of Selina Kyle, is all the boardrooms and apartments, reminiscent of a romantic comedy of the 1930s. < br /> <br /> And then click. The intelligent but trampled secretary romantized by a lonely millionaire? The resulting complications caused by deception and disguise? 'Batman Returns' is clearly a romantic comedy in the style of ancient Hollywood, which is filtered through the sensibility of Burton's S & M dungeons. It has more in common with 'The Hudsucker Proxy' (including Expressionist sets) than with other superhero movies. <br /> <br /> Like many romantic comedies, it focuses on the transformation of heroin; not from ugly duckling to swan, but from doormat to dominatrix. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her career (often remarkable); is iconically sexy as Catwoman (poor Halle Berry never had a prayer), playful and vengeful, memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body. In retrospect, however, it is his scenes like Selina that impress; almost every one of them is a little comic gem, in particular the vision we have of their solitary life in the home. It is a delicately balanced tragicomic presentation, and it is in these scenes that the film really comes alive. Nothing moves me like Selina and Bruce Wayne dancing under the mistletoe to Siouxsie and the Banshees, a weapon held between them, at the same time empowered and trapped by their alter egos, condemned to conflict. Forget the easy sentimentality of "Big Fish" or the emotions of Edward's "Scissorhands": this is the most sincere scene of all Burton's films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, madness, self-hatred and not a little ingenuity, all in a few lines and absolutely nailed by the actors, especially Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, Danny de Vito almost equals her, finding the wounded dignity buried beneath those really disgusting Long Johns. The villain at the top of the comics reveals himself as nothing more than a farce; The Burton penguin is a wild creature undergoing its own Eliza Doolittle style remodeling (almost literally an 'ugly duckling'). It is the most radical and funny reinvention of Burton. Max Schreck by Christopher Walken completes a perfect triptych of villains, slipping between casual charm and psychosis with blank eyes with disconcerting ease (and is it just me, or does the logo of his company remind me of Mickey Mouse? ask the former Disney animator Burton). <br /> <br /> 'Batman Begins' by Christopher Nolan, a true action movie, has been highly praised as the first movie to do justice to Batman; I admire Nolan's movie, but it would be a shame if he were allowed to eclipse this idiosyncratic jewel.
