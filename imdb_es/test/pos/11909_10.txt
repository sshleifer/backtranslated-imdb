I liked this movie. That is all I can say about it. Lou Gossett did a good job, although I'm still very disappointed with him after all the Iron Eagle movies. And even if I was smiling inside when the first main teenager dies (I will not give it up), it was done in a pleasant and appropriate way. Almost everyone in this movie does a good job, so take a look! It's another one of those movies that I found very cheap, so I bought it and I recommend the same thing.
