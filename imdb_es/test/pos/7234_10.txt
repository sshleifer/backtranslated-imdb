This is the best movie I've seen in my life. And I've seen a lot. I'm not even a fan of Troma. I've never heard of Troma before watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I had already lost the hope of seeing a great movie until I saw "Tromeo y Julieta". This movie is a dream come true. Shakespeare would probably be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic. There is sex, violence, humor and satire. Break many taboos. <br /> <br /> This movie is not disgusting or stupid. It is difficult to describe in words how intelligent, fun, exciting and ingenious this film is. The music is great and fits perfectly to each scene. The characters are very believable and the acting is great. I really cared about the characters. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not just for Troma fans. It is for all people who have a sense of humor and like intelligent and credible entertainment, instead of the totally stupid and incredible popular movies that do not dare to do what this movie does. <br /> <br /> The bad reviews only show that this movie is great and something exceptional. Or you love it, or hate it. Like all true works of art, not all people understand and appreciate it.
