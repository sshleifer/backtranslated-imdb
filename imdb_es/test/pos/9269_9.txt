I entered "The Closer She Gets" knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker's mother who fights against cancer. I expected it to be a very distressing and depressing movie. And although the subject is certainly emotionally heartbreaking, the surprising thing about this film is the positive message it sends. It shows the total dedication of a family to face together the challenge of cancer. They refuse to lose faith, even in the darkest moments. <br /> <br /> The most touching moments for me are when this faith is revealed. Small comments that the mother and the family make among themselves that reveal their will (and theirs) to survive, and their defiant emphasis on love and family unity. In this way it is an edifying and deeply hopeful film. We should all be so fortunate to be surrounded by a family like this in times of serious illness.
