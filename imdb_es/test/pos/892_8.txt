Like NIGHT STALKER and then X-FILES, the show created a fantastic situation and the main characters had to solve it. Unlike these, the heroes did not stay with an empty bag at the end. They had generally tangible results. It was also clear that the "good guys" were in a dirty profession in which they occasionally had to take out some unpleasant things. Imagination, ingenuity, acting that was not always taken seriously ... I miss it. One of the reasons is that I have a hard time thinking about too many programs (apart from BANACEK) that did a good job of taking the viewer and getting their attention from the beginning. The writers stood out in the creation of enormously improbable situations, if not impossible, in which the characters had to find an explanation. The explanations that often took 90 degrees become something clearly unexpected, however, for all that, it still makes sense. Also, I agree with another critic that the character of Anabelle was somewhat underutilized, but when he was on the screen, it was not just for the eyes. She was quite competent in her own right and faced the two male protagonists when she felt that the point she was saying justified it. A rarity in those days. Sullivan? If he were not in the Department, he would be working for the KGB or the CIA. He's that kind of coldly efficient, ruthless guy. He knows how the world works and realizes what he can do to get the job done. King? It is clearly a game for him. One in which he excels and in which he participates in ideas for the detective / spy novels he writes as his ostensible "real" work. It is probably the most fun to see of the three, although everyone has their moments and, often, also. However, I agree that the eventual series derived from his character lacked the original's interest.
