This is one of the few movies of this type that I have reviewed and enjoyed. While Clint Eastwood is his usual self, the general story works well, even on the edge of Washington DC <br /> <br /> The issue: a murderer follows the president and there is only one person who can save him. <br /> <br /> It can not be easy to make a film that the public enjoys these days, involving this field. This movie is successful on several levels. Eastwood is his usual hero, who wants to save the president since the Kennedy era. He does well in this role, as does his aluminum foil, Reneee Russo (an FBI agent). In general, well done and with suspense, with additional stars for Malkovich. 9/10.
