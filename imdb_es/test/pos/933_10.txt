The final part of the Kieslowski trilogy, based on the colors of the French flag, finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematographic image. In Red, the images are paramount, as well as the obvious but intelligent color code. However, instead of adhering to empty aesthetic gadgets based on the 'cinema du look', Kieslowski's Red is a multi-layered meditation and densely drawn on the nature of destiny and love. In Red, love and destiny are intertwined but they are complex notions, dictated as much by the whims of human beings as by invisible parallel associations that seem to be overlooked. You feel that Rojo is really an allegory, a recreation of the omnipresent gestures of Prospero in The Tempest, but it is more than his story seems. Network requires innumerable presentations, and each visit reveals something new that intertwines with the structure already impeccably laid out. <br /> <br /> Although Red is a Kieslowski masterpiece, it is best seen as part of the trilogy. The blue and white elements are referenced in red, which the knowledgeable spectators will enjoy.
