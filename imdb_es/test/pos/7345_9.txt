This film tackles the themes of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such an intelligent, artistic, sensitive and visually impressive way that they transported me completely. It's a rare gem of a movie in the way it honors beauty and women. You will have to see for yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable personality, albeit not something broken, in a way that every woman will relate to. I discovered that the honesty of the emotional interactions between the characters is very refreshing and deeply appealing. There was nothing in this movie that told me "low budget" when it comes to quality. Nothing. The fact that it is a low budget film is a tribute to the creators of the film. The final sequence during the credits will also leave you without socks. It's a brilliant celebration of Jane's choice. Unexpected and inspiring.
