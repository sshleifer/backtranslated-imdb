Soderbergh is a fabulous director, but nothing he could conjure could surpass the incredible cast he gathered for this zenith of sequels. Clearly, he knew this from the beginning. The term "star vehicle" has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that is based on a star. What this film does is get a whole herd of Hollywood photos and make them shine even more brightly than before. The last scene says it all: all the stars sitting around with NOTHING happening and NOTHING what is said. We can only watch them socialize as if it were a scene from a reality show in which George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Don Cheadle are just dating, being themselves. So the story is not important at all, at least it's not where the greatest pleasures of the movie come from. If you want a smart theft movie, you better stay with 11. But if the star gaze excites you, this will be your day.
