By far, one of the best science fiction movies out there. However, multiple visualizations are needed to understand the concept of the film and to appreciate not only the special effect, but also the main plot of the film. I feel that this movie film received such bad reviews because nobody took the time to see the film the way it was meant to be seen. He has some moments that he would like to hurry and pass, but they are few and far between. Hooper, who directed TCM 1 and 2 along with a remake of INVADERS FROM MARS, and THE FUNHOUSE does its best work here. The great score, good acting and great effects make this a movie to add to your collection, if you have the opportunity to see the widescreen version on DVD, highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of science fiction.
