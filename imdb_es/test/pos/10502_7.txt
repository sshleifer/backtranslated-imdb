The progeny is about a husband and wife who experience loss of time while making love. Without realizing what this strange experience means they try to get on with their lives. The husband begins to question the strange event and receives help through a very annoying psychiatrist. He comes to believe that extraterrestrials are responsible for this lapse in time and that the unborn baby he once thought was his and his wife's actually belongs to the aliens. <br /> <br /> If you ask me, this is a great scifi / horror story. Taking a very questionable real life scenario involving extraterrestrial abduction and hybrid breeding is definitely an approved of this type. I love all things related to extraterrestrials and this story definitely gave some good ideas. So, if you also share an interest in extraterrestrial things, you should be very happy with Progenie. Anyway, at least in regards to the story. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie in general is quite normal. With the average performance of all the actors. Yes, even by the amazing Mr. Dourif, who still offers the best performance. Although the black chief doctor, he delivers his lines really well. There are some points in the film in which some of the deals shudder or laugh, which is fine in my book. I like cheesy and this had a little stinky cheese, and I say it in a good way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with a less stellar script you can not blame all the actors. Especially I was not interested in Mother Hysteria who was looking for the movie. She wanted a baby so much that she neglected and rejected everything her loving husband (who is a doctor!) Told her. It almost reached a point where you really did not care what happened to it. <br /> <br /> Progeny is another film by Brian Yuzna from the movie icky-sticky, Society. Again, it offers some slimy effects, and again it offers a rather unique horror story. If you like sci-fi / horror movies or you are a fan of Dourif and Yuzna movies, there is no real reason not to see this movie if you have the opportunity. A generous 7 out of 10.
