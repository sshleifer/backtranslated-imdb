The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene of the French "Emmanuelle 2". This incredible woman did not go unnoticed, and was soon chosen as the protagonist of this new Italian series, where she is the centerpiece; A beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world has to offer. In this first installment, Mae Jordan / Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the people, as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals. Like the character of Sylvia Kristels, Emanuelle has not become personal when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality. This first film is basically about how it becomes the "Emanuelle" with which most movie fans are familiar. Filled with a magnificent cinematography, beautiful people and an intoxicating score of the legendary Nico Fidenco, this will surely please. Those who enjoy the style more guided by the history of the original French "Emmanuelle" should also like them. The main story here is an interesting story about a cat and a mouse of a playboy womanizer who realizes that he has fallen in love with a woman who is the female version of him. Sexy, fun and totally entertaining along; a telenovela to be sure, but one with enough skin and candy to keep male viewers entertained. For some reason, this is the most difficult to find on DVD. There has never been a legitimate DVD for this, which is very strange. The bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do it until someone gives this diamond of a movie a proper release.
