"Dead Man Walking" is one of the most powerful movies I've seen in my life. I find it hard to believe that someone, after having seen the movie, may feel indifferent about the film or its message. Tim Robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on viewers, but he manages to make a movie that sympathizes with the opinion of the death penalty in most cases, whether it is right to murder a murderer or not. I've always known my position on this question, even as a child, and this film, despite the fact that it really has no side, made me even more certain of my conviction that it can never be right to kill * anyone *. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet, his nomination for an Academy Award was well deserved. Even if Nicolas Cage does a great job on "Leaving Las Vegas," he would have been happier if Penn had won the prize. Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and deserved the Academy Award she won. And Tim Robbins certainly deserves the vote I've given to this movie: 9/10!
