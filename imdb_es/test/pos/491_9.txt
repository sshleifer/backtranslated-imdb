hello <br /> <br /> Blade is a sensational action movie. The hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain have done justice to their roles. <br /> <br /> The action sequences of the movie are better than Matrix! <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes is one of the best action heroes of all time. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies / vampires, this is the ONE. <br /> <br /> The theme is quite good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made before. But these are the best. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the trip.
