"Best in Show" is undoubtedly Christopher Guest's funniest and deepest film to date. The characters are represented in an excellent way and the connection of the mascot with the owner adds a new level of comedy to the film. I've been a fan of Guest since Spinal Tap, but in this film he has really accomplished what he set out to do in the "mock-documentary", a genre he invented and has now perfected.
