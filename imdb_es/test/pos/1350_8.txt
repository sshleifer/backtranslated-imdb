I had read the movie and I thought it would be nice, a good movie on Saturday night. I did not expect anything good, I thought it would be mostly fluff but I hope it is not a totally bad experience. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and flowed very well. Ash Christian was perfect, it was nice to see his ability to turn an uncomfortable moment into something moving. He could have turned this character into something we've all seen before, but instead, he turned away from the stereotypes and focused on the character's naivety. It was wonderful to see Jonathan Caouette again, I did not know what he would do after Tarnation. Ashley Fink is a gem, a great actress of young characters who, hopefully, will get more work. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the movie that could have used some work, but overall it's not a bad time in the movies. My friend described him as a gay Angus / Napoleon Dynamite but it's more than that. It is a study of characters about how to grow as gay in a small city, the pain is there, but the mood behind that pain (which only age can clarify) is magnified. I hope to see more of Ash Christian, Ashley Fink and Jonathan Caouette soon.
