The idiot said: "You can not touch this" surely applies here. With all the classic horror and science fiction movies that are coming out, along with all the lower remakes, it's hard to find anything worth 2 hours of your time. That's why I always trust the classics that scared me so much when I was a pre-teen. <br /> <br /> THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the fattest, the scariest and the most shrill. Classic science fiction horror that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever did. However, what really gives him power is not the gore (which consumes MIXES of slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the feeling of fear, isolation and distrust that it fosters in the characters and the spectator. <Br /> <br /> You can not be further away than Antarctica, and in this howling and frozen white scene is where the story takes place. Several Americans, investigators and the military are stationed there. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog ​​running to save his Norwegian life with weapons. Before you know it, the American outpost is fighting a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. It can be transformed into bloody and disgusting and disgusting forms before it is finished, but once it is finished, if you did not see it in progress, you can not distinguish it between humans or other normal animals on Earth. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just some of the best actors. This movie is the reason why horror can be a great genre. Actually STILL scares me. The alien blood "jumping" from the petri dish when the hot wire touches, still makes me jump! <br /> <br /> It is still the most fearsome of all.
