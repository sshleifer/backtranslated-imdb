It was terribly close, but the China Syndrome received the worst kind of publicity when, at the time of its release in theaters, the accident occurred at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. I still remember that all the attention of the country was stuck to the hourly bulletins that came out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And I would not know, a scientist in China Syndrome describes that the worst case makes an area as big as the state of Pennsylvania uninhabitable. <br /> <br /> Less than a decade later in Ukraine in Chernobyl In recent days, the Soviet Union faced a crisis of this kind that was not corrected in time. The China Syndrome, once again, became a relevant film. <br /> <br /> The film is more about security cuts than about being anti-nuclear. Jack Lemmon is a man who lived with nuclear energy all his life as a captain of an atomic energy submarine. What angers and ignites him to create the confrontation that culminates in the film is the stupidity and greed of the managers of the electric company. Stupidity and greed are products that are found every day. The problem with them is that there are places where you can tolerate less in human society. <br /> <br /> Lemmon shares the billing of the stars with a couple of famous Hollywood children, Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. Jane is a TV News reporter who is constantly being assigned to the featured stories and turns out to be in a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs. The concealment of his own station and his subsequent meeting with Lemmon unleashed the chain of events shown in The China Syndrome. <br /> <br /> The best scene of Fonda. However, I thought it was Peter Donat, a news executive from his station. . Take a look at his facial expressions, as Donat overflows the importance of history and condescendingly tells him that his very beauty demands that he adhere to the pieces. Fonda knows he has something and stays with him. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays his iconoclastic cameraman, this was a typical part of him in his day. In his MTC tribute to his father, Kirk Douglas, Michael said he opted for roles that show sensitivity. I could still have seen a young Kirk Douglas in this part. <br /> <br /> What to do with energy for the industrial and post-industrial nations, a baffling problem that will affect our government for a couple of generations. This movie shows what can happen with a dependence on nuclear energy. Our current geopolitical problems in the world stem in part from a dependence on fossil fuel, specifically oil. Everything we use has unforeseen consequences. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the real hero of the movie is Wilford Brimley, Lemmon's colleague at the nuclear power plant. In the end, Brimley really gets close to the plate. <br /> <br /> See China Syndrome to know what I'm talking about.
