There is no plot. There are no central characters. No moving cameras or close-ups. In fact, this film does not follow any of the conventional narrative techniques used by conventional film. However, Du Levande by Roy Andersson is a remarkable piece of film narration. It is a moving look at the human psyche. <br /> <br /> Composed of a series of vignettes, Roy Andersson gives us an intimate vision of what makes us all human. In perfectly framed static shots, added with the music perfectly in tune, although peculiar, Roy introduces us to a large number of characters as they embark on their daily existence. Some on the edge of the tragic, other hilarious, take us on a Nordic journey like no other. <br /> <br /> It's a trip to the little things that make us human. Instead of having exaggerated visual or narrative techniques, everything is reduced to the minimum so that our only focus is on the characters. It focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are; Our dreams, our despair. It is through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals. <br /> <br /> The colorless colors and pale makeup of the characters only seem to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them, we are all alive. There is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this movie, but you leave the cinema with a sense of life. Much more accessible than his previous film, Songs from the Second Floor, Du Levande, is a truly inspiring piece of cinema.
