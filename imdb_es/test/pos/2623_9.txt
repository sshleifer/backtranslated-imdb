Having seen only once and in the hours of dawn, it seems that I can not forget this disturbing movie. A mixture of mystery, suspense and harrowing romance reminds me of Vertigo. The actors, although not as well known, are good, especially Joan Hackett in one of his best performances. You believe in her, in her love, in her new search for freedom brought by her love, and in the end in her overwhelming pain. The plot is ingenious and convincing and does not stretch the credibility. Management and technical aspects could certainly be better, but they do not compromise the overall effect. And he has a message: do not let revenge blind you, you can become his last victim. It's a real pity that it has not been redone, but maybe it's a period piece that is best left alone.
