I enjoyed the performance in this movie. Except for the sister. She reminded me of Janice in Friends. I could never believe it was anything but disgusting. <br /> <br /> My main problems with the film were the anticlimactic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law. The guy who falls out of the car exploding? Maybe if her hand had been blown and she ran to the silence to ask for help, and she kissed him and hurried him to the hospital, maybe then she could have gone at the end. I think someone needed to die at the execution scene. Mainly the brother-in-law. It was a pain in the ass anyway. Or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who kept the silence. He could even have bought the brother-in-law killing the hero and ending with the two sisters who are put on snuff films. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing again and, as I always say, it's much easier to be a critic rather than an author.
