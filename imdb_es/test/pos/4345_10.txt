This movie is truly a classic 80's movie! A must have in any movie collection of the 80s! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS! <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of action without stopping! <br /> <br /> And continuing with the classic 80's movie "bad guy vs good guy" - this movie is mostly less the norm and all about weapons and CREEPS! We see Bronson knocking down the thugs and the CREEPS with a 30-caliber heavy machine gun from the Korean War! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CALLING BIG! When Charlie runs out of ammunition for the Heavy Machine machine gun, he runs back to his crib and takes the weapons with his long-range high-caliber pistol. This gun can stop a damn ELEPHANT and Charlie is putting holes the size of bucket lids on the bad guys with it! And if that's not enough, Charlie is also packing an anti-tank grenade launcher, which by the way, is only good if he can get the CREEPS together. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is "ha! The" big ones "and many of the actors on the wall (mainly playing CREEPS) appear throughout the film! The film is loaded with memorable liners and scenes! Heck, my favorite scene / line is where the leader of CREEP confronts Broson in jail and explains calmly: "I tell you what I'm going to do ... I'm going to kill an old woman ... just for you! ... Catch him on the six o'clock news. "<br /> <br /> Is this movie violent? Heck yes! But, you'll laugh and you'll shudder all the way!
