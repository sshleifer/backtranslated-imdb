When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Gass would make a movie about their band, I was going crazy! I love his music and I hoped that this movie was really fun. Now that I've seen it, I can not say that these hopes were not met, but I think I expected more. The movie is full of the great music of Tenacious D and I really loved listening to it. There are many great jokes and I love the story, at least the first part. I do not like the way the movie ends. The end is very abrupt and, in my opinion, could have extended it a little more. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it's a good movie to watch. Everyone who likes rock music should see it. It will give you a good laugh!
