In general, I am disappointed by what the media calls "lesbian" movies these days: bisexual killers; psychotic killer lesbians; women who experiment with other women, but end up with men at the end; Ridiculously pretty women that only come together to light men, etc. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, FINGERSMITH is on a very high pedestal over this garbage. It is a believable love story that is WONDERFULLY carried out by every member of the cast, even the least of the supporting actors. Besides having a very attractive central conflict, the romance between the heroines is well developed and is credible thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins. <br /> <br /> I have also seen TIPPING THE VELVET, but FINGERSMITH is far superior to the previous one, both in the character / conflict development and in the quality of the performance. <br /> <br /> FINGERSMITH is satisfying and enjoyable to watch, and offers lesbians from around the world a great follow-up act for BOUND.
