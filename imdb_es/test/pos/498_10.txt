This movie was brilliant! I absolutely loved it! Wesley Snipes was great for this role, and I'm sure Blade 2 would be just as good. <br /> <br /> Blade is, by far, one of my favorite action / horror movies. and if you have not seen it yet, and like vampires and blood (all those things) you really should rent it, because I assure you that you will love it!
