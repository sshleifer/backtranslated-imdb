Ah, Hitchcock! It's hard to find a bad Hitchcock movie until he lost it after THE BIRDS (1963) and SABOTEUR shows the point. Having admired most of this director's work for many years, he had managed to omit this, perhaps because of lack of interest in Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings as main actors. Of course, I was familiar with the climax of the Statue of Liberty for having seen it repeatedly in retrospectives of films, but I mistakenly assumed that the story it took me might not be interesting. I was wrong! The suspense plot is immediately prepared in a casual encounter between Bad Guy's saboteur and the protagonist mistakenly accused of Good Guy and continues to advance through a series of additional casual encounters and narrow escapes. All the familiar elements of Hitchcock are: the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime; People are not what they seem to be; dramatic or improbable places that intensify the scene of suspense that is developing within them (an airplane hangar, a ranch, a bridge from which the handcuffed hero launches to escape the police, a sumptuous charity dance in a mansion palaciega, an upper floor of a skyscraper, and finally the torch of the Statue of Liberty). <br /> <br /> The humor provided by the support players, the generous wrists of the first comments of WW2 - vintage, are moments of human warmth where the suffering people find it inside. Give a hand to help a human companion, without getting anything in return? In short, there was always a basic humanity in the core of Hitchcock, although the traps were spooky: a sensational cast of supporting players, mainly Otto Kruger as the most shrewd villain on this side of George Sanders (his credits on Broadway include leadership male in Noel Coward PRIVATE LIVES (and that says it all) and, of course, Norman Lloyd as the titular saboteur, not to mention Alma Kruger, has no connection with otto? as a prominent widow of the society involved in the intrigue of the fifth column (his character prefigures that of Claude Rains' mother in NOTORIOUS) Priscilla Lane does a good job with a difficult role.In most of her early scenes, we can not say whether she thinks the hero is innocent or guilty, and It seems that he constantly changes his opinion, not coming to his side completely until the end of the process.You can not determine if his performance is at fault or if we are destined to remain in a state of uncertainty, but the developments of the plot are so fast, funny and intelligent that we really do not care what you think. <br /> <br /> Then there are the peculiar Hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the plot. Twice Lane's character stops to get a change for a quarter? once to reimburse his kidnappers for an ice cold drink and again to make a call from a phone booth. Why were these scenes inserted? Does anyone guess, perhaps to make the film seem more realistic and, therefore, increase the credibility and suspense? Or maybe to give the audience a moment to catch their breath? Some of the characters are exaggerated? the garrulous truck driver, the incredibly kind and confident blind man who lives alone in an impeccably maintained forest cabin, the "human skeleton" of political philosophy and other members of the circus caravan who hide the protagonists of their persecutors.
