When I read some of the other reviews of this movie, I remembered good and not so good aspects. But, in general, I must say that it is one of the best movies I've seen in many genres or countries recently. More than anything, he avoided many of the traps typical of the most recent international cinema, such as taking beautiful landscape images or being 'hip', 'having fun' or imitating American films as the fiction of the pulp. The movie is unique in many ways. On the one hand, it is a film about relationships in which sex plays no role (something unusual, especially for foreign films). It is also a film about the relationship of two men with each other (also unusual: it is not a "movie of friends", there is no homosexual tension, there is no ego / phallic competition). It uses little dialogue, but communicates a tremendous amount. It is a simple story, but full of complex details that are easily understood by any human being and universal in its relevance. I did not find the film dark or depressing (it would all look this way if you look at Hollywood's happy ending movies all the time), but a true reflection of human emotions. For example, in the scene in which Mahmut realizes that his cousin has left, it is when he sees his sense of relief, that the cousin has left, and yet he regrets having rejected him. Who has not felt such ambivalence, when he loses a friend or lover, or in some other situation? It is rare that this type of real human emotions are shown in a film in a non-cliche way. When it comes to culture, or being a Turkish film, I feel it is the difficult balance between being a "Turkish" film: the realities that apply most to that place (the biggest fight to succeed in a Turkish city instead of a European one, the greatest contrast between country and city, and a human and universal history that did not necessarily have to be established in Turkey.At this time when people from all over the world consume culture and fetishise it, this film does not try to tempt us as 'Turks', or try to communicate it as a 'hard reality', or 'this is how Turkey / Istanbul is', and yet, the cultural elements are there, I think the comparison with 'lost in translation' that someone It was quite good, everyone, at least in the United States, was enthusiastic about that movie, I personally thought it was mediocre at best, somebody put it right as a vague story that I was supposed to deal with. the "disorientation" that happens to people who live or travel abroad. Even if the film was supposed to be humorous, the characters and their motivations or crises were never clear (even for a more 'light' film or comedy, this is necessary). And I found myself being treated to a typically "Orientalist" story of alienated Amerian abroad. Going back to 'Distant', in terms of the idea that it is a bad performance, or that it is too slow, or that it has no argument, I am sorry, but the people who say this do not know anything about the making of films and Maybe nothing about being human, without offending. You do not have to be a movie buff or cultural connoisseur to appreciate this movie. This movie will be two hours of your time well spent!
