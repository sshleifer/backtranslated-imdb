I enjoyed this movie well, it could have been much better. I expected more action than what I got ... which was more a comedy than anything else. Granted, it was serious in parts and had a good fight scene here and there, for the most part it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror. What is difficult to do with a vampire movie. A vampire hunter loses his partner and must train another, his sister is going through a difficult break, but is being persecuted by a vampire of all things. Of course, this vampire is quite nice and does not like to suck blood. So that's all there is really except for a plot by another vampire after certain real vampires so that he can get maximum power. Some of the problems with this film is that its plot went here and there and the film had a very uneven flow, that and it seemed to change the genres too too much. One minute of action, the next pure comedy. However, the girls were nice, there was good action, the comedy was worthy of a giggle or two and Jackie Chan makes a quite energetic appearance or two. It is likely that this film just needs more development in some areas, such as the villain, who is basically not really explored. So for a movie with some good fights and a giggle or two, this is pretty good ... though, why was it rated R? I have seen things that we have done that is PG-13 that is much worse than this.
