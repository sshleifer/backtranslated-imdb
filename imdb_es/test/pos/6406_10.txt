Key West, for too little time was "television appointment" for my family. I would go through Red Lobster and pick up a Party Tray for the night I was on. The irony of the situation was that I was working for a Fox Affiliate at that time, and everyone at the station was outraged at not renewing the show. Everyone in the cast was excellent. Fisher Stevens ... perfect. Who could not stop identifying with a "common man" who dreams of being a writer in Key West? Jennifer Tilly was always extraordinary (and is a HECK of a Texas Hold'em player). You can still find the pilot episode on YouTube. I wish they had put hurricane one. Only that episode, I should have won an Emmy, as well as the rest of the cast.
