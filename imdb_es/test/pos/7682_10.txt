I was a projectionist while I was in the USA. UU And remember this movie very well. We had just installed ourselves with stereo sound! o-o-o-o-o !! Well, it was a big problem in 1959. The instructions came with the reels. The overture was played while the projected image of the curtain was closed and I followed the example with the curtain of the theater also closed. for the intermission, the curtain of the theater was closed and, after five minutes, I restarted the film with the closed projection curtain, while the music was used as a curtain call to the second part. being the first stereo movie I had seen and being such a huge musical production that I certainly enjoyed watching it every time I showed it to run.
