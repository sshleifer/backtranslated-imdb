I love this movie and I have my TV program scheduled to be recorded when it reappears on November 2nd. It is a very good love story with a touch. The song that is played at the end of the movie is one that you would not believe would be a great success, but it's a song that stays in your head and now I'm trying to find that song so I can listen to it and play it. I do not really have the style of the programs that I see or the songs that I like to listen to, and there it leaves me quite open to see new things with an open mind. I would like to say that there are some parts in this film that is not meant for the whole family to see. This movie shows the skin. It's a bit like a lifetime movie for women, about women. I say watch the movie and you may like it as much as I do.
