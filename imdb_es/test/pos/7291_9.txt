All right, I'm 12 years old, so this is where you can watch the movie from a preteen's point of view. I have also commented on Magnolia and Bicentennial Man, both great movies, if you want to see them. Very well, Here on Earth was a beautiful movie with amazing scenes and images, very pleasing to the eye. The writer (I do not know who he was, check IMDB) or he worked very hard or has a good appreciation of love, poetry and drama. I cried 4 times throughout this movie, once for more than 30 minutes. It was very sad, very beautiful, very significant. It's a great movie for anyone, say, 11 or older who is not a fan of romantic comedy. Yes, it's romantic, yes, it's comical, but (in my opinion), it's better than "She's all that" or "Whatever it takes". I never cry! It is a tender story. Go rent it and record it :).
