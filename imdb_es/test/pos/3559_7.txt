The hired killer George Hilton, the suave Mexican bandit Gilbert Roland (who is great) and the bank representative Edd Byrnes try to make fun of each other while looking for a large amount of gold from one of Roland's train robberies that was hidden by a traitor member of his gang. <br /> <br /> Although it is not the best that the genre has to offer, it is still windy enough with lots of cheerful fun, full of action and a satisfying ending. <br /> <br /> Any Gun Can Play is best remembered for its opening in which George Hilton easily shoots the three bandits who resemble Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Django. <br /> <br /> The following year, Hilton and Roland met with Van Heflin and Klaus Kinski in the highly recommended The Ruthless Four.
