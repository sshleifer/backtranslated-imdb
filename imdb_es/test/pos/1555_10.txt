Excellent story, wonderful performance, incredible production values ​​and a fresh and action-packed short with a perfect touch at the end. What a great short film! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and it captivated me. Then I saw it again at another festival (where it won again) and it impressed me even more because the subtle touches became evident the second time, for a short film, this includes many smart layers in a short time. <Br /> <br /> AWOL is not for the faint of heart, but it is very well done and it is completely awesome for a short movie, for any movie really. It is an interesting story that is told very well, and each scene moves the story, which reveals that the good shooting instincts were to make this film. The film looks beautiful and David Morse is also impressive, with a dynamic performance in each scene. Observe your character trying to defeat the curve, life is launching it, it is a great visual experience. <br /> <br /> It should also be borne in mind that when war tortures make headlines every day, the lines between reality, good and evil, can become very gray, while rhetoric becomes strong. and try to do things in black and white. AWOL intelligently allows the audience to decide for themselves what they believe the message is, what is real and what is not, which adds to the mystery. <br /> <br /> On both occasions I've seen it, the audience was on CAMINO more in this movie than the others that play with it, which is saying a lot. Right now there are a lot of shorts, but few offer the kind of excellence and the complex subject that AWOL does. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the previous critic is out of place. , or have a personal agenda, because this is really a great example of making independent short films. I see MANY short films, and I must say that if ALL the short films that made the festival were so good, THEN the business of the short films would have some serious legs.
