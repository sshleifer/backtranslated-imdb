In New York, a group of freshmen join the High School for the Performing Arts after having succeeded in their audition. For four years, her dreams, disappointments, successes, love and personal dramas are revealed through the insecure Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), the homosexual Montgomery (Payl McCrane), the aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), the aspiring Coco (Irene Cara) ), the ambitious Ralph Garci (Barry Miller) and his friends until the day of his graduation. <br /> <br /> Twenty-eight years ago, "Fame" was a great success, with the story of teenagers looking for a place in the Show Business, and I loved this movie and the soundtrack on CD. I just watched "Fame" on DVD, and at this point I would say it's a good movie with great potential, but with too many defective subplots. The story follows too many characters and leaves many situations unanswered. I do not know if Alan Parker had editing problems to reduce the execution time of this movie, but what happened, for example, with the dancer who goes to a clinic to have an abortion? What happened to Leroy and his teacher? Did he fail due to his grammar problem? What happened to Coco after taking off her blouse in that thief's apartment? The musician who plays the synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the secondary plot. Anyway, "Fame" is still a lovely entertainment and a cult movie for me. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fama" ("Fama")
