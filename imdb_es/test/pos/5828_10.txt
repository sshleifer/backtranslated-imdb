Yes, this show had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes, over the years the lines of the plot became exaggerated, melodramatic and very unrealistic, however, it did not matter because the show is great. You really get involved in the characters and all the characters, no matter how small or old, they are perfectly chosen. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine anyone else except JK Simmons playing the racist neo-Nazi rapist leader, or anyone else playing Tobias Beecher except Lee Tergesen. The transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is incredible. However, the character that MADE Oz OZ was CHRIS KELLER (played by Christopher Meloni). He did not have any relationships with anyone else in the prison, except Beecher (well, except for Ronnie Barlog, but that was only for Ronnie to stop playing with Keller's lover, Beecher). Their relationship transcended the sexes and Tom Fontana actually made us worry about those two and he wanted them to be together. <br /> <br /> I loved Vern's weak point for his children in the show and how Fontana made the characters sympathize with all these atrocious criminals that we grew up to love, including Simon Adebesi. <br /> <br /> However, some lines of the plot were totally incredible and unrealistic: * A boy building a bomb in oz * The guys stand in a spotlight on their windows in their pods looking at other men planning something in his mind - also above * Drugs that go into oz * Everyone in the rehabilitation group used or sold drugs and his sister Pete never helped anyone in six years. * People who die in the gym, the supply closet and the kitchen. * No one hurt Ryan's mother * No one fighting Cyril outside the boxing ring (except Vern, of course) * Two inmates with tools were left alone in the elevator shaft and one of them died without investigation. * Karl Metzger (guard) is murdered and nobody investigates. * The governor carries out all his press conferences in prison * All that a prisoner must do is say "I want to see Glenn" or "I want to see Mcmanus" and they are brought to them without asking questions. * People die every week in Oz * Outside, people kill someone and get 20 years, probation in eight, but if they kill someone inside they go almost immediately to the death row * No staff paid on the site in the kitchen or in the mailroom: inmates handle both departments without questions. * Medications aged for inmates to replace him as time goes by * Ryan has no friends or associates, but he is never hurt, killed, maimed, raped or beaten. * Boys should NEVER throw away toilets when they go to the bathroom or vomit. * An NBA scout comes to prison to recruit an NBA player (yes, to the right) <br /> <br /> However, with all these flaws, this show is still amazing. It is frightening, brutal, sexy, nervous, raw and innovative. Dean Winters, Scott William Winters, JK Simmons, Christopher Meloni, Luiz Guzman, Adele (the boy who played with Simon Adebisi), Eammon Walker, Lee Tergesen, Terry Kinney, Muss, Alexander, LL Cool J, etc., etc. They are all impressive and make the show worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend renting this on DVD. The sixth season comes out on 9/06 (next month). The first five seasons are on DVD: watch them and then watch them again with audio comments. I loved the director's comment with Chazz Palmentari. The sequence with Andy Schillinger running around the cafeteria tables and then falling into the hole was an incredible top-notch shot. Prestige! And Kathy Bates directing Family Business and the famous fight scene between Beecher and Keller, just amazing! Sparkly!!! That would have to be so weird for Meloni to touch the private part of Tergesen in front of an icon like Kathy Bates in that scene! Woohoo! I did it wonderfully, word game! <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Oz: The Next Generation! (as with Star Trek, etc.) C'Mon !!! Let's start it!
