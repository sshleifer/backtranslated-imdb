Before watching this movie, wash your ears, take off your makeup and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. She does not have to do it. This image will give both of them enough warmth to keep their relationship long enough. If you are Jewish / Russian / Ukrainian / immigrant, yes, what a minority of popular movies, laugh inside your memories. If you are something else or whatever, laugh at the bittersweet memory of the importance of friendship and family. In this film, nothing will seem strange how strange it may seem. However, I fear that few will see this movie, because it is not the kind of image that people see when they go to the movies. But, please, do it for humanity, and do not forget to get the soundtrack, for pleasure.
