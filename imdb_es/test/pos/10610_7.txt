Mention Bollywood to anyone who has a slight familiarity with the genre and the images that usually appear are distasteful, about the most important musical numbers in clothing that makes Vegas look like a bastion of conservatism. This perception is not favored by the smell of condescension that permeates most films that have approached Bollywood from the perspective of a stranger. However, Willard Carroll's romantic comedy, Marigold, takes a different tack. It is not a nod of wink-wink to those silly people and their clueless antics, but a sincere appreciation of Bollywood for its vitality, its lack of irony and self-consciousness. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that The director has a tremendous affection and respect for Bollywood while at the same time is baffled by its more kitsch aspects. And if you're familiar with Bollywood, you can appreciate what it does here by making a true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood film conventions. From one of the opening shots, a flashback of Salman's character when he was a child by the sea, talking to his grandmother (played by Helen! How many Salman films start with this same premise?) To the flashback sequence that It incorporates the film that Marigold and Prem have been filming, anyone who has seen enough Bollywood films will recognize these references. Does the story itself incorporate proven and true conventions of both Hollywood and Bollywood? the fish out of water fulfills the duty of the family at the expense of personal fulfillment. The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot of the most comical configuration of the first half, giving way to a more dramatic resolution of the second. However, ultimately, the film's sensibility is that of Hollywood, with its ironic and underestimated humor and its story of a woman who learns to believe in herself, to achieve self-affirmation. <br /> <br /> You could not have a movie inspired by Bollywood if there were no musical numbers and this movie does not disappoint with seven of them. However, unlike Bollywood, the songs do not come out of nowhere and transport their characters to a European place or Goan beach; They exist as musical numbers that are part of the film that is being made, and they remember how the musical numbers were justified in the Busby Berkeley films as part of a theatrical show. Or do they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there? a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians (including a cameo by singer Shaan) playing. All reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at that moment of the film. Often, music takes a conventional song from one genre and turns the other. So, in one of the highlights of the film where Marigold becomes his, is the song picturazation quite typical of its genre? The female star singing and dancing among a line of women? but in this case it's blonde Ali Larter, who looks like a totally natural Bollywood movie star, with emoticons and lip-syncing to Hindu lyrics without subtitles. <br /> <br /> Sumptuous visuals are also synonymous and Marigold fulfills that aspect beautifully. Thanks to some of the best talents working in Bollywood today. The director of photography is Anil Mehta, who was also the director of photography for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and the production designer is Nitin Desai, both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. Can you really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam in this movie? in fact, the illuminated floor in one of the numbers was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol, which coincidentally has an inlaid Marigold pattern. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, Carroll obviously has a penchant for detecting interpretive talent as evidenced by playing at heart? One of the first films for Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe. And in this film he hits the mark again with Ali Larter. One of the main reasons why the movie works is because of Larter. She makes a malicious, unattractive character understandable and her subsequent transformation credible, and she's smart, funny and sexy because she's smart and funny. She and Salman share excellent chemistry and that is one of the film's greatest strengths. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming here, as he filters through his iconic role as Prem. However, this is the old school Prem, so wait for a quiet Salman and dim. or relieved! It is a sincere and sensitive interpretation of him, tarnished only by the deficient enunciation of his English lines. <br /> <br /> With a refreshing lack of cynicism and a brazen embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter to the Bollywood and Hollywood movies. of yore
