I hope we will never become cynical as a society to appreciate the simple beauty of this film: beautiful in sight with its romantic English countryside, and beautiful in its message of faith and loyalty. Look at this with your children, especially with your young daughters. Velvet Brown is a wonderful example for girls. This was one of my daughter's favorite movies. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a bestselling book by Enid Bagnold about a girl, Velvet, whose whole life is her horse, Pi, and about her unique mind. the search for his "impossible" dream. I will not say anything more about the plot, I spoil it for the novice viewers. She lives with a large loving family in a small coastal town. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that made Elizabeth Taylor a star, and watching the movie is to understand why. She is a natural actress who radiates an inner beauty that combines with her exterior beauty: confident, passionate, innocent, she is the emotional core of the film. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney gives a wonderful performance as Mi, the young woman The man who arrives at his door one day, stays and helps Velvet to train Pi. This is one of his best performances. Anne Revere also stands out as Velvet's mother in an Academy Award-winning role. His strong, loving and wise character understands that life does not have much value unless you follow your dreams: "We are the same, I also believe that everyone should have the opportunity to live an awesome madness once in their life." <Br / > <br /> I recommend this very sweet and very inspiring classic of Hollywood's golden age.
