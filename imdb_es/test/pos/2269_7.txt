"Everything is illuminated" is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel. This version is more about the changes in Eastern Europe from the Second World War to the post Cold War and how the younger generation relates to that history as a family memory. <br /> <br /> Debut director / adapter, Liev Schreiber, retains some of the novel's humor and language crashes, mainly through the wonderful Eugene Hutz as the Ukrainian tourist guide seduced by the United States. It is so striking that the film becomes more of an odyssey in his country and his family when he moves from his comfortable surroundings in the sophisticated Odessa to the heart of a cynical and isolated land that has been devastated by the conquerors through the communists and now the capitalists. , with both Jews and non-Jews as detritus. As funny as his first scenes are when he establishes his daring bravery, we later feel his discontent in his own country when he tries to ask for directions to the local yokels. <br /> <br /> Shreiber uses Elijah Wood, as the American tourist, as a very high gear in a visual panoply, since his character is less verbal than one of the book's narrators. He and Hutz play well with each other until the conclusion that it becomes more sentimental in this simplified plot. Once the story of the grandfather takes over in the last quarter of the film, promulgated in a wonderful and unpredictable way by Boris Leskin, the younger generation does not seem to suffer any catharsis, as they simply order the closure. <br /> <br /> Schreiber does a wonderful job of visualizing the human impulse to document history. One of his credit advisors is Professor Yaffa Eliach and his style of remembering the life of shtetl before the Holocaust through artifacts clearly inspired the appearance and is very powerful and effective. <br /> <br /> The Czech Republic represents Ukraine and the production design team could find memorable symbols of change in cities, towns and rural areas, as it is now mainly a road movie, and the Long driving scenes drag a little. Schreiber retains part of the symbolism of the book, particularly the moon and the river, but after having cut the portions of the book that explain it, they only look pretty or ominous to the atmosphere and no longer represent time or destiny. <br /> <br /> Like W.C. Fields would have predicted, the dog steals most of his scenes to laugh easily. In general, Schreiber goes by more poignant than the book. It is irresistibly moving, especially for those who have not read the book, but with less moral and emotional disorder. <br /> <br /> The film is enormously animated by its wonderful soundtrack, which includes songs and musical instruments of the Hutz gypsy. Band of traditional songs to contemporary tracks to the klezmer fusion score of Paul Cantelon. <br /> <br /> This is not a Holocaust movie per se, it's a kind of mirror image of "The train of life" as the memory of a time loaded with meaning now, but It resonates more with those who have an emotional connection to that story.
