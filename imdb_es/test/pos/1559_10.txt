I did not expect much when I rented this movie, since many independent films seem to be a little overrated these days (well, Hollywood movies too), but this movie was fantastic, really great, it's very bad. It did not reach a large audience because it is simply excellent. I really love Alice's determination, it really makes me see my life as a gift, and I see how privileged I am to have an education. But aside from that, this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story, regardless of the budget, it's an excellent movie and everyone should see it, love it and definitely learn something from it. I do not have to be Roger Ebert to know it's one of the best movies I've seen all year, and certainly one of the most sincere.
