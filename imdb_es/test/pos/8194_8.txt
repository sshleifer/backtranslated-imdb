For a movie, the plot follows the story closely, or at least the historical gossip. But then the Chinese, who know history very well by seeing it portrayed again and again, will never tolerate it in any other way. The attention to detail is wonderful, especially for anyone who has read the Sima Qian story in the historian's records. Jing Ke, according to Sima Qian, made an attempt to attack the life of Qin Shi Huang at the request of the Crown Prince of Yan before unification. Sima Qian explicitly mentions both the General Fan's boss and the dagger rolled up on the map, as well as the dagger thrown at the bronze column. Although Jing Ke is not a stranger in the game of the sword, he is not the invincible warrior represented by Chen Kaige. Jing Ke is certainly the weakest link in this movie. Actually (again, according to Sima Qian), he was a heavy drinker and delayed his visit to Qin as long as possible, spending a lot of time with Yan's ladies before the crown prince finally ordered his way. . In short, he was a human being and did not expect death, although he was willing to accept it. Chen Kaige's Jing Ke fears death, but not his own. He is the classic ruthless murderer turned into a disillusioned pacifist. His love (or perhaps just affection) for a woman and pity for several hundred children whom Zheng had buried alive (not even two thousand years of Confucian hostile historians claimed that Qin Shi Huang did this, although there is a legend about he burying 460 Confucians up to their necks and then decapitating them) is enough for this killer to kill again. The melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being simply boring. The performance here is not in bad shape, although it is not very interesting given the character. As for Lady Zhou, in all the many stories I've heard about Qin Shi Huang, she has never appeared. Anyway, Gong Li is famous enough that the Americans have heard about it (thanks to Zhang Yimou) and there had to be a love interest, so here it is. It is unfortunate that his performance is almost as wooden as the character of Jing Ke. She has done much better (in Qiu Ju for example) in being subtle; here he barely manages presence. But all this is trivial compared to the extraordinary performance of Li Xuejian as Zheng himself. Qin Shi Huang is for the Chinese, rather what the Satan of Milton is for us: accepted as a villain, but noble. The achievements of Qin Shi Huang radiate astonishment over two thousand years to the present and Li captures his terrifying will without compromising his humanity. Li's performance is sufficient, but the scope of the film is great, although the picture is deliberately monotonous. It feels old. The score is adequate, it barely moves, although it is very appropriate for the action. Although I've only seen it once, I think Chen Kaige should be given more credit for his work with the camera than other critics have allowed him to. The opening credits are stimulating. If five stars is absolutely average, I gave him three more for the performance of Li Xuejian and Chen Kaige as an actor, writer and director.
