Spoiler alert <br /> <br /> I have never seen comments about a movie, with which I disagree with more than the comments that people made about this. One could learn from the critical views of this movie. As an educational film, I rate it very well because it teaches "how to succeed". We do not see movies to learn; We usually look for entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it as low: the end is weak and cerebral / intellectual. This conflict results in my eight-star rating. The film follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The executive of the network introduces Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), to study for the position of air news presenter. Tom immediately charms people with humility. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for his chance on the air for years, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all the news, inside and out. <br /> <br /> The network executive wants Grunnick on the air and Jane argues that Grunnick is not ready, that he does not know the news. They do not listen to it. Forced to put Grunnick on the air, Jane contacts Altman for information about the news and transmits Altman's comments through a headset to Grunnick while Grunnick speaks. We note the sharp contrast between the words of Altman / Jane Craig and Grunnick, while Grunnick skillfully writes everything that Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear to make it understandable, enjoyable and entertaining for the audience. Altman has an opportunity in the air and network executives ask him to seek training from Grunnick, the new guy. This new (news ingnorant) boy training him? This is something that Altman does not see as justified, but reluctantly accepts. <br /> <br /> Grunnick trains Altman and is thrilled to notice hundreds of Altman flaws in appearance, audio and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert in the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him, causes Altman to have a panic sweating attack ("Flop Sweat") when he is in the air. Grunnick finally becomes the main anchor of the network and Altman resigns before being fired. But Grunnick fails in his attempt at an affair with Jane Craig, because she discovers by Altman, that Grunnick sometimes feigns circumstances to make people feel like him. This puts it out of him. This sends the message that, in relationships, we want people who are genuine and who do not try to like us. <br /> <br /> This movie sends the message that making people like it is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people who comment on how this is the nuisance of TV News and how Grunnick represents an attractive guy, but stupid or of all kinds, but without substance. The opposite is true, Grunnick possessed abilities and a very complex intellect, to make people like it, including the presence of the mind to know exactly how it looks and sounds, when it is in front of the camera. ). Grunnick's shortcoming relationship with Jane Craig is that he is too motivated to be sympathetic and will fake a situation. Many people are calling Altman very smart or brilliant. Altman played by Brookes is not as smart as Grunnick and the "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that Grunnick handles when he is in the air. Altman gets upset over the fact that he knew the news and Grunnick was more successful at making people like him. There are also people who comment that these things are exclusive to the TV News industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job is obviously not popular, but my experience indicates that it is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, though unpopular. Educational, yes, but it does not have an edifying ending.
