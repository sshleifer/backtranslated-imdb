I would like to point out these excellent points in favor of this film: <br /> <br /> # 1 Angelina Jolie sex scene <br /> <br /> # 2 The Foley artist surpassed herself <br /> <br /> The plot # 3 was quite thick <br /> <br /> The DVD # 4 includes trailers and chapter stops <br /> <br /> # 5 no animal was damaged during the creation of the film <br /> <Br /> # 6 tributes to the blade runner throughout the movie <br /> <br /> # 7 burning trash cans <br /> <br /> # 8 funny without legs <br /> <br /> # 9 Voice over from Jack Palance added a real dynamic element to the movie. <br /> <br /> Notice of the wise # 10, for example, "When you eat with the devil, bring a long spoon". <br /> <br /> # 11 Angelina Jolie was only 18 years old! <br /> <br /> In summary: an evening of entertainment was offered.
