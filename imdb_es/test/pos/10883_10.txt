This game requires stealth, intelligence and a firm hand. The gameplay is simply the best; Besides that, there are the interesting extras: the bullet holes remain in the walls, the enemies react to specific points in which they have been hit by the bullets, there are tons of animations captured in movement that make the enemies look very real (for example, when looking through a window in a guard, he will stay there scare away flies, sneezing or scratching himself), and the list goes on. This is the best licensed / movie conversion in history and puts you in the skin of the softest super spy. This game is the best reason to own an N64.
