Once you sit down to watch this movie "A cannon for Córdoba", you have the feeling that it will be great. The reason? The film begins with a veiled score by the renowned composer Elmer Bernstein, who gave us such memorable songs as "The great escape and the magnificent seven". In fact, when you read the opening credits that lead the cast is none other than George Peppard as Captain Rod Douglas, you know he's going to have a lot of action. Also, when you see the actor John Russel playing General John J. Pershing, you know that a heroic saga awaits you. The story is taken from the annals of the Mexican revolution and involves the US. UU In a dispute of a border town with the Mexican bandits crossing the Rio Grande at the beginning of the 20th century. General Córdova (Raf Vallone) is among the most brazen leaders of the rebels. With his army of Mexican revolutionaries, he attacks Pershing, kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces. Since the United States Army can not enter Mexico legally, Captain Douglas is sent to what is scheduled for a suicide mission, without orders and without help from Pershing. Its mission is to recover the Cannons, destroy a rebel stronghold and restore life to Cordoba. Selecting the roughest, toughest, most experienced and certainly most insolent men available, Douglas enters Mexico and attacks the almost impregnable fortress. The dramatic action continues, as does a lot of explosive emotion. If one is asked for criticism, I would say that the choice of the heavens. Vallone and John Larch are not very threatening. Not so with the men who are on Peppard's side. Pete Duel and Don Gordon (Who is superb.) However, this movie is recommended as a good visualization. ****
