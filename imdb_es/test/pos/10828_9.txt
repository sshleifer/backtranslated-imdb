"Bon Voyage" has the fast pace that somehow reminds me of the Indiana Jones / Star Wars movies, it's as if you were on a fast train or on a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> It is considered as a romance, mystery, thriller and farce; It is all that and more, including sincere observations about the reactions of French society during the Nazi invasion at the beginning of World War II. And it is also a juggling exhibition that involves 7 main characters. All the scenes seemed historically accurate (to my eyes) and gave an excellent feeling for the period. <br /> <br /> All the actors were well chosen and gave excellent performances, but the IMO, the most superb, was that of Isabelle Adjani, who played the role of an opportunistic and self-centered French film star; not only did she quite convincingly interpret the role of a young actress, perhaps half her age, but she also convincingly interpreted her love performances in such a way that the audience sees that she is just a serious and more complex person than a simple gold seeker. His character and energy drive the film from start to finish. It was not until I read Roger Ebert's review that I discovered he was 48 at the time of the movie. That beauty! <br /> <br /> I appreciated the end; It's satisfying, but it allows you to write your own conclusion about what happens with the main characters. <br /> <br /> As another user commentator observed: DO NOT be late; You need to be there from the opening scene. Good advice. <br /> <br /> I gave 9 out of 10.
