This film does not have the outstanding images that American Beauty or The Ice Storm offered, and because it was made after those films, it can not be marked as very original: the music, although subtly bright, looks a lot like that of American Beauty. <br /> <br /> The story has some similarities with The Ice Storm in particular (as well as with Sigourney Weaver). Perhaps unintentionally, the film seems to try to recreate too much the success of the two films mentioned. Sometimes, the story tends to be a bit more superficial than it is bigger and more successful "brothers" having too many things going on or not delivering the most effective dialogues. Here, the writing can not be measured with that of American Beauty. But that can be said about most of the films that have been made, even the best and there are still many things that I like: said musical score and (probably, given the cast) effective performances. It is noteworthy that Emile Hirsch would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding "Into The Wild". <br /> <br /> In general, I can recommend this movie if you like suburban dramas, although it is not the first on the list. of forced visits, which would be surpassed by: 1 American beauty 2 Small children of the ice storm 3. <br /> <br /> After you've seen and liked it, take a look at this one.
