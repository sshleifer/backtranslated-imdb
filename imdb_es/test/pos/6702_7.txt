I finally got Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format intact and waking Henry Mancini's score to the fullest. Having seen Lifeforce for fifteen years on tape, I must say that the "uncut" DVD version was great and disappointing. The US version UU It's so * much * better than the DVD version (European?). The American version of Lifeforce moves much faster (the editing on the DVD version is terrible, it feels like an unfinished cut). And the many scenes that are not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact, a "new" moment almost destroys the entire film, when Caine (Peter Firth) meets the male alien in the cathedral. I love this scene, although in the United States version. On the DVD, the male alien speaks to Caine and what he says is very funny. It is the pinnacle of hilarity: <br /> <br /> "It will be much less terrifying if you only come to me!" The male extraterrestrial says, in a deep voice of style of the fifties. I was knocked down when I saw this. It just does not belong to the movie. That scene is pure camped in an otherwise serious film. I'm glad that Hooper (or whoever it is) has cut that scene when the movie premiered in North America. There are several changes that were made to the US version. UU That makes Lifeforce much better and I wanted the DVD to have the US version. UU The editing is sharp and frenetic without being annoying and some points that were already boring in the US version are even more boring in the DVD version due to the added scenes. And the opening credits on the DVD are terrible. Much better in the American version. More subtle <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Basically, these are aliens who make a stop on Earth and absorb as much Life Force as possible. The movie has too many flat, uninspiring sequences (talk, talk, talk), but when the action goes to London, it's fun. The movie really shines in these scenes. One can see Hooper finally doing what is good: chaos, savagery, horror! Lifeforce should have had more of these scenes of chaos. They are the best apocalyptic scenes ever filmed. It is also the best zombie movie. The zombies are hungry (by the vital force, not by the flesh) and are mad, agile and terrifying. Not the slow movement of other zombie movies. Also, many people have criticized the end, but I love it. It leaves you high and dry, like one of the victims with great loss of life. <br /> <br /> And to think that this movie appeared during the cute and tender 80s, when people came to E.T. or Cocoon or another sweet and boring, feel good science fiction movies. No wonder he was bombed because he was far ahead of his time with his super nihilistic point of view. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, well, it's not great. The image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras at all. But it's great to see the movie in its widescreen format. I just hope that they release a clean and clear version of the United States on a DVD, and with comments from Hooper and Dykstra.
