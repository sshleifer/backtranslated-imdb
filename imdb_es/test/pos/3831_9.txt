I agree that this is ONE of the best episodes of the entire series; my only detraction would be the somewhat shocking appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this: if he was not present during the first execution of this episode, then he knows Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the second generation of Trekkie (or Trekker, your preference), it takes you out of the scene at the beginning. However, he is an excellent commander and the opposite for our captain, and this episode is strongly written and well acted by all. Both sides have made excellent comments about the cost of war compared to the price of peace and certainly remind us of some of the best films of World War II and the later era. Those are not my favorite genre, but I would definitely recommend a fan of them to watch this episode through that filter. You'll see it holds up. I will never understand why science fiction receives so little respect: the best drama comes from placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.
