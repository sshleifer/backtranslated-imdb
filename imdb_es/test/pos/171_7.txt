Three ten-year-olds born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to knowingly murder anyone who offends them. <br /> <br /> While the killer children movies were not exactly new at the time of this twisted slasher of the 80s The theme of children as killers works very well for this movie. Bloody Birthday brings some good chills and suspense, while being a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities. It stretches along a thin line between cheesy and spooky, but it's still entertaining with an interesting plot. There are some scenes of strong murders, as well as a bit of nudity to establish this as a guilty pleasure of a solid slasher. <br /> <br /> The cast does a pretty good job. The young stars Elizabeth Hoy and K.C. Martel offers some threatening performances, while rising star Julie Brown performs a striptease before a memorable murder scene. Veteran star Susan Strasberg performs well as a teacher and Jos√© Ferrer has a special appearance. <br /> <br /> Everything around this entrance slasher out of rhythm is not bad, although it is true that it is not impeccable, but it is worth seeing. for fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
