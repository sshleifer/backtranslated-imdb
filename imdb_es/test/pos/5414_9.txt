This movie is full of little surprises, many of them funny. The fact that it is written and directed by a young man of 24 years surprises me. Some of the scenes in which high school kids use ecstasy made me feel very uncomfortable because I have a child that age and I could imagine using it. As the father of a teenager, I found that representations of parent-child interactions were very accurate. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the many little jokes in the movie, and I enjoyed the fact that not everything made sense. And not all the problems were solved in the end. To paraphrase Mark Twain, truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction is required to adhere to what is possible, while the truth is not. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that plays with the viewer, which allows us to believe that people are what other people think they are, only to allow us later to realize that the people we assume were right They were completely ignorant of the real situation. One of the film's strongest scenes, a scene in which we feel very relieved and sympathetic to what the character is doing, is based on a completely erroneous assumption, and the character, although admirable, is totally wrong. It's very subtle, I think. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> I really liked the score, I thought it really helped the movie, it really helped to set the mood, the movie has a couple of moments and the background music helps to establish that. . <br /> <br /> The speech of the most outstanding is a beep and a half, I have a great laugh! The movie is really in my head right now, I saw it this morning. I'll try to see it again, time allows. The tens are hard to get, but nine solid in my book.
