Before going to this, I was skeptical about the horribly assembled trailer that made it look like an equally horrible movie. I was surprised how much I did not waste my money. I think the success of the films comes from the really scary thing that is and the atmosphere of the house. Small things like sensor lights create a real uncomfortable feeling. The shadows and the cold feeling of the house make it easy to know that no matter how much you know in horror movies, everything can happen in the movie. The acting is by no means perfect, nor were they bad. The main character is convincing even taking into account the annoying teenage dramas that surround her. In the end, I was very impressed with the film in most aspects. <br /> <br /> It is definitely a movie that I would recommend.
