These are the ten most energetic and entertaining movie minutes I've seen in a long time. As a film student at the University of New York, where this short has been shown several times, I greet Jim Cox for his clever sense of style and rhythm for our generation. I'm sure I'll see your name later on the big screen. Let's hope that this short finds a market on television or somewhere, so this inspiring work can get the wide distribution you deserve.
