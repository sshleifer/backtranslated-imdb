What movie I've always liked the Asian filming style, and this movie does not disappoint at all! Photography is impressive, from amazing landscapes to swirling colors. The main actor is really realistic in representing the painter (whose paintings are amazing). The ending is also very well chosen, very poetic. The only comment is that they should have shown a little more deeply the connection between their inspiration and their abuse of alcohol and women. But overall this is an excellent movie!
