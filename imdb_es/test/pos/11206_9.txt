When you're watching Distant, you know you're not watching a French movie, there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people do not talk much here, there are some lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations. Only for you to have sense of what is happening. It also does not look American, there are no car chases or shootings or violence, unless you consider the killing of a mouse as an act of blood or the daily stress of overcoming a moderate catastrophe. Sometimes, relatively long medium distance shots may remind you of "contemplative" Asian cinema, but it only reminds you that the director does not push things towards the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers but, again, this is not a problem. Taiwanese movie, it's a Turkish movie. I do not know what that means, I do not even know if it's supposed to mean anything. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a plot itself and, however, those few lines, those somewhat long. the shots retained and that tension often mitigated gradually create a feeling that something is happening, a feeling of "plot", for want of a better word, that grows in you. At the end of the movie, you may have the feeling that you will miss those two cousins ​​who have many things in common but are worlds apart.
