They recommended this movie to me as one of the best love stories ever told. And since I'm a big fan of love, I bought the tickets and sat in the theater. After 90 minutes, I left the theater with nothing but disappointment and the song was the only positive thing about the film. I was horrified by the story itself, because two people can love each other but be so afraid of never acting. I just could not get past the language barrier and the cultural barrier. The second time I met him ... I was in a different mood, I had no expectations anymore ... and I had more patience, a more relaxed mind to "see" the movie ... and as soon as I opened my eyes, I discovered love ... the beauty of the movie. I went beyond the language and love story and saw the performance (not even for a moment I felt that they were acting!) And cinematography. The first time I heard a definition of what a movie is, I was told that it should be a perfectly balanced string of photographs (shots) and this is the movie that matches the description. Almost all the shots have an idea behind, and combined with the music ... and the effects of light ... the result is just a masterpiece! And a masterpiece is something you should have in your movie collection.
