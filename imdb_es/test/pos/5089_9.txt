Nothing boring about this movie, which is held together by completely accomplished characters with some depth for them. Even hooded torturers have body language. Jannings performance is brilliant, everything will be, will and will. A Henry VIII as it must have been. Henny Porten is, perhaps, more noble and purer than Anne Boleyn, but she interprets the paper as it is written: a victim trapped in the jaws of a large (huge) baby. <br /> <br /> Sparkuhl's cinematography is beautiful in the restoration, the sensual tints. Lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveal their corruption to the smallest of pettiness. He takes his time, he can prove the patience of a public accustomed to letting himself be carried away by the action, but it is worth spending time. It lowers the heart rate and watch this little miracle of the German silent film.
