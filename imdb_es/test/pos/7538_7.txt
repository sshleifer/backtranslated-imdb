For those of you who are not familiar with Alisdair Sims, he is, of course, THE ultimate Scrooge of all the Christmas Carol films. (I ... I guess I'm very bad ... I really have not seen the damn thing). I suppose those who have seen Christmas Carol and are so accustomed to his character can find The Bells of St. Trinians quite surprising. You see, in this movie, Sims has two roles. One, he plays much better, and in the other, he is on the street as the director of a private school for girls. So once you pass that for your thick skull, this film offers you many treats. The plot is about how the school tries to earn some desperately needed money through a horse race. It's actually a bit more complicated for small children, but I think they would be preoccupied with their antics and horses to notice. Adults can also trip over all the thick accents that are thrown around as well. But, once again, the story is reasonably light, the action is crazy and frenetic, so that one really notices it. PS: all the children look like they come from Eloise's school of tenderness.
