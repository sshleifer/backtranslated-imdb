I had the pleasure of seeing Saltimbanco live before watching the video version of the program. While nothing can be compared to actually being there, the people behind the video did an incredible job of capturing the taste, the feeling, the sensation and much more. The wonderful performances of the amazing and amazing company of Saltimbanco are captured beautifully everywhere. The video flows as smoothly and artistically as the production itself. A wonderful experience
