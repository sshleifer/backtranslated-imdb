One of the funniest movies I saw in the cinema in the early 70s, and unfortunately, has only been on television a few times since then. This movie must be released on video. It's about Sellers at his best, the thinnest of all, like a crooked hospital administrator. Great cast, great movie. If someone has a good copy on VHS, I'd love to buy it.
