This was unusual: a movie today that was very nice. In fact, it was so nice that it limited being too hard to believe in some parts. As I watched this story based on real life, I thought: "Nobody is so good, so tolerant." Mainly, I was referring to the role of Ed Harris as "Coach Jones". I think they exaggerated a bit in their character, but that's better than the other way around: showing it worse than it was in real life. It is also strange to see Harris playing the part, since he has a long resume of playing nasty and profane characters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I never complain about a nice movie and well-being, and it's good to see a lot of well-intentioned, kind people. These people direct their friendship, love and compassion to "James Kennedy," better known as "Radio," a mentally slow high school kid played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story takes place in the mid-1970s in South Carolina. Gooding also does a good job with the paper. However, like Sean Penn's role as a man with mental problems in "I Am Sam", a character of an hour and a half like this is enough. After that, the sonority of those guys becomes tired of listening. <br /> <br /> Note: It was interesting in one of the documentaries of this DVD to discover that, in real life, it took years in "Radio". To make your transformation, not months as shown in the movie.
