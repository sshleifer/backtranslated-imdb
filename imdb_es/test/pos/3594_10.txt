What I enjoyed most in this film was the Corfu stage, being Greek, I adore my country and I liked the director's flattering point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece struggled to keep up because of the war, the Nazis and the difficulties. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love, but times are difficult and they have many sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage, who looks great in a uniform, gives a passionate account of this unsatisfied love (at first). He worshiped Christian Bale as Mandras, the future husband of the heroine, he looks very good as a Greek, his personality matches that of the Greek patriot. A true fighter in there, or what! One of the movies that I would like to buy and save in my collection ... forever!
