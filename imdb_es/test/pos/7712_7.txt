This is one of the peripheral stories that Animatrix has and that has no direct relationship with the arrest of the war. A glorious plot of the movies, but Trinity, with the voice of Carrie, appears in it. It has a private detective who is hired by large amounts of money to find a hacker named Trinity. We see his search that shows other PIs, only one he meets, that apparently has gone crazy for his own experience when trying to locate Trinity. finally, he gets in touch with Trinity, who assumes he is a man, of course, told in the narrative and something that puts us firmly in his own perspective despite what we already know: in a hacker chat room and solves an enigma that forces him in a hurry to take a train. He forgets his hat, but his faithful cat throws it at a moment of ridiculousness so absurd that it is hilarious. <br /> <br /> He meets her on the train, but the trick is revealed when the agents attack; the agents were using it to get to Trinity and Trinity was trying to release the PIs sent by her, which he does not know, of course, and which is not explicitly stated in the animation, something common in black film titles, which often It hints at a lot of interesting secondary stories, subplots, developments, etc., but it does not show you more than the central story and a limited point of view to create an extra air of mystery and intrigue. <br /> <br /> almost everything in this short film is black and white, the music is reminiscent of the black cinema and the unconventional detective, old and at the same time dedicated, is the perfect protagonist for a black film title. The section of trivialities of the entry of this title in IMDb also presents some references that this title makes to complicated literature, something that also borrows, a genre of mysteries for detectives, gangsters, etc. Appropriately animated by Studio 4 Â° C and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, it is a pleasant variation of the usual matrix story.
