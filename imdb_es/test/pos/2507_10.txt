I am a former heterosexual gorilla, former rugby player and former boxer, and I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It is not a "mystic river". It's a piece of fluff. But there is room in life for the fluff, and when that fluff is shot in an attractive manner, well acted by attractive, sympathetic, cleverly planned and full of good dialogue, there is even more space for it. <br /> <br /> I am not the biggest fan of Tom Selleck. But he is good at this. So are Julianne Nicholson (loves her bald head and freckles), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do!). <br /> <br /> The landscape is pleasant, the atmosphere is optimistic, there is Anguish and longing and farce and even a bit of redemption. <br /> <br /> Any critic (male) that disagrees with this movie is, shall we say, not perfectly confident in his masculinity. Meanwhile, I will continue to capture fragments of him without apology whenever it appears on the cable.
