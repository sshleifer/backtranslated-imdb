I'm not a fan of Faulkner (which is considered a sacrilege, especially because I grew up near the author's hometown); However, I think this is an excellent movie. On par with the quality of the movie "Kill a mocking bird". If you have not seen it, buy it anyway. It's worth having it in your permanent collection. TCM recently played the movie as part of the Race on Film series. I would like them to play more often. Very touching. <br /> <br /> On a side note, the people of Oxford, Mississippi, will also enjoy seeing the images of the city square, as it was in 1940. The courthouse, the town hall, etc.: They are all on screen. I never knew that the movie was filmed there until I noticed the familiarity of the buildings. When I saw the arch in front of the City Hall, I began to suspect. Look closely at the pennants on Chick's wall: You will see two for Ole Miss!
