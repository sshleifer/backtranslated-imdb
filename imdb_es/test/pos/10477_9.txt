This movie is almost unknown, but it's very good. In a lonely Danish city, two older sisters live remembering distant young people, when, due to a strict Puritan education, they had to reject happiness. Alone, then, they live in a dignified austerity, until Babette arrives, who flies from Paris, frightened by the horror of the war. In a short time, you will be able to convert the kindness and love that you received when you arrived. A good lottery prize allows you to organize a great banquet, following the best rules of French gastronomy. All neighborhoods are invited (all fanatically puritans). They accept, but they agree not to show any trace of pleasure or enjoyment, since it would be a sin. However, the seductive strength of the delicious food they eat, is seduced by the sensuality of French cuisine. The banquet ends in a very heartfelt happiness, although quiet. Love among humans has awakened. The miracle of raising human kindness due to the pleasure of meaning has begun. The movie is surprisingly good, but it's not for everyone. During most of the film, nothing happens, everything is so quiet and so quiet, that for many minutes, you can only see the life of the inhabitants of the city. But, as the film develops, it becomes more precious, when Babette wins the lottery prize (after the 30 minute film), the show begins. The author can, with a perfect address, show us how Babette prepares the banquet, how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful (Love), all told in a delicious way, with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting. . Then, as the banquet progresses, the quality of showing us how the mood of all the dining rooms changes due to the food, only with the first shots, with impressive scenes filmed one after the other, is simply amazing. In addition, the touch with colors and photography are also excellent, almost all the scenes in the film are like an image, so the work is involved there. If you are able to admire a good cinema and you realize that sometimes it is more important to tell you something instead of what is said, this is your movie. If you like good food and love good food, you will probably feel fun, since most of the feelings of the film will be familiar. An Oscar fully deserved. The only problem is its slowness to set the story, but I can forgive it (I hope everyone too)
