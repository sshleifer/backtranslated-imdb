"Summer of My German Soldier" was one of the many television movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s (others were "Brian's Song", "Sybil" and "Someone's Watching Me!") . It represents a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) who befriends a German prisoner of war (Bruce Davison) in the era of World War II in Georgia. One of the things the film shows is that many of the German soldiers were not really Nazis, but simply recruited. When I saw the movie, I had a real idea of ​​how things should have been in the South at the time; I mean, can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? <br /> <br /> Therefore, I certainly recommend this movie. I think it's always important to show the things portrayed here. Occasional overexploitation prevents the film from being a masterpiece on a large scale, but usually it is doing quite well. I hope the movie comes out on DVD. Also starring Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine (the patriarch of "My Great Greek Wedding").
