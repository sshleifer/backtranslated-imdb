I have not read the novel on which the film is based. So I can not comment on what is missing or if changes were made. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I had a wonderful experience watching THE KITE RUNNER ... I find that when I see films about other cultures that here, in the United States, I learned how they live and there are other people. <br /> <br /> The actors in this film are from Afghanistan and other countries in that area. There are 3 small children in this almost epic movie in their first roles, they were wonderful. <br /> <br /> The scenes that allegedly took place in Kabul in various parts of China, I assume the area is similar to the actual places in the book. <br /> <br /> Mark Foster directed and did it FINDING NEVRRLAND, he has created the same magic here. <br /> <br /> All aspects of the production are first class. <br /> <br /> I found this movie better than the Oscar nominees and winners. <br /> <br /> The film is subtitled, it is very clear to read. It has an adequate PG-13 classification. SPOILER ALERT --- The scene of a child's rape is very well handled. <br /> <br /> However, I can not give you a 4 star rating as the general plot and the story we've seen many, many times less this is a movie worth seeing .. <br /> < Ratings: *** 1/2 (of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
