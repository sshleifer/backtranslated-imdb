This was a great series for black people at that time. We loved it so much. It was the only program about black middle class families on television. at the time. Please, release this on DVD. I know many ... many people who still talk about the show. If it is published, I am sure that many young black people will find it as enlightening as it is interesting. The program addressed many issues related to racism, racial discrimination, teenage pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parents, social pressure and much more. The show ended so abruptly and left the fans speechless and wondering why he was removed from the air. Since then we have only seen some of the actors and actresses. Please, release it on DVD as soon as possible.
