Cooley High is considered one of my best films of all time. It certainly reminds me of the days when my youth grew up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago in the early, mid and late sixties. What happened to Brenda and Pooter? Someone needs to track those two. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for her innocent wit. Both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after their debut in the film. I think many of the fans of this movie would like to know what happened to them, as well as others who performed in this fun-filled film. Certainly, I think this movie should be included in some kind of MOVIE HALL OF FAME. The whole cast of this movie was great. My opinion is that "Cooley High" has returned the hands of time, those were the fun years.
