This is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. The glorious Technicolor shows the beauty and spectacular hair of Rita Hayworth. I should have made more films in color, but then Columbia was not in a position to spend money for the Technicolor spectacular. <br /> <br /> Rita is a WOW like Rusty Parker; more than staying aware of Gene in some aspects of the brightest numbers ever. She also looked beautiful in dresses at the turn of the century, so she had the opportunity to play her own grandmother. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with "The Show Must Go On", I think it's great, but Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is not impressed. His motto is work, work, work !!! One of the dancers, Maurine (Lesley Brookes) is determined to outdo herself and is going to audition for the girls competition of the golden wedding of Vanity. Rusty is also at the auditions too. In a very funny scene, Maurine just had a very regular audition and seeing Rusty, gives some advice on how to impress the judges. "Do not be shy and demure - talk and shine". Rusty does it with pleasure! <br /> <br /> They decide on Maurine and go to the show to see her, but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty; She reminds him of someone from his past. Cornelia (Eve Arden) still has nightmares about Rusty's audition. "Whose Complaining" features Genius (Phil Silvers) and the dancers, disguised as working girls - (Rusty is a taxi driver). <br /> <br /> John is remembering a lost love (Rusty's grandmother, Maribelle Hicks) the first time he saw her singing "A Sure Thing", at the races. Meanwhile, Danny, Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls at their local restaurant. Then they throw themselves into the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion): "Make Way For Tomorrow". <br /> <br /> "Put Me to the Test" is an animated song and dance number with Danny and Rusty. Meanwhile, Rusty Cover Girl was chosen and Danny McGuires is the place to be seen. Lee Bowman appears as Danny's romantic rival and puts a brake on things. Lee Bowman is probably the most boring protagonist in history, so Danny should never worry. <br /> <br /> Rusty (dubbed by Martha Mears) sings "Long Ago and Far Away" and is danced beautifully by Danny and Rusty. The dresses Rita wears are impressive. Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling designed them. Danny wants the best for Rusty, but he's afraid he'll lose it. Gene Kelly is also fantastic in the number "Alter Ego", where he dances with himself. <br /> <br /> "Poor John" is another look at the century: it was written in 1906 and it's an extremely funny song taunting rich relationships - Hayworth looks beautiful in an incredibly picturesque outfit. Look for Al Norman in both "Poor John" and "A Sure Thing". He was an incredible eccentric dancer, who appeared in several early musicals, including "King of Jazz" and "Paramount on Parade." It was easy to detect. <br /> <br /> The "Cover Girl" dance is simply wonderful. Rita was very talented, beautiful and a great dancer. After a group of beautiful models parade through the covers of the most important magazines in the United States, Rusty breaks into a beautiful golden dress that goes down a ramp to the catchy song of "Cover Girl". My God, I love this movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
