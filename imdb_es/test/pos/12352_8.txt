The Pam Grier gun baler takes names and kicks like the heroine in the blaxploitation action game "Sheba Baby" by director William Girdler, co-starring D'Urville Martin and Austin Stoker. "Sheba Baby" is one of the several hard-girl movies in which Grier appeared during the 1970s, such as "Coffy", "Foxy Brown" and "Friday Foster". The short-lived Girdler co-wrote this practice and routine private observation room with producer David Shelton in one night and presents a stubborn female shamus who refuses to trust a man to help her do business. Unfortunately, "Sheba Baby" is not as good as the blaxploitation movies that Grier did under the supervision of director Jack Hill. Hill directed the native African-American of North Carolina in "Coffy", "Foxy Brown", "The Big Bird Cage" and "The Big Doll House". Anyone who analyzes images of African-American women in the cinema should be familiar with these epics. The main problem with "Sheba Baby" is that our heroine has too many convenient breaks. Naturally, the secondary villains are happy kittens who could not hit the side of a barn with a howitzer. As the main antagonist, Dick Merrifield qualifies as a selfish and elegant villain, with lines of choice such as: "Anything worth having is worth stealing." In addition, composer Monk Huggins provides a loud and atmospheric orchestral soundtrack, and the best song, with Barbara Mason warped, is "Good Man Is Gone". "Sheba Baby" presents Grier as Chicago stylist Sheba Shayne. She leaves Windy City to return to her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to help her father. When he arrives in Louisville, Sheba learns that his father, Andy (Rudy Challenger from "Detroit 9000"), is having problems with a local black gangster nicknamed Pilot (cigar D'Urville Martin from "Hammer" de chumping) who demands that Andy sell his loan company to Pilot or die. <br /> <br /> Initially, Pilot sends a squad of thugs to Andy's office, but our heroine's father catches them on the spot. They turn Sheba's father into a punching bag. Interestingly, during the fight scene, Girdler rarely shows fists crushing flesh. Previously, Andy's right hand, Brick Williams (Austin Stoker of "Horror High"), had sent Sheba a telegram requesting him to return to Louisville, but did not receive it immediately thanks to his lazy companion who did not know where to find her. and Sheba are hooked, revive their romantic flames and share a night in the sack. Brick spends most of his time urging Sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity. As a former police officer in Louisville, Kentucky, Sheba prefers to shoot first and then ask questions. After she arrives home, Sheba borrows her father's car and barely escapes when it is blown up. While she goes out the door to get into her father's car, Andy receives another call of harassment from Pilot. Previously, Andy had refused to talk about the possibility of selling his loan company to Pilot, but Andy changed his mind and agreed to speak with the tumult. A satisfied pilot warns Andy about the dynamite that has been connected to his ignition with a delayed-action fuse. In other words, starting the car will not cause the explosion; The explosion comes ten seconds later. Andy and Brick rescue Sheba before the car explodes. Previously, Sheba had agreed to let her father handle his problems without his interference. "Dad, I know you think I'm doing a man's job, but I'm not going to stand by myself just because I'm a woman," Sheba tells him. After his near-death experience, Sheba swears to know who sabotaged his father's car. She deals with an old contact from her days as a police officer and threatens the man with his weapon to extract the information. Only after Sheba has turned the man's face into a bucket of chlorine powder, he gives in and tells him about a reward at the city's railroad museum. Brick accompanies Sheba and the shot occurs with a nervous pilot who moves away from the chin of his chin. <br /> <br /> Later, Pilot sends a quintet of contract thugs out of town, armed to the trash, andy's office. These cannons ignore their orders not to kill. Not only do they shoot at the company's lending office to the tapes, but they also attack Sheba's father with a shotgun. Sheba retaliates in a short time. Holding his nickel-plated revolver, he shoots three of the four assailants Harry the Dirty. The last hitman throws away his weapon and begs for mercy. Sheba has her finger on the trigger when homicide detective Phil Jackson (Charles Kissinger of "Abby") and a uniform cop arrive on the scene. In the hospital, Andy Shayne dies by the hand of his daughter. Naturally, Pilot is furious with this revelation and his fury borders on apoplexy. Afterwards, Sheba traces a money shark, Walker (Christopher Joy, from "Cleopatra Jones"), and takes out information about the pilot while she holds him at gunpoint in a car wash. This is one of the best-prepared scenes with many sinister shots of car wash equipment whirling and buzzing. Walker warns Pilot about Sheba. Pilot and his henchmen face Sheba in a parking lot and exchange lead. Sheba flees on foot to a nearby carnival. While the police cornered one of Pilot's men, she deals with the others. Pilot accidentally shoots one of his own and Sheba runs over him. She holds Pilot to a roller coaster track and threatens to keep him there until the roller coaster cuts her head. Pilot manages to escape after he talks to Sheba's guts about the identity and phone number of the great man, Shark (Dick Merrifield of "The Hellcats"), whose reputation is so immaculate that Detective Jackson describes him as "the guy with everything". the correct answers. "" Sheba Baby "is not the first Pam Grier, but the idea that our heroine can handle everything on her own without the help of the guys makes it interesting and entertaining like a movie for girls.
