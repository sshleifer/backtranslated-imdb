In the tradition of the "neo" films of black cinema like "Chinatown", this film focuses on a crime mystery in a dark realm with a bit of vision of the mixed characters. The typical noir characters from around the world, including the police to prove their worth, a damsel in distress and a bad bad boy. Sharky's Machine gets a 9 out of 10 for its cinematography first, plus its direction, history, strong character performance and excellent jazz score. Available on DVD, although the soundtrack is sold out (but available "used" in some auction sites). Filmed in a location in beautiful downtown Atlanta (the hometown of novelist Diehl) and the clean appearance of the city around 1979 would make an old citizen or visitor from Atlanta a long time before the 12 lanes crisscrossed the city. city, the dream of a cinematographer that moment. This was the first American feature film by Rachel Ward.
