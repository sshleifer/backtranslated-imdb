Finally a real horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I'm a terror fan and I recommend this movie, but it's pretty bloody. I'm not a big fan of the fight, but Kane really took away the whole thing from the monster. I have to admit that I did not want to see this movie, my 17-year-old son dragged me to it, but I'm really glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with the others about all the horror films of remake enough. I think that's why this movie is getting good reviews. It's a refreshing change and takes him back to The Texas Chainsaw (the first), Michael Myers and Jason. And there is no CGI garbage.
