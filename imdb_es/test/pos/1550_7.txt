In a way I liked this Columbo movie, its atmosphere, which was like a real thriller and its approach, sometimes even reminded me of black cinema, in the first 30 minutes of the movie. It's really nice and it's done in a traditional way, with the right camera angles and the use of light. It does not mean instantly that this film is brilliant, but it is solid enough to consider that this is a good entry for the movie Columbo. Definitely, it's a better movie than the movie post Columbo 'later' average. <br /> <br /> 26 years after his previous appearance in the movie Columbo, George Hamilton returns once again to play the lead role opposite Peter Falk, again as the killer. , in a totally different and new role, of course. I liked him in his role and he was a good "villain" of Columbo, who gave the good lieutenant a little good competition. They had some nice sequences together. The problem with Columbo's "modern" new films had always been that he did not have a well-known actor with Peter Falk. This movie obviously does not suffer from this problem. But I must say that this film does not present Peter Falk at his best. Undoubtedly, he has played the character better and his performance is not consistent enough within this film, which is probably also due to the film by its director Daryl Duke, who also directed the really terrible film "Tai-Pan", between many other projects. <br /> <br /> It has a pretty good and nice story, but the fact that the same kind of plot to cover up the murder has been used before in a previous Columbo movie does not help either, of course. It was used before in the 1975 film "Columbo: Playback". However, of course, it also has quite a few "original" moments of its own, although, of course, in essence, each Columbo movie is more or less the same. But hey, that's what made the Columbo series so big and consistent. If it is not broke, do not fix it. <br /> <br /> It is also true that within this movie there are more clues than usual for the lieutenant, which does not mean that the film is his killer. more stupid or careless, but I see it more as writers more enthusiastic than others. It does not make the movie or the story bad and, in fact, it even makes it more pleasant to see Columbo working hard and discovering all kinds of small but important clues. Fortunately, the movie is also full of a fun and funny Columbo comedy. <br /> <br /> It's just a good entry to the Columbo movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
