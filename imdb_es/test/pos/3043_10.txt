I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I have seen it 4 times more since then. I had never heard of that before and I consider myself a connoisseur of classic cinema. A true and polished diamond in the rough. <br /> <br /> This movie jewel revolves around Jon Voight (main character "Conrack") as a young school teacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the children of the islands, all in an Al school. In the beginning, students reveal that they know very little about the world beyond their home on the island. The heart of the film is that Conrack finds inspiration to awaken his young minds to the world around them. Students quickly reward their teacher with an eagerness to learn and a remarkable ability to understand concepts that, a short time before, had been strange to them. Conrack uses unconventional and intelligent teaching techniques that turn out to be, oh, a little fun! God forbid. Learning and fun? Together? It can not be, or so those who are in charge say. To avoid a spoiler, I'll just say that Conrack finds resistance with the boss man ... and the end is really bittersweet. <br /> <br /> I am a 35-year-old white man with some teaching experience, so I should identify myself with the main character, Pat Conroy (also known as Conrack, Mr. Petroy). But I do not, I identify with the black guys. As a child, I was transferred to the school on the other side of the city from 4th to 6th grade, around 1979. These children in the film remind me of my classmates. Fortunately, in 4th grade, when one is 8 or 9 years old, one does not understand racism. I only remember that we were all children, we played at 4 squares, we played ball, we hid and we ran relays. <br /> <br /> This movie is very moving. There are charming and moving moments from beginning to end, non-stop. I often found tears in my eyes, then suddenly laughing out loud. It is a funny movie. <br /> <br /> "Git away from that winda !!" .... "Sir, if you are prepared to accept the garbage, I should tell you that the rabbit did it in your lap." ... "Then, you are the white school teacher, Mr. Conrack. Conrack, you are a good teacher, you are a good white man, "....." wind 15 mph from the east, warning of small boats, small boats, careful, big ships are fine, do not worry for nothing. "..." is not a cook, but Eleanor Roosevelt, not a harvester, but (something Latin) ... that's Latin ... wait! "..." Conrack sings like a frog ... I sing well, what are you talking about? " <br /> <br /> It still baffles me that I still do not hear anything about this movie or that it has very little reputation or followers. I intend to seek more comments, comments, background and "confection" of the things, if they are available. What surprises me is the performance of the children without training. One of the children, Mary, I understand that she was an actress, and you can see it. However, the other children have many genuine lines and reactions. I wonder how they did it! I guess Conrack and Mary had a precise dialogue with which to work, while some of the scenes unfold naturally or improvised. <br /> <br /> Conrack is a special movie. In my opinion, it is one of the few films that are so good and so unknown. Others in that category are King Rat ('65), Dark Passage ('47 with Bogie and Bacall), Gods Must Be Crazy ('80) and Bad Day at Black Rock ('55). I recommend them to everyone. But first, take a seat in Mr. Conrack's class.
