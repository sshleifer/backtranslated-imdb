A direct X file that shows that the action is always equal to the intelligence. The direction of Rob Bowman is clear and crisp, the episode seems as fresh now as it was almost a decade ago. David and Gillian offer excellent performances and both seem to enjoy the lack of luggage: it is an independent X file that even non-fans could find and enjoy. Junior Brown gives both leaders a run for their money during their scene with them, it's so convincing that you could believe that the crew drove to the center of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to. Bryan Cranston is intense and energetic like Patrick Crump. Since then, he has admitted in interviews that he knew almost nothing about the X Files before this role, a fact that makes his performance on the track even more incredible. A brilliantly silly episode.
