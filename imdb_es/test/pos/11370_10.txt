I saw this miniseries when I was in high school. I remember it as absolutely brilliant and convincing. At that time, I did not know any of the British actors in the series, but since then I learned that some of the stars of today performed in it, including Sean Connery (the original James Bond among many other roles), Judi Dench (the Queen Elizabeth in "Shakespeare in Love" among many other roles) and Eilene Atkins (probably best known for creating "Upstairs / Downstairs", but also excellent in many acting roles). Like the other commentator, I would like to see him again. I am sure that the production remains timeless, and I hope it has been released on VHS or DVD. If you have the opportunity to see it, do not miss it.
