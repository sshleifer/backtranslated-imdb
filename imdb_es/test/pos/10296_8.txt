Forget about the recent American remake that unfortunately tarnished the reputation of the French original under the director's participation in both. This is a romantic noir of the 90s with many twists and turns. It works better like a Gallic ode to the back window of Hitchcock, because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that triggers the intricate script. The story is made in a surprising way, like a Picasso painting, which offers multiple perspectives on the same event and requires the participation of the viewer at all times. The settings, the music and the unforgettable music are wonderful, as well as the excellent contributions of the cast. Watch it more than once.
