I was 9 when I first saw him on television. on a Friday night. I remember the announcement of the full page in the television guide with the image of the Rex. It's amazing how some things stay in your mind after 30 years. Anyway, if you're a kid who likes monster movies, this is entertaining enough, especially with Boone and Keats enraging each other. The special effects are not harryhausen, but it's worth the hour and a half if you find it somewhere on the nightly television. I have not seen it in some years for some reason, these classics fade away from cable television. If you catch him late at night, do not be too critical, just grab a few sandwiches and enjoy it. It may be corny, but I thought it was much better than the kong remake that came out in theaters a year earlier.
