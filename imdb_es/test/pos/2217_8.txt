"Half Empty" is a musical hilarious about the eternal optimist in this case, a self-help writer who goes to Germany mistakenly thinking that he is popular there. Instead of an audience of adoration, he finds himself adrift in a world of jaded misanthropes, including the woman who is supposed to be his publicist. His attempts to make friends in scenes that are largely improvised lead to one great encounter after another when he is verbally abused by nihilist musicians, abrupt gangsters, etc. With time, she manages to win over her publicist, both she and her. The heart and his mind, but his own vision of the world is shaken when his hero, a much more popular self-help writer, turns out not to be what he seems. The action is marked by several musical numbers. <br /> <br /> We saw this at the DeadCenter Film Festival in Oklahoma City and we were impressed. This is a really fun and inspired small-scale indie production. You could discuss some technical things (like lighting, which is a bit dark) but the piece is fun and inspired enough so you do not care too much. If Voltaire were writing "Candid" today, the character would be a self-help writer.
