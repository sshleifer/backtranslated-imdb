Well, I enjoyed this movie, although sometimes it becomes too stereotypical. I did not understand at this time if the "Punishment Park" has existed in the past, but I think the issue is not really here. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie in a different way. Show how much violence you can find in our world. It reminds us that we live in a world led by violence and that no one can escape from it. If someone refuses to "assume their responsibilities", he will be expelled from our society ... All our history is made by wars, we must never forget this. In fact, it is only when we finally accept the truth that, perhaps, we will change and understand that our "intellectual abilities" have improved. So we could use them to find other ways to solve our problems. <br /> <br /> In 2 words, this movie is a must see, it may help us to accept the truth ...
