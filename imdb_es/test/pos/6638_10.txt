This film offers one of the best experiences available to moviegoers. In no way is it a pleasant movie, but it offers realities and emotions that the human mind never intended to touch. It opens paths in the way an individual thinks, and then changes the person forever. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was in class, and immediately after seeing it I had to skip my next class and walk around the campus to re-establish my body and my mind. I felt devastated and, somehow, unreal, as if it did not exist. It was only a few months later when I told one of my friends about SHAME, and she asked me: "Oh, is it when you were wrong after seeing it and you found me talking very strangely?" I did not even remember running or talking to anyone while I was out that day, I was surprised. <br /> <br /> In terms of the plot, it is the simple tale of a couple torn apart by war. There the suffering is greater than that of the dead and in the end ... there are no words to complete the image created by Bergman. It's like a horrible dream that makes you wake up, altering your own reality forever. This movie must be seen.
