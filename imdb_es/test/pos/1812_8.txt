For the most part, romantic movies were never my cup of tea. But Valley Girl is one of the few romantic movies that I could not only see, but I really enjoy. Nicholas Cage is excellent in his first role and Deborah Foreman is an amazing person. There are some secondary stories that tend to get confused, but not enough to diminish this movie.
