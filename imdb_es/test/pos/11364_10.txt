In 1961, this series was shown on local television here in Southern California. I and many others have been asking the BBC for a tape or a DVD since then. Now, suddenly, here it is on Amazon. I pre-ordered in January and now here on March 30 arrived. It was a long wait (48 years). It was worth it? So far I just saw Richard II (I only have the DVD from 2 o'clock) and I can say YES! It's worth the wait. The acting, the direction and the production are excellent and even better than I remember. The production is in B & W, but somehow it fits. The video is clear and very good, the sound is impeccable. One more proof of how timeless Shakespeare really is. <br /> <br /> I gave this 10 stars even if I only saw 1 of the 8 works. I am sure that when I have seen all of them, I will change my rating to at least 12. <br /> <br /> It is currently available in Amazon (US Region 1) at a reasonable price. <br /> <Br /> I'd better stop now so I can see again. The next one is Henry IV, part 1 of which is my favorite Shakespeare play.
