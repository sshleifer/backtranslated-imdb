This is probably one of the best French films I've seen in a long time! This "pastiche" or parody of spy movies is very well done and will make you laugh from beginning to end. Some references to the world today are very subtle. The entire Moroccan context of the film should be understood in light of today's French culture / environment. That said, all the jokes and, apparently, shocking comments that could have been understood as such due to this context, are allowed and accepted because this is a parody. <br /> <br /> My sisters who had already seen this movie told me that I should also go and they assured me that I would have a great time, and in fact I had! If you liked the old 007 movies with Sean Connery and you also like movies like Airplane or Hot Shots, you'll be delighted. I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the United States ... Wait and see.
