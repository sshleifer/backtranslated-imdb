Oh, I remember seeing this show at 4:00 p.m. during my high school days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember seeing it when I did my homework. <br /> <br /> Even so, the program caught my attention when Alex showed his special powers and dealt with typical high school problems. <Br /> <br /> But the show was not all about adventures and special powers; It was more an educational effort for a younger audience to be more interested in school and biology in general. <br /> <br /> The main actress (I can not remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered fantastic performance. She made the show visible. <br /> <br /> They just do not do shows like this anymore ...
