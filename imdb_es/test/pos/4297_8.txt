I wish there were more movies about middle-aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of the moral road of life make an interesting observation. It seems that there is a different judgment criterion for women who have extramarital relationships than for men. The hurtful and humiliating behavior of Amy Watson towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the papers and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards man. If she found her husband bored and critical, she could have told him, left, and waited for a large financial settlement after the divorce. The scenes of the country and of London are marvelously authentic and rich, while the autumnal climate adds to the melancholic background. The ending is perfect, so in tune with real adult life.
