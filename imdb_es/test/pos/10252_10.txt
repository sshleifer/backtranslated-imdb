Cooley High was actually a drama with moments of comedy. It was a reflection of the school life of yesteryear. I attended Coolidge High in Washington, DC from 1976 to 1979 and much of what was at Cooley High was something that was done every day at Coolidge. In fact, after the movie, everyone started calling Coolidge "Cooley High." By getting high, throwing dice, chasing girls, basement parties and fights, that sums up high school life for many in the California era. I can not forget Motown because Motown music started and ended many days ago in the 70s. The blows kept coming. However, Cooley High adds a layer of humanity over madness because when everything was said and done as in Cooley High, my classmates and I had a lot of love for each other. And like the Cooley High characters, there was life after high school, but there was nothing like waking up each morning and experiencing each day to the fullest from the classroom to the seventh period. Thirty years later we are preparing to celebrate those good times. Cooley High is definitely a piece of the time that simply improves over time because I like it or not the only thing that remains of those days are the memories, some good and some bad.
