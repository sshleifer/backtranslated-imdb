I was going to use 'The German Scream' as a summary, but that was already taken lol. It summarizes the anatomy very well. As long as you are not oblivious to subtitle reading, Anatomy fits perfectly with the Scream / Urban Legend package. It is a horror game for teenagers in a medical school where the students disappear and then become subjects of experimentation in the dissection laboratory. Ask a brave student to investigate herself and discover a giant conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Whenever I'm watching the original movie in German (I can not comment on the dubbing, I have not seen the English edition). Written and ready so that the tension never stops. Compared to its American counterparts, the mystery is discovered much faster, which means that, instead of being a slasher until the final revelation, Anatomy evolves during the time that elapses, from a horror movie slasher eats body to a thriller intelligent and exciting. It is an exciting journey from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the actors involved as well. Franka Potente proves once again that she is an intelligent and intelligent actress who can make any role come alive. Her central performance as Paula is an excellent base to build the film. The eerie lecturers and their teachers' pets are equally good, a presumptuous presence at all times. <br /> <br /> It is also surprising that the film does not drag much. The pace is fast and strong, very similar to the previous urban legend, which means that there is always something to keep your attention high. If there is a drawback, it might be that some people think that Anatomy is too frightening for them, but if you persevere with the graphic dissection sequences of the first half, the second part with its thrilling connotations of suspense will reward you. I recommend Anatomy to anyone who enjoys a good teenage horror, but is a bit tired of American opinion on the subject.
