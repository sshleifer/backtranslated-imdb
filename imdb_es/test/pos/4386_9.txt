I have seen almost all the Coen brothers' movies now, and I must say that this is one of their best films. I would not dare say it's better than "The Big Lebowski", but it was very good in its own right. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought the story was very interesting and fun. I loved all the characters, especially Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete). <br /> <br /> There's really nothing bad I can say about this movie, but this movie is not for everyone. It could be safe to say that if you liked the films of the other Coen brothers, I hope you like this too. And if you liked what you saw in the trailer, I think you'll like the movie, but do not restrain me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope you like (d) the movie as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
