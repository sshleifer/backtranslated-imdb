Finally, I had the opportunity to install and compare the two versions of this film that is currently being played: first, the old and malicious imitation of Embassy VHS called SCREAMERS, and then a new Italian DVD completely restored from the new favorite media company of everyone. It is not a shame of Italy. <br /> <br /> The American ads about "men turned inside out" is how they all say, totally deceptive, and indicative of a Roger Cormanized take of what would otherwise be a fantasy and adventure thriller Superior for adults. The full Italian version is a fairly extensive, well-designed and deliberately developed version on "Isla del Dr. Moreau", and there's nothing wrong with that. It is a sumptuous and beautiful Euro Horror event with brain, good conspiracy, character development, location shot, period costume and sets, etc. <br /> <br /> But I must admit that the 14-year-old knuckle grass blower is still lurking somewhere inside me, it gave a stronger kick to the more rugged, sordid and sloppy Roger Corman version, which it has a bit of gore on top, a striking but absurd opening segment, and then most of Martino's original film, although a little abbreviated make room for Roger's entertainment idea. The pace was somewhat faster, the sequences of shock closer together, and it looks as much fantastic form of Mrs. Bach as in the extended Italian version. <br /> <br /> I still do not have much of an However, there is an idea about what concerns the specific story: there are a number of twists in the plot and incidental characters that were somewhat difficult to follow. A subparcel of local voodoo did not help much, and it's funny how it all culminates in a fight between the shipwrecked nobleman and the mad scientist ... It may take a little more visits. I'll say this: movie fans should take advantage of one of these PAL imports and take a look at what is really a movie instead of just another old and grim homemade video. The compositions of the panoramic screen shots once again reveal that Martino had an eye. For filling your screen with interesting things. Nobody gets their heads off as in the SCREAMERS print, but it's still interesting, and once again proof that, while their standards may have been more or less confined in the area around the gutter, Roger Corman was very Funny when he did it. for him, and from side to side, these are actually better movies than they had to be. <br /> <br /> 7/10
