The 80s were surpassed by all those HALLOWEEN horror movies / Friday THE 13th, so this is a relief. <br /> <br /> Ten incredibly annoying teenagers (would you like to hang out with these idiots ?!) decide to throw a Halloween party in an old local funeral parlor called "Hull House". During a "past life session", a demon is accidentally released, and each person becomes possessed and kills others. <br /> <br /> This all sounds VERY BAD DEAD / DEMONS, but Tenney lends certain direction style to the procedures, there are some good one-line phrases, the music is excellent, the Steve Johnson FX prosthetic makeup gives fear and Linnea Quigley is quite funny as a crazy bimbo for the guys who pokes the eyeballs with his fingers and makes a new and amazing thing with a tube of lipstick! <br /> <br /> Great fun at an obvious level! After reviewing the breakdown of the vote and the other published reviews, I do not understand how it only received 4 out of 10 (?!) <br /> <br /> I give it, 8 out of 10.
