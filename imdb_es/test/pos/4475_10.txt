What an amazing story and what a beautiful movie! We said goodbye to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so easily and yet so forcefully. I saw him hypnotized, almost holding his breath as the story unfolded towards its inexorable end. The execution of this film was almost perfect: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us to understand the strange Platonic bond, absolute, therefore, possessive between two creatures that do not pretend to be part of the other's world. Both are capable of affection, but, ironically, it is the "most evolved" that becomes dependent and possessive, unable to accept the freedom of the other. It is one of the most intriguing and intriguing aspects of the many forms of love, and an incredible study of how human love, oppressive and destructive, can sometimes be. <br /> <br /> Only a rudimentary mind would associate this story with any kind of bestiality.
