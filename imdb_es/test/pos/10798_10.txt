When you think of 'Oliver Stone', the films that come to mind would be his biggest and most controversial films, such as Platoon, JFK, Born on the Fourth of July or Natural Born Killers. Talk about radio usually does not. It's a pretty small movie, actually. More than half of the movie takes place with Barry Champlain at his radio station speaking into his microphone. But believe me, this is one of Oliver Stone's best movies and you should NOT miss it. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a character study. Barry Champlain is a rude, self-destructive and risk-taking radio show host. He says too many things and starts to have problems with his boss, his lover (s), his fans and even some Nazis. He does not like his audience or the callers and many of them do not like it (whether he likes it or not, but they have no idea why). But, in the end, he says on his show: "I think we're stuck with each other." <br /> <br /> Watch Talk Radio, even if you do not like Oliver Stone movies. You would be surprised. Surely it was. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
