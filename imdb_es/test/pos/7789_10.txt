I love this movie. The representation of Shehzad Khan as Bhalla a.k.a. "Shut up, Robert!" He was so hilarious Every time he was hit during a fight scene, you could hear him scream. Viju Khote is the stupefied Robert a.k.a. "Rabbit". I love that Shakti Kapoor a.k.a. "Crime Master Gogo". The double role of Paresh Rawal is incredibly hilarious for his portrayal of Ramgopal Bajaj and Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother does a very good imitation of Bhalla saying. "Relax, PLEASE relax." I love the scene in which Aamir Khan puts a laxative in the food of Kman "Muscles" of Salman, which caused the irregular intestines to force him to use the toilet innumerable times.
