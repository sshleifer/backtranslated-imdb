This bittersweet slice of magical realism had a history of checkered production (the director / writer was replaced) and accumulated at the box office, but it is a tremendous movie. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are preadolescent brothers whose scaly Mama (Lorraine Bracco) lives in a shack with a petty alcoholic (Adam Baldwin). During his battles with alcohol, Baldwin physically abuses Mazzello and manipulates him to remain silent about his situation. But when Wood delves into what's happening, the guys come together and create a fantastic solution to Mazzello's devastating dilemma. <br /> <br /> I love movies that mix fantasy and dark reality. They rarely have financial success ("Lawn Dogs" is a similar example), but they are usually original and intriguing. <br /> <br /> The Baldwin drunk is shot from the child's perspective and his head is cut deliberately. under the top of the frame. This device allows us to judge him purely by his actions and as a totally physicalized beast. Both Wood and Mazzello are excellent, and drag us effortlessly into their dark and terrifying world. <br /> <br /> The "radio brochure" of the title is a small red wagon in which children transport their belongings. Here it transports a Dream. <br /> <br /> Seriously interesting things.
