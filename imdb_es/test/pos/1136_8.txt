When I first heard about "Greek", I thought I would see it because it sounded ridiculous. Another of the ABC Family shows that are so bad are almost good. But tuning in with a friend from the university, we both found ourselves enjoying the pilot episode much more than we expected. <br /> <br /> As a member of a Greek society, I can say that many of the stereotypes that are mentioned are those that appear almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and brotherhoods on a campus. And they are also very fun to play alone at home, let alone to watch on a TV screen. The opening scene evidenced a slightly dramatized version of the preparation for a real formal career in some brotherhoods and continued from there. <br /> <br /> This is not a show for Greeks too sensitive. If you offend even in jokes about things that are not so good about Greek life, then you will spend the entire first episode, and probably many others, shrinking and screaming. But everyone else should have a lot of fun watching him. It's nothing new, but when it comes to college, nothing is ever.
