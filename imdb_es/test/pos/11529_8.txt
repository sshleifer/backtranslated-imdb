If I look with enough attention, you can find flaws in this movie, mainly with the script. I found Wolf's character not totally convincing. However, those were my only "complaints". Because when this movie started on Cable, I was just going to record it and watch it later. However, from the beginning, with the spooky music and Cameron Diaz doing his dance of the 60's, I was fascinated. I never got up until the movie ended. It seemed like I did not even blink. <br /> <br /> The performance of Cameron DÃ­az and Jordana Brewster was excellent. The scenes were beautiful, the girls were beautiful and the music was disturbing and very touching. The story was quite unique and, at times, it had a surreal quality. The viewer will like the image more if he had a good understanding of the mood of young people in the 60s and 70s, especially in the United States. Many of the scenes basically managed to show something from that era that is difficult to pin down. It was a bit more complicated than the simplistic claim that they wanted to change the world and ended up disappointed, although that might be the most obvious aspect. Phoebe learns more and more about this as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> One aspect that does not seem to be covered by the other reviewers who might mention, is the way in which the two daughters seem to go through life after the death of their father. They had both adored him, and his presence had been a stabilizing factor in their lives and obviously he had loved them deeply. Today we read a lot about children who lose their parents too soon, only to get lost in their way. This film covers the domino effect of the loss of the father in the daughters left behind, first in the older sister Faith and then in her younger sister. His mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents. This type of dynamics is not covered in almost any other film, especially in so many different layers of plot and subframe. The internal struggles of reality against Phoebe's perceptions gradually come off like layers of an onion. <br /> <br /> Speaking of plot, this movie should be higher than here. I kept waiting for a big conspiracy to be discovered regarding Faith's death. The way she resolved herself surprised me, even if others had guessed much earlier. <br /> <br /> Maybe not for everyone, but I could watch this movie many, many times.
