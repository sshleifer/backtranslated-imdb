Do not Torture to Duckling is an absolutely impressive deviation from giallo for Lucio Fulci. Unlike other heavyweights of subgenres like Mario Bava and Dario Argento, Fulci adopts a decidedly gritty, grounded and socially perceptive approach to Giallo's narrative in this film. There is nothing glamorous about the murders of children and borderline pedophilia (a brave sub-plot for 1972), and Fulci wisely shoots with a serious and lugubrious eye, avoiding flashes, melodrama and histrionics of direction. The procedures are punctuated by bloody and instantly sensational pieces that are further reinforced by Fulci's discordant sense of realism. The deeply disturbing scene of the "murder of witches" in particular, with its blatant brutality, feels like a snuff film. The composer Riz Ortolani groups these scenes full of butchers with fierce explosions of reverberant strings. <br /> <br /> The film is crowned by a simultaneous, lyrical and violent conclusion, in which theology, morale, fanaticism and superstition clash. It is a deeply effective ending that has the ability to leave the spectator in a stupor of a stunned and disarmed body. <br /> <br /> Fulci could not have chosen a better location for this movie. Photograph of Do not Torture to Duckling in the ancient city of Matera, Italy. As Matera continues to modernize to this day (highlighted by its shift from an agricultural to an industrial economy), it is grappling with its UNESCO-sponsored reputation as a receptacle for mysterious Paleolithic ghosts. The concerns of the real-life Materani are reflected in the characters of the film, who, wearing their Christianity on their sleeves, confront with frustration any tradition of exotic fringes (namely, witchcraft) that moves away from the norm. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Matera was also used as a substitute for Jerusalem in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. In any case, this adds even more power to Fulci's message. Catholic guilt and creepy murders are such a resonant combination.
