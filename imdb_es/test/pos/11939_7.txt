- The Best Bit: When the bored mobster (Nicholas Turturro) screams at the fugitive (Matthew Modine) "Shane! Shane come back!" and when the older boy asks "What are you doing?" He simply repeats "Enjoying my time!" Actually like me at the moment! <br /> <br /> - The most spooky part: I've been asking myself all the time to see: where did I see that girl before? where ? where ? Until I found out about the final credits ... OH MY GOD! She is (Elizabeth Berkley) .. Of the fiasco of the dancers! But I just could not recognize her with her clothes on! In fact, I felt a brief tremor. She is really cute and nice, but maybe Hollywood did not have pity at all! <br /> <br /> - The sexiest bit: when (Berkley) says "Do you mean the material that gives you a boner?". <br /> <br /> - The most boring thing: The assistant delayed after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end !!, in addition, the Mexican smuggler received 3 bullets (in the same car!) and he is not dead either ??? <br /> <br /> - The ugliest thing: All those people killed, as well as the numerous (F) pupils in a boring degree! <br /> <br /> - The most beautiful: The intelligent and crazy script with all the funny characters and the tumultuous situations, the performance was also very good especially (Paul Rodriguez), who stole the program (since he had the best dialogue too!). <br /> <br /> - The most disappointing thing: although the direction did not affect at all the ingenuity of the story, but at the same time it did not give a unique touch, an incomparable signature, some kind of madness Hilarity like that of the history itself. However, maybe the low production mistreated him well! And, of course, the simple and insipid music that could be like that because of the cheap production too. <br /> <br /> - The most confusing part: (Matthew Modine) is a talented guy, but what exactly did he do to be out of Hollywood's "A" star list? What could be what he did (or did not do) to end up in an independent and light joke like (The Shipping)? <br /> <br /> - The most absent scene: Where did (Jos√©) the Mexican smuggler finally go? I thought we would see it again at the end, smuggling once more like the little surviving criminal who, in a brief trick like this, could materialize the continuous disorder of such a world. <br /> <br /> - The biggest question I had after the end: When will we see (The shipment - 2)? How I am so eager to see again that fine and small comic atmosphere of Hurly Burly! <br /> <br /> These were my own answers.
