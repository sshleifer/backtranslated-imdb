What often threatens to turn into a careless, disheveled drama about misunderstood middle-class youths ends up in a surprisingly shady and subdued film by John Frankenheimer (the first, although he started on television, directing among other things an earlier version of this screenplay) . <br /> <br /> We are still in those semi-mythical 50s when the teenagers were driving jalopies and the jeans were still swarming. James MacArthur (the adopted son of playwright Charles and actress Helen Hayes, and then enters pop culture as Danno of Hawaii 5-0) gets involved in a minor incident in a movie theater that escalates to throw a blow to the Manager (Whit Bissell) and booked at the police station. His father (James Daly), a great movie producer receives the call, does not listen to the version of his son's story, and pulls the strings to get it out. <br /> <br /> But MacArthur still has a chip on his shoulder, which even his nice mother (Kim Hunter) can not tear down. Things get worse at the Coldwater Canyon farm until MacArthur, trying to vindicate himself, represents a repeat of the original incident ... <br /> <br /> Does not the film avoid attitudes? and clich√©s ?? of his time, but he presents them with a considerable nuance: each character receives an honorable audience; each point of view has its merits (and the reactions to the film will depend on what the viewers contribute). There are flaws (the word "unpleasant", a standard rebellious euphemism of the era, used about 30 times too often) but are outweighed by its strengths. The film benefits from a strong cast (the most notable of which is the excellent actor James Gregory, as a police detective) and a decidedly non-exploitative way to tell his story. From a vantage point in the new millennium, the hot water that MacArthur is in may seem a little warm, but The Young Stranger remains honest and honorable. <br /> <br />
