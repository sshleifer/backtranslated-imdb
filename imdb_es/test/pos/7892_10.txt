22. JOE (drama, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a factory racist worker who is known to hate "hippies and babysitters". Meet Bill, a businessman who has just murdered the lover of his drug-addicted daughter, Jill (Susan Sarandon). Jill escapes and joins a hippie commune on the outskirts of the city. Bill turns to Joe for help. Their search takes them through the most sordid parts of the city, where both the inner hatred and hatred of men are more tested. <br /> <br /> Criticism: This was the first major campaign of director John G. Avildsen (an incredible career that included: 'Rocky', 'The Karate Kid', 'Split-Image', 'Weekend in Bernie's house '). The film is interesting enough, as it served to summarize the themes and ideas of the turbulent 60s (Vietnam War, black power, lib for women, etc.). He also has a good performance of Peter Boyle as Joe, one of the first film antiheroes. It has always been good to play creepy and bossy heavy whose abstract ideas are reinforced by their intimidating presence (I would play Frankenstein's monster in the parody of Mel Brook, Young Frankenstein). It reminds me of a small child trapped in a large, stupid and clumsy body. The movie has a weak script (the meeting of Joe and Bill, for example, is a bit casual), but it has a particularly gruesome ending, after the taxi driver. <br /> <br /> APPOINTMENT: Song title: "I saw a guy who sold scrap to children, he gets nervous every time he passes because he knows that if I catch him, I'll kick his head and kick his fat to $ $.
