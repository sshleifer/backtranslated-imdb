I wish Hollywood made more movies like The China Syndrome. Because it scores at all levels. <br /> <br /> He has an intelligent, credible writing. It shows that not only the nuclear power itself, but the money involved in it, is what causes danger. And the movie also gives you an excellent picture of how television is made. <br /> <br /> It scores like a thriller: the first time I saw it, it kept me right on the edge of my seat. And it counts as a movie of characters: I really got interested in the main characters. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilford Brimley and, above all, Jack Lemmon are great.
