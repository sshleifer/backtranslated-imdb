Jean Dujardin represses the gestures of Connery: the adjustment of the twins to enter a club while all women turn to admire him, the carefree straightening and smoothing of the tie, the overwhelming and risky. It's weird, and you realize that part of Bond in the sixties was Connery's creation and not really Ian Fleming's character. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is a nod to those first films, the film takes off mainly from Russia With Love and Thunderball. The main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is, not only in terms of sexism, but also of nationalism and colonialism, and how he sticks his nose in when he is sent to Egypt. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect: about 20 minutes seems like a joke movie and some fragments of it remind us of the parodies of the day, of which there were many. The intelligence men of Morcecambe and Wise had suspicious-looking men in Fez who were also following their heroes, and that is going back a bit. Unlike Sellers' Clouseau or Barat Cohen's Borat, Dujardin does not give his character that layer of reality or genuine pathos: he's too busy perfecting his Connery manners. It does not do enough with the credits or a great song, and there is no funny or serious villain, like Dr. Evil by Mike Myers or the nemesis of Naked Gun by Ricardo Montalban, for the hero to face. <br /> <br /> But the scene in which OSS117 wakes up in Cairo one morning made me laugh out loud in the empty three-room cinema, and everything looks wonderful, plus, you will never have the opportunity to see the Operation Kid Brother on the screen, and Women are crumpet, really hot. It is a parody of Bond without falling into the routine of the mad scientist / Ken Adam or fun gadgets. Highly recommended.
