The talents of Abbott and Costello shine in the happily childish version of "Jack and the Beanstalk." The use of tone and sepia color, music and choreography, song and dance, the crossing of players from one role to another, as well as several other aspects of this excellent film, make it evident that the techniques and styles used for "The Wizard of Oz" is playing with here. And that works well for our intrepid duo. There are other things involved that make this movie a pleasure for me ... Buddy Baer, ​​Max Baer Jr., from the uncle of "The Beverly Hillbillies", who appears as the policeman and the giant. Pat Costello, Lou's brother, having participated in the writing of the script. These things help make this movie fun. It has, however, has its downside. I think the choreography is wrong. But the cute melodies and the voices that accompany it help to detract from the rather careless dance numbers. Some of the players, the couple in love (prince and princess) to be precise, are not very good at their trade. But these things are a small price to pay for an otherwise pleasant walk through the yellow brick ... er, I mean ... climb the bean.
