Hitchcock made at least 11 films about the common man, wrongly accused in the race (sometimes really running, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control, being the first "The 39 Steps", which really He did Popular in Britain. It really is your distinctive theme. <br /> <br /> Others include "Young and Innocent", "Saboteur", "Spellbound", "Stage Fight", "Strangers on a Train", "I Confess", "To Catch a Thief", " The Wrong Man "," North by Northwest ", and finally" Frenzy ". "Saboteur" begins Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, a worker at an aircraft plant during the war, accused of murdering his co-worker and best friend during an act of sabotage at the plant. He meets model Patricia Martin, played by the actress Priscilla Lane, during his escape from the law, and then, of course, the various Nazi / fascist sympathizers along the way. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is mainly like "The 39 Steps", which includes similar plot devices like wives, the blonde who does not trust the main character at the beginning, a race across the country (in a case from London to Scotland and in the other from California to New York), and meet the "colorful" locals along the way. And so, like "The man who knew too much," I think this is a new American version of one of Hitchcock's previous works. <br /> <br /> I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he presents himself as a very common character. American, a kind of "common man" with whom the public can identify. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is more involved in the action than Madeline Carroll in "The 39 Steps" and Ruth Roman in "Strangers on a Train". However, as mentioned elsewhere, Otto Kruger steals the show as the villain. I also liked the performance of Vaughan Glaser as the blind uncle; Your lines are great. There are some funny touches along the way for comic relief, such as traffic signs with the character of Priscilla Lane in them, and circus performers, and the truck driver, Murray Alper. Contrary to other opinions here, there are not too many characters that create Barry Kane's innocence immediately. <br /> <br /> There are some slow parts, mainly when the action moves to New York, but it recovers quickly when the last planned act of the fifth column is set in motion. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite Hitchcock movies (I put it in my top 5), especially in these days of the new war on terrorism. I think he comes home. <br /> <br /> Makes you think: "Could my co-worker be involved in something bad?" In fact, one of the posters of the movie "Saboteur" proclaimed "Beware of the man behind your back!" Imagine how that played in the minds of adults during World War II.
