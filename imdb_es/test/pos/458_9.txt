Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, this story has all the suspense of a good book or movie of the Cold War when a multinational group of foreigners tries to smuggle Jason Robards from Hungary to Austria. However, three things complement the story, making this an extremely good movie. <br /> <br /> First, the actors use the real languages ​​of their roles. Russian soldiers speak only Russian; the Hungarians only Hungarians; Germans are only Germans, except in the minimum measure to tell the story. As Debra Kerr is English, she only speaks English, and, of course, Yul Brynner and some others who are essential to the story also speak English with a lot of accent. As a result, the empathy of the audience towards travelers becomes paramount. The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when he can not understand any of the languages ​​spoken around him. The audience awakens very powerful feelings and, despite the intensive use of foreign languages, the public is never lost by following the film. No subtitles are needed. <br /> <br /> Second. I was in Hungary in 1995, and I tell you that this movie is right. From the gypsy music that dominates the dinner to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place in the village scenes, the realism is incredible. If I did not eat at the actual restaurant of the movie, I ate at its double. I thought I was actually walking down the main street of that town. (Actually, the film was shot in Austria). Third, and more importantly, this film brings together Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after The King and I) and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is Nothing less than Oscar qualified. Of course, Yul already received an Oscar for playing that relationship, so the Academy was not going to give him another, but that's the quality of the film. Do not miss it.
