The first time I saw the opening of Otto Preminger's "Porgy and Bess" on TV, probably sometime in the early 80's, and my younger self found it a bit slow, despite the timeless music. I turned it off <br /> <br /> last night, an improvised and extremely rare print, projected at Cinemateca L.A. and it was a bit revealing. The performances are strong and memorable. Dorothy Dandridge brings a lot of vulnerability, strength and subtle eroticism (at least by current standards) to her part. It is said that Sidney Poitier is uncomfortable with the film, but his performance is excellent, like Pearl Bailey. Even better are Sammy Davis as Sportin 'Life, as a loving cat, and Brock Peters, as the villanious Crown. <br /> <br /> Still, I am not a fan of previous Preminger, lead, and much easier to see - "carmen jones". Porgy and Bess "is far superior to that less controversial film, although that may have to do with the fact that the original material is also far superior. <br /> <br /> As you saw last night, this is a robust material but far from perfect work, not all moments come to life, and there is some discomfort in the way the film combines the stylized set of Catfish Row (beautifully done by Oliver Smith) with the actual locations, and even for my ear. untrained Some short parts of the score seem to be too popular. <br /> <br /> In addition, while this does not detract from the achievement of the filmmakers, Preminger's decision to film almost entirely in wide shots, without first shots and occasional medium shots, no doubt, can not be seen on the TV "panned and scanned" and can condemn it even on widescreen DVD if you get the restoration you deserve.In smaller screens, we can not distinguish The details are crucial to the way Preminger organized the film. <br /> <br /> Also, the mi x heard last night was strange. Many of the voices, particularly in the opening "Summertime" seemed excessively soft and were overwhelmed by instrumental music. Maybe this can be solved in a restoration. <br /> <br /> There is the theme of the film's racial politics. Personally, I do not see anything wrong with it, at least in a contemporary context. At the time that so few films showed strong African-American characters, this might have seemed an unfortunate choice for a big-budget Hollywood movie. And, although there may not be much "empowerment" here, these are recognizable human beings that are not racial stereotypes. These are operatic characters who make bad decisions because that is what the tragic characters do. That alone made it a great step forward at that time. <br /> <br /> In a modern context where strong and heroic African-American characters are less rare (although they are not yet common enough), these characters do not seem to be more or less than human They could really be poor and uneducated people of any ethnic origin. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the thorny politics, the original work is undoubtedly one of the great achievements of American music and (secondly) theater. Poitier, Davis, Dandridge, Peters and, yes, Pearl Bailey, were all amazing artists that we will never see again. This less than perfect but still solid film clearly deserves to be seen and treasured.
