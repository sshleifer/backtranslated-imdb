I thought anywhere, but here was a good movie. It is starring two wonderful actresses, Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman, who when I heard that they were in a movie together, I refuse to see her. In general, it was a very nice movie. He had moments. where I felt like they had tried so hard, and there was also really exaggerated and worn material, but there was nothing in the movie that I absolutely hated. I even liked the way they used the emerging performance of the movie. Thora Birch uncredited, and all the little happy / sad moments are touching and effective. If you want to see this movie, go ahead, because although I do not recommend it, it's not something you should avoid and it seems a 5.9 rating. unfair in my opinion
