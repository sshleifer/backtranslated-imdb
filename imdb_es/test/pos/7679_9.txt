I watched the movie at its original premiere in Austin, Texas. The old Paramount Theater (I do not know if it still exists) was filled with speakers around the walls connected precisely to the six channels. At 15 years of age, I was impressed. The concept of surround sound was completely foreign to music and cinema at that time. <br /> <br /> I vividly remember at least three outstanding scenes where the surround sound had a great impact. (Although, please, forgive me if time has distorted my memories with inaccuracies). The first was a camera trip through Catfish Row, I live with the sites and sounds of daily activity. You saw each one first, like a blacksmith, for example, then, when the camera passed them by their sound, you would continue to hear going to the left or the right along the side of the theater backwards. The second was a music band that was first seen on the front, then passed in front of the camera dividing to the left and right. Not only did the sound of each instrument follow its own directional path, but it also changed in the timbre as it played towards you, to one side and then away from you. And if that was not enough, they also explained the Doppler effect for each instrument as it progressed. The third scene was near the end of the movie when Porgy leaves Catfish Row in New York to search for Bess. He and almost half of the cast members go before the camera when they leave town with the same sound effects as the band. The other half of the cast / choir sings along with them and also greets and dismisses Porgy and his other friends. The responses of friends can be heard from the sides and back. <br /> <br /> The surround sound was used with splendid effects throughout the film. I think I remember a stone or something thrown from a dock and listening to it land in the water behind me. Small things like that were obvious to the theatergoers who were lucky enough to have all six channels, things that would simply seem mundane in the theaters without it. <br /> <br /> I stayed at the theater during several presentations. You could do that then. And I went back several more times before I left the city. I never saw the movie again. Literally, it BEGINS its DVD release with restored image fidelity and surround sound. I hope someone somewhere has kept it. Please, Gershwin family, allow it to be released before it is lost for other generations.
