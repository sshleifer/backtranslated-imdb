I saw him tonight with moderate expectations: if Tartan Films has noticed something and is publishing it, that's usually a good sign, however, I'm not usually a fan of Julie Walters, I do not usually like his roles Comedy (I'm sorry for any fan, but it's personal, I just do not find it funny in comedy). <br /> <br /> Although it was great - a great performance by everyone, but Grint and Walters are exceptional! A lot of laughter, a lot of pathos, a great timing and a wonderful rhythm movie; A coming of age film would not normally be something I would expect to like but I can not recommend it enough, and watch Rupert Grint as he matures into a fine fine actor.
