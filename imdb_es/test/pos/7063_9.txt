No, it's not a Kane citizen. But do you expect it to be with a name like "Meatballs"? It is the best summer camp movie of all summer camp movies. Does anyone line up "Little Darlings" line by line? Or "Whitewater Summer"? <br /> <br /> This is just one of those movies that came into my mind when I was in high school and they stayed with me all these years. Every time I feel geeky, I mutter "Spaz, Spaz, Spaz, Spaz." Or when we are walking in the forest, I say to my husband: "I am Wudy da Wabbit". (He does not understand). "It just does not matter, it just does not matter." I mean, this thing is classic! <br /> <br /> Although disappointed with the DVD. I wish there were special features, maybe a comment or a make-of. But the movie itself is a perfect snapshot of life as a teenager in the late 70s. Maybe not MY life ... You can not help but want to run through the woods with shorts, knee-high stockings and feathered hair each Once you see this movie.
