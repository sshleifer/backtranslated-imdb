It is likely that Barbara Stanwyck did not think so, but it is a relief to see her with a darker hairstyle (if it was not a wig) than the one she had to use in "Double Indemnity" the previous year. That movie, while the premiere of "film noir" and a great versatile movie, gave it a great role, but, oh, that hair. Here, she is more elegant and certainly no fatal woman, but she is certainly a woman of 40 years. She has become accustomed to life without men since most of them are at war, and like a successful columnist like Martha Stewart, she writes a home column in which she describes her home in the country while the camera analyzes what it really is. We meet with his boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea that she is living a lie, and when he makes his way to spend Christmas in his supposed home in Connecticut, he has to invent a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and a baby . Before we can say "Jingle Bells." Hungarian chef S.Z. Sakall intervenes to help and ends in a nice cake one by one with Irish Una O'Connor. "It's not goulash, it's Irish stew." Sakall simply takes the paprika, pours almost everything and says "now it's goulash", totally changing what she has prepared for lunch. Then, when it comes to the flapjacks, he flips and she pulls out. For years, a few friends of mine and I will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation. "I do not turn around, I do it!" She will not even turn over just one for Greenstreet, saying "I've never changed my life". O'Connor can get nervous when she screams over and over again in some movies, but here, she is delightfully kind, and her partner with Sakall is very charming. <br /> <br /> It's obvious in the romance department. that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck's tea cup, especially when she meets the handsome Dennis Morgan, who is a little dizzy when bathing the baby, who eats soap, which causes Stanwyck to be a little alarmed. I should suspect something instantly, but it does not. But it does not matter. The film is so lovely with the country scene full of snow, a lot of rocking chairs and a dog running towards them while the sleigh goes up. Living in New York City after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of the state of New York made me miss this type of Christmas. While Central Park is beautiful after the first snowfall and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is also a requirement, there is something about looking at a field of snow-covered trees and occasionally catching a glimpse of deer, rabbits or other wildlife. <br /> <br /> This is a great Christmas movie that can also bring the Christmas spirit out of season, and makes a great combination with another Barbara Stanwyck Christmas movie, "Remember the Night," an underestimated gem. Add Christmas to the big city of "Meet John Doe," and you may have found one of the busiest stars in Christmas movies.
