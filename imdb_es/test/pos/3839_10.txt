* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was when it was reissued on video when I was about 8 years old. Now I am 17 and I continue to see it every time I have the opportunity to do so. "The Aristocats" was a beautiful movie that immediately fell in love with me. I loved the songs, especially the ones the kitties sing on the piano. In fact, I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it. The three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I've ever seen. The cat Ally had a great voice! <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when the kittens play the piano. That part is adorable. I also enjoy your trip home. Is incredible. This is one of the best Disney movies I've seen and one of my favorites. Everyone should see it. I give this movie 10/10 stars.
