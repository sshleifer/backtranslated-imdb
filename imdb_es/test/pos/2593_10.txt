In one of the many cartoons of Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd goes hunting, and Daffy tries to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. On the other hand, "Rabbit Seasoning" makes an interesting use of the order of words and pronouns (warning: it is possible that your speech is very funny and real). <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of this caricature is the costumes. used by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems to have been dangerous for 1952 (especially in a caricature), but they did it perfectly, as they always did. All in all, this only serves to show what geniuses the people behind these cartoons were.
