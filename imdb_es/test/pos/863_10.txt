When I first saw Stella in the central comedy, I thought "God, this is horrible!" But I loved Wet Hot American Summer. So I knew that something did not make sense. There was nothing left for me to do, except look for Stella's shorts that, I had heard, contained more dildos than any other comedy company. When I found them, not only did my dildo's expectations come true, but I also found the best comedy scenes I've seen in years. The set of twenty short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs. Not only did I laugh for the first time I saw them, but I kept laughing more loudly when I looked at them again and again. It's really a shame that Comedy Central had the restrictions of cable television for the Stella series. It would have been much better on HBO or Showtime. Your brand of humor can not be restricted by censors or popular culture. Since even if I was on HBO, I'm sure the "masses" would have voted it canceled in a season or less, but it would still have been fantastic. Needless to say, I am now in love with Stella and all her individual members. Any Stella fan should visit David Wain's site with all his short films. They are just as nice as Stella. So I take my hat off to Michael Showalter, Michael Ian Black and David Wain for the incredible comedy they have done with Stella. I hope to see much more of the company in the future.
