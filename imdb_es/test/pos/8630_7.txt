I wanted to see this movie because I'm a big fan of Abbott and Costello, and when I saw it, I liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, not hysterical, but fun. I mean I laughed at a lot of the fun parts and just enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Although not the best of Perfect Straight Man and Perfect Buffoon, you should see this if I really love Abbott and Costello. <br /> <br /> Of all the Abbott and Costello films I've seen, I can not say I've seen one I hated. This is decent, fun and entertaining. Abbott and Costello at least made some pretty decent films in their later years. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked this movie, it is not one of the best, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
