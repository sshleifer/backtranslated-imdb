Watching The Kite Runner, by the director of Stranger Than Fiction, is the cinematic equivalent of eating your vegetables, since this PG-13, qualified as a work of art, is good for your diet. No, this is not the kind of movie I like to leave on the couch and the eyeball at the end of a difficult day. Kite Runner is not your typical conventional movie designed to entertain you and make you forget your problems. First, there are no famous stars in it. Second, do not cut or dry anything, black or white, or so extravagant that you do not create an image that you see. Third, The Kite Runner becomes subtitles when the characters speak occasionally in their native language. Fourth, the Forster movie is not a romantic trick about the girl's wishes of the children, the girl of the lost children, and then the return of the girl's triumphs. Fifth, this movie in a foreign language can make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your assumptions about life, friendship and survival. The main issues here are cowardice and redemption. The protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the action that must expire at the expense of his own safety and personal integrity. Right, The Kite Runner is about redeeming yourself for the sins of the past. We are talking about personal responsibility, so do not rent or buy this wonderful movie for a nighttime celebration of children or something to eliminate the bad taste of your system day. Based on the successful novel by Khaled Hosseini, this culturally illustrated melodrama about right and infarction initially looks like one of those gay friendship movies about teenagers in the vein of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandlot. About a half hour in its 127 minutes, this adventure about two young people flying kites in Afghanistan becomes dark and unpleasant. However, if he can handle the remaining hour of the plot, he will be gratified, relieved and perhaps even entertained. <br /> <br /> Kite Runner opens in San Francisco in the year 2000 as our protagonist, the Afghan emigrant Amir Jan (Khalid Abdalla of United 93) and his wife Soraya (Atossa Leoni of The Florist) receive two boxes of published articles. Copies of Amir's first novel. As soon as Amir had the chance to enjoy his lifelong triumph as a storyteller, the phone took him out of his reverie and reluctantly returned to a past that is best left behind. Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub of The Nativity Story) calls Amir of Pakistan to make an application. Rahim was a servant in Amir's house in the 1970s, when Amir lived with his wealthy Pashtun trader father Baba (Homayoun Ershadi of A Taste of Cherry) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. "You have one more chance to be good," Rahim informs Amir without sugar covering his request. Basically, Rahim wants Amir to fly to Pakistan and then enter Afghanistan, devastated by the war, and rescue Rahim's young grandson, Sohrab (Ali Danish Bakhty Ari), who is imprisoned against his will as a sexual slave of Assef ( the newcomer Abdul Salam Yusoufzai) to The cruel Taliban chief and the feared adversary of Amir. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner changed from San Francisco in 2000 to an extended flashback in Kabul in 1978, when life was idyllic. Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi), 12, and the son of his father's maid, Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), love watching movies, such as The Magnificent Seven, in the west of John Sturges, when they are not flying kites. By the way, this is flying kites like you've never seen flying kites. Children not only fly them, but they also compete with other children to see who can cut the ropes of another child's kite. Comet flight scenes generate the same kind of excitement as Tony Scott's Top Gun dog fighting scenes. Hassan is Amir's best friend, but unlike Amir, Hassan belongs to the vilda Hazara minority. Previously, the young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with the young Assef (Elham Ehsas) and his two mates. Assef was about to hit them, but Hassan pulled out his sling and threatened to use it on Assef. Assef had no choice but to back away. Meanwhile, Amir was prepared to suffer the hand that fate had given him. Amir's father, Baba, laments the lack of his son's spine and fears that half a man will grow up because he is a coward, unlike the small and brave Hassan who takes Amir out of trouble. Anyway, Amir and Hassan emerge from the confrontation with Assef without a scratch. Later, after Amir sets a new record with his flying and kite fighting skills, Hassan runs after a kite to claim it. Hassan is the homonymous character referred to in the title. Hassan claims the fallen kite, but finds himself at the mercy of Assef and his two henchmen. Assef lets Hassan keep the kite, but his henchmen hold Hassan's sprawling eagle, kneeling in an alley while Assef sodomizes the youth. Worse, a traumatized Amir observes the assault from the vicinity, but lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who would have intervened for him. <br /> <br /> Apart from the extraordinary aerial scenes with kites, The Kite Runner is simple, simple things. When Amir returns to Afghanistan to rescue Sohrab, he poses as a Taliban fighter, but does not carry a firearm. The rescue scene in The Kite Runner is like the escape scene of The Midnight Express. While Forster does not explore local politics or immerse us in the ethnic and cultural issues at stake here. In fact, the terrorist David Benioff of Troy had to eliminate some parts of the book and the racial and ethnic prejudices are not clearly delineated, so you have to accept some things by faith. Forster studied the film in almost China to give it an authentic look. Forster deserves credit for making these two hours more epic fascinating. The performances, especially by children, stand out for their credibility. The Kite Runner is a movie that you will not easily forget.
