This was a very funny and fast-paced movie. I saw it more than once and I keep my rent to show others. I would like to take this opportunity to ask anyone who is aware, how do HK producers choose their subtitle translators? I am so curious. Please direct me <br /> <br /> Again, to review again, it's a really fun movie with a lot of content, subtleties that remind the classics, although they are full of slapstick. Reminiscent, say, of the Mexican comedies of Cantinflas. <br /> <br /> The film does not disappoint the fanatics of the director who have realized that he chooses clearly Chinese themes, trying to reach features that are rarely explored. The entire director's collection is a way to get a look inside the culture in a disarming way. <br /> <br /> And I do not see how your fun girl at the China Party could be overcome.
