I have loved this movie since I was a child. I remember the night my mother brought this movie home. I loved it and I still do it. I think it's very funny and original. There are also some very catchy melodies in this movie. Lou is also a surprisingly good singer. The actors who represent Prince Arthur and Princess Eloise are also fine, but Abbott and Costello are the best. Buddy Baer, ​​former heavyweight boxer, also brother of former heavyweight champion Max Baer, ​​is good at this movie as the policeman and the giant. He is a better actor than the boxer. He had a natural talent. The beginning of this movie is hilarious about how Lou Costello is still crashing the car and how he gets into trouble with Buddy Baer. The slapstick in the house is also good. I especially like the comedy in the castle of the giants. My favorite parts are; The part where Lou is climbing the bean and everyone is singing like a farewell. Jack is answering that he will return. Lou Costello is very good at singing. My other favorite part is the part where Jack is fighting with the Giant. I like it when Jack blows up eggs and when he tries to make the giant an omelet, they keep exploding. Abbott and Costello are hilarious and the best comedians of all time. This is just one of his great movies that I will love and appreciate. The reviews of this movie are not very good and I do not understand why. This is a very good movie by Abbott and Costello. I also love how Lou Costello comes back to reality at the end and thinks he's back in the dream when Bud hits him. He starts singing his song and leaves with an attitude like nobody pushes me. Very good movie.
