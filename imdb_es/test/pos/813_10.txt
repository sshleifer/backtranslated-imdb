This has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The idea of ​​a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the desert. When mom and dad lose their jobs, not to mention that they have green slime in the bathtub. They decide that the best thing for their families is to move to Oregon. Once there, everything goes wrong. An interesting cast of characters complements this movie. Including a young Molly Ringwald, this is a movie that I would definitely recommend.
