I just want to say that the role of Chris Diamantopoulos as Williams for the whole show, was worthy of Emmy. It was strange how well he did it. And being as fast and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is ... WOW. There were scenes in which Diamantopoulos had to say, probably, 20 lines of fast fire and 15 different characters while emitting those lines, while it sounds as if ROBIN WILLIAMS made those characters ... well, my friends are an impressive performance. It's one thing to do an imitation of Robin Williams for a couple of minutes. It's another thing to do for a full-length television movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know how I felt about the whole program, and I do not know how much they played with the facts, but I do know that it was Chris Diamantopoulos who kept watching me. So for that I give it a 10.
