Story about a widowed father (Claude Rains) raising his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is loved by the great hunky Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is in love with an old but rich man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to be a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic. The handsome dead Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), a business associate of his father, comes to stay with them. All the sisters fall in love with him. Then, the cynical Mickey (John Garfield) enters the scene ... <br /> <br /> The very entertaining film was a great success and was nominated for five Academy Awards. It is beautifully directed by Michael Curitz, has a pretty good script (although predictable) and a VERY attractive cast (especially Lynn). This was also John Garfield's first film and he became a star. This was so popular that there were three or four sequels (which I never saw). This is a fascinating, entertaining and large-budget soap opera that is worth seeing.
