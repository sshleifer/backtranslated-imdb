The veterans of World War II return home and find it difficult to adapt to civil life. This magnificent drama is led by experts by Wyler and beautifully filmed by the famous cinematographer Toland. Despite its duration of almost three hours, it does not crawl for a minute. Sherwood's script presents very human characters and a great dialogue. Andrews has perhaps his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet. They are also good Wright as a young lady in love, Mayo as Andrews' cheating wife, and real life veteran Russell as a man who lost both his hands. However, the top honors are for March and Loy as a married couple facing challenges as they re-encounter each other.
