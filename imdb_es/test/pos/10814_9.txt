[Minor spoilers follow] <br /> <br /> Steve Allen opined that topical humor about serious events can be considered by many as acceptable according to the formula: Tragedy + Time = Comedy. 1939 before the German assault on Poland was not a fun period and subsequent events, including the Blitzkrieg (after the Sitzkrieg) that took Germany to the Channel, resulted in the heroic evacuation in Dunkirk and gave the world the hideous spectacle of a France supine prostrate His honor before the Nazi conqueror. <br /> <br /> Romance, comedy and a lot of serious drama? Yes. The director, Jean-Paul Rappeneau, with a well-matched and outstanding cast, creates in "Bon voyage" a pastiche of events and scenes from history and imagination that is enormously entertaining. <br /> <br /> Viviane Denvers (The beautiful Isabelle Adjani) is the best actress in France when the clouds of war are accumulating in Europe (which is a clich√© too used, I'm sorry). A veteran self-veneer bedhopper with many issues to her credit, her inner motivation seems to be: "What's good for Viviane is good for ... Viviane." After a premiere of his latest film after a minister in Reynaud's incompetent administration, Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu in an unusual role for him), he points out his interest in her, goes home and meets a former lover who does not understand the word "no". He decisively solves that problem, but then, frantically and histrionically, he recruits another ex-boyfriend, Frederic (Gregory Derangere), who is still angry, to help deal with the disaster in his apartment. Frederic is a novelist in expectation. <br /> <br /> A comical accident that once again highlights, almost as a public service message, the importance of the windshield wipers working and puts Frederic in jail for the most serious charges. Fortunately, the break of the Germans from their static positions forces a total transfer of prisoners to the south of France, but our boy escapes and goes there privately instead of being a ward of the state. <br /> <br /> The panic and fear in France when the Germans wipe out the victory are well represented and a new turn enters history. With whom should Frederic be found, but the really wonderful and young research assistant, Camille (Virginie Ledoyen) who accompanies the obligatory Jewish refugee scientist, Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehle)? Kopolski has some "heavy water" bottles that he needs to get to England. Of course, Germans should not cling to this vital ingredient to know what (this part is pure fiction: there was never heavy water in France in 1940, only Perrier). And Camille is as attractive as she is dedicated. <br /> <br /> What now? Peter Coyote as a supposed French journalist, Alex Winckler. Be notified of your name. He really is an officer in the Abwehr (German military intelligence: a spy). And he also used to bed with Viviane (and he wants a repeat of his adventure). Apparently, Kopolski type is the only important male character who does not want to have it with the actress. <br /> <br /> What follows is a series of adventures and setbacks that are perfectly integrated to produce a very fast one. Rhythm and nice movie. In part, a tribute and a bit of parody in "Casablanca", this is a very funny movie (except for the heavy Nazi fragments). <br /> <br /> Isabelle Adjani deserves recognition for the best performance I've seen in years of an adorably cute total narcissist with few or no redeeming traits. And Depardieu, disloyal to Reynauld and ready to leave the ship and join the traitor, Petain, is convincing as a man whose ardor for Viviane overcomes his diluted sense of duty towards the Republic. As a human being in power at a critical moment in French history, Beaufort is terribly vile. <br /> <br /> Not shown in many theaters, "Bon voyage" should be available to buy or rent soon. See it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
