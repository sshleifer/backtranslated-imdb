One of the best and most exciting of all the conspiracy thrillers (there was a series of films of this type in the 1970s). This is about an accident in a Neuclear Reactor and about attempts to cover it up. Jack Lemmon is the employee who realizes how dangerous the plant is and Jane Fonda is the television reporter who takes the story on board and both players are at their best. <br /> <br /> The events presented in the film are, of course, frightening and not at all unlikely, (much of what happens here happened in real life on Three Mile Island), and although now it seems something of a time, however, highlights the fragile and a dangerous world that we have created for ourselves. Expect a series of similar films about the effects of global warming in the near future (and not junk like "The day after tomorrow").
