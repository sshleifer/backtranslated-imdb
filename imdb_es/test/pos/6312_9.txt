This is a very visual movie. With that I mean that the dialogue is scarce, almost to the point of being a silent film for some very long shots, starting with the opening shot. <br /> <br /> The silences, however, break with a surprising track sound ranging from discordant, staccato rhythms to an eerie mix of violins, and interspersed with voices that sound like dreams. It is a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes, one of the first visual images is a man walking down a street, so concerned about his interest in a well-formed woman, who enters a lamppost: one of the consequences of love and beauty. a metaphor of what's in the store ... <br /> <br /> A long time ago, another movie? Love Story (1970) - said that love never has to say that you feel it. This narrative turns that idea around in several ways, starting with the main character, Titta (Toni Sevillo), a seemingly innocuous long-term resident in a luxury hotel somewhere in Switzerland. Every day, week after week, he sits at the same coffee table, enjoying the passing world, his cigarettes, his coffee, his loneliness. And he has been doing it for ten years. He sits down, observes, and once a week he gets involved in three very surprising activities that you will discover when you see this little masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> Love is explored in a different way, in a direct counterpoint to the loneliness and the reserved nature of Titta: two senior residents of the hotel are still very much in love, but the man wants to die in a spectacular way when his time comes, while his long-suffering wife reprimands him for tricking the cards with the other guests, one of which is titta. Now, Titta knows about his disputes, his love, the man's traps, his apologies to his wife and his complaints. How? In a surprising way and black comedy ... one of those surprise activities that I mentioned. <br /> <br /> But, this is not a comedy, actually, although it does touch the idea of ​​human comedy in a Balzacian sense: the irony of life and what to do with it. That decision had been made for Titta ten years earlier when he left his wife and started living in the hotel. He keeps in touch from time to time, and it is clear that he still loves his (now older) children and the sadness in his voice says a lot. But, there is something more than pain ... <br /> <br /> A life like Titta's obviously seems to be completely boring, and in fact it is from many perspectives. However, only when we learn what is under his almost mortal face, the horror of his situation hits the viewer between the eyes. But not before we know that the waitress, Sofía (Olivia Magnani), is very interested in Titta and makes an effort to awaken Titta's interest in her. <br /> <br /> And that's when things start to unravel. Titta: eventually succumbs to his femininity and in doing so discovers, once again, the consequences of love. Ironically, in doing so, he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life, and in the most spectacular way. <br /> <br /> I know that all of the above is somewhat cryptic; but, to say more, would ruin the film and the story for you. If you like Italian cinema? I love! ?? I urge you to see this. The acting is excellent; the soundtrack cools the spine; The camera work is really innovative; the address shows the maturity of a true artist. <br /> <br /> I know I'll see this movie again, and again ...
