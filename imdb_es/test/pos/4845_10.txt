Undoubtedly, the cinema is a powerful medium, more now than ever, due to the accessibility of the DVD / video, which gives the filmmaker the additional security that possibly his story or message is seen by millions of people. The use of this medium, therefore, grants an innate responsibility to the artist, since the film can be educational and entertaining, which dictates that certain subjects must be addressed accordingly and with the corresponding sensitivity and sensitivity. A film like Spielberg's 'Schindler's List', for example, is important, as it keeps the memory of what should not be forgotten alive, and as history tends to repeat itself, Spielberg's film can be considered a valuable tool for prevent recurrence of that tragedy. In that same sense, this film, 'Focus', directed by Neal Slavin, is important, since it illuminates the problematic reality of anti-Semitism, which for many years has affected millions of people, even today it is unimaginably frequent, and as any manifestation of intolerance, will be perpetuated if left unchecked or ignored. Born of a xenophobic strain, it is a disease that infects society that, without ceasing, could be terminal; and with his penetrating ideas about the condition, this film is an effective vaccine that, at least, can help stop the proliferation of it and, hopefully, can act as a step to eradicate it completely. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) served his country in the Great War, and since then he has lived a quiet and conventional life in New York. He has had the same job as a personnel director for about twenty years, and owns the house, located in an average middle class neighborhood, where he lives with his mother (Kay Hawtrey). Lawrence is the kind of person who manages very well to take care of his own business and refuse to get involved with issues that are not (he feels) his concern. <br /> <br /> All that is about to change, however As with the advent of World War II, Lawrence, along with the owner of the corner market, Mr. Finkelstein (David Paymer) , is unaccountably targeted by the neighborhood xenophobes, who have allied with the "Union Crusaders". a national organization currently dedicated to channeling their fears and hatred toward Jews, or anyone who even "looks" like a Jew. And, suddenly, Lawrence discovers that he can no longer stay on the sidelines and see how the game is played; because now, HE IS the game, whether he wants to or not. <br /> <br /> Based on an intelligent and well-written script by Kendrew Lascelles, which he adapted from Arthur Miller's novel, Slavin presents a chilling scenario that examines in an incisive way the effects of fanaticism on those against whom it is leveled. ; and when one considers the fact that this is not simply a hypothetical situation, but a representation of reality, it becomes even more disturbing, even disconcerting. And what makes the film so effective is Slavin's obvious understanding of his subject, and his studied presentation, which is exhilarating in its subtlety. In the opening scene, Slavin establishes the "character" of Lawrence, and shortly after reaffirms it in another scene, which gives the public the opportunity to observe and assimilate how Lawrence's mind really works; The thought processes that direct your life. With that in place, then, Slavin can take his audience along with Lawrence as his problems begin to develop gradually. By doing so, it effectively illustrates how the problem evolves, rather than simply raising it and tackling it head-on, which increases the emotional participation of the viewer and, ultimately, improves the impact of the movie. <br /> <br /> Slavin makes an important statement with this film, which is not only an accusation of intolerance, but also carries a warning message about apathy. And to his credit, he never hits you in the head with him or engages in pointing with the subjective finger to defend his case; instead, proceed with care, doing everything possible to be as objective as possible with everything you are submitting for consideration. His approach is that of a film diplomat; and it's an approach that serves Slavin, and his movie, quite well. <br /> <br /> Like Lawrence, William H. Macy, one of the best character actors in the business, offers incredible performance. establishing the credibility and credibility of his character with a sensitive, honest and introspective portrait. He never tries to avoid the personal flaws of Lawrence's nature, but instead uses them to create a character that is decidedly three-dimensional, which not only makes him convincing, but also serves to reaffirm the integrity of the portrait. What makes him so compelling is Macy's ability to convey the process by which he examines his own consciousness, allowing the viewer to share the experience of his personal epiphany. In the final analysis, it is the strength of Macy's performance, more than anything else, that makes this film so distinctly different. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the film is the performance presented by Laura Dern, as Gertrude Hart, a portrait that effectively complements Macy's work, as well as that of Slavin. Dern gives a tremendous substance to his character, capturing it physically and emotionally, and his colorful zeal creates a striking contrast to Lawrence's reserve that works extremely well, both for his character and for the film itself. <br /> <br /> And just like Sean Combs recently (in 'Monster's Ball') he made a good case against ruling out in advance the acting efforts of an established 'rock star', 'Meat Loaf Aday' A powerful performance here, like Fred, the next - neighbor door It also proves that a true artist will produce, regardless of the type of canvas he has worked with to work. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Michael Copeman (Carlson), Kenneth Welsh (Father Crighton), Joseph Ziegler (Gargan) and Arlene Meadows (Mrs. Dewitt). The kind of film that makes a filmmaker of his trade "Focus" proud offers a memorable experience that, with luck, will also be enlightening for those who do not know that such conditions have existed, and still do, even in this. Freedom land. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
