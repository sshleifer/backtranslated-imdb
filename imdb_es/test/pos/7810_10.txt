There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi cinema. Andaz Apna Apna is one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young people (Aamir and Salman) who dream of being rich by marrying the daughter of a millionaire (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan do their best to mock each other and attract Raveena. The plot is complicated when Paresh Rawal & Co. plans to take over all the wealth. The movie is a good rhythm and very funny. Rarely does one find a Hindi comedy that is fun and smart. This is one of the few movies with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only movie!). Unfortunately, it did not succeed at the box office, and we may never see a film of this caliber again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has demonstrated his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as an imbecile. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma, who is Raveena's assistant / friend, is also fun. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania add to the flavor of the film. All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I would like them to make more quality films like this one. You will want to see this movie again and again. <br /> <br /> PS: for those of you who have seen this movie, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc.
