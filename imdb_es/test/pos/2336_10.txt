I have enjoyed this movie since the first time I saw it in the theater. Some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about how to get the best out of people, work together in harmony, build a team and achieve goals, without preaching morality. The situations are well designed and are consistent with the premise of opening the film. The tension accumulates very well and the humor is clean and consistent. The film manages to drag me directly to the root of the characters and laugh pretty well all the time. This is a movie that feels good and is coming. <br /> <br /> What surprises me is that a movie that seems so simple can be entertaining in the long term. The music is a perfect copy of the music in the typical post-war serious films of the Navy, which help to create humor and point out that greatness is in the eye of the beholder. The scenes in the credits are an excellent music video for "In the Navy", which deserves its own special full screen feature. The scenes and cuts are well done, and the casting and acting are ready. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic as big as the one that was made, without any pretension. In fact, the lack of pretension is what makes it so fun to watch. I love these guys and girls. <br /> <br /> The other day I thought about the movie and I asked myself if it was available on DVD. Good fortune has arrived, and the DVD came out in May 2004. I went to the store and took a copy. Then my wife and I enjoyed another fun night in front of the big screen. I rated this movie as a 10 because it meets at all levels, much better than many high-budget films and Oscar winners. This is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Listen to Fox's home video: he has a great movie in his vaults, and it's a shame to find a DVD of cheap shots with very degraded dye colors only 8 years since its release. So why not restore the colors and present the film as it was meant to be seen? I would gladly pay a few dollars more to get the correct image. I'm grateful to have my own copy. Now, tell us what the film deserves and how to recreate the sequence of credits as a special feature of a full-screen music video.
