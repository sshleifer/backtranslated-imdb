I like the pastor! Of course the performance was not good, but the fight scenes were nice. Van Damme throws some good kicks and so does Adkins. The story was normal. A Texas policeman fights against smugglers. This movie did everything a Van Damme movie should do, which is martial arts and action. Van Damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than Van Dammmes the last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar-winning performance, you will not get it here, but if you're looking for action and martial arts, then this movie is for you. Scott Adkins is an amazing martial artist and, unfortunately, the public has grown tired of the martial art superstars, but his films in this movie are great. Van Damme offers strong kicks and it's good to see him perform martial arts again, since he has not done so in his last 4 or 5 movies. This movie is definitely worth watching if you're a van damme fan.
