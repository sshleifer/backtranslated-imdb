This story is an excellent story of two children who do what they can to get away from that abusive abusive parent. The star of "The Lord of the Rings" Elijah Wood is outstanding in this unforgettable role. This movie is one of the main reasons why I have not touched a single beer and I will never do it while I live. That could make me sound like a nerd, but that's what I have to say. It's a wonder why this is not as weird as a classic American tale.
