Not being a movie buff, I'm not familiar with the names of directors, screenwriters, producers and the like, but I can distinguish an exceptional movie when I see it. <br /> <br /> The creators of this good movie could either be at the top of their fields now, or they could arrive very soon. I know the actors are already there. <br /> <br /> It makes the talent come closer to the genius to show with such realism how a national tragedy like Vietnam has impacted the daily life of a typically average American family, and makes us see at close range why there is so many Vietnam veterans homeless. <br /> <br /> Without getting into free scenes of blood and bloodshed, it makes us understand why so many young people had flashbacks of what had happened. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is particularly exciting, and it gives us an idea of ​​what happened in so many families after Vietnam. <br /> <br /> I wish there were more good movies like this, Not only about Vietnam, but also about other social conditions.
