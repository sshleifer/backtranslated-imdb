There have been many (well, more than a few in any case) attempts over the past 30 years to create a movie that looks "otherworldly". Assuming that this is the desire of a film director to distance himself from other films, or simply to overlook the low-budget and messed-up look, "Begotten" is on the top echelon of this stack. <br /> <br /> Apart from The incomparable "Eraserhead", anyway. <br /> <br /> Merhige's painstaking process of artificially degrading his changes in the film is its structure completely (imagine what this film would look like in the glorious standard Technicolor): you can almost imagine it as an artifact of another culture unknown Some images are so far away from what we expect to see on the screen, they become distorted mainly as they dislocate. This is not a disturbance of "The last house on the left", rather like coming out of your cave for the first time and seeing the sun gap. <br /> <br /> Look at this Fever-Dream If you have the opportunity, and enjoy. Remember, they make other movies more standard day by day. They can wait.
