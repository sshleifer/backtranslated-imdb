Arthur Miller certainly knows it. Their stories offer a clearer picture of what it means to live in the United States in the 20th century than any other writer I can think of. <br /> <br /> The approach, based on one of his novels, is no exception. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Laura Dern give fantastic performances here. Emotionally bruised but ultimately rewarding, this movie is excellent.
