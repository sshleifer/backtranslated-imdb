I have never been kissed, it gives Drew Barrymore the opportunity to do something that maybe 70% of us would like to do. Go back to high school and make some necessary corrections. Actually, the first time for me was bad enough and, at my age, I doubt I could do it like Drew does. <br /> <br /> Of course, the reason could also be that once we get out of high school it's like leaving a Cocoon and we have to deal with the great hostile world there is. I have met some in my life who would come back and stay if they could. In fact, there is an episode of Law and Order that explores the dark side of this same situation. A girl who looks young enough to do so, goes to high school at least three times and kills the person who stumbles on her secret. <br /> <br /> With Drew, although it's a chore. She is an editor for the Chicago Sun Times who longs to be a reporter. The publisher Garry Marshall, who plays the role as Donald Trump took over the Sun Times, has this brilliant idea and only sees in Barrymore a person young enough to achieve the masquerade. <br /> <br /> The high school the first time was bad enough. Drew was not the most popular then and is not improving the second time. That is until Brother David Arquette also returns to school and helps in difficult times. <br /> <br /> Of course, this poses many problems for Drew, peer pressure from two sources, work and school. What can a girl do? <br /> <br /> Never Been Kissed is a light and charming comedy that, in their opinion, skips the opportunity to be brutally exploitative and gives us good entertainment. Drew is very funny and sweet, and his performance in times of stress for his character moves very well in pathos. Michael Vartan, as an English teacher, is the type I would like to have more in the field of education and Leelee Sobieski and Jessica Alba play a couple of children with empty heads that Drew tries so desperately to connect. <br /> <br /> It still does not inspire me to return to Midwood High School.
