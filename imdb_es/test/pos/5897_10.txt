Very pleased to see that this excellent movie gets such high ratings from IMDB users. The best years of their lives are still the best film statement about veterans returning from the war I have encountered. Easily the best performance by the often overlooked Frederick March. In fact, the whole cast shines, including the music legend Hoagy Carmichael, who treats us all with a subtle version of his classic Lazy River. I would recommend this excellent movie to anyone who loves movies.
