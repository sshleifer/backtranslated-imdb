This is a very, very strange movie ... one that is so strange that it is better to see it for yourself. The movie starts with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly bright as he is. It can be said very quickly that this man is a total cynic: he finds no value in practically nothing, but clings to his own inner sense of personal importance. In addition, he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, he enters a bank robbery and manages to annoy the thieves so much that one of them shoots him in the head. Interestingly, this is only in the middle of the movie and what followed was a very strange narration of the last seconds of his life. This is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narrative is like one of the novels of this literature teacher: one that is written intelligently and says things the way we would like everyone to be able to say them. Watch this strange movie, it's incredibly convincing and it's not like anything I've seen before.
