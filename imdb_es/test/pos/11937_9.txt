I think Toy Soldiers is an excellent movie. It is one of the only films that, apart from some well-known actors, has an unknown cast that can act. In my opinion, the plot is captivating. It keeps your attention without having a scandalous story that could not happen in real life. I think everyone would enjoy this movie. Sean Astin always seems to choose the perfect movies to be in that showcase of his talent. It is very underestimated and does not receive the recognition it deserves. Other films that have been on other actors have been in the spotlight, but this movie and Rudy really show it because he is the main character of both. I hope that one day he will receive the accolades he deserves for his performance. If you want to see a great movie, you need to see it and if you are a Sean Astin fan, you will definitely like this movie.
