Garlin surpasses himself as a writer, director and actor in his independent production about a big man (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughter continues to arrive almost every minute. It is a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man who seeks love, but made with great writing and acting comics. The supporting roles are also very well done and they are very funny, and they really make the movie rich. <br /> <br /> Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her role as a receptionist and takes you directly to the mood of the rest of the movie. Sara Silverman is amazing with some of the great fragments she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classically excellent in her role. I wish there was more of her in the movie, since I think most will agree. It is certainly refreshing to see her in a tight leather outfit. <br /> <br /> David Pasquesi was the distant companion and the voice of reason. Mina Kolb plays Jeff's mother with whom he lives. There were many other cameos, all of them very well. <br /> <br /> At the prime minister, Jeff mentioned his inability to do more with Bonnie due to production problems. Still, it's good to leave you wanting more. I think it's that indie thing to keep some ambiguous things to allow the audience to think for itself to fill in the blanks. The neat title should give you a clue to this. <br /> <br /> Jeff said that some of the basic characters were based on their past relationships. This explains why they work so well. Real-life people are always unusually colorful and make great characters. He departs a bit from what he might expect, after having seen Curb Your Enthusiasm and some of his other works. It is one of those things in which an actor risks doing something that maybe they always wanted to do but could not. <br /> <br /> I think it is noteworthy that the improvised background of Garlin in Second City and Hunt are for that. As for the subject, establish the style of acting as the focus of the story and the direction. It is perhaps a new innovative hybrid of improvisation and independent cinema.
