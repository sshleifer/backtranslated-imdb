They received this DVD from the ACCENT range, which is a label that specializes in art-house films, released Irreversible and a range of Bergman opus. <br /> <br /> What caught my attention in the Alex Frayne movie, strangely titled, MODERN LOVE Is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision, a film that takes us to the mind of Mr Joe Average, full of voices in the head, visions and madness. It is set in rural Australia, the film does not trivialize or praise people like so many Australian films. that is, our films are full of "adorable rogues" or people with "golden hearts", etc., etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Not in this movie. The spirit of Stanley Kubrick is very important here, it is not impeccable, but it has a fascinating attention to detail, a romantic streak and a state of mind reinforcements, if it is not understandable. <br /> <br /> Minor objections ... the appearance of the defective transfer: the front credits were cut into slices, they do not fit in the frame. <br /> <br /> In addition, one of the short films is damaged and stops halfway.
