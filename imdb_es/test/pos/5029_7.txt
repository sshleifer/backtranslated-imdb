As one previous critic said, Travolta stole all the scenes in which he was. Do you recognize the character? It was Vinnie Barberino, all grown up and still a bit sordid, but it's still nice, oh, yes! <br /> <br /> The disappointments were William Hurt and Bob Hoskins, perhaps because their characters were poorly written, or simply did not care. I kept seeing one of the Baldwins (I can never remember which) in the role of Hurt so that Hurt's incredible talents would not be wasted. <br /> <br /> Andie McDowell is a sweetie, but she is not very credible; partly the writing. The development of the character was simply not a big thing in this movie. Just look for Travolta, sit down and enjoy.
