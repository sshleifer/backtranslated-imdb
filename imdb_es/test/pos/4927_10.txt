CAUTION: Possible spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> "Steven Spielberg presents Tiny Toon Adventures" was always one of my favorite cartoons when I grew up (hell, it still is). And this film perfectly captures everything I love about the program and presents it in an integral way. <br /> <br /> Beautifully animated by the Tokyo Movie Shinsa studio (WB outsourced each "Tiny Toons" project, and this was the best studio to handle the program), the film begins at the end of the school year at Acme Looniversity , the renowned cartoon school where Buster and Babs Bunny (unrelated) and their teenage toon partners learn from the masters of animated madness, the Looney Melodies. After the final bell, the film is divided into five different plots. Buster involves Babs in a fight with water pistols that culminates with a dam and a tide, sending Buster, Babs and Elmyra's dog, Byron, to an overturned picnic table looking for adventures in the deep south. Plucky Duck tells Hamton Pig and his family to let him go with them to HappyWorld Land, "The happiest place in the Western Hemisphere," but he has to endure an unbearable car ride and the threat of a chainsaw hitchhiker. Elmyra's cat, Furball, finally escapes, but does not get discouraged ... not when there are a lot of "aminals" to play in the Acme Safari Park. Fifi la Fume spends his summer hunting his heartthrob, movie star Johnny Pew, hoping to get an autograph. Of course, the hotel in which it is located is almost impenetrable. And Shirley McLoon installs a divination post on the Acme Acres boardwalk ... and lets her day relax when Fowlmouth takes her to see the horror movie "Skunkophobia." <br /> <br /> All this history the lines are very funny, and some of them even overlap at the end. The only complaint I have with this movie is that it does not make full use of the Tiny Toons list; Dizzy Devil and Mary Melodie only have one scene, Gogo Dodo only appears at the beginning and end of the movie, and Montana Max, Sweetie, Calamity Coyote and Little Beeper are nowhere to be found. Still, they are excusable failures in an otherwise perfect film. This film is quite rare nowadays, since it is more than 12 years old and it has never been released on DVD, but I suggest you look for it: anyone who is a fan of Warner Bros. animation, whether classic or contemporary, NEEDS watch this movie
