I think the New York Times film critic, Elvis Mitchell, wrote the best review of a line of In the Mood for Love when he said he is "dizzy with a romantic spirit that has disappeared from the cinema forever." How true those words are! Really romantic movies are so rare these days, while movies that include lots of sex and nudity abound (often portrayed bluntly and gratuitously). Then, given this cinematic climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest film feels like a breath of much needed fresh air. Mood for Love is about the condemned romance between two neighbors ("Mr. Chow", played by Tony Leung and "Mrs. Chan", played by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses have an illicit affair, while trying "not to be like them" . But after hanging out together on lonely nights (while their spouses are absent "on business" / "caring for a sick mother"), they fall madly in love and must resist the temptation to go too far. <Br /> <br /> Several factors are responsible for making In the Mood for Love a new classic among "romantic melodramas", in the best sense of that term. First, the specific period of the film (ie, Hong Kong of the 1960s) is faithfully recreated with a surprising degree of detail. The clothing (including the gorgeous dresses of Maggie Cheung), the music (for example, Nat King Cole) and the general ambience of this film evoke a nostalgia for that specific period. Second, the award-winning and incredibly beautiful cinematography of Christopher Doyle creates an environment that not only envelops its two main characters, but seems to overflow with romantic yearning in each of its sumptuous and meticulously composed frames. Make no mistake: In the Mood for Love was the most beautiful film of 2001. (It should also be mentioned that the usual hyper-kinetic visual style of Wong Kar-wai is understandably understated for this film, although his pallet remains equally colorful .) Third, there is the score of Michael Galasso, which is accompanied by slow-motion sequences, for example, Chan walking in his elegant dresses, Chan and Chow "look" as they cross on the stairs, and other beautiful scenes that are They record in memory. The main score, which makes their instruments sound as if they were literally crying, is heard eight times in several points of the film and serves to highlight the sadness and longing felt by the two main characters. Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung offer wonderful performances (Leung won the award for best actor in Cannes) and manage to generate real chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> The above elements come together and work very well together to create a movie that feels timeless, "incredibly romantic" and, in a word, magical. In The Mood for Love, perhaps more than any other movie of 2001, it reminded me why I love "going to the movies". And I guess it's the biggest compliment I can pay for a movie. <br /> <br />
