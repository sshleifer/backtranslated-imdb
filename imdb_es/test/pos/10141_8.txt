Certainly, this movie has the sound of the truth about it, since it pretends to be based on real events on a marine base. It is about the attempted cover-up by the commander of the local Marine Corps for unacceptable conduct by a Navy commander, which resulted in the shooting death of his ex-girlfriend, a Navy captain. The man and the woman had been lovers, but the captain tried to break the relationship when she discovered that her boyfriend was married. He continued to stalk her, reaching as far as to fire his sidearm in one direction at a time. Finally, he broke into his house, attacked her with a knife and was shot twice with his service pistol and died. The civil prosecutor ruled the murder in self-defense, but the Marines decided to accuse the captain of murder. You see, the eldest was a decorated hero from Vietnam and an old friend of the Colonel in Chief at the Navy base. The captain, too, had made some enemies in the command of her group of engines, rejecting some masculine advances in a very elegant style. <br /> <br /> There is a considerable psychological burden that motivates and controls the actions of the main participants in this drama. , that the very capable cast transmits very well. The director and editor, however, seem determined to hide events as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and changing views. You're lucky if you know where you are most of the time. However, be patient with them; It is a worthwhile story as the martial trial takes place in the captain's court, and it seems that the hand of all men is against her, even her lawyer sometimes. <br /> <br /> The verdict? Well, after all, this is more of a suspense story, so you'll have to see it for yourself. There is a kind of "pacifist" message embedded in the movie, but forget about that. Of course, "war is hell", but sometimes it can not be avoided. We will need those Marines, even if they are not always the best clean game champions internally. As Kipling says in his poem "Tommy Atkins": <br /> <br /> "It's Tommy this and Tommy that, and Tommy waits outside, but, there's room for Mr. Atkins, when the ship is on the tide" .
