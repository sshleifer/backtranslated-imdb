This movie is similar to "Better Off Dead" since it has some of the same stars. This, although it is not so good. While it's quite fun and entertaining, there's something about "Better ... I like it, better than better." He has these boys who go to Nantucket to spend summer vacations while they're there, they know this girl who is trying to save here. " of this guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant. This guy really does not seem to like lobsters, because in a scene he puts him in boiling water and puts a stethoscope so he can hear him scream. The main character is divided between this girl and the girl of the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant. Somehow or another this leads to a great showdown in a boat race, as in "Summer Rental", although it works a little better here and fits the plot is a little better. Although what is the deal with boat racing at this time? Was there any strange fascination with them? For the most part, this movie offers laughter in a good video, but "Better Off Dead" was even better because it was the first and the jokes worked better.
