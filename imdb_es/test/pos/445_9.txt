This movie works on many different levels. It is the profile of a very interesting couple, a social commentary on aging and nursing homes, a love story, a musical. I've seen Uncle Frank a couple of times, and every time I see him I'm not sure who to call first: my parents, my wife, a friend I've lost contact with. . But it has a way of reminding you of the most important relationships in your life, and we want to reaffirm those that continue. Expect a lot of laughter and probably some tears if any of the vibrant characters here hit a chord. I'm pretty sure they will.
