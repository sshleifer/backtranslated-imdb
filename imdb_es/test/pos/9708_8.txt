It is what you expect. It causes laughter, shrinkage and dry agitation, not necessarily in that order. It's about the top. You will see things that you can never erase from the eyes of your mind. "Jackass Number Two" is better than the first; The actors definitely took more risks while filming this movie. There are many acrobatics that could have killed the actors, especially Johnny Knoxville. The treatment of the animals was suspect, but apart from that, the film achieved what was done to achieve it. If you like the preview, watch the movie. If you do not, stay away! <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
