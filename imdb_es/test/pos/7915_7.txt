The first sound film of Eisenstein retells the ice battle of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the knights of Livonia, eager to take Russia to Roman Catholicism. Made in 1938, Nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda: the Germanic knights, with their sinister helmets (and somewhat ridiculous) are obvious to the Nazis. The butchery of the knights when they enter a Russian city seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of World War II. The film ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with the sword will die by the sword. Made in delicate black and white (reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marked the return of Eisenstein to official favor. In the late 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet filmmakers to stop experimenting and make films that would be more populist and acceptable to the Russian public. That stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he returned with his most accessible film. Nevsky's strong point is in its second half, which presents the battle itself, and it looks just like a milestone in film history: never before (and probably never after) would a battle be so vivid on the screen. Another strong point is the beautiful and captivating soundtrack of Prokofiev (using a composer to record a movie was completely unusual at that time). One of its weakest points: the comic relief (in the form of two simple Russian warriors trying to attract a beautiful Russian peasant) is really discordant.
