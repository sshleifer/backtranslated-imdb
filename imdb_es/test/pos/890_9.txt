With all due respect to Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicolls and their characters, Department S will be forever associated with Jason King of Peter Wyngarde. <br /> <br /> Most people remember him as this camp, flashy detective and womanizing detective in the Austin Powers mold, but that will hurt the character: it's much more nuanced than that. <br /> <br /> Jason King is lazy (he often lets Stewart fight all the bad guys and only adds up at the end), he's selfish (his appreciation of people is based on whether they've read his novels or no), much of his detective work is a factless speculation that backs them up and gets mad when Annabelle is right ... and she is often clearly, is a man who has a middle-aged crisis and handles alcoholic beverages, but ... Jason King is brilliant. If Wyngarde had played him purely as a hasty hero, it would not have worked, but he shows King often as a paper tiger, guided by his libido, love of finery and prone to greatness (and stands in the way of his detective work sometimes) but it has some of the best lines and notes in the history of television. And by not interpreting it as whiter than white, the chemistry and interactions between the three main characters is the best. <br /> <br /> Looking at it again on DVD recently, you can see how much. The depth that Wyngarde put in Jason King.
