The first Disney animated film without the strong participation of Disney itself, this film suffers the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (this is, I think, the only Disney animated film since the 1940s that is NOT based in a previous version). book or other work, but rather it is an original story). As others have pointed out, the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in Lady and the Tramp and the story of kidnapping / trip home in 101 Dalmatians. <br /> <br /> But to overcome this flaw, filmmakers have successfully used many of the best features of most of Disney's animated films of the past 10-15 years: Phil Harris (of The Jungle Book) which expresses one of the main characters, follows his duet with Louis Prima in the previous film and another here with Scatman Crothers. The visual aspect of the quality of this film is practically transferred from "Dalmatians" (with some good winks to French impressionism, apparently), and the villain here (the butler) is very reminiscent of the henchmen in that movie as well. (This is probably one of Disney's least memorable villains). The main story goes back and forth between the cats, and the continuing difficulties of the butler with two rural hunting dogs (with a great voice work by Pat Buttram and George "Goober" Lindsey.) The different animal characters are similar to those who have seen "Tramp" and "Dalmatians." The owner of the cats, although he has a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother of Sleeping Beauty, has none of the unpleasant features of that character and is presented as very warm and generous. <br /> <br /> The real strength of the film is the work of the voice, after starting with the use of mostly familiar actors in The Jungle Book, the tactic continues strongly here with Disney veterans, Harris and Sterling Holloway, from The Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor (who would make a very similar character in the movie The Rescuers), as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp.They are all excellent here, especially Harris and Gabor in the forefront. No excellent as one might expect, showing a variety of emotions well. <br /> <br /> Younger children may feel upset by a few short episodes (an escape from the trajectory of a train at high speed, almost drowning by one of the children), but these do not come from a particularly frightening or dark way and they end very quickly. In general, there are very few scenes of the kind of more terrifying scenes that are found in many other Disney classics. <br /> <br /> A small oddity is the way in which some visual aspects of the culture of the 60s are represented among the cats that play jazz in supposedly 1910 Paris; one can not help wondering why history was not firmly established in the present, apart from the large amount that Paris had changed much of its appearance in the intervening time. It really would have made more sense that way. <br /> <br /> The songs, although they are enjoyable and, at times, are very enjoyable, are not particularly memorable. However, the general energy applied here, the excellent voice work and the excellent animation contribute to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses. Far from the greatness of the classic "10", such as Pinocchio or Aladdin, and not quite the "9" that one can give to the Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, this is probably an 8 out of 10 quite marginal; maybe a 7.
