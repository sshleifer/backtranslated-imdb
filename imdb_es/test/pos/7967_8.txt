I have reasons to love the great users of a camera; The fluid direction of the action lends itself to adventures and comedy narrations of accelerated rhythm; but such skill, in the hands of a King Vidor or an Anthony Mann can also be applied to idea-level work. This is the masterpiece of Paul Wendkos. Your story can be sold in a single pair of sentences. General Hector Cordoba is establishing himself as almost emperor in northern Mexico and stealing a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. he sends his crack mission unit, divided, apprehensive but determined, directed by George Peppard, to recover the cannon and return Cordoba to life, to put an end to the rebellion. The charismatic Raf Vallone plays Córdoba; the ladies of the piece are Giovanna Ralli and Francine York; with the team even more integrated by Nico Minardos, Peter Deuel and Don Gordon. Other stalwarts in the class include John Larch and John Russell. In addition to an operation that is already fantastically dangerous, there is Miss Ralli and a Mexican Lieutenant Lieutenant (Gabriela Tinti), whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba settled down on her own. The danger multiplies when Gordon's brother as an advanced spy is captured and tortured to death while he has to look ... and decides that he needs to kill Peppard. The attack captured by the cannon, when Peppard's orders are not obeyed by a regular type of army, is one of the most electrifying visual and staging achievements in film history; The penetration of the Córdoba fortress, the revelations discovered there, and the actions that give the mission team an opportunity to win, or almost victory, are impeccably presented. This is a beautiful color adventure movie, with unusually strong costumes, acting, lighting, art direction sets and music by Elmer Bernstein. Stephen Kandel's script is probably the best of its kind for a movie. This is probably the biggest Western most underestimated at this time, but I have always appreciated his heroes as a result: get workers. But as Peppard reminds his group on the way home, "the problem of being a" hero "- is the next morning." To know why he says it, he will have to see "Cannon For Cordoba".
