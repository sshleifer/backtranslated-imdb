When Precious Bane was broadcast in the United States, I was surprised by this beautiful story. All the actors were brilliant; Clive Owen really understood the character he played. I went immediately to a bookstore and ordered the original novel, which is even more beautiful, and which sold out just after buying the book, although I have seen it online several times. I also hoped that with the Oscar won by Janet McTeer and the enormous popularity of Clive Owen the BBC would naturally get this excellent production on DVD ... I can not believe that after these years we still do not have DVDs. It has to be the only production created by the BBC that is NOT for sale. Come on, BBC, you have money to make us fans here. Get this on DVD please!
