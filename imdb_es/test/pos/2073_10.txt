I was never interested in this game in the past, although I love Shakespeare and have seen most of his works now and studied with enthusiasm in school. Something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to discourage me. I never bothered to try to see Hamlet until recently I decided that I should at least try to see him and borrowed Olivier's version of the library. Well, I fought with that. Olivier seemed too old, not only in his appearance but also in his performance. The work had been greatly cut to adapt to a more conventional film and I think I should have lost it too much because I found it difficult to concentrate on it, soon it got bored and bothered me. I still think Olivier's Henry V is the best version I've seen of that exciting play, although I admit that I have not seen the Beeb version yet and I can not remember how it was the first time it was shown. <br /> <br /> I've heard about the full version of Hamlet by Branagh. Although I enjoyed his Much Ado, I think Beeb's version is much better and his Henry V. did not impress me at all. But I stayed a little out of Branagh after seeing his disappointing effort in a musical for Love's Labor's Lost, which is a play. I like it and it was so well made by the Beeb. <br /> <br /> Finally, when I recently acquired Beeb Shakespeare on DVD, I soon saw one of my favorite works of Shakespeare, Richard II, and Jacobi simply captivated me in the part, so I was immediately persuaded to see to your Hamlet. . What a revelation this work is now for me! Yes, it's splendid, but I think you need an actor that you can emphasize to play Hamlet, and for me this is Jacobi. Amazing. It is intriguing to note that although he is older than I understand Hamlet's character was, he does not see it, whereas in Olivier he did. Now I realize that he is also in Branagh's version and had a lot to do with Branagh's training, so I'll have to see that to see what Jocobi does with Claudius! I'm interested in discovering that Jacobi has trained Branagh because yes, you can certainly see the influence. <br /> <br /> And now I'm going to see it again ...
