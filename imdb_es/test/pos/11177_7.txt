Being a big fan of Monkey Island, I fugured that this would be terrible since Ron Gilbert did not make it. Chico surprised me! Although he's still not as good as the first two, he has the comedy he wanted. I was a little nervous about the new graphics, the new SCUMM engine and the fact that it was on a CD. But everything came together, and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. I especially enjoyed that the fight against the sword had returned. And the whole story about how to find the big ring not cursed was just amazing. Go ahead and try this two-CD adventure. And now we can rejoice, because Monkey Island 4: Escape from Monkey Island will REALLY come out REALLY soon! This autumn!
