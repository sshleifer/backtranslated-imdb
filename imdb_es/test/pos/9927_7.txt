No matter how much it hurts me to say this, the movie is not as good as it could have been. Maybe I was fooled by the innumerable exaggerated reviews here at IMDb, but I expected much more ... <br /> Sure, the idea is good, the violent scenes and the camera work are exceptional, the imagination of the genius Dario is impressive, but the film is "dirty" for a couple of mistakes that seem unforgivable. First of all, am I one of the few people who feel that the Heavy Metal music played in the most intense scenes simply destroys the atmosphere? With a different kind of music (Goblin ????) during the "needle" scenes, it would have been so intense! ... Instead, the soundtrack destroys any possibility of tension ... Secondly, the final scene of slaughter and The Last Moments of the movie are simply dumb and uninspired. I do not mean "amateur", because I love Argento's films. The end left me empty. Talk about a final impression! This is not what happens in most of Dar√≠o's films! Although, it must be admitted, Suspiria also suffers from a hasty end (even if most of it is brilliant) ... <br /> <br /> In summary, watch this movie, try to make the most of your positive points, but be prepared for some bad ones too. This is not a perfect movie by any means.
