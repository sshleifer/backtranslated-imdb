I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and I felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in a plane crash. He was not in the old rock 'n roll class, say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he was not far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been if he had sung for decades. Almost every one of those who launched were successes. <br /> <br /> So, I was pleasantly surprised by the good work that Gary Busey did to interpret it and to imitate his singing voice. It made Buddy feel proud, as did the actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) who played Holly's support group, "The Crickets." <br /> <br /> As for the music, there are some of Holly's best known songs at the beginning of the movie and it's really good with a solid ending at the end, since Holly and the guys show up in Iowa in his last concert. Busey not only sings like Holly, but he is also in the appearances department. Something was the actor's best performance, and you do not get any argument from me. <br /> <br /> I'm also glad they finished the movie on an optimistic note with that Iowa concert, instead of dwelling on His tragic accident. The end could have been a true failure, but they did not let it be.
