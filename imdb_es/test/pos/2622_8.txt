I saw this episode many times because I did not understand how Prue died. This is what happened. Prue, Piper and Phoebe try to save their innocents, a doctor, because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe climbs the stairs to look in The Book of Shadows, while Prue and Piper are protecting their innocents. Shax appears while Phoebe is still up, so Shax throws an energy ball to the doctor, but Prue pushes him out of the way and Prue takes a blow to the chest with him and hits him against the wall, the same as with Piper. Then, Phoebe goes down the stairs and says the spell, since it was only Phoebe who said it and not the power of three, Shax was only hurt. Phoebes calls Leo to cure Piper and Prue. So Leo heals them. Phoebe went to the underworld to find Cole, while Prue and Piper are looking for Shax in the streets. Piper and Prue see that Shax and Piper use their power to blow up Shax, while a new reporter has it all recorded. So everything is new about the three powerful Halliwell sisters, while Phoebe does not know anything because she is still in the Underworld. There are Repoters and people all over the Halliwell house. Then, a maniac enters the house and says "Can I be part of your coven?" and Prue says: "No, this is our house, get out of here!" and Prue uses her powers to cast her out. When the maniac leaves the house crying saying "There are the witches". The maniac becomes so angry that he shoots Piper through the stomach. Prue gets in the car and the trays to go to the hospital, but people do not let her in, so Prue uses her powers to drive people away and make people want to kill her more. They arrived at the hospital but Piper did not succeed. Meanwhile, Phoebe is in the underworld. Poho realizes that they have been exposed, so Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can invest the time. The source says that it will only invest time if Phoebe promises to stay here in the underworld. He told Phoebe what the source had told him. Phoebe says "What would make her think that I would make such a deal?" and then Cole says: "This way you can save the life of one of your sisters". Leo goes to the hospital to discover that Piper is really dead, so he tells Phoebe that it's true. Phoebe then agrees to stay alone if Cole returns to warn Piper and Prue about the speaker and Piper's death. Back at the hospital, the SWAT is about shooting Prue, but the second before they do it is rewound when they were in the mansion with the doctor, but this time Phoebe was not there to call Leo to cure Prue and Piper. throw on the wall too. The doctor died and so did Prue. But this is what I did not understand, if Piper also threw herself against the wall, why did Prue just die? Why did not they show Leo come and heal Piper and Leo trying to cure Prue? If you know the answer, please send me an email to angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS. I miss Prue, but I also like Paige and I'm glad that the show will continue
