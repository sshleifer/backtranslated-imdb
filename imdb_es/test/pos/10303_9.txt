This is a great example of Hollywood movies that do not make you think, are moving and not lacking in a sense of humor, Kevin McKidd and Paula Sage are excellent. <br /> <br /> I actually saw it on TV late at night and I can see why I missed it at the cinema, it's not the kind of movie that multiscreen "mega" cinemas show today , more pity <br /> <br /> I'm going to look for the DVD. Not for those who prefer it, the current tendency towards special effects and without history. If you liked the best-selling book "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night," you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is next to the best Scottish films, like "Small Faces" and "trainspotting". All the films in which Kevin McKidd also stars. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
