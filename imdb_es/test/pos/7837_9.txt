I found the episodes fascinating and well written. Like a television show, it was entertaining, which is what I expect from fictitious entertainment. I like the "relationship" between the teacher and his female security guard ... although sometimes her Scottish accent makes it a bit difficult to understand what she is saying. I expected there to be more than four episodes. I acknowledge that a commenter / reviewer of this series had comments related to your opinion as a doctor. I understand the comments of this gentleman; however, this is a fictional television series that aims to entertain ... not present precise facts like a documentary. Patrick Stewart performs well and makes his character believable. If you want to watch a documentary, this is not the series for you. But if you want to see unique scientific theories in a media based on entertainment, you will enjoy all four episodes.
