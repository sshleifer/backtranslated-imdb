As you know, "the best game ever played" is about golf. I used to mock the dramatic title, but through a large visual screen credited to director Bill Paxton (best known for his performance in Twister and his funny supporting roles in Aliens and True Lies) we discovered that this has much more meaning than a game . <br /> <br /> Although the film is about golf, it seems that sport is only the framework of what is really happening. What is really happening is a story of people being told that they can not fulfill their dreams, whether by age or social status. A conflict between the wishes of a child and the demands of a father. A legend of English golf that seeks to take the title home with the country breathing in the neck. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) plays Francis Ouimet, a caddy with a God-given talent who was never allowed to play golf in the first place. Despite the resentment of the "gentlemen" of the upper class, it was undeniable that Francis had a gift. What represented a greater threat was the discouragement of his father, played by Elias Koteas (Sugartime, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), who felt that playing only one game will never improve his poor living conditions. With the continued support of his mother, Francis finally comes face to face with his idol, the legendary golfer Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane). <br /> <br /> More impressive than the game itself, it was the cinematographic achievement of the film. This proved that the narration is successful through pure cinema. The whole movie could have been told without dialogue. There are scenes in the film that create a strong suspense and a powerful emotion with only images. In a particular scene, Francis Ouimet swings and the whole crowd turns their heads to see the ball flying in the distance, all but the face of Harry Vardon looking intently at Ouimet without flinching. The ways in which golfers visualize the course offer a more aesthetic enjoyment. <br /> <br /> A nice support cast completes the set. Peyton List shows the love interest and it seems worth playing, and Josh Flitter plays an adorable caddy that keeps Ouimet concentrated while the pressure impales him. Golf fan or not, you will appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that the cinema can be an excellent way to tell any story.
