I just saw the DVD version of BORN BAD and it seemed tense, gritty and, almost at the end, too graphic for the faint of heart. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman get excellent performances. For a low budget movie, this image offers. The depth of character and intelligent dialogue are two things that are not usually seen in an image of Roger Corman. Check it out on DVD!
