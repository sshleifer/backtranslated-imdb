Yesterday I saw this film again with a 20-year-old intern from my office (well, it was a quiet day after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer, and the way the dog is still waiting at the door. Are not we part of each one of us like that dog after someone we love dies? <br /> <br /> I also love the elderly in the restaurant; They remind me of some of the older people in southern New England. Where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion. And I love the wedding at the end. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is great in this movie, and Bonnie Hunt should have won a prize for everything. <br /> <br /> Bonnie - Make more movies!
