I would like to start by saying that I can only hope that the creators of this film and their sister film The Intruder (directed by the great unauthorized stylist stylist Jopi Burnama) know in their hearts the pleasure they have given me. my friends in the quiet town northeast of Jarrow. <br /> <br /> From the initial credit sequence that manages to drag very slightly despite having trapped a man on a motorcycle, the relentless destruction of a silence. laboratory, the introduction of one of the most annoying and anemic types at the same time in the history of cinema and costume design that Jean Paul Gautier would find silly and striking. Not make mistakes; This is a truly unique experience. Early climax: an explosion (get used to it, much more of where that came from!) Followed by an approach of our chubby heroine and reading the most hilarious line of the word "dad" in living memory. And then ... the musical theme ... <br /> <br /> Yes, this deserves its own paragraph. Sung by AJ, written by people who really want to remain anonymous, makes songs written for Rocky films sound like Schubert. This is the narcissism of the motivation of the hero of shit 80 at its highest point, with letters chosen as "it is only for you and for you, we have reached the limit" and there is much talk of having to "cross the line" ( It will make sense in time: our hero cares little for the limits of the good-faith police work that abounds, not to mention the Indonesian Supremes that seduced the title of the film seductively.At this point, anyone who wants to go off officially has no pulse . <br /> <br /> Our hero is the Semitic police Peter Goldson (brilliantly rehearsed by the intrusive star Peter O'Brien), the "stabilizer" of the title The approach of the man bull in a porcelain shop to fight The crime and, in particular, his disguised undercover work leaves a lot to be desired, but he is certainly an entertaining guide through the mediocre streets of central Jakarta, with the local connection of the seedy ball where he finds himself. to Captain Johnny. Trailer, as well as Peter's own wasted space on the fashion crime Sylvia Nash, which recently. So many highlights, so little time: the "arrogance" of Peter's arrogance is not such a convincing argument against the boss of the bad guys, Greg Rainmaker (the fanatics of the intruders will know the evil and crafty bastard Craig Gavin as the monstrous John White, right? Oh, well ...), the x marks the stupidity of the location map of the place, our hero is taking advantage of the heroine Tina Probost during a moment of weakness in her name, the latter appears in a sting operation dressed as a member of a particularly extravagant troop dance. And believe me, it barely covers it. <br /> <br /> There was not even time to enter the plot that revolves around the search for a drug detection system and a kidnapped teacher with an alarming but commendable amount of national pride. Or our hero appears at a funeral dressed as an extra in Boogie Nights. Or the absolutely hysterical craic between Captain Johnny and Goldson: two guys have never made more noise with friends of their friends than these clowns. The palette was possibly too subtle for me, he thinks. <br /> <br /> Oh, follow the people, and you never thought that the scenes of unbridled destruction and general chaos could be so boring, but the character interaction is great, the dialogue really is priceless and the incompetence in the program is somehow endearing. Oh and the shoe people - watch out for the shoes!
