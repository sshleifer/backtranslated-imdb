In the first scene of transformation, what is music? I heard it was "The Greeks do not receive any freeks". It's okay? I really liked that sound. I also liked the "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with lots of laughs and puns, visual gags and slapstick. The place of Mrs. Woo-Woo remembered some places that I myself visited. Ivy Venus has appeared in other things that are truly amazing. She looks very different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity did not hurt her a bit. Mark Blankfield reminds Gene Wilder in some way. Bess Armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time.
