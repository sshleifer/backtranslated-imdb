For anyone who has sought happiness, "Half Empty" is a must. This original intercultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers, which make "The Producers" seem boring. Writer Bob Patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts about life, wisdom and happiness, even writing inspirational comments on index cards while his girlfriend pours out his heart and ends his relationship. When his book on happiness, "North Star" is not successful in the United States, his editors send him to Germany for a book signing tour. In explaining his decision to Bob, the boardroom bursts into a moving song that Monty Python is proud of. Since his arrival in Hamburg, Bob's complete ignorance of the German language leaves him at a clear disadvantage. However, he remains standing, immune to the true feelings of his hosts towards him, until a fanatic and devotee arrives who changes everyone's reaction to him. <br /> <br /> The original songs drive the movie, often describing the subtext of the story. in the precision of lateral division. The cast, directed by Robert Peters, shows an immaculately dry sense of humor and lives in his characters as if they were not acting. See it for: A case study of how good intentions are totally irrelevant; How the ruthless Americans are seen abroad; What little reason is needed to explode into a song and, above all, to a silly, entertaining and unconventional laugh.
