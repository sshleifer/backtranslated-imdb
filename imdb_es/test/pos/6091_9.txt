As you can read in many reviews here, it is a movie that you love or hate, apparently not so much space for intermediate opinions. For my part, I think it's a good sign. <br /> <br /> I always appreciated this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (I never saw Titanic, for example, and I do not intend to). <br /> <br /> The English patient is caught because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment, compared to when they are "at home" (Katherine), shows how destructive love can be slow , strong and absolutely painful, and excited by extreme passion. issue, the pain of those who leave behind, the futility that one can feel to move forward. <br /> <br /> The photography is simply impressive, not to mention the game of the actors. The pace is slow, but timely, and that does justice to the book, the timeline and the depth / development of the characters. Putting this in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here) would amputate the multiple layer of this movie. People tend to have difficulties with the pace of the movies ... as if they were in a hurry to get to work. Hey, get a life! ;-) enjoy ... <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4.5 out of 5.
