When I read the synopsis of "Messiah" in the TV guide, I was not ready for what I expected. The story follows DCI Metcalfe trying to solve a scary murder case that is taking place in London. Soon he notices a pattern, there is a loose serial killer, killing people with names and jobs similar to those of the 12 Apostles and their murders are identical to those of their corresponding Apostle. The two-part series kept me right on the edge of my seat, with Metcalfe following closely behind the killer, but I always missed him in a couple of seconds and discovered the unpleasant disaster he had left behind his evil victim. The "Messiah" will surely cause a lot of controversy, but nonetheless, it is the biggest drama that the BBC has shown in a long time.
