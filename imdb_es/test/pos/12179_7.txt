Pretty good, do not expect any high culture ....... the acting is bad, the story fails, but it's still a pretty good movie to watch. why? because it's dark, a little stupid, like unpredictable and just entertaining and fun to watch. Do not expect anything, as I said, just look at it and you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> is a movie, without an argument or a memorable performance, but there are enough scenes that will make you laugh, cry or at least make you feel obliged to see it until the end ... <br /> <br /> this is all I wanted to say ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
