Shirley Knight plays Sara Ravenna, a Long Island housewife who escapes her marriage when she discovers she is pregnant. She plans to drive to the heart of the United States and start over. On the way, she picks up a friendly hitchhiker (James Caan) who calls himself 'Killer'. He soon discovers that the "killer" of good nature is really damaged by the brain, and by lifting it, without knowing it, he has assumed a great responsibility. The two drive to Nebraska, where Sara gets a job for Killer helping on a reptile farm on the highway. This is where Sara meets Gordon, a local policeman, and soon things get terribly wrong for everyone. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful drama about people disconnected from society, alienated by the choices they make or by the limits. imposed on them by others. Even with such a low budget and a very carefree attitude, the film can capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complex and divergent role and there are moments of some impressive performance from her. One of my favorites is when she phones her worried home for the first time with her worried husband. It is a scene so tense at both ends, and in every little gesture and inflection of a word, much is said about it with so little. Then comes the character of 'Killer' played by James Caan. This character is different from any other who has seen him play, and performs wonderfully. It is one of his best performances, as it is very sober and moving. <br /> <br /> The way in which Coppola develops the characters through the use of short and dream-like flashbacks is very intelligent, and adds a fragmented vision. Fast flashbacks that are self-contained and graphic contrast well with longer shots in some crucial scenes. Also, because this movie was filmed all over the East of the USA. UU., It offers an interesting and authentic image of America in the late 1960s. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many other films starring Mrs. Knight. I'm just familiar with his most recent work on television, usually playing an upset mother-in-law or a dirty old woman. It was great to see her so young, beautiful and so wonderfully subtle in this movie. It is also a shame that James Caan became the "tough man" for the rest of his career, because this movie proved that he is capable of much more than that.
