I was surprised to learn that Jimmy Caan has left this program, does anyone know why? I consider James one of the greats of all time and I was not surprised that he ended up on television, which may be better than the trash you see on the big screen. The stories are skillful and the camera faster than a bullet! You must not forget the rest of the cast: James, Vanessa (mmm!) Nikki, Molly, Josh, Mitch ... Also, can anyone tell me why in the world there is a thematic nonsense in the DVD sets, but the remix JXL by Elvis? Is a little less conversation used in the initial NBC transmissions? Does not it make sense to use a melody that you would associate with the mecha of American gambling for DVD releases?
