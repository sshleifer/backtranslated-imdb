Like Steven Seagal, I'm also a huge Van Damme fan and have followed most of his films since the beginning of his acting career. <br /> <br /> In this film, Van Damme takes on the role of Jack Robideaux, who is a cop who recently moved to New Mexico from New Orleans to work as part of the Border Patrol. Tormented by memories of his past, it's up to Jack to end a group of former Navy Seals for smuggling illegal drugs to the United States that killed his daughter. <br /> <br /> In general, I found this movie to be very good, Van Damme is in very good shape for 48 years and can really move. The action scenes are very intense and the film even throws a couple of twists of the plot to keep guessing. Unfortunately, Van Damme does not have the same intensity he said 10 years ago, regardless of whether Shepherd: Border Control is the third solid, straight film that Van Damme has made when opening the door for a bigger project. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to a Van Damme fan or a fan of action movies in general; The Shepherd: Border Control is a great movie, not as good as Hasta la muerte but better than the Hard Corps. Be sure to try this, you will not be disappointed.
