The influences of other films and stories of science fiction and suspense are evident throughout this film. The movies that come to mind immediately are Alien, Aliens and Starship Troopers. The story itself is quite simple and it is not so original, hibernating traveling through space, landing on a planet without apparent life and a "deserted" geological expedition, except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together towards their mutual survival, while the body counts. This type of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it is done well. I think Pitch Black did well. The characters are interesting and you want to know more about them as the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised at who does it and who does not. <br /> <br /> Vin Diesel plays Riddick, the convicted and stereotyped criminal who has a murderous past, physical dexterity, high tolerance for pain and who can see comfortably in the dark. You know he's going to end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie, because it's insinuated into the whole movie that he may actually be aware of things. <br /> <br /> Cole House plays the bounty-hunting drug addict who is probably a really bad guy compared to Riddick, since his character is revealed throughout the film. It is very likely to be braver when the odds and firepower are in your favor. A very selfish character who ultimately gets what he deserves. <br /> <br /> Radha Mitchell plays the co-pilot on the doomed ship, who is pulled out of deep sleep because the ship went through a swarm of meteors or the end of the tail of a comment. When she finds the dead pilot in her room to sleep, she tries to land the boat, which leads us to discover that this is a potentially fatal flaw in the character: fear of responsibility, responsibility and being a leader. His character in the short span of history is probably the one that grows the most, since in reality he has a certain conviction, he takes charge and does not sit down to wait to be devoured by the aliens that lurk at night. She, in some strange way, connects with the increasingly distant human side of Riddick, who in turn, in the end, respects her for her choices and her adherence to them. <br /> <br /> The story in some cases is manifested as I would expect, but I think you will be a little surprised by what characters survive this heartbreaking experience. This movie is an entertaining crash train in progress to watch. Go see it! <br /> <br />
