This movie is not for those who expect a martial arts show. As for historical accuracy, I will leave that topic for those better informed on that subject. I thought the performances were wonderful. Gong Li never disappoints as the ingenious and (initially) loyal consort of the King of Qin. Fengyi Zhang showed great flexibility in portraying a rule that descended into madness. He chose the route of the "Hannibal Reader", instead of resorting to peroration. For me, the best performance was of Zhiwen Wang as the super soft marquis. The character was very greasy, but in a subtle "Sir Humphrey Appleby": yes, a minister. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the prominent feature of this film. The scene in which the Marquis and his men stormed the palace was impressive. There are also a series of wonderful battle scenes. Therefore, this movie is highly recommended on the big screen.
