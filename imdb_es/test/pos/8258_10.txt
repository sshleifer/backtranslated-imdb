Please, why not put this fantastic movie on DVD? I have been looking for the same thing as the previous writer for years, what is delayed, or I show it on television. It's so understated, it's one of the most romantic and beautifully written books I've read and I think I've read some. It seems that I think it was read on radio 4, but I can not find it either. Why not try and redo it? I promise that it will be a source of income, people love that kind of stories, so, please, free it and get us out of our misery or refuse us, although I doubt it can be improved. Have any of the readers read the same author or seen the movie with Jennifer Jones? This is excellent, but not to the same extent.
