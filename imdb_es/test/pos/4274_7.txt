This show really is the American idol of Broadway. He has singing, the British boy, a boy who is sometimes nice and a super nice woman. <br /> <br /> Of course it's different because there's a song, and there's dancing and some acting (we just do not see anything of the performance). <br /> <br /> I gave this program a 7 because there are a couple of tweaks that I know many people (including me) would do if they were working for the program. The first thing that really needs to be changed is for the judges to decide who goes to their house. I know they want to find Danny and Sandy, but the United States should have the power to decide who stays at home. There is not really any point for singing. The person with the least number of votes usually goes home anyway. Another thing that I would change is to see them act in the program. What is Broadway without acting? The last thing that needs to be changed is the song that the eliminated people sing at the end. Danny eliminated always sings the same song and Sandy eliminated always sings the same song when they come out. As they sing them every week, those songs become annoying. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am not a fan of the movie, Grease, but for some reason I am hooked. This show is very underestimated. It has so many performances and memorable moments.
