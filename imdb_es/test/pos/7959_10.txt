CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST is a perfect movie. An impeccable film about all the defects of humanity. On the outside it may look like a movie about death, but it's really a movie about life. I just can not recommend this movie enough. And do not be afraid, dear readers, it's not a depressing movie. As it was said, it is a film about the brightness of life, trained under the guise of death. You'll laugh. You will cry You will realize that life is fragile and short. And it will leave the view with a better understanding of how precious life is. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> (visit www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this film and reviews of other foreign films.
