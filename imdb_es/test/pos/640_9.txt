Billy Hughes is a silent young woman who works to put on makeup in a cheap horror movie filmed in Moscow by a US director. One night Billy is locked in the movie studio. Later that night, he hears that someone could be in the building and goes to check it. It was then that he came across a woman who was brutally murdered while being filmed. After escaping from the clutches of the murderers, Billy informs the authorities, but is angry when the men show that it was an act. Billy knows what he saw and soon his life returns to be chaos, on the part of underground figures who believe that it has something of importance. <br /> <br /> I do not know how that passionate person who slept happened to me, but I thought. It was a much older movie. However, there is one thing, it has to be one of the most shocking and intense thrillers I've seen in a long time. He is simply a great suspender builder and mostly everything fits into place! The first half of the show is surprisingly captivating with tense sequences that have your heart in your throat and cloud us with an atmospheric environment of alienation. Underling this is a humorously evil black streak. The flaws appear in the story, since he loses the furious grip he had so early and the silly humor (or better comic relief of the putter) between the characters of Fay Ripley and Evan Richard is a success and is lost because he is too strong. In the long term, I probably could have done it without him. Despite some moments of crisis, this aspect did not prevent me from enjoying it. For me, the soft end with which they decided to leave simply did not feel good. <br /> <br /> The premise, curiously mysterious, was spooky for the bone and packed some disturbing objects. So the context and its emotions were multiple facets, there was something new in how all this develops and the jitters and unbearable tension are intertwined in a series of twists and turns in the plot. Actually, they made excellent use of the novel idea of ​​this disability and to harm the situation by organizing it in a foreign place where not many spoke English and, therefore, we are trapped in confusion. The delicate Marina Zudina gives a heartbreaking description of the mute American Billy. The way he could show erratic emotions through his eyes and actions gave him a bit of harshness and credibility. The director Anthony Waller films the film in a very elegant, punctual and skillful way, without losing that sombre aspect that derives from its rigid environment and a powerfully aired music persistently bothers you. The only real name to make an appearance was a small cameo by Alec Guinness. The performances of the cast were good, especially the turns of Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as the Russian assassins. <br /> <br /> This fascinating feature, which is mostly made up of unknowns, is much better than its average darkness. suspense novel. Highly recommended
