I must say that I did not expect this movie to be so good. In general, the oriental cinema presents the communist past in 90% of the films. However, this film exceeds the Romanian cinema, being worthy of more publicity. <br /> <br /> The performance is honest and not exaggerated, the plot is simple but complex, since it presents life in the Romanian suburbs, the sound surprised me, the direction was good and what else can I say ... <br /> <br /> This "Crash" from Eastern Europe took me to the film living every moment of it. I have even felt a desire that comes from me, a desire for adventure after seeing it. <br /> <br /> Look at it! You will definitely enjoy it! <br /> <br /> 7/10
