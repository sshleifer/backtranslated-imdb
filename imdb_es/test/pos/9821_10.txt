A film for mature and educated audiences ... <br /> <br /> I watched "Random Hearts" in an advanced screening shortly before its launch in North America. This romantic drama was a real pleasure. I'm sure this story will not be a cup of tea for everyone, especially if you consider the dark premise of the film. But the photo has some very edifying strong points in its favor. <br /> <br /> All-time box office draw Harrison Ford ("Star Wars", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "The Fugitive", "Air Force One," "Patriot Games") is in the top of his game as an internal affairs officer, Dutch, desperate and desperate. Ford's very subdued and nuanced performance shows quite the range it can achieve with class and determination to take the audience to its world of loss and betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and the type of film very different for Harrison Ford to adorn the screen among his great action hits. Next year, Harrison Ford returns to the action, first for director Robert Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump", "Back to the Future") in his 2000 summer thriller, "What Lies Beneath," and later on the year in Tom's film adaptation. "The sum of all the fears" of Clancy. 'Fears' will be Harrison Ford's third outing as CIA agent Jack Ryan. <br /> <br /> Director Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa", "The Firm", "Tootsie") has a supporting role in this role as a political adviser to the Scott-Thomas congresswoman. It is a very sharp and energetic performance for Pollack. Sydney Pollack is not only a gifted director, he is also one of the most credible, natural and charming actors (see also "Eyes Wide Shut"). <br /> <br /> Kristin Scott-Thomas ("The English Patient," "The Horse Whisperer" shows that you do not necessarily have to be eccentric or mundane to be considered sexy.) This is one of her best films, and she offers a tremendously elaborate and smooth performance that works well against the strength of Ford's quiet man. <br /> <br /> The subplots work wonders, especially the secondary plot that involves the investigation of Ford's character on police corruption. Look for a chilling and effective turn by "Heat" actor Dennis Haysbert, who plays Detective George Beaufort, the obstacle he must overcome in Dutch's investigation into police corruption. <br /> <br /> The rest The cast is a wonderful delight, Charles S. Dutton (who owes a lot to the lead in the movie) shows that he is one of the best character actors, and Bonnie Hunt, whom I find extremely solid. In this production, he steals most of his scenes with that wonderful, charming smile like Wendy Judd. <br /> <br /> The technical side of the Pollack thriller is first class. From the incredible photography of Dave Grusin ("The Firm" by Pollack) to the amazing image of Philippe Rousselot ("A River Runs Through It"), to the sharp edition that keeps the film as new, despite the unfortunate premise of the movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good thread of mystery, a plot of good rhythm, stories based on characters and a romance, all in one. This is an excellent story about betrayal and forgiveness. It also presents one of the most surprising, yet poignant, and probably controversial endings for a Harrison Ford film in recent times. "Random Hearts" is definitely one of the best movies of the year. <br /> <br /> (*** 1/2 of ****) or (8.5 of 10.0)
