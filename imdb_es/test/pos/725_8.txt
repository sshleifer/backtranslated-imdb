This movie was probably the best "scary movie" I've seen in years. Chilling could be a more accurate description. The ending was unexpected and that's why it took me by surprise. if it has any defect it would be the excessive use of the whole meaning of the concept of life. Since nobody really knows that answer, you definitely navigate in murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie. Put that aside and the movie is quite nice. Pope Carly should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry. the rest of the cast was somewhat unstable, however, since the focus was on Sara Nova (carly papa), his performance anchors the film. The acting skills of their costares were not a problem, since it was not their performances that drove this movie. (thankfully). Look at this movie, you should enjoy it. <br /> <br /> t
