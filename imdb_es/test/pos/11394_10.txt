What needs to change in today's attitude towards films like Boogie Nights is the focus. The approach is horrible! Comparing it to Pulp Fiction, watching only pornography and all its aspects ... come to the people, there is more to that in this beautiful film. And to all the skeptics, Paul Thomas Anderson has not proven himself worthy again and again? Magnolia is one of the main reasons why I watch American films and I still believe in this "industry" for which movies are nowadays ... And what about There Will Be Blood? That is a film that will remain in the history of cinema, whether you like it or not! If you! The so-called consumer ... you know something: F # * k! You do not deserve this, you do not deserve anything. So many artists struggle today to get recognition and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious films, even conventional, because people just want to see celebrities doing stupidities ... like the sale of Britney Spears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was very painful for me to say it because I do not want to see this, I do not want to believe that nowadays all that matters is the sum of numbers ... sales income and sales return ... I want to see magic, the magic that Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa brought and created through the language of cinema. Because that's what the PTA does. He is creating magic!
