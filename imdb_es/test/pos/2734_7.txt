15 Park Avenue, well the name is puzzled to be initially an address in New York and a film that takes place in Calcutta. However, as the story unfolds, one realizes the thin line that the director tries to go through Relations, Social Cause and, of course, the world of schizophrenia. I would say that Aparna Sen is a director who has much more to say and has less time available. Well, without a doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way, it makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our '15 Park Avenue '. It is an endless search within each one of us ... <br /> <br /> The powerful performance of Shabana Azmi is a pleasure to see. His presence on the screen brings a lot of life to the scene. In fact, it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after a long time because she expected it to be all the way from Konkona Sen's terrain. Shabana makes you feel like the skin of an older sister who runs the show for a very unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life. He loads all his ambitions and desires with a sister under 18 (who is more like a daughter to her) and an elderly mother played by veteran Waheeda Rehman. As for Guide's main actress (that's how I can remember her instantly) there's almost nothing to say except a few lines and tears here and there. Always reliable Rahul Bose plays another pivotal role in the film, showing the emotions of a middle-aged man with repentance on his face almost to perfection. This man really surprises me with the variety of work he has done. From a musician in Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr. & Mrs. Iyer and many others ?? It is one of the versatile ones that I would really like if I also had some more shots in the first part of the movie. The cameo in the film is by Shefali Shah (remembers Satya and Monsoon Wedding). She looks really beautiful and shows the role of a mother of 2 children with great ease. She gives a glimpse of today's Indian woman who has a modern but still conventional approach when it comes to her husband's previous relationships. <br /> <br /> The focus of the camera has been Meethi, played by Konkona. She and her schizophrenic world constitute the core of 15 Park Avenue. She has really worked hard for the character, but sometimes she can not relate to the audience. The fateful accident of his life tries to bind to sympathy and has only had partial success. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to address several things at once, starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a woman even in today's modern India and also the twisted relationships in a shattered family . And I think Aparna has been successful to some extent. The impotence of Meethi while working as a journalist in a rural eastern state gives us all a naked image of the country we are so proud of. <br /> <br /> Well, after I finished on Park Avenue 15, there was a sense of inexhaustible thirst inside me. I wanted more of this movie to soak up emotionally. It has been a commendable effort on the part of the director, except for some setbacks. You have to watch all those who like to see a different cinema, something with a strong purpose.
