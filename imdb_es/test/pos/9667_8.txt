Romanian cinema is little known outside of Romania. No Romanian director caught the attention of the international public, as did some of other Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Czekoslowakia or Yugoslavia. One of the few great Romanian film directors is Lucian Pintilie, who 35 years ago directed a great film 'Reconstituirea', which was quickly eliminated from the circuit by communist censorship. After that film, still a reference for the Romanian cinema, Pintilie could not create freely in Romania until the communist government fell in 1989. <br /> <br /> 'Furia' reminds me of Pintilie's film 35 years ago. The title means "The Rage" and I can not imagine why the distributors chose to translate it differently. It is a lost generation. While in Pintilie's classic the root of evil lies in the oppression and lies of the communist regime, here young people must deal with the emergence of the subculture and the moral filth that filled the void left by the totalitarian. ruler. The end is tragic and painfully expected. <br /> <br /> The film is well directed and the acting is good. Without too much complexity, he manages to create an emotional bond between the characters and the viewer. One would say that some situations seem similar to '8 Miles' or 'The Fast and the Furious' - but look at the date of production! This movie was made at the same time, if not before the Western couple. If this is really director Dan Munteanu's first film, as IMDB says, it's an outstanding debut. In any case, a good movie can compete and sell well in the western market. <br /> <br /> There is hope for a new generation of Romanian films that with a bit of luck and good distribution will make their place in the international film scene. <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale.
