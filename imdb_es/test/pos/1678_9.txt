RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955) <br /> <br /> For me, it seems a very risky idea to try a Hollywood remake of the 1955 RIFIFI classic by Jules Dassin. Planned for release in 2007, Al Pacino will apparently be the protagonist, assuming the role of Tony le Stephanois. Risky business ... How are you going to achieve this? <br /> <br /> Ironically, Dassin was included in the Hollywood blacklist and tried his luck in France and made this little masterpiece, aptly called by some "The Abuelita of all the caper and heist movies". In my opinion, it is still a unique classic in its class, beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever filmed. Whatever the opinion of the film. <br /> <br /> In recent years, RIFIFI has become dangerously overvalued. However, this French classic should not be forgotten. Go see it, before the remake comes out, to have ammunition to compare the two. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
