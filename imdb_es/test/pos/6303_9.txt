Le conseguenze dell'amore (2004) is a beautifully made film that takes small steps carefully placed towards its end that must be savored to enjoy it. From the contrasting landscapes, to the closed world inhabited by the hero, the Director takes us for control and controls us from the moment we enter the hotel. We, as the hero, will never escape the suffocating intensity and the paradoxical monotony of his criminal world, driven by crime. That the film resists the stereotypes of the mafia while delighting in them makes it even more successful. The concrete tomb, the inevitable brutal executions and the overwhelming masculinity are exposed and exposed for what they are. Only brutality and business, and nothing more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organized crime and not about loving or living for oneself, the family or others. Our hero is, in fact, a hero in the sense that he abandons his life by the touch of the beautiful waitress, the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbors in the hotel and to escape from his decorative prison. The consequences of love are certainly beautiful and brutal at the same time. Look at it!!
