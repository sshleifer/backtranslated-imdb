I saw fantastic! because in recent years, Michael Sheen has become one of my favorite actors, and if you have not seen anything before, first you are embarrassed and, in the second place, get a copy of Heartlands or Dirty Filthy Love. This production did not disappoint: Michael Sheen was almost magically transformed into Kenneth Williams and gave a performance as tragically moving as it was skillful. Not to take anything away from the other performances, but like Kenneth, Michael really stole the show. I do not know how he does it, but every performance I've seen Michael give seems to metamorphose, until the character he plays is truly credible, and no matter how hard he tries, I can not blame him. I must go to take my tea, enjoy!
