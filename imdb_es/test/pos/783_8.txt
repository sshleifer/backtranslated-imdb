A British lesson by Harold and Maude, Driving Lessons features a Rupert Grint and a Julie Walters. While it is true that Grint has the stone face like a redhead Benjamin Braddock for the first half of the film, he does not detract from the peculiar family movie: there are things that happen that are outside of his character's experience and that create a Shocked reaction. The chemistry between Walters and Grint takes the film, although the hard work of Laura Linney to make her written stereotype is human is also remarkable. These performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists like Sufjan Stevens, John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica make this popcorn movie worth a Saturday afternoon.
