I really liked this comedy. Will Smith does not do anything slow. It is always within reach with the best scripts and comedies that keep you laughing and involved in the plot. You're watching an expert comedian, who plays all his parts well. One fully believes that he is the one who is playing. I loved him and Tommy Lee Jones in The Men in Black. This comedy qualifies very well with that movie. Humor is moving quickly, and Will Smith is as sure of himself as he was in Men in Black. Quick wit, and very skilled in the art of making others score each time, but doing it with good taste and with delicacy. <br /> <br /> Will Smith seems to have perfected his comedy routine well. He was so funny. I loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate, and his face swelled, and he looked more like Cassius Clay after a fight than himself. Then, when you see him drinking the bottle of benadryl, try putting the head back in the correct size. I laughed so much He knows how to make everyone laugh.
