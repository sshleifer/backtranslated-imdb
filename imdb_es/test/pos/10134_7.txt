It is not much, but it is a validation of the values ​​of small cities and the inclusion of a young man with mental problems in his heart. <br /> <br /> I read some of the reviews and was surprised by the hostility it generated. I felt that Cuba Gooding handled the role with dignity and respect, unlike the image of the drooling fool Sean Penn in "I am Sam". <br /> <br /> The fact that it is based on a real story makes it even more comforting. Sports are taken seriously in high school in a small town in the United States (and elsewhere, I suspect) and I felt that the portrayal of these competitive students opening their hearts to a less fortunate person sounded true, at least to me. <br /> <br /> The coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and Radio, but he made the decision softly under the open and loving forms of Radio. Very well done to everyone. 7 of 10. <br /> <br /> Debra Winger, we need more of you in photos!
