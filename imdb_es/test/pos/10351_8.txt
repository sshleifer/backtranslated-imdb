I was whining like an idiot for the last ten minutes of this exceptional piece of television. I have to say that the idea of ​​sitting down to watch 90 minutes of what was meant to be a rather depressing material on a Sunday was not welcome. The idea of ​​another, more than worth winning, the possibility of winning at the BAFTA did not excite me ... However, the final result left me at 6. This is one of the best television programs I've seen in a long time . For years I had the impression that all the originality had left the BBC drama department. Our Friends in the North was the last production that really impressed me and that was 10 years ago. However, faith is restored and honor is satisfied. David Tenant was amazing! So many actors that I can really think of would have gone to the city in a part like this, but I never saw Mr. Tenant as an actor or as the Doctor, all I saw was Alan Hamilton. They have not taken my heart so much since the performance of Daniel Craigs and Geordie Peacock so many years ago. Sarah Parish was also amazing and I really hope that this role will give her better roles in the future. All cast members were excellent, but a special mention must be made to the director who really placed us inside Alan's head. The toaster scene, in particular, made me feel quite dizzy.
