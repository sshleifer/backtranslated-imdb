As a veteran screenwriting instructor at Richland College in Dallas and a former MGM screenwriter in the days of decent movies, I'm delighted to have clicked on Channel 33 in Dallas tonight and seen this lovely movie in which Betty White is GORGEOUS and A yearning for the good old days of truly good movies before Hollywood started hitting all this crap for teenagers. If a producer is listening, I would like to say that there are enough of us over 60 who will gladly pay a dollar to see a film that has no weapons, no murders, no special effects, no sex, no violence, and only a good one. A touching story of human relationships that leaves you with a good feeling of warmth, as this movie did for me.
