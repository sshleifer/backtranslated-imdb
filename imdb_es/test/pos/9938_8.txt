A young theater actress grudgingly accepts her first major role in a play like Lady Macbeth thanks to the mishap of the production diva in front of a moving car. Betty (Christina Marsillach), winner of his praises, finds horror instead, since the one responsible for taking her to this point terrifies her in cruel ways. <br /> <br /> First is her boyfriend, stage director, Stefano (William McNamara). brutally stabbed with a knife while she has to look, tied to a pillar in her uncle's vast mansion, preventing her eyes from closing thanks to needles stung under her eyes, with a prick in the result if she blinks. By allowing him to escape, Betty is again in this unfortunate position, when a specific gold chain is found in her Lady Macbeth wardrobe that the madman had destroyed after killing a series of crows that escaped from their cage in the equipment room . , by the designer of clothes that is first struck on the ground by an iron and later stabbed with a pair of scissors (... to fill this unpleasant scene, the chain falls on his throat with the killer who has to open his throat to find him While Dario does not elaborate this act specifically, Dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors to obtain an optimal effect, since the camera often retreats to the dead face of the victim, having no place to go, Inspector Alan Santini (Urban Barberini, who interprets it with coldness and soda at the request of Dar√≠o), promises to catch the psychopath, since Betty trusts her few remaining friends to feel comfortable, the theater director Marco (Ian Charleson, of GHANDI & CHARIOTS OF FIRE, who would later die of AIDS, a sad note, Dario revealed in an interview that Charleson informed him at the end of the session that he was HIV positive) on stage after a successful career of horror films despite having been rejected by critics and friend. Look (Daria Nicolodi, the old grip of Dario), his agent and confident. But, the serial killer is quite motivated and, of course, there will be a confrontation between them in the theater, since Marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal. <br /> <br /> I think this is Dario in its most savage and nihilistic form. Although he has undoubtedly made frightening films later (as suggested by his Masters of Horror and SLEEPLESS entries), this film really increases the stakes in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath. His method of forcing Betty to watch was a joke by Dario in relation to the kind of audience that likes to look away from the most horrible parts of horror movies. I found myself rubbing my eyes every time she just had to blink (... brilliantly, Dario shoots the puncture from the point of view achieving a tormenting effect from our perspective as if we were the only ones with the needles with duct tape that kept our eyes open ). I like how Dario will show Betty's widened eyes, horrified by what she is forced to watch, while the blood cuts the needles when she has no choice but to blink. The photographic work of Ronnie Taylor is impeccable, like the point-of-view shot of the crow in the theater at the end while looking for the killer. Or, when the camera "travels" through the rooms in the theater following the killer who wants to see his muse from the seat of a box. Or, the sequence of the dream in which Betty remembers an event related to the death of her mother by a murderer, who puts on the same mask and gloves that cause her trauma today. The climax, in my opinion, is the sequence of bullet shots through the peephole, masterfully organized by everyone involved as the camera follows a bullet that shoots through the eye of a victim, exploding from the back of his head, going through a phone that Betty planned to use to ask for help. We even receive a raven that pecks the killer's eyeball (... to add to this vicious scene, the crow is shown with the eyeball circling in its beak). The only aspect I did not like, often pointed out by the detractors of the film, is the "final" ending that I personally considered to be a bit unnecessary, but I guess Dario wanted to point out that Betty was not like her mother. a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies that, in a twist, is related to why the killer torments our heroine. The rock music used during the violent scenes did not bother me, because I felt that those moments of evil graphic attacks needed a jarring blow that heavy metal can often provide.
