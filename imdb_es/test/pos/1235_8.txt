While cartoons and / or references to people or things from the entertainment industry or even product brands are usually a staple in shorts like this, they are not used here in quantity. Most individual gags are rather generic. As I will give examples, there will be spoilers below: <br /> <br /> There are only three (well, technically four, there is a quick one at the end of the cartoon) cartoons that I saw, which is a bit low for this kind of short, although one is a prominent character with a good amount of activity. They are Jack Benny (as Jack Bunny), Leopold Stowkowski and the inimitable Ned Sparks (like crab in a can) it is very likely that, if a crab was involved in a Warner Brothers during the years 1930-1940, the caricature was used. It would be Ned Sparks). There are also references to Billy Rose's Aquacade and a riff on a radio show called "Henry Aldrich" (soon, mother!), A play by Superman (Superguy here) and the villain is a takeoff of "King Kong". That's all for that kind of joke. <br /> <br /> The products themselves are mostly generic and the gags are more played with basic items in unusual situations, like turtles that come out of soup cans to attack the villain like tanks. , cans of tomato soup making "La lata", gingerbread men who become parachutists, using parachute handkerchiefs, etc. The gags are very good and is an excellent example of a cartoon by Bob Clampett. Clampett had beaten his step like a Director at this point and while it is not even close to his best job, it is not to sneeze either. This short can be found in Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Vol. 3, which is an excellent set that I highly recommend. In itself it is also recommended.
