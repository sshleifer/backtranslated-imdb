First things first ... <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons is a much better movie and very different from the Da-Vinci code. <br /> <br /> Following the recent series of comic book movies, remakes and questionable resurrections of aging franchises. It's refreshing to see a very solid and entertaining movie that is devoid of unstable camera-shooting techniques, lens flare, excessive GCI and above action sequences. <br /> <br /> In this regard, Angels and Demons almost feels old-fashioned. It offers a good and considered debate on the historical subject of religion and science, and offers a perspective of the parallels between the great houses of God in Rome (beautifully shot by the way) and the temple of modern science, which is the great CERN. Hadron collider installation. <br /> <br /> Hanks makes Hanks pose as the smart guy and adapt to the role much better than the second time he performs at Da-Vinci. A solid cast offers a good support, with a particular highlight that is Armin Mueller-Stahl's stoic cardinal. But the main salvation of the movies is their rhythm. During all the time I was totally absorbed in the story, the film never gave me time to sit down and recognize its flaws in logic. <br /> <br /> My only serious criticism is that part of the science described is at best arguably refers to the authenticity of the real world. But that is not the fault of the filmmakers, rather an observation of the old adage that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, the story is an adventure adventure and a race against time with a good amount of intelligence and a nice touch or two on the way. <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend it to fans of any of the national treasure films (which this clearly imitates but with a much more serious vibe) and fans of adventure stories in general.
