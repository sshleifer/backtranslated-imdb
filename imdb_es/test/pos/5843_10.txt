Oz was a fantastic show, as long as the frequent male nudity does not discourage you. There was too much frontal male nudity in this program, more than any other program you would see in a porn channel. Less than that, it was the best television show, and one previous commentator said "better than Prime Suspect". The main suspect is Tom and Jerry against The Simpsons. Do not answer If you have DirecTv, now you are doing it again from the beginning in Channel 101, now you are in Episode # 3. Highly recommended. The creator Tom Fontana also did Homicide, which was an AWESOME show. But why all the male nudity? We all know that things happen in prison, but did you really need to show them so often? That was the only thing that got me out of the show. If I want to see naked men, rape men, kill someone myself and witness firsthand. Otherwise, I like my black penis free TV shows every five minutes.
