Okay, sure, this movie is a bit of the hokey side. It's hard to take comic book characters and put them in movies with credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone?), But this goes a long way. I've never read the real comic, but that really does not matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly because of its merits, not because it is a faithful account of another person's idea. (Unless it's a movie based on a true story, that requires at least some attempt at truth and precision). So, why will I give this movie a pretty high rating? Because he tries. Try very hard. In my book, that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Many films have been made with the main subject of vampires. It seems that everyone has their opinion about the vampiric tradition, be it the cross, the silver, the garlic, the aversion to sunlight, whatever. Some of those ideas are included here. The story is familiar ... a group of vampires conspire to conquer the world, with one person (mainly) standing in their way. Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses, who have moved slowly but surely towards the world and share it with humanity. For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist around them. Vampires have even taken relatives, people who aspire to be vampires and do the dirty work of vampires to show them they are worthy to be "converted." <br /> <br /> Now that I think about it, there are many elements of this movie similar to the story of the Roddy Piper movie, They Live. A hidden enemy, a hidden group of people who plan against them, the fight to save humanity ... everything that is also present in Blade. <br /> <br /> The performance is not the best here. Snipes is, at best, just a little better than some of his other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relative newcomer, is not so bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blade's partner (it's for Blade what Chip is for The Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best job of all the cast here, like the "boss" vampire you love to hate. <br /> <br /> I do not know, but I loved the special effects of this movie. From the blood-soaked vampire-style rave to the inevitable fight at the end of the movie, the special effects are not so bad. There's certainly enough blood and blood for everyone, but after all, this is a vampire movie, right? The various forms and types of weapons used by Blade are quite unique, and are not generally used in contemporary action movies. Snipes has more instinct with a sword decked out than he, for example, with a machine gun. Also, there is much more thought in fighting with a sword than just blowing someone up. (Unless, of course, you are Indiana Jones). <br /> <br /> In general, this is not the best action movie ever made, but it is not bad either. As an added benefit, the musical score and the soundtrack are also great. Tell me, in what other movies can you listen to a super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek ?! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
