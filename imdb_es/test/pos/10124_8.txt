Inspired by true events, radio is one of the dramas with the best interpretation and sense of heart that I have seen widely spread at some time. It is definitely one of the best films of the year 2003. <br /> <br /> The stars of the radio Ed Harris, who is still worthy of an Oscar in this film, as football coach Harold Jones. Coach Jones has taught soccer all his life and loves the game. However, Coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day Radio, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance since Men of Honor, arrives at the soccer field while the coach's team is practicing for the game. Some team members then tie the radio and throw it into a building. Then they hit the building and, finally, Coach Jones suspects something is wrong. He approaches and helps Radio, which is scared, and from that moment Coach Jones and Radio share a very special bond. The radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in football games and school events. It also becomes Coach Jones's main interest in life over football, which at the beginning was his top priority for both his family and Radio. <br /> <br /> The film deals with all kinds of real-life problems, including what their priorities are in life, accepting people for what they are, even if they are different, death and family relationships. The film touches all those themes and more, and is extremely well made and the director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film. What I liked the most about the radio was how real it felt. The performances were like seeing something in real life happen right before your eyes. The radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. Some parts were quite funny, while others were very serious and sad. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think the radio was very overlooked by critics who only got average ratings. They should have heads up there, because it's amazing how this movie can only get 2 star reviews and something like rock school can get 3 or 4 stars, it does not make any sense to me. Also the performances as I mentioned above are first class and worthy of Oscar. In my opinion, both Ed Harris, who I think is underestimated as an actor, as Cuba Gooding Jr. should get some kind of nomination for this film. Radio is one of my favorite movies of the year and it gives me reasons to keep watching some of the great Hollywood movies. My final grade for Radio is 9/10.
