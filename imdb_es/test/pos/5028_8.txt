That pretty much sums it up ... corny. The incapacity to act of MacDowell is sometimes painful, and Hurt needs the money to assume such silent roles, but I still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Why? In one word, Travolta. He is great in this movie. Still, I can not give the movie too high a score, but it certainly deserves better than it seems to be getting.
