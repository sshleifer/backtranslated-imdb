I just watched this movie during the weekend, and I must say that I enjoyed it a lot. The 2 Italo-American actors are excellent as always (Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia). It is obvious that the director was influenced by 2 great films of the past directed by Italians. He was mainly influenced by Dino Risi and his film IL SORPASSO. It is the story of 2 young people who meet by chance and become friends. One is extroverted and the other introverted. They enjoy all day together and at the end of the day, the shy learns that there is more to life than their usual routine of monotony. The same happens to Albert de Santi. Unfortunately, IL SORPASSO has a very similar ending and this apparently influenced the director of ON THE RUN because he uses the same technique but with a touch. I had expected something, but I was surprised to see that it turned out to be the opposite. If you watch both movies you will understand. The other film that influenced the director is AFTER HOURS, directed by the great American Italian Scorsese. I highly recommend the 3 movies !!
