Okay, it was black and white and probably a 2 "tape, which means that the BBC deleted it, right? But it remains in my mind for so many years (1960 ??) as a perfect fragment of the story animated by the most innovative Edition and wonderful actors full of youth and courage. <br /> <br /> I WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN! Are you reading this, BBC? Find your original 2 "tapes or the 35mm film, deal with actors and Directors for rights, and reissue! I know, I know, some of them are dead, others are missing in action. <br /> <br /> Where else can I see Mary Morris as the 'snake heart wrapped in the skin of a tiger'? Where else can I see Paul Daneman do 'Now is the winter of discontent ...'? Or Robert Hardy delivers his speech about 'that idol ceremony'?
