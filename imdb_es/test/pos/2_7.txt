My criteria for measuring a movie's observation ability is if I get nervous. If I start to change position and I realize that my butt is sore, the film is too long. This movie did not even come close to being boring. Surely in some places it is safe, but never boring. <br /> <br /> All the other military branches have had love notes written about them and have seen their recruitment levels increase, why not also the Coast Guard? They are definitely undervalued, until the day the ship sinks. <br /> <br /> The movie was very nice and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the old male man who does not know when to give up. However, I was very impressed by the performance of Ashton Kutcher. I've never liked it, I've never seen any of his television shows and I've always considered him immature ... well, punk. In this movie, he does a great job! He is on track to have the status of a leader. I think the movie they showed us must have been a preliminary cut or something, because about 2/3 of the entry, the film became very grainy, the sound level decreased and microphones were seen falling everywhere. Also in the screening were representatives of the film, who sought comments from the audience, especially in the parts of the film that we did not like. <br /> <br /> ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER: The comment I gave concerned aa couple of lines at the beginning. Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife, Sela Ward, pack his things and move. He says: "Maybe I should be the one to leave." And she replies: "No, you do not know where there is anything in this house, I should be the one who goes." This does not make sense: if she knows the design so well, Costner is right, he * should * be the one to leave.
