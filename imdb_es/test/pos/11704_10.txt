<br /> <br /> Crackerjack, starring Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy, both parts of the comedy cast on Saturday night in the early 90s "The Late Show", Bill Hunter, an icon of the Australian movie and John Clarke, whom I still regularly see on Australian television with Brian Dawe. <br /> <br /> Crackerjack, loosely about a guy in his 30s (Jack Simpson, played by Mick Malloy) who pays his annual membership at the local bowls club in order to get a few parking spaces for which he himself uses and rents others as cheap parking in the center of the city. <br /> <br /> The club is in difficult times, and gathers all the resources and members it can, Jack receives a phone call that tells him to show up for next Saturday's game or lose his membership (and , consequently, your parking space) <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the rest, but the film is fun, cheerful and contains Everything that should be a good Australian movie. <br /> <br /> If you are not Australian, then some of the jokes and humor will certainly disconcert you, if you are an Australian: do yourself a favor and sit down before Crackerjack. It is already available on DVD, I already have my copy! <br /> <br /> 10/10. Awesome movie! <br /> <br />
