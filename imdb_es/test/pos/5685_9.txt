I live here in crocodile territory and I remember well the real events that inspired this film. Our bowels fall off every time we hear about a crocodile attack. BLACK WATER is, quite simply, the best crocodile movie I've seen. While I loved ROGUE last year for all its effects and striking scenes, it was the local scenes that captured our audience. We laugh at ROGUE more than anything. However, BLACK WATER really resonated with the restlessness and fear you may experience when you are alone in the mangroves (you call them swamps or bayous, but they are mangroves). All tourists must see this movie before heading to the Northern Territory. The ending was a little disappointing after the rest of the movie, but I will add it to my DVD collection when it becomes available.
