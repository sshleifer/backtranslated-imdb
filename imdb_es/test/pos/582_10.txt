Remembering the works of Jim Henson years after his death is like taking a look at another moment. Unlike most so-called creative types who try to sell or, worse yet, cynically exploit children today, Jim never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child. And if there was ever a time when he demonstrated this, leaving Labyrinth aside, it's the 1979 Muppet movie. Filmed as an allegorical story about how Henson started working on children's television as a puppeteer and ended up with his own show. Half an hour on prime-time television, The Muppet Movie ends with an affirmation of everything more progressive, what the comprehension class would say. Children who did not meet the expected standard during the eighties. And as we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and can not talk about anything so as not to offend someone, here is the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of The Muppet Show . I have said it in other comments, but I must say it here. A great light in the world went out the day Jim Henson died. <br /> <br /> The movie Muppet begins with its cast seated to see the premiere of what was to be seen during the next eighty minutes. In short, precise movements, we are presented to the main players, as well as to some of the minors. And when the story itself begins, we are given a great song for us to enter at the moment. The Rainbow Connection painted a beautiful and sad image of what the Muppets were, especially Kermit. These were not just a bunch of felt puppets with unique personalities that combined to put on a show. They were living beings based on a part of all of us, we only wrote much more audaciously than we are used to. As each Muppet was introduced to us, we saw another reflection from ourselves and, of course, the children in the audience would respond differently to each character. Therefore, everyone had a favorite. When Animal appeared behind a drum kit and tried to eat a saucer, I knew I had found one of mine. Today, I'm more a fan of Swedish Chef, but I do. <br /> <br /> Complementing the characters was a series of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities. Can you imagine that? He shared a vision of Dr. Teeth and his band, as well as the creative soul of Henson. But the most relevant song for me was Gonzo's number, asking me what it is and where it came from. Many of us would spend our whole lives looking at the stars and, like Gonzo, saying that we knew we would return there some day. Not that all the songs were so serious, of course. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent (or lack of it) and hit the road. If evidence were required that current "musicians" have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something that can be heard, this would be the number. Never before, and never again, the group dynamics of a cast and music will complement each other so perfectly. With the puppeteers and the voice actors so perfectly at the top of their game, the human cast had a lot to live for. <br /> <br /> What makes it even more amazing that the human element is also up to the task. of the deal. The cameos literally dot the film, and everyone, from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas, appears to offer their support. Even Richard Pryor, the last man you'd expect to see in a movie about the Muppets, seems to create a hilarious moment. Mel Brooks's cameo is as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when I was a small child, but I suspect that's because Henson knew why I found it disturbing now. However, the great acting force comes from Charles Durning, who like Doc Hopper embodies everything that both Henson and his audience decided to resist. At each crossroads, Hopper comes to offer Kermit the opportunity to sell and betray his own class. Or perhaps, the offer ceases to be the correct word when Hopper's attempts to guarantee Kermit's compliance become increasingly energetic and violent. All this is a great metaphor of how each artist has his heart broken by the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, Animal also appears to remind us that the fact that our friends are not sweet and tender does nothing. Not less than a friend. In fact, Animal turns out to be Kermit's best friend at the time. And that has been the central message of every good show or film in which Henson has been involved since then. That to reject or reject others simply because of linguistic or aesthetic differences could literally be the worst mistake that has been made. There is no doubt that in today's world, where an imbecile in a purple suit can tell my children that they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and are not yet being seriously investigated by the child welfare authorities, the Henson's creatures workshop could never have taken off the ground. To erroneously cite the title of the album, daring to be stupid is one thing, but imposing the choice on others is another matter. The movie Muppet demonstrates how Henson dared to ask everyone to think, both inside and outside the proverbial box. There will never be another completely like him, but he would never want us to stop trying. <br /> <br /> Therefore, The Muppet Movie is the epitome of ten out of ten films. If we had to send a movie to the cosmos to show intelligent life that we are worth more than being eliminated, that would be it.
