A beautiful movie The character of John Garfield is a distant relative of Jean Valjean from "Les Miserables", while Detective Rains remembers Javert from Victor Hugo, the ruthless arm of the law. <br /> <br /> As in many other films, the city personifies evil, while the country and nature represent sanctuary, redemption and a second chance for those whose life seems doomed forever. But even in the light of day, the danger can suddenly appear, as evidenced by the excellent scene in the reservoir. John Garfield - an actor who, as Leonard Maltin points out, should be rediscovered: I have never been disappointed in any of his films, except for his support in the "gentlemen's agreement", but it was not his fault. It gives a sensitive and sincere interpretation and on the side of the audience. with him as soon as he is unjustly accused (the first sequence shows a rather unpleasant hypocrite, but all his evidence redeems him and how we feel about him during the last scenes with Rain detectives.) Colorful characters (grandmother and children) add lots of joie de vivre that is necessary.The humor is also present in the game of strip poker, since the brats of the Dead End are a rich child. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
