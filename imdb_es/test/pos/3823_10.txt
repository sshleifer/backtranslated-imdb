When the new external limits began, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to decline, most episodes simply became ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the best and the worst of the series. <br /> <br /> Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining for the flops. <br /> <br /> 1. Beyond life: as an institution, the US military-industrial complex. UU He is both evil and paranoid, not to mention stupid. However, individuals with great integrity serve our country, and will obey their conscience even at an incredible price! In the end, the aliens do not need to say a word. Those who have no conscience are fools who will be held in absolute contempt! <br /> <br /> A truly subversive episode! One that should appear on prime time television for all to see! This could be a revelation for some, but people without conscience should not be allowed to serve in our army! Neither ends justify the means! <br /> <br /> 2. Theory of relativity: a good person can be forced to make a split-second decision between good and evil to save the lives of helpless intelligent beings and at a great cost to one same. What makes this decision even more difficult is the hard choice: be isolated from exotic strangers with whom you can not even communicate, except with gestures, or accompany a group of people that you think will keep you safe from unknown dangers, even if they are ruthless and devoid of compassion! <br /> <br /> This episode is great! What fuels this depravity is a good old-fashioned greed. This episode is one of the most forceful accusations of capitalism, transnational corporations and the violation of the environment, which I have seen in my life! Unlike real life, justice is served here, and quickly! <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable lines is when the ruthless corporate thug said something to the effect: "We did the same in the War of the Amazon Rainforest." Alluding to the killing of the Amazonian Indians who were trying to protect their tropical forests so that they were not exploited, as a justification to literally kill again in the name of the "survival of the fittest". Something that Darwin never wanted to be taken literally! <br /> <br /> 3. Alien Shop: You can use tremendous power for good, even from an exotic alien. This power can be used to heal instead of destroy. Simple mortals can learn from their mistakes! Even a criminal can see the light if he is given ample opportunity to do so. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a strong medicine is needed, but we can all wake up and change our self-destructive ways! <br /> <br /> 4. The Grell: An extraterrestrial can be a figure similar to the one of Christ! In the distant future, slavery can be justified, once again, in the name of expediency! Basically, good people can be corrupted. Sometimes, a person needs to experience great shame to see the evil that he is committing. Children are closer to the truth than adults. Those with political power have a tremendous responsibility! Another work of genius! As a species, "Do human beings learn from history?" <br /> <br /> Flop number 1: Quality of mercy: Loose lips, sinks, boats! When you are at war, please keep your mouth shut about important military plans. Wow, did I really need to watch a soap opera of an hour to solve this? I wonder, did the creators of The Outer Limits run out of ideas, or did the corporations disconnect? Dark and ugly, which is useless, but for despair! <br /> <br /> Flop Number 2: Beyond the veil: So bad that there is no moral, but this: when you are locked in a psychiatric hospital, use common sense, please! This episode is so bad that it disgusts. What an X-Files scam! Do not waste your time on this one! You will thank me later! <br /> <br /> It is a sad comment that The Outer Limits lowered the tubes towards the end of their execution. Subversive episodes, like the first four, could not last forever! It was a miracle that they were made! With luck, some day, other brave souls will follow the tradition of subversive external limits in a new territory. <br /> <br /> If you happen to be such a daring person, a good place to start is with a unique book: "Anatomy of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction," edited by Neil Barron. As far as I'm concerned, the most complete book ever written on the subject.
