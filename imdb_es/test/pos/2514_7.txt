An insipid title disguises this solidly carpenter example of old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment, this film demonstrates a great success of several disparate elements: a period piece, a romantic drama, a crime film and a political thriller. Interestingly, although made by Fox, its protagonists? Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck ?? both used to be associated with other studies; Your chemistry on screen here is palpable and eventually led to marriage in a couple of years. Although a little too young, Taylor is a hasty hero (a Marine personally appointed by President McKinley to discover the culprits behind an organized cleaning of numerous banks); As expected, as soon as he detected them (led by the gentle Brian Donlevy and the carol Victor McLaglen), he falls in love with a singer (naturally, Stanwyck) who has thrown himself into the gang. Although, to tell the truth, the song is far from being the fortress of the actress. In the same way, apart from having to prove his worth to reach his fold, he has to compete with McLaglen for Stanwyck's attentions; by the way, the practical joker character of the previous one reminded me a lot of Charley Chase in SONS OF THE DESERT (1933), which, by the way, was also directed by William A. Seiter. Later, Taylor has two minds about involving Stanwyck in the imminent bait and tries to offer his resignation to the president while he runs away with the girl. But the jealous rival interrupts his plans. The robbery went wrong, we found Donlevy dead and the other two in jail; Taylor's hopes for McKinley's intervention? Having learned in the meantime the identity of the elusive and obviously prominent 'inner man'? Apparently they are frustrated when the President ends up murdered (a great twist of the plot, although the suspense resulting from the eleventh hour feels invented). To return to the mix of styles of the film, even if vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste, the romantic triangle slows down things and skimps a bit the aspect of the thriller, is this an attractive production? with the actors already mentioned, well supported by people like John Carradine (who inexplicably disappears after a single scene), Douglas Fowley, Sig Rumann and, like two American presidents, Sidney Blackmer (the bubbly Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy ( McKinley).
