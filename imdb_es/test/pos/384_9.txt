<br /> <br /> "Let's swap murders: your wife, my father", a seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers, Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet during lunch on a train trip. Guy, a solid and respectable tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, the flirtatious Miriam, will not divorce him to marry Senator Anne, laughs at the conversation as a joke. The next week he does not laugh anymore. In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense, Bruno stalks Miriam through a carnival and strangles her. As he does so, his glasses fall off and we see the murder strangely reflected twice through his glasses. With a cold and loving heart, Bruno, once the deal is over, approaches the dreadful individual who waits, even presses him to "do his part". Things are not helpful when Anne's younger, precocious sister appears suspicious of the murder of Guy of Miriam. Then, accused of a murder he did not commit and expected to commit another, what is Guy going to do? The power of this film is in the presentation of human beings who have a killer side in their nature, and this makes Hitchcock to perfection.
