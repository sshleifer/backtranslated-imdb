What a refreshing change from the PG movies that make teenage girls jump out of bed, that high school kids count how many girls can "connect", children drink, do drugs, etc., etc., etc. Hiaasen has written so many books that are fun but hardly classic literature. but he has finally written something that high school kids want to read. And this movie sends a message to children that maybe they can make a difference, that maybe their voices can be heard. Filmed in South Florida, the landscape is beautiful, natural and REAL. Who cares if it's predictable, and a little cheesy. That's how FREE WILLY was and look how well he did it. This is a good family movie .......... a rare breed.
