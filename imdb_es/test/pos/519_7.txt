"Witchery" is a horror yarn Euro-Trash! David Hasselhoff is very funny in this case and, unfortunately, he is one of the best actors. Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife ... is incredibly bad! The plot of this movie is ridiculous too. It has some holes, which you can not help but notice, but it's still entertaining at all. <br /> <br /> The gore in "Witchery" is really amazing. I loved the part where the old bag "sucks" in the trash and ends up in the fireplace for roasting! And the part where the lady "takes advantage" of the devil was very disturbing. I would say that this is a must for the gorehounds. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a super-produced and well-performed movie, look elsewhere. But if you like the Italian style of the old school and the gore above, "Witchery" belongs to your shelf. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the low rating here! What were you waiting for, "The Exorcist"? 7 out of 10, children.
