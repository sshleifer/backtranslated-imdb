I'm not sure to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy movie. The first time I saw this, I really could not make out the ending and that's the only part of the movie that seems to lack depth and left me a little depressed for a while. Then I saw him a second time and I realized how good the performance was and I had no idea why he received the scant attention he had at that moment. <br /> <br /> The unforgettable performances of young Mazzello and Wood should have made this movie a classic. <br /> <br /> Although it was probably intended to be a fantasy / drama by the original writer / director (Evans), once Donner took over, he presumably did so with a more dramatic perspective, especially the final, that He left a lot to be desired as to what really happened to Bobby: did he get killed? Did he escape and did he really do all those fantastic trips? Or was it just an imaginary story woven by Hanks to prove a point to the Children? <br /> <br /> But in general it was not the end of a happy ending to which we are so accustomed in a children's film. Maybe it's because it's not just that. <br /> <br /> To see what could have been a more classic ending, visit the official site of Elijah Wood where you will find the first rough draft of the conclusion of the film (presumably by the original writer) <br / > <br /> Also a note of Hans Zimmer's music that is one of the best soundtracks I've heard, a mixture of childhood and dark feelings throughout the film. A great CD to get if you can. <br /> <br />
