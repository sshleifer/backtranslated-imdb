Has there ever been an angel of death like MIMSY FARMER in Barbet Schroeder's heroine play in the 1960s? Jean Seberg type with a hypodermic. The Pink Floyd score. Despite some ultimately insignificant weaknesses, a classic, blatantly stripped by Erich Segal / Noel Black for his inept JENNIFER ON MY MIND (1971), although Tippy Walker, playing a similar character, is very addicted to drug addicts in this last disaster. MORE, however, is excellent, a great drug movie of the 60s and, simply, an important document of its time. It's a cult movie, so join the cult. <br /> <br /> No American film, as far as I can remember, traces the same territory. MIMSY is an amazing archetype, elevating this to mythical realms. Not for the faint of heart. Great sex scenes too.
