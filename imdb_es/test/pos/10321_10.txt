This is the first short of Three Stooges with Shemp that I saw, and it's one of my favorites! <br /> <br /> That's what I really liked about Shemp when he came back after Curly hit, he did not try to be like Curly, it was his own character, and that's what I admire! Shemp is my third favorite puppet, I like him more than Curly, but I like Curly as much as Shemp. Shemp is great, it's fun, it's silly, it's SHEMP! <br /> <br /> I really loved the scene where he dropped the coin and Moe entered the cabin with him to find her and they ended up tangled in the cables and really hurt. <br /> <br /> But what I really thought was terrifying was when Shemp crashed his face against the glass of the phone booth, he looked like a deformed Professor Snape! <br /> <br /> Poor Shemp, He had a lot of bad things happen to him in this short, but that's typical of the Three Stooges, they always have a lot of bad things happening to them! <br /> <br /> This short is another must-see for Three Stooges fans! <br /> <br /> 10/10
