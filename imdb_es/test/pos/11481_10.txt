There was a video in the United States called 'Cartoon Scandals' that showed about an hour of forbidden cartoons. <br /> <br /> Most of them were from the time of the Second World War. That's where I first saw (and heard) this one. <br /> <br /> The rooster during the transmission of opening news becomes a vulture with an Asian face that says 'cock-a-doodle-doo, please'. After that, eight minutes of propaganda are reproduced as a newscast. <br /> <br /> It is viscerally racist, but when you see it as the piece of history that it is, it can (and should) be forgiven. <Br /> <br /> Slice ration cards to make sandwiches. <br /> <br /> Show the ruins of Rome while it is called Moussolini 'Ruin # 1.' <br /> <br /> A sweeper using a broom. <br /> <br /> A manned pump with the pilot that says 'RET ME OUT OF HERE'. <br /> <br /> And of course the stereotypes. All Japanese were drawn with big teeth, constantly bowing and saying "please" at the end of each broken sentence. <br /> <br /> What's the most fun? The anti-aircraft siren were two slanted men who stabbed each other with pins. "oooo-OOOOOO" <br /> <br /> Hi AOL. Let this one come out. It deserves notice. My wife laughed at this. And she is 100% Japanese.
