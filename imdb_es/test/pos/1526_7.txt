The good news is that the director is reportedly committed to the cause of Amnesty International and anxious to convey a strong message about freedom of expression and the evil of oppression. The plot is clearly original and the actors are two of my absolute favorites. The not so good news: 'original' is not the buzzword of all when you visit the movies or the video stores. In addition, prominent critics such as Maltin and Roger Ebert have dismissed the film as a genuinely failed attempt to turn a theatrical play into a cinematic form. If I remember correctly, the title is taken from the fairy tale that the character of Stowe has written and that has made it a possible subversive and suspicious in the fictional place where the story unfolds. His dreams are dangerous for the government, represented here by Rickman as the intense and manipulative interrogator. Given that these two people are practically the only ones that appear in the film, the director faces a real challenge to maintain the viewer's attention. In the end, I found everything fascinating. Not impeccable and definitely not for everyone, but rewarding. It is not close to a masterpiece like 'A short film about Kieslowski's murder' or as explanatory as 'The dead man walking'. But if you like those movies or any of the Costa-Gavras political thrillers, you can also appreciate this one. Just do not wait for any overexploit sermon or revealing action sequences.
