I'll start by saying that I've always been a Bonnie Hunt fan ... She always adds life to any character she plays, and did a wonderful job in her directorial debut. <br /> <br /> I have to admit this is a movie for girls ... But with this in mind, it's a wonderful story, that touches many emotions and provokes all kinds of reactions. <br /> <br /> This movie describes real life as people with real life. as situations (Although I have to exclude the coincidence that is most of the film) <br /> <br /> It is a love story ... not only of a man and a woman, but of the love of the family, the friends and the loved ones. some pasts (Even pets). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. Well worth the rent or purchase.
