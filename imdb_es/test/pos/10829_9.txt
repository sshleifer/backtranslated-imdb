The director and author Jean-Pierre Rappenau was 8 years old during the spring of 1940 when the Third Republic of France disintegrated in a few weeks. It was a moment, he says, when "all the adults were a little crazy." He and the production team have lovingly and meticulously recreated that world in a movie where all the characters are essentially fictitious. The structure, a classic farce, is ideal for the period, since several plot lines intersect and intersect only to join in a logical and satisfactory conclusion. The parity of this plot is Frederic, played by the brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere, who is fully prepared to play against Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The true strength of the film is in its supporting performances. M. Rappeneau projected the film exquisitely with actors who offered ideas for action and dialogue and who know and demonstrate that it is possible to make a character completely with only two short sentences of dialogue. Although it is still not as influential as Renoir's "Rules of the Game", "Bon Voyage" deserves to be a complementary piece of that classic. Even though it demands a large audience, it gives a lot back. One of their demands is the tolerance of a certain shyness and a bad direction in terms of the exact genre we are seeing: a criminal melodrama, no, a spy thriller, a romantic comedy. I recommend it to the friends of cinemaphile. Just be sure to let them discover for themselves that it is a romantic comedy.
