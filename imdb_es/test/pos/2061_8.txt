"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is a nice and very interesting action thriller, and a breakthrough for Geena Davis' career. The plot is very familiar to the Bourne Identity but what? The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plot is strong enough to keep you busy for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> It is directed with a sense of style and avoids most action clich√©s. Geena Davis is great as an action girl and overcomes her usual "good wife" role. Samuel L. Jackson is as good as the support player. However, the bad guy in the movie is too corny and you can tell what's going to happen to him. <br /> <br /> He moves away from the usual habitual users like Commando and On Deadly Ground and is definitely one of the best professionals in the world in years. Good fun and good entertainment of popcorn. 7.4 / 10.
