The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the excellent performance of Natalie Portman. She gave her character quite ungrateful emotional depth much appreciated. Susan Sarandon, a good actress, is properly sincere as the mother figure. I thought that the chemistry between the two stars was believable, a chemistry that could have developed more with a more enveloping script. I'm not saying that the script was bad in any way, I'm just saying that sometimes it seemed underdeveloped. I do not think it was the scriptwriter's fault. The film suffered for being too long, and sometimes it was out of focus in the longer scenes. The film looks beautiful, with good direction and excellent performances. In short, you can see it, but maybe more for a larger audience. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
