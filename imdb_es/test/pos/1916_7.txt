This is definitely one of the best cult classics, and it is a must for all fans of psychotronics. Why? It has everything that a great 70s exploitation movie should have. It includes dialogue on the fly, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sordidness, political impropriety, violence and many other elements of a good cult classic. In other words, Dolemite is a must see. <br /> <br /> As with many of these movies, the plot has little or no meaning. What I got from this is that the Dolemite swindler was framed for stealing skins and half a million dollars in narcotics. While he was doing time, his archenemy Willie Green (the same man who framed him) took over his nightclub. However, the friendly warden (the only white character in the entire film who is not completely evil or incompetent) decides to release him to stop the evil Willie Green and his drug trafficking. Luckily, he knows kung fu, like 50 to 75% of the characters in this movie. And even more fortunately, while he was locked up, Mrs. Queen Bee sent all her "hoes" to kung fu school. With this army of kung fu fighting "hoes" (his words, not mine) on his side, he plans to recover Willie Green's nightclub. However, two racist white policemen try to incriminate him again and take him to jail. <br /> <br /> As I said before, do not try to follow the plot. I have seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connection with anything else. The secondary characters enter and exit the film. I'm still trying to figure out what was going on with Reverend Gibbs, the mayor and the burger pimp. Who cares in the end? The scenes with these characters are priceless. As for the dialogue, it is horrible with worse delivery. Since Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I begin to wonder if this movie was to be a parody or a serious action movie. It seems he could not decide which one. Lines like "Yes, I'm so bad, I'll kick my ass twice a day" ask for further investigation. Either way, the movie is hilarious, and the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese factory. Another hilarious element are some of the less erotic uses of sex and nudity in the film. The actors who would never want to see nudes get naked (including the mayor and queen bee). Not to mention the fact that the boom microphone seems to appear in all other scenes. <br /> <br /> More than anything, Moore shows incredible enthusiasm. He seems to be having a good time in general and is certainly charismatic. His comedy raps proved to be a big influence on the gangsta rap of recent days, including Dr. Dre, who proved it on his groundbreaking 1992 album "The Chronic." As technically inept as the film is, it is culturally influential. Even more important, it's a good time for everyone. The biggest crime that an exploitation film can commit is boring, and this, in spite of all its faults, is fast and entertaining. In other words, if you like this kind of movie, you will love "Dolemite". If you do not understand, you are a "motha-f *** a!" (7/10)
