I have used this film in my university's ethics courses for more than 10 years (also "Crimes and Misdemeanors" by Woody Allen, another excellent and multi-level ethical study). <br /> <br /> It's fiction. I do not focus too much on the unrealistic characteristics of "Strangers" because all fiction movies are obviously false on many levels. I love the movie as a comedy of gallows, tense, with many ironic twists and visual pleasures, even if it is "incredible". The story is told so well that I do not even think about criticizing its verisimilitude (although I must confess that the tennis match seems to me the weakest part: too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competition). <br /> <br /> Some problems presented in the film that promise a realistic moral education and an ethical discussion: <br /> <br /> 1. Ethical passivity: some weaknesses of Guy's character are destined to Hitchcock. A primary ethical vision of the film is the danger of the inability to articulate one's moral positions. Guy can not effectively block Bruno's crazy proposals at the beginning. An interesting question is why and how does Guy behave so passively and ineffectively? One possible answer is her depression due to her intense and complicated divorce process. <br /> <br /> 2. Lack of communication: Guy makes another mistake at the beginning: on the train, to get away quickly, he agrees that Bruno's ideas are all good. But Guy's literal meaning is opposite to his sarcastic and inflected sense. Bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for interbreeding murders. Guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any assassination agreement. To some extent, close to the beginning, Bruno may be partially pretending that an agreement has been reached to lure Guy into a complicity network. Bruno is manipulating Guy; Guy's linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno the opportunity to put an ethical "hold" on Guy. Bruno manipulating Guy can also take other meanings. . . . <br /> <br /> 3. Secret: some have speculated about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. It seems ridiculous at first, especially because Guy seems obviously heterosexual in his relationships with Miriam and Anne. However, remember that Guy is also ineffective with both women. Guy appears (stereotypically - it's 1951, remember) effeminate, especially in relation to Bruno. Guy, the strong athlete, is weak inside. Bruno is also in conflict (playing "against himself"), appearing physically and physically strong at first, but then shows some "effeminate" features (Bruno's fashion and footwork, his emotional caress to Guy in different situations; receives a manicure from his loving mother, Bruno kissing and desperately caressing his mother's hand, other more subtle homosexual stereotypes that have a cryptic meaning from Hitchcock's point of view). I'd like to hear Hitchcock clarifying his meanings here. <br /> <br /> 4. Dishonesty and distrust: Guy makes some colossal mistakes by hiding truths about Bruno from the family and from the police. Guy does not fully understand that admitting the fault quickly can be better than a cover-up or a delay in confession. Once again, Guy is driven by passivity, insecurity, fear, and maybe a self-hatred that is closer to Bruno's own hatred of what we are interested in seeing or admitting. Both Guy and Bruno represent their own parables of impotence. <br /> <br /> 5. Lack of evidence: Guy feels a problem in gathering evidence to be absolved. While going quickly to the police would solve a big problem, Guy gets caught with his own doubts and insecurities: the absence of desired alibis; the inability of the alcoholic teacher to testify on behalf of Guy; the obsessive need to appear politically pristine; and other personality factors that make Guy feel helpless. It is as dysfunctional as Bruno, but not so dangerous (although one could partially blame Guy for the murder of Miriam). <br /> <br /> 6. Illness and mental disorder: an interesting question is how legally responsible is Bruno for the murders? The more ethically incompetent Bruno is as a sick sociopath, the more guilty a healthy man can be who did not get up and acted morally to prevent crimes. Guy's failure is like a man who does not call the police when a sick friend threatens to commit suicide and death ensues. It could be argued that more than one crime was committed and that Guy is an emotionally hampered accomplice. <br /> <br /> These and many other features of the film make "Strangers in a Train" a jewel of a work of morality, a Diamond for philosophical and cinematographic reflections.
