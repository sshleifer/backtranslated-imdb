At first glance of this mini ... I was a little disappointed that Tommy Lee Jones and Anjelica Huston did not return to the cast. Both John Voight and Barbara Hershey did commendable work in replacement of very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary Epic Western. <br /> <br /> Cherokee Jack Jackson (Haysbert) played an excellent bad guy, and Louis Gossett Jr. was, as always, faithful with his excellent acting skills. <br /> <br /> The drama that seemed true to life in many scenes, including one of the best, where the brave shooting ended with the death of Ranger Walker, made me feel like I was really in the movie. Going back to Lonesome Dove was for me, almost up to the quality of the first of the series. The next 2 follow-ups with James Garner as Call simply did not work for me. And that Lorena marries Pea Eye? How the hell did he get that in his? That was a total mismatch of the characters. The first 2 of the series made the epic story, the next 2 were by no means of the same quality. <br /> <br /> Now, if the first 2 could be remastered in Dolby Digital and in an anamorphic presentation, the films could be where they should have been like today's movies.
