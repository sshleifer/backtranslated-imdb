Yes, I AM a fan of FF7, but how many people who watch this movie are NOT going to be? And so, I'm reviewing this movie from the perspective of a fan of FF7, and without regret. (I would not know how to properly review the movie for someone who has not played the FF7 game). <br /> <br /> Visuals - 10/10 I loved the Advent children. It is a sensory delight, a complete overload of audio and video. The images were impressive: some feats were achieved that I simply would not have thought possible with an animated feature. When the action scenes arose, they were, for want of a more precise word, a roller coaster. With a spectacular movement of the camera that extends from one range to another, for the purpose of perfectly integrated bullets at crucial moments, up to the level of total detail, everything is difficult to criticize. The animation has a big budget, the style and the images are impressive, and the effects sometimes made me forget that I was watching animation instead of live action images. I could ramble for hours repeating myself about the fantastic quality of the images, but it just would not do it justice. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 The sound was fabulous. The voices of all the characters did not disappoint (no one sounded silly) and the sound effects were audacious and sharp. Music - from the game that (in my opinion) had the best soundtrack of the game, transferred beautifully to the movie. Most of the memorable themes of the game are present in the film, although they often use different instruments to better adapt to what is happening. There was some rock music and bolder thrash metal music in the really intense action scenes from time to time, but everything fitted well with the situation of the film at the right time. <br /> <br /> History - 7/10 History and characters would be the main flaws of the film. Both aspects simply were not on par with the game, but again, the game could devote more than 40 hours to develop these points. The movie only has about 90 minutes. As for the story, the plot was not bad or anything, but not as ambitious as expected from someone who played the game. In effect, the plot seemed quite weak in comparison. The game was so extravagant with the intricate twists of the plot and the progression / development of the story, that the film never had the chance to compete in the same league. Instead, the film took a more sensible approach: expand the action and try to include so many inner jokes and themes in itself instead of trying to recreate in an incredible way the massive story factor, which originally was a driving force in the game. The lack of use of Materia also caused me some controversy: the story of the film chose to use Materia little (though not ZERO) and, instead, a lot of skill and supernatural fighting ability. I hope that if a sequel is made, incorporate Materia much more extravagant and important in the film. There were also many plot holes in the film, all of which you can forgive if you think of Advent Children as a random anime, but it seems ridiculous when you realize how it was based on a game that ran tremendously well. <br /> <br /> Characters - 7/10 The characters, although all are present in one way or another, do not necessarily shine to their true potential. There just is not enough movie time to spend with all of them. And so, all their stories and background skills are not shown completely, and in some cases, almost nothing (Red and Cait Sith leave absolutely no lasting impression). Even Cloud, who is the focal point of the movie, I feel that he does not use enough of his familiar game skills. The subject of Matter is a strong reason for this. That said, it's a joy to see the cast in action, even if it's in a role that does not use them to the fullest. However, the new characters were what caused most of the fight: the Bad Guy Trio and the boy friend Denzel. There was a great lack of explanation about any of them. Anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the blanks with something reasonable and finish it off, but speaking objectively, the subject is still there to be commented on and, therefore, is a bit disappointing. <br /> <br /> Value - 10/10 The reproduction value of this movie is excellent: personally I want to see it again in a bigger and louder way: bigger screen, higher volume. <br /> <br /> Enjoy - 10/10 Whatever the flaws in The Movie, it just was not big enough to make my enjoyment difficult, and I honestly think that will be the same case for most people. I enjoyed Advent Children tremendously and encouraged the other fans of FF7 to go see it.
