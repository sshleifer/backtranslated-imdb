I consider myself fortunate to be able to see a wonderful movie with two wonderful actors. "Kramer vs. Kramer" was great for me because I think I could relate to him. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Although I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. Having two parents that you thought were happy and ending up hating is the worst. Through this film, in fact, I think it made me realize that my parents are also people, and that they had as much pain as my sister and I did. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie, this was a good idea. one. Yes, it's dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend this to a lot of people, because I think most of them can relate in some way. There are funny, sad, happy and relief moments that are carried away tremendously by these great actors. It's a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7.5. <br /> <br /> 9/10
