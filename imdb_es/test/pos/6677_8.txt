Well, there's not much to say about this. But it's really good. Very good job of Softley's direction and the movie has a good cast. The plot of the films is also credible and ... hehe good. So the good is the main word in this case. I just hope there's more of this kind of science fiction movies. That's why this is pointed out in the crowd. I give it 8.5 out of 10
