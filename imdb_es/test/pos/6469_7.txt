John Cassavetes is fleeing the law. He is at the bottom of the pile. He sees the black Sidney Poitier as his equal and quickly become friends, forming a kind of alliance against a stalker of a foreman played by Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> As someone who has worked in a warehouse when it was me. Younger, I can tell you that fights in the warehouse, complete with rotating packing boxes and agitator grip hooks are as realistic as they are. I myself have been in fights like these, although no one was killed. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Sidney Poitier's widow is a variation of Shakespeare's Shylock "I do not bleed?" This is an anti-racist film that, at that time, was very necessary. <br /> <br /> The three main characters, Warden, Cassavetes and Poitier, are excellent, and Warden is the most prominent of the three.
