Every time I do not give 150% to my dreams or my goals, I think of Mark Borchardt, the real-life subject of "American Movie." Mark's stubborn persistence in having his first feature film produced and filmed is so captivating that it will make you laugh, shake your head sadly and encourage it. <br /> <br /> I have not seen such an honest documentary since then. The movie about R. Crumb. The "cast" of support (Mark's family and real-life friends) is great. Give this film a chance and you will see a great movie and a wonderful picture of the things the American dream is made of.
