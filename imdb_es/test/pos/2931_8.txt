The next top model in the United States is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately I get bored with it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 1: Yes, I'm happy that Adrienne won, she wanted me to win the beginning. <br /> <br /> cycle 2: it's very bad, I think Mercedes deserved it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 3: I did not like Eva, but I did not like most of the girls in this cycle. <br /> <br /> Cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. I do not know what they saw in Naima, but I definitely know what they saw in Kahlen. <br /> <br /> Cycle 5: like cycle 3, it was not a great cycle either. But of all the girls, NICOLE as the winner? eww! <br /> <br /> Cycle 6: I liked Sara and Joanie, but Danielle is also fine. <br /> <br /> Cycle 7: Caridee definitely deserved it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 8: No, I did not want Jaslene to win. I did not like her. I saw other girls in that cycle with much more potential than her, although I did not see much of this cycle. <br /> <br /> Good show, I just saw it too many times so that I like it much more:
