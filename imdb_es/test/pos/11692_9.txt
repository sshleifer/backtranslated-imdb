Beauty in Trouble (Kráska v nesnázích) is not a great title. Do all the descriptions of this film fail to capture what it really is? An adult fairy tale. A poor girl is courted by a prince. The "girl", Marcela, played by the dazzling Anna Geislerová, has a beauty of Isabelle Huppert, with a red hair, face and figure that are seductive, sexual and infinitely fascinating. She has a husband louse, but they have good sex. Children hear love through the walls. He is rude and passionate, since the sex of the working class seems to be often portrayed in the cinema. But it is also up to us to recognize that this is what unites them in an otherwise incompatible marriage. The husband, a professional car thief, is eventually caught and imprisoned. How she came to this marriage, we do not know, but she is not exactly an upper class. But she is beautiful, intelligent (we assume) and loves her beautiful and resistant children. She deserves more. And she can get the life she deserves ... eventually. (No spoiler!) She is forced to return to her mother after her husband is sent to jail. Mom has a horrible second husband (read ugly stepfather). He is a true spectacle of terror. He borders on being a child abuser to children. He is obsessive about cleanliness, but he throws the table without grace and, at the same time, demands manners and decorum from the children. He is a socially disadvantaged lower class with a social disability. Mama endures it, like Marcella's husband, at least it's lustful, horrible but hot. The ambivalent, confused and layered characterizations are what make the film so powerful and interesting. These characters have flaws, some seemed driven by class, others by innate character. These flaws and character details are lovely in one minute and despicable in the next. The public really has to negotiate the conflicting feeling of class, sexuality, ambition, commitment and the role of women as mothers and wives through the rapidly changing terrain of history. In the background, as with many films such as the wonderful Icelandic film "Thicker Than Water (Blóðbönd), children can be the victims, what is good in the end may be the best for the children, who are our salvation and our It is a theme that develops these days in films that range from Labyrinth of Bread to Children of Men, foreigner.The cinema is recognizing in intricate moral accounts that life is confused, brutal, unjust and, as adults, we must act together to be able to pass something worthwhile to the next generation If we surrender to our basic instincts, we can lose ourselves and the world in the process The extraordinary and complex and colorful characters of Kráska v nesnázích speak of the qualities of what makes a man, what drives a woman, what represents hope, what is a class: is the economic status of the plot of your character? The film is very human As shown by the last 2 shots, which moved me in an incredible and unexpected way. The director's choices are so subtle and intelligent that comparing this to an American movie seems unfair. Americans sometimes seem unwilling to consider that paradoxes in human nature do not offer fixed resolutions. But here, dangerously raised in an ostensible fairy tale for adults, there are interesting moral questions. Do not be fooled by the simple story; It's a good movie.
