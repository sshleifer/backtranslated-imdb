Chan-wook Park, you have to give it to the boy. In my opinion, he is not only a brilliant director, but a brilliant director who can change his gender to any genre and often provides something refreshing but, ultimately, satisfying. <br /> <br /> Thirst is essentially a vampire tale, but one that plays fast and loose with some of the "rules" of the subgenre. Kang-ho Song plays Father Sang-hyeon, a man who selflessly engages in a research program and then contracts the disease he is trying to cure, dies and returns. All thanks to the blood with which he was transfused. Being the only one in five hundred to survive, he becomes a great celebrity for those who know him and all he wants is to return to normal. However, the normal thing now is to be able to jump great distances without suffering injuries, wanting to drink blood and getting very hot under the neck when the sun's rays come in contact with your skin. It is not long before he lives with a rather dysfunctional family unit that he met in his childhood and, while hiding his new and strange lifestyle, is caught in a complex love triangle, increasingly acceptable dark thoughts and gliding by a slippery slope that could take him from man to beast to monster. <br /> <br /> Skillfully combining several genres, Park's film seemed much fresher and more original than Let's Right One In (to use a recent example) and I was genuinely impressed by its focus on material that could easily have been sense as worn and worn as any other series of vampire movies we've seen over the years. It is a mixture of horror, melodrama and comedy while reflecting on ideas such as the strength of faith, power over life and death, the inconvenience of immortality, etc., etc. Some people have complained that this genre The mix approach weakens the film, but I personally discovered that it was an animated, entertaining and always enjoyable movie, aided by a great central performance by Song as the tortured priest and fantastic twists of a cast of support without weak links. Many characters move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and credibility, especially the young woman (played by OK-vin Kim) who becomes the object of love, lust and affection of the priest. <br /> <br /> Fans of Asian cinema (and Park in particular) and also fans of "The Tell-tale Heart" by Poe should see this, it's another elegant movie of a man who seems to take everything at his rhythm. and always manages to offer nothing less than solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> Check this out if you like: Cronos, Near Dark, Dellamorte Dellamore, also known as Cemetery Man.
