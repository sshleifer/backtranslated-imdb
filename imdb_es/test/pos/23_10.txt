Anyone who appreciates good acting and dialogue playing will love <br /> <br /> this movie. Taken from Ronald 'Taking Sides' Harwood, it is a fun <br /> <br /> and, ultimately, a lousy analysis of a relationship between two very "actor" types. Albert Finney is sublime as the despotic <br /> <br /> actor of Shakespeare who barely notices the world war being waged <br /> <br /> around him, so his intention is ruin of the fortune of his theater <br /> <br /> company and his own psychological and emotional collapse. <br /> <br /> Tom Courtenay is unmatched as Norman, the "Dresser" of the title, <br /> <br /> whose apparent devotion results in being anything but disinterested. <br /> <br /> You really have to see it.
