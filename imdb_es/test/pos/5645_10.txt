This is probably the best war movie and without doubt one of the best movies. There is no sentimentality, no patriotic agenda, not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this somber glimpse of what we can only call hell. It is this silent rigor and lack of manipulation that gives the film its amazing power. There is also no attempt to make a hero of the protagonist of Ichikawa Tamura. He's just a poor, poor condemned man who tries to stay alive in a world of horror he's waiting for, but he's not sure, he can cling to his humanity in the process. Fierce lack of singing and illusion of Ichikawa makes Fires on the Plain independent. Ichikawa died in February 2008.
