The interpretation presents a very topical subject in the form of a very tense thriller. It is an exciting film, and not preaching. Seeing it in an Arab country with a mix of Arab and European audiences gave it an extra level of atmosphere. The audience was totally trapped by the movie and then gave him a loud applause. The story of an Egyptian, married to an American, detected the suspicion of links with terrorist organizations and was sent to a friendly Arab country (with the US) for an "enhanced interrogation" (as the character of Meryl Streep states in the movie: "We do not have torture in the US" seems to be the first page of today's news, there is a very clear link between the different characters that appear in the film and the rhythm of the film never falls. Of the films it seems to be (as stated by the character of Jake Gyllenhal in the film) that by kidnapping and torturing the suspects many more terrorists are created.The performance is uniformly excellent with Streep and Reese Witherspoon, which can not be missed.
