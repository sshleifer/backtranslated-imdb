This is a good adaptation of Dan Brown's impressive book. I can not say it's new or very good, but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent history, the result could have been better. The movie is quite long, but in the end I felt that some things were missing. The sound effects and the sound tracks were very good. The performance was well done, but the development phase of the character was very weak. For people who did not read the book, things may seem to happen too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as the things in the book, they could have tried to make the most appropriate important scenes. What made the book so good was the whole puzzle story combined with the excellent portrait of the Vatican. You do not see any of that in the movie. Too much hurry and the use of time is not good, these are the main problems of the film. Therefore, it is worth seeing, but it could have been done better.
