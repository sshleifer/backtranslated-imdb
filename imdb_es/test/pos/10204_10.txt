Lang makes Hawks as well as Hawks in the first part of this extraordinary western, before settling in the typical deterministic Lang, dark and obsessed with guilt for the end. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantaneously but at the same time very subtly. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is on horseback and chased, we do not know why: he stumbles upon the wounded Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his gun and his horse, but upon discovering that Creighton is wrong, he decides to fix it first. It transmits mainly through facial expressions and a very short and clipped dialogue: in 2 minutes we know that Shaw is an outlaw, but basically a good guy. Shaw ends up helping Creighton on his way to civilization, then disappears. <br /> <br /> Cut a few weeks or months later, with Creighton on the road to recovery and in charge of an expedition to place the telegraph west of Omaha. . He hires Shaw as an explorer, who tries to leave when he discovers that Creighton is in charge; But Creighton wants it anyway, paying a debt and feeling some quality. A tender foot is also hired, son of a benefactor of the project, but uncharacteristically, the Eastern Richard Blake (Robert Young) is quite competent, as it is immediately shown in a fun but exciting bronco-busting sequence. Both contracted compete for Creighton's sister, Sue (Virginia Gilmore), who, again, not typically, seems as capable of taking care of herself as any other man. The camaraderie among the three men, the comic elements that involve a reluctant cook and several rude and fallen types, and the wonderfully played romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and remind me more of the "Red River" of Howard Hawks or " Only Los Angeles have wings "that most of the Lang, but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it does not matter, and does not alter our pleasure, if perhaps it changes our expectations, like the most common Langian themes of The enchanted past, the dark secrets and the immense attraction of the easiest, destructive and evil forms dominate the last part of the film. Shaw's old friends return to torment him as the wagon train and its cables move westward; attacks are mounted on the crew, and Shaw has to fight what, if anything, is to tell Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade (Barton MacLane), leader of the outlaws. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot Early in color and moving almost uninterrupted from the sound stages to the western locations, it is for my money easily Lang's best western and one of his best films, which he transmits as powerfully as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their past and build a new future. Scott is as good as I've seen him, showing more with an eye movement than many actors can do in a dialogue paragraph, and the rest of the cast is uniformly good. The inevitable confrontation between Shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary, and a surprise even to a devotee of Lang like me; and even in 1941 it seems that there was no more meaningful place on the margins of civilization than the hairdresser and the dusty street. You can shave, you can feel like a new man, but you really can not be as long as the old ties still hold you back. <br /> <br /> Genius.
