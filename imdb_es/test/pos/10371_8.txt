I watched this movie on the A & E channel last weekend. The mystery was fine, I could not guess the culprit before the end. But I enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery. There was a mystery about some of them, especially George Abernathie, performed by the wonderful Michael Fassbender and George's cousin, Susannah. In fact, the story of those two characters left me wanting to know more. So I tried to rejoice with Agatha Christie's book of the same title, I think this movie did not follow the letter. Very good performances from the actors involved, especially Fassbender and the lady who played Cora / companion.
