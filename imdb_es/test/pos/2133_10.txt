If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematographic masterpiece told with depth, subtlety and passion, a film without equal in the visual field. He is tirelessly impressive and also very brutal in his representation of our great heritage of greed and annihilation. And, of course, what the reviewers could not accept is that it does not tell a simple narrative story like 99% of Hollywood production. His characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions. They even seem to be thinking, something that average movie reviewers do not understand and can not accept, so they destroyed it. See the original widescreen version without cutting. Is awesome
