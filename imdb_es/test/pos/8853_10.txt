When in 1982, "The Thing" hit theaters around the world, it had a cold reception and very bad box office results, becoming almost a failure in John Carpenter's career as director of horror; however, time has shown that "The Thing" was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the fault of the film. Today, "The Thing" by John Carpenter has gained the appreciation it deserves and is considered by many fans of horror as a horror classic, and not without reason, as this new version of the story of John W. Campbell, Jr. "Who Goes There?" (Previously adapted as "The Thing From Another World") is closer to the original story and maintains a pessimistic feeling of fear and high doses of suspense in a masterfully elaborated study of paranoia. <br /> <br /> The plot of "The Thing", begins in the winter of 1982 in a station of investigation of the EE. UU Located in the remote territories of Antarctica, when the crew members notice that a Norwegian helicopter is approaching. The two apparently crazy pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill a Husky dog ​​that makes its way into the US base. After the Norwegians are accidentally killed, the Americans try to figure out what made them crazy. Soon you will discover that the Husky dog ​​that the Norwegians hunted was not a normal dog, but a creature capable of imitating all living creatures, and not only that, it is tremendously hungry. <br /> <br /> Director John Carpenter earned himself a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher "Halloween", where the suspense and atmosphere were above blood and shock. "The Thing" could be seen as an evolution of that style, because even when Carpenter makes great use of the special effects of Rob Bottin (which in his day were described as "repulsive" by the critics), the film still focuses more in the atmosphere and suspense. instead of the violent (and very well done) blood screens. The feeling of loneliness, as well as the "bad karma" among the crew members, increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the Thing, even our main character, RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell), who ends up in a situation in the that nobody can be reliable. <br /> <br /> This element of the plot was more faithful to the concept of the original novel, and was unabashedly ignored by the previous version (it's not something completely wrong, just a big difference), which makes this version it feels less like a remake and more like a new conception of the original novel. Bill Lancaster's script manages the characters with a brilliant mastery, which gives us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to trust them, which makes them an essential factor in the disturbing sense of terror that keeps running through of the movie. The mystery and the suspense are at maximum, since you can never know who is the Thing and who is normal, which improves the paranoia and the unpredictability of the plot with excellent results. <br /> <br /> The cast is very effective, and their performances in general are so effective that you can almost feel the negative feelings among your characters as real. Carpenter's regular collaborator, Kurt Russell, while MacReady takes the film, and through his eyes we witness the madness and horror that the research station is in as situations get worse. Definitely one of his best performances. Wilford Brimley is also great as Dr. Blair, a scientist who goes crazy after discovering the purposes of the Thing. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" is such a wonderfully designed film that its flaws tend to go unnoticed, although they do exist. . The most notorious is the very low and, occasionally, not appropriate score of Ennio Morricone. It's not exactly bad, but it feels out of place in some scenes and is not one of the best works of the legendary composer. In addition, due to some erroneous forms with special effects, some scenes that actually fill some small holes in the plot were left aside, although nothing important or really annoying. <br /> <br /> When you talk about John Carpenter's movies, most people will almost instantly name "Halloween" as their favorite movie, but personally, it would go with "The Thing", since I consider it the Carpenter's biggest achievement so far, and one of the most interesting and terrifying horror films ever made. I would go so far as to call it one of the best movies ever made. 10/10
