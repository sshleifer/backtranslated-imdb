High school. Years and decades later, some look back with affection, others with shame. But few find it easy to forget. It is one of the most critical phases of our lives, when changes occur quickly and furiously, whether we are prepared or not. There are no children, no adults, irresistible forces slap us, pushing us and throwing us in all directions. <br /> <br /> "Fama" did everything possible to capture this turbulent and chaotic period for its cast of young characters. For the most part, he succeeded. He wandered, but he felt like a piece of life. This film occupies a special place in the hearts of the Class of '80. We had just said goodbye to a decade, and at the end of three or four school years stimulating and, sometimes, difficult. We were heading towards the cold and cruel world, leaving home for college and then unknown parts. When we approached our watershed event, this brand new film was like a two-hour yearbook for us. We could not escape the title song on the radio. That was us up there on the screen. These were our friends, rivals and classmates, since we had faced our own dreams, frustrations, successes and failures. <br /> <br /> It is especially poignant for those who attended any of the other high schools in New York City. , especially Stuyvesant, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like the children here, we were considered the best of the best. We did not have auditions, but rigorous entrance exams. Perhaps even more than the children of the Performing Arts, we were expected to change the world, although we did not necessarily become famous. Like them, not all of us achieve it. But the atmosphere of the pressure cooker fostered an extraordinary camaraderie and spirit of body, not unlike the touch of "Hot Lunch Jam" in the cafeteria. On our own graduation day, our spirits rose almost like the jubilant crescendo in the touching finale. The film appropriately leaves us in a unique and triumphant note at the end of "I Sing the Body Electric", which points to the dazzling, bright and limitless future, and all the promise it had. <br /> <br /> "Fama" could not have been established anywhere else. This story would never have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has a stronger identification with movies and television, but New York is a mecca for all the arts. The home, not only of what was then called PA, but also of Juilliard, of world renown, is a cultural center unmatched in any other city in the world. It is also a time capsule of the rest of the city of the time, showing the soda, grit and dirt that was endemic to a New York that was still struggling to recover from the fiscal crisis that had almost bankrupted it. But above all, it showed vitality, as it was silenced by the incursions of Giuliani, Disney and tourism. <br /> <br /> What I would not give for being young again. But with "Fama", at least I can remember what it was like.
