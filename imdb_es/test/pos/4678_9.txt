I wonder how many MINI Cooper cars were sold thanks to this movie. I could not stop increasing the sales of this small car, which appears in this film, along with an attractive cast. <br /> <br /> This is a very, very entertaining movie of robberies and persecutions. It has a "great" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> The best chase scene is right at the beginning with a search for a boat in Venice, Italy. The film does not exaggerate the violence, it has a rather intelligent script (with few exceptions). It presents interesting characters and is well entrenched. The game of cat and mouse between the characters of Norton and Theron is exciting and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Once again, however, we are manipulated to encourage the criminals portrayed as "the good guys". How many times has this happened since the days of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" in the 1960s? Hollywood has been twisted, for you. Here, one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the leader and the paternal figure (Donald Sutherland) of the gang, making him the worst of the group and the villain of the movie. In addition, Theron's character is in the typically exaggerated feminist Hollywood mode, in which women can do all things (even drive a car) better than a man. A third minor irritation is the conceited and intelligent attitude of Seth Green, which we are also supposed to accept because it is modern and great. <br /> <br /> Despite these obstacles, it's an extremely entertaining movie and it does not exaggerate because of blasphemy or sex ... and, yes, those little cars are great. Everyone with whom I have spoken who have seen this movie, have enjoyed it.
