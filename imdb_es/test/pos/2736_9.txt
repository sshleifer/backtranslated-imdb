If you repeat a lie a sufficient number of times, will it become the truth? 15 Park Avenue is the story of an alternate reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The film is about her search of her home in a fictional direction where her imaginary husband and her 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers another masterpiece. Each and every one of the actors in the film was better than the other. Konkona Sen seems incredibly convincing as a schizophrenic. She takes out the paper with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is amazing as always. She plays the dominating and fiercely independent older sister of Mithi, who takes care of her sick sister and her elderly mother. She refuses to accept that despite all her strength and courage, sometimes she still feels lonely. This should have been a very easy movie for Rahul Bose. The role was less demanding and anyone could have done it. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was the most surreal part of the whole Park Avenue experience. It took me a while to digest that the movie was over. It left me confused and maybe even a little annoyed. But later, it began to sink. My eyes are black. But if everyone says they are blue, will I still believe that he is black?
