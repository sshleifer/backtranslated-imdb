Someone in these Boards has predicted that everything is being dreamed by the protagonist's best friend, even if it's a friend he has not seen in the last 20 years. I refuse to rule it out, but it raises some viable questions. Why does a telephone engineer WANT, or a shoe salesman or a butcher, WANT to create a mythical world and weave it around a friend who fills it in the process with a set of equally mythical supporting characters? With such a good imagination the friend must be WRITING not dreaming. Dream or not SOMEONE, and the obvious candidate is the director Paolo Sorrentino, has created a very visible world in which Tony Servillo turns quiet into a beautiful art. They ask us to believe that the twenty-year-old Titta La Girolomo (Servillo) "molested" the mafia some years before our meeting with him and, as a penance, is a virtual prisoner in a small Swiss hotel that every week goes to a local bank . With a suitcase that contains nine mill mill big in used notes. In addition to this weekly trip, he is free to do what he wants and what he likes to do is smoke, play cards with a cheating man and a wife who reminds the husband to what extent they have fallen socially, and ignore the friendly Olivia's proposals. Magnani, who has spent two years trying to get a smile and / or a "good night". For reasons best known to himself and that are inconsistent with a man who has no interest in anything or anyone, Servillo spends a certain amount of time every day applying a stethoscope to the wall of his room and listening to private conversations of his card. playmates. Eventually, he responds to Magnani, he has to do it or it would not be a movie. This is the 6f plot: that of Destry, who never uses a gun, or Sean (Duke Wayne), the "quiet man" who refuses to provoke the provocation and fights until the obligatory scene where the gun is tied and the fists piled up . - but instead of being satisfied with a courtesy, stai oggi takes 100,000 out of the suitcase and buys her a car. The final inconsistency occurs when Magnani tells him that he will pick him up the next day at 4 pm in his car and that they will go to the mountains to celebrate his birthday. We have established that she lives locally, so, as she is seen driving from a place miles away, nobody knows, ignoring a police blockade to get off the road and overturn the car. These inconsistencies, apart from this, are still a good part of the making of films with excellent performance and very good support.
