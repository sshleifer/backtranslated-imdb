... Our grandpa's time. <br /> <br /> More than the gangsters, it is a detailed description of an American family around 1930: the father, proud of his work who cares for his son who has dropped out of high school, the mother everyone wants have, the daughter who forgets the dinner time in her tight arms and the twins who are absolutely adorable ("Do not go to sleep first, please!"). <br /> <br /> And there's the grandfather, playing the Doodle Yankee on his flute. Have you noticed that this melody has the same role as Doris Day's "Que Sera Sera" in "The Man Who Knew Too Much" by Doris Day (1956)? Finally, the most courageous person in the family. So old he does not even tell you his age, but he's proud of his country and resisting the hateful blackmail of the gangster. <br /> <br /> A good movie by Wellman.
