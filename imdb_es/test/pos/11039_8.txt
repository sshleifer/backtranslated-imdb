This short was the first short film published by Paramount Famous Studios and was one of the many made by the studio that shows Popeye directly engaged against the enemy, most of the Japanese. While Warner Brothers, Disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, made shorts that often depicted Germans as frustrated, most of Famous Studios' efforts focused on the Japanese. Given the naval ties of Pearl Harbor and Popeye, this is quite understandable. This is a short average. Seein 'Red, White an' Blue and Spinach For Britain have aged better. But it's still worth seeing. Recommended.
