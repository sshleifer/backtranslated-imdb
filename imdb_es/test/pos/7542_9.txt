A very funny British comedy from the mid-1950s about a school for girls. The girls are all involved in mischief and chaos, making gin in the bathtub, smoking and playing. Alastair Sim plays the director Millicent in a glorious role of drag, as well as Millicent's brother. A police officer goes to the covert school to see what's happening. This movie is fun, it has great gags and Alastair Sim is great. Just a classic Britsh comedy, very funny and not too cruse. Joan Sims and Sid James, protagonists of many Carry On movies, play small roles, but this movie is about girls. It generated 3 sequels and a recent renovation. Look and enjoy where everything started.
