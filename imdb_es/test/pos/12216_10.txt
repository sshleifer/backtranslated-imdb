Surface is one of the best shows I've seen. NBC is so stupid for canceling a great show like this and, what's worse, leaving it alone. NBC or someone else should give Surface at least one more season just so it can be completed. It's as if NBC gave you a book to read and, halfway through it, they decided to take it off and you can never discover the end. I just want to see what happens to everyone and, most importantly, see what happens to Nim. I think I can say this for sure about most Surface fans: we want to save Nim! Nim has taken all our hearts and then the NBC simply cuts them in two. Come on NBC, just give Surface one more season!
