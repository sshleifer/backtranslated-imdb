In fact, I first saw One Dark Night at the theater and wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper. I loved it then and I still love it. The plot revolves around two people. First, a woman learns that her father has telekenisis after her death. Then she herself has feelings about the strange powers of her father even in his death. The mausoleum in which he is buried in the plays is the host of the other main person, a high school girl who does everything possible to enter with a group of girls who only want to torment and challenge her to stay in the mausoleum all the night to join your group. They return at night to scare her and find fear for themselves. The cast is directed by Meg Tilly with supporting roles from Adam West and one of my personal favorites Elizabeth Daily, also known as E.G. Daily. Take a look at this if you love 80s movies and corny horror movies, you will not be dissatisfied.
