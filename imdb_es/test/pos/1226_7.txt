This film is about six men assigned to transport money from the bank to companies. Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for the war in the service of his country and now his friend Mike Cochrone (Matt Dillon) is helping him to make a living by making sure he does not lose his home. Mike tells him that this was not the life that his parents expected for him and that he should be living a better life than he has now with his brother Jimmy Hackett (Andre Kinney). By telling Ty that he and Jimmy have always been a family to him and would do anything to help them, Mike tells Ty about a plan to make a robbery. The money would also be around 43 million divided in six ways among the other carriers, although Ty does not like the idea he tells his friend Mike, as long as nobody gets hurt. On the last night, Ty was forced to talk to him. A social welfare lady about putting her brother in a foster home, which gives her a dilemma to lose what matters most in her life. Although the plan seems safe at first, greed is not everything when it comes to taking lives. <br /> <br /> When it comes to theft, your entry or your exit, so when you do not go with a plan it is difficult to play the hero and stop people driven by greed when it comes to having large sums of money. money. This film includes a cast full of stars to keep you interested, starring Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne, Amaury Nolasco, Fred Ward, Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia. In short, I recently recalled it in "Stomp the Yard", which deals with a boy who lost his brother and lives his dream of going to college. This was probably one of his best movies in which I've seen it and it fits the character so well that it's great to see it on the big screen again in action.
