In the middle of The Hole, I sent an email to a friend of mine to summarize it. I'm not sure if the movie would break down into a series of submissive gestures, I found it a bit unpleasant to recommend it, but then I saw the ending. It is perfect. I have been living in Korea for 6 months, and this film could easily summarize the strange confusion and frustration of any Asian metropolis when confronting Taiwin here. It uses the myth of Hong Kong musicals in the same way that Godard or Hartley use Western musicals, but it takes it to the extreme, it's a rough world and, on occasion, the logic of Kafka-esquire makes it even better. I really feel that the closest comparison of The Hole is Hal Hartley's desire to survive, but he has a bit of a grim picture of what are hopefully and strangely metaphorical films eventually. Anyway, this is what I wrote to Esther. I hope you like The Hole too. <br /> <br /> Hey, <br /> <br /> watching a movement called the hole. I think the Taiwanese seem a bit strange to China unless it's Hong Kong. It's worth seeing so far. It is about a boy and a girl in an apartment complex. the ceiling of the man collapses and the girl begins to get angry and, well, it is a rare metaphor for the pleasure, the disaggregation and the simultaneous pain of a quite intense infatuation. There is also a sub-plot of zombie virus and many small and strange scenes in which the girl represents her desires through doo-wop sequences quite innocent and a little funny. Worth a look.
