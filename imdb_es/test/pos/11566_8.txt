I used to watch this program when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it very well. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things that I remember very well are the opening sequence and the musical theme. In addition to that, they were all ideally launched. The writing was also very strong. The performances were first class, too. I hope some network brings it back to see each episode. Before finishing this, I would like to say that I will always remember this program in my memory forever, even if I have not seen all the episodes. Now, in conclusion, if a network brings it back, I hope it catches it a day before it leaves the air forever.
