This is one of my personal favorites, a rare little gem that seems to be unknown to the general population. Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson form the heart of the piece in what is a well-chosen cast. Few films have captured the real hostilities that sustained the Civil War, but it seems to capture all the right moods and moods. If you are a fan of the book, Cold Mountain, try this movie and see if you do not think it is a good companion.
