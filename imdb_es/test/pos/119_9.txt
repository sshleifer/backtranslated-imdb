Finally I saw the third movie in the Mehta trilogy: "Fuego". To begin with, I would say that "Water" was the undisputed masterpiece, at all levels. The fire comes later with the Earth very close in order of quality. Fire: there are so many things in this movie that I will need a little more vision to take it all. The writing is magnificent, the script creates friction that starts the whole process of "heat" from the beginning to the end. When it really erupts in a fire, conflicts move towards the complete breakdown of relationships. <br /> <br /> Mehta is a brave woman: she sees with a clear eye many things that are icthetic, false and repressive about the great society she came from. India is changing rapidly these days, but a lot of this is an economic change. The fact that he encountered such fierce opposition to the creation of "Water" after having cleared the script, shows that there are still many taboo subjects that Indians can not look directly in the face, can not examine or discuss. Worse yet, if someone like Mehta has the courage to show a mirror to these problems, he faces death threats. So, even if India considers itself a pluralistic and tolerant society, the facts are not always the case. While "the Earth" was simply a historical setting for the carnage of the civil war after the independence of India, fire and water point to personal, social and religious problems, which, as I say, are considered so strongly ( in a negative sense) that a There are still many years left for artistic dialogue. As I write this "Water" is scheduled to be shown in India later this year. I will believe it when I see it. <br /> <br /> Fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that I saw in "A price above rubies". Whether it is about arranged marriages (as it used to be among Jews about 150 years ago, or as it is among many modern Indians), they run the risk of having a bad marriage imposed on men and women; or, simply marriages without love ... However, this is not the real problem. Mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that keep widows in misery (Water) or keep women enslaved to marriages without love (Fire). I am not an expert regarding secular or Hindu laws regarding divorce. The film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce) is almost as bad as the sad marriage. In any case, Mehta's film is a very moving and powerful attempt at sexual discourse that maintains relations with modern Indians up to a probing scrutiny. That the three films have made themselves felt in India as an unjustifiable attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mentality. Mehta is forcing the problems to be examined no matter how ugly. I admire his work and I can not recommend his films enough. Magnificent, disturbing, provocative, breaks taboo.
