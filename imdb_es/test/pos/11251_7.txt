I'm from Texas and I live very close to Plano where the real deaths occurred, so I might be a bit biased to say that "Wasted" is a movie you can not get out of your head. <br /> <br /> Stahl, Phoenix and Paul play their characters very realistically. You really think that they are high school students every day who are simply addicted to heroin. The content of the drug is also handled very graphically, although everything that happens in the film has a purpose, and every moment the downward spiral of the characters is heartbreaking. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. Once you look at it, it hits you!
