A variation of the same plot line was used in an episode of Simon & Simon (Thin Air) that originally aired in December 1982. <br /> <br /> The gender of the victim was changed, the surviving spouse is one of Rick's "old flames". It is also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney had a role in this episode of the Rockford archive. <br /> <br /> Both episodes were based on a story by Howard Browne, as noted in the list of "writing credits". <br /> <br /> Anthony James plays one of his classic TV bad roles. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the concept between Rockford Files to Magnum PI to Simon & Simon is quite interesting.
