Alexander Nevsky is a series of excellent cinematographic opera sequences that go from pastoral to lament and end in a triumphant cantata. The story takes place in 1242. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) defeats the Teutonic Knights in a battle on the ice of Lake Peipus. <br /> <br /> The film is a splendid historical contest that shows the director Sergei Eisenstein in his most inventively pictorial, and climax in an excellent battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds. Several films have scenes strongly influenced by the Battle of Lake Peipus, including Doctor Zhivago (1965), Mulan (1998) and King Arthur (2004). Alexander Nevsky remained out of circulation due to the changing political winds, and then he established himself as perhaps the most influential historical film made by the Soviets.
