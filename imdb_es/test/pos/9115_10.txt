If you are like me and you bought Tenacious D's new album the day it came out, and you entered the film knowing all the lyrics of all the songs ... then you will surely enjoy this movie. Yes, I'm a big fan of Tenacious D, but I really liked this movie that made me laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty much everything I expected. Comic genius backed by a great composition of songs and some great cameos by Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. I especially enjoyed the part of Tim Robbins. <br /> <br /> If, however, you are not familiar with the Tenacious D HBO series and the fantastic debut album, this may not have the same comedic impact on you. I would still recommend that you go and see it because it is still worth every penny of the admission price and it will make you smile even if you do not have points all the time.
