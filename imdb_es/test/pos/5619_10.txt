For many years, Samuel Goldwin tried to take his friend Jascha Heifetz to the screen. One night, when Goldwyn and his wife Frances dined with Heifetz and his wife, the silent screen star Florence Vidor, Goldwyn proposed that Heifetz star in a movie. After some persuasion, Heifetz accepted, with the condition that his performance be kept to a minimum. And the movie, originally titled "School of Music", was born. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite common: A street kid (Gene Reynolds, who is better known as the producer of "M * A * S * H"), runs away from home and ends up in a music school with financial problems led by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan). While trying to raise funds for the school, the child and some other children go through Heifetz at Carnegie Hall. After a lot of noise, Heifetz ends up appearing at the school concert and sponsoring the school. <br /> <br /> The story, although predictable, is surprisingly well written, although the film contains several minor errors in which different scenes were patched, the most obvious being the young cellist who leaves the orchestra hall in a message and is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later. <br /> <br /> What is not surprising is how good the acting is. As usual in the studios, the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with a veteran talent: Brennan, Joel McCrea, Andrea Leeds, Porter Hall, Marjorie Main (later Ma and Pa Kettle), Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey and a Who's Who of characters actors. Actress Diana Lynn and singer / actress Kaye Connor made their debut (uncredited) in this film, as did their singing partner Nelson Eddy Gale Sherwood (as Jacqueline Nash). Veteran actors like Reynolds, Walter Tetley and Terry Kilburn also appear. <br /> <br /> Goldwyn hired the Peter Meremblum Symphony, a prestigious youth orchestra from the Los Angeles area, to appear in the film. Most of the children in the orchestra were not actors, but they were excellent musicians, as good as professionals (which many of them later became). Many of the children in the orchestra followed notable careers: Kaye Connor and Diana Lynn starred in theater and movies, Richard Berres was producer and director, Mitchell Lurie founded a well-known music supply company, Elliott Rapaport continued to be a leading cardiologist, Lewis Elias was a leader of the band, Thomas Facey an orchestra conductor with different symphonies, Channing Robbins a leading instructor at the Julliard School, his sister Joyce Robbins a SUNY Stonybrook instructor, and many of the children of the orchestra pursue careers with the principal symphony orchestras. <br /> <br /> While Heifetz's performance was kept to a minimum, his salary was not. He ordered $ 70,000 for seven weeks. When some scenes had to be re-shot at a later date, he received an additional $ 50,000 for another four weeks. What fortunately was not kept to a minimum was his musical production. The composer Alfred Neumann (who was once director of the Meremblum Orchestra) handled the score. Heifetz interprets "Introductionne and Rondo Capriccioso" by Camille Saint-Saens, his own arrangement of "Estrellita" by Manuel Ponce (with an off-screen Teddy Saidenberg), the "Hora Staccato" by Dinicu (by Vitaphone, with Emanuel Bay at the piano), an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's "Melody", an arranged violin solo from the well-known "Adante Cantabile" by Tchaikovsky from his opus 11 string quartet (played during the first credits at the beginning of the film), and the last movement of the Concerto for minor violin by Felix Mendelssohn-Barthody. During all these performances, there are many close-ups of Heifetz's performance, which include very close shots of his fingerings and bowing, something that would be of great value for violinists who wish to study his technique. <br /> <br /> The Meremblum orchestra also shines here, performing the arias "Caro Nome" by Verdi and "Casta Diva" by Bellini, (both with Sherwood's chant), an arrangement of the overture of "Barber" of Seville "by Rossini, a short excerpt from" Eine Kleine Nachtmusik "by Mozart. ", and Mendelssohn's concert mentioned above (with Heifetz) Diana Lynn can be heard in the background of a scene, playing part of Chopin's Nopturne in B flat minor, and Mary Ruth, five years old, plays the popular" Minute " "Chopin's Waltz. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is an excellent movie AMC showed regularly until the beginning of 1992. I have not seen it on television in recent years, but it's not hard to get copies of it. If you have the opportunity, I recommend you watch the movie.
