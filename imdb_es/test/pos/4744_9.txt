Seven Ups has been compared to Bullitt for the chase scene, but it does not compare to Bullitt. Bullitt has a building principle that builds builds. When McQueen leaves the sordid hotel, he gets into his Mustang, which is parked under the Embarcadero highway (now uprooted) and realizes that the Charger is nearby, you know he is about to see something spectacular. From that moment, when McQueen starts that car, begins the best sequence of car chases ever filmed. Adding to this is an excellent Lalo Schriffin If I remember correctly the sound track. This continues for a long time before you actually hear the first tires screaming. The image of the McQueen Mustang that suddenly appears in Bill Hickman's rearview mirror has no equal for the visual impact. The look of surprise and double take of Hickman really adds to the effect. Then, of course, San Francisco is unparalleled in the configuration of cars that go up and down hills and around curves. In addition, Bullitt was filmed in the 60s when the cars were still "hot" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) created a better set of wheels than two Pontiacs loaded with smog devices in the 1970s, Seven Ups. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad guy's car in both movies. I saw him sitting in a preview of a privileged movie once on the Universal lot when he was making newspaper reviews of films. They tried it well in Seven Ups, although with the scene of the chase. Seven ups had some "jumps" on small hills, (Yawn), but of course they were not the hills of San Francisco. The pursuit of Seven Ups, to which they really go fast, is longer than the Go Fast sequence in Bullitt. But the scene of a single shotgun shot that totally blows the hood of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the height of the absurd. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except that it was filmed in New York.
