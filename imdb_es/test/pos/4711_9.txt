I am afraid that I will have to add my name to the long list of people who are amazed that this film has not yet been released (September 2007) on DVD. It is one of those mysteries that makes the mind go away, especially when considering the amount of DVDs available today that contain material that should have been saved years ago. I still have an excellent digital copy in VHS in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo, so my objection is more of principle than of frustration for not being able to watch the movie. As for the film itself, this is an excellent option for everyone, with a good image quality, a soundtrack more than satisfactory, an animated plot that involves suspense, emotion, sadness, frustration, feeling good and an exotic environment ( for a European). How true does the film fit the reality in Burma? I have no idea, in fact, that is less important, the essential thing is that, in terms of entertainment, it is a success. One soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and I admit that I have my heart in my mouth during the final scene of the crossing of the river. It's a pity we hear so little about countries like Burma and this movie at least gives an idea of ​​the country. Has the situation changed since 1995? The events that will occur later this month seem to answer this question with a resounding "No" and the regime in force seems to be as brutal as ever, not even to save the lives of monks, not to mention women or children!
