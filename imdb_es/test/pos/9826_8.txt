Why do people need to follow the opinion of mass and critical herds? RANDOM HEARTS, directed by brilliant Sydney Pollack (who also has a small role in the film) is another Harrison Ford vehicle. As such, it is quite good and entertaining. Surely, anyone who goes to see it has this in mind, or reads the book that is not better. Even the fans of Kristin Scott Thomas, including me, knew that it would be a variation of her again playing the love interest of her older uncle. Even as such, the movie is satisfactory. What's wrong with this movie that is much better in the other Harrison Ford vehicles (with a much higher rating)? This film is not a masterpiece, but it is not as bad as the opinion of the potential of the masses.
