I saw this movie only when I was a teenager early in my hometown in India, at a time when the only things that fascinated me apart from the girls were the Tigers. I came home after seeing him, with a glazed look in his eyes, wanting to be the guy in the movie who befriended the Tigers. What a movie and what a moment it was! The theater in which I saw it does not exist and has given way to a shopping center. I do not know how I would feel now after so many years and I do not want to spoil a memory of my childhood by finding this movie available on DVD or something similar and not finding it more interesting. I learned from previous experience that a childhood memory is often blurred when one travels the jaded highways of life, occasionally, trying to rediscover their unadulterated past through movies, only to discover that their innocence sprouted completely and was not welcome . And I do not want to throw to the wind the experiences of a memory of this movie. I do not have children, so I'm probably being selfish when I leave this movie in a sepia-colored area of ​​my brain, I do not want it on DVD. But if you are at a precocious age and you want to remember the memories of an endearing childhood in later years, try to watch this movie (if possible). It will really be worth it.
