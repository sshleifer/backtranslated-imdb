Or vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is a French film directed by an American filmmaker (Jules Dassin) who had to leave the country because he was included in the Hollywood blacklist thanks to HUAC. The premise of the story is quite familiar: a last jewel of the theft for Tony le Stephanois and his friends, and so is the end for everyone to ... Well, there are no spoilers here, sure, since this is the type of film in which the tension towards the end is important. <br /> <br /> Dassin filmed in realistic black and white lighting on the streets of Paris with actors and actresses who are not glamorous. The attractive, sometimes intruder, Georges Auric score improves the film and will remind viewers of many similar scores from American films of the 1940s and early 1950s. Jean Servais interprets the unconditional and consumptive leadership in a fedora as much as Humphrey Bogart could have played it. Tony just got out of prison, his best time has passed, but still he is strong and decisive when he has to be, his mind is still sharp when he is concentrated, the kind of antihero whose eyes cry even though the tears never fall. <br /> <br /> Dassin plays the Italian security pirate and supposed ladies who know the rules but are neglected. <br /> <br /> In the film noir, the logic and focus of the film force us to identify with the bad guys. . There are often levels of bad guys, the "bad guys" we identify with and the "bad guys" who are bad guys in our bad guys, and maybe there's one bad or two bad guys. (Here we have Remi Grutter, played by Robert Hossein, a slightly sadistic drug addict). Then there are the policemen who are irrelevant or almost. In the most modern black cinema, the bad guys are not even "good" bad guys, and they get away with it or something similar. In the old film noir, which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties, the usual motto, following the old "code" of Hollywood, was "Crime does not pay," and each criminal must pay for his crime before of the End of the movie. <br /> <br /> Probably the most impressive feature of Rififi is how well the movie progresses. The plot develops quickly and impeccably as did the great film directors, directors like Stanley Kubrick, Louis Malle and the best of Hitchcock. Some have compared this with Kubrick's The Killing (1956) and suggest that Kubrick stole a little. Well, the directors always steal if necessary, and there are some perhaps revealing similarities, such as being "a final robbery" for the protagonist, and making the girl take charge of the works. The similarities can be deeper because when this movie was coming to an end, I suddenly thought: oh, no! The suitcase in the back seat will come out of the convertible, it will hit the ground, it will pop open and all the money will fly through the air! Those of you who have seen The Killing can remember what happened to the money near the end of the movie! Which reminds me of another movie with something bad in the money: U Turn (1997) by Oliver Stone, starring Sean Penn. There, the money in his backpack is blown up by a shotgun blast. Hahaha! Getting the dubbed version of this movie would be an act of sacrilege, since the dialogue (when there is something: the robbery is done without dialogue, it is worth approximately 30 minutes) is concise and easy to follow and only requires an occasional look at the subtitles. , which, by the way, are quite utilitarian and guide instead of having each word spelled out. <br /> <br /> Another thing: all the brutality is done like the sex that used to be made in the movie, which is off. camera. A boy cuts his throat. We do not see it I like this kind of approach. We do not have to see the gore. You can almost let your children see Rififi - almost. <br /> <br /> Take this now and look for a Hollywood reprise starring Al Pacino and directed by Harold Becker that will be released next year where you can be sure that the violent scenes will be played in full.
