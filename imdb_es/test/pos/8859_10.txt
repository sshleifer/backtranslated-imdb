John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the greatest possible respect, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoid core of the short story of John W. Campbell Jr. The secret to the success of this version is the unbearable Tension that builds up as the group of men suspect each other, the tension of literally waiting to be taken takes a fearful position. Carpenter manages to manage the shocks and the mystery necessary to keep the film in the right direction. Whether it's a horrible scene or a sequence of "what's in the shade", for me the film is a perfect fusion of horror and science fiction. The dialogue is successful for a group of men trying to keep it together under pressure, and Carpenter's score is a wonderful pulse beat that further increases the sense of doom and paranoia throughout the film. The cast is excellent, a solid set of actors led by Carpenter favorite Kurt Russell, while the effects used give the right amount of impact needed. But, above all, it is the end that is the supreme glory, an end that does not conform to the norm and is incredibly appropriate for what has happened before, lets wait and see what happens, 10/10.
