Crack House (1989) was one of the few films of the 80 that is inscribed in this genre. What is supposed to be an anti-drug film is nothing more than an exercise in depravity of the exploitation of targets. However, there is nothing wrong with that. The presentation of the video even has an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the Richard "turncoat" Roundtree show. <br /> <br /> The movie follows two young lovers in high school. One of them is an almost tough guy and the other is his girl. One of them receives the help of a mutual friend, while the other is given a trip to slam and then given the opportunity to return with his former friends. Jim Brown appears as the "Mister Big" of the film, is a bad guy who can still annoy anyone and is a very sadistic guy who likes to hit his hoes and take the tar from those who try to challenge his word. Luke, from the General Hospital, also becomes a guest star. <br /> <br /> If you like sleaze, this movie is for you. Sadly, Hollywood no longer does this and, when they do, it is neither exploitative nor entertaining. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Sleaze fans.
