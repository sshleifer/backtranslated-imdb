Well, every scene so perfectly presented. I've never seen a movie that made sense in almost every scene before. <br /> <br /> Well, while I was watching this movie, I remembered seeing "Amilie". Amilie is also a kind of similar movie with more fun and fantasy touch. These films are based on the same plot. But both are perfectly perfect in their own way and be able to create a world of their own. <br /> <br /> Network is able to provoke many thoughts in people about the destination and the trips. And I'm still thinking about it. <br /> <br /> The story is great and the ending is a bit funny. I was laughing in the final scene. Very funny how these three movies, Red White and Blue, are connected. <br /> <br /> In general, a great work of art. A work of a teacher. <br /> <br /> 10/10
