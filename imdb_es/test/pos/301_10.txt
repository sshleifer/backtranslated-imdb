The masterpiece of Francis Ford Coppola was a grand finale to a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s, there was an atmosphere of tolerance, open-mindedness and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of important films by some of the best directors the United States has ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (some of them were the violent deaths of the main figures of the political and cultural scenes of the United States, the racial struggles, the emergence of the counterculture of the sixties, the increase in violence and Death in the streets ...) seemed to influence the vision of the filmmakers who were willing to dare, be different and create funny and intelligent moving movies. Coppola's film is a strange mixture of humanistic and skilful thought of making films, following the parameters of war movies and adventures, and at the same time subverting them with their fluid reflections on the value of life, the reason of death or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work, done against all odds, narrated in the 1991 documentary "Hearts of Darkness: A Apocalypse of a Filmmaker"; a moving image that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam War to get to the screen. This may not be the definitive film image of Vietnam, but by treating it Coppola challenged the formula of the classic melodrama found in two Vietnam films made simultaneously, "The Deer Hunter" and "Coming Home", or in the latter as "Platoon" "and" Casualties of War ", before Vietnam became the starting point for making products of any kind, such as the horror in" La Escalera de Jacob ", or the comedies like" Good morning, Vietnam ", among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the basis of a search for answers to the questions that every man faces every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.
