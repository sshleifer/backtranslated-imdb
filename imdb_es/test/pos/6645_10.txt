First, the story is not as simple as many previous critics tend to emphasize, it is actually a very complex story, unlike other Bergman films that are more inclined towards the study of the character. In Skammen we have two main characters, but since we launched from the beginning in the middle of a war, we have no idea who is fighting and why, everything is open for any resolution. This creates a great tension and makes each event significant. As the story unfolds, we are presented with numerous characters, who become symbols of humanity, both in its dark and luminous sides. We have the example of innocent bystanders who try to survive during an absurd war, the cynical doctor who mocks his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the entire film, the perverse opportunists who try to make the best of a heinous. event (the character of Bjornstrand), the innocent dead children, the anonymous figures almost turned into animals from the boat, etc. All of them are seen in some way through the eyes of Jan (von Sydow) and Eva (Ulmann), their characters are more restricted. in other Begrman films (In Passion) and this is exactly because the important thing here is the story, the way in which external events have the capacity to radically change human nature. <br /> <br /> Bergman made this film two years after Persona where the main conclusion expressed by the only word uttered by Liv Ulmann's character is INGENTER, nothing. That's all: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, the latter is nothing more than a work that includes all works. But what about the war? And especially the annihilators of the twentieth century. In Person, the only real emotion suffered by the character of Ulmann is when he sees a victim of the Vietnam War turned into a human torch. In Skammen, that idea extends to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. In a region without the name of a country without a name (we only assume that it is Sweeden) two factions that speak the same language fight in an absurd war. Jan and Eva are two dreamers caught in the middle, but their dreams are interwoven in a kind of counterpoint. At first, Jan is an idealist, unable to react adequately to the world and subject to the will of his wife. Towards the end, it becomes a radically different personality, capable of killing without motivation, strong will, implacable (look closely at the suicide on the ship ... the simplicity of the act is heartbreaking). On the other hand, Eva progressively loses contact with reality and, in the end, is completely absorbed in her own unfulfilled dream. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the whole film delivers its message in a very effective way. Bergman places the viewer next to the character, placing the camera in the car with the actors, or in an extreme close-up behind the actor. Nykvist manages an extraordinary control of the camera, there are some masterly "hand" effects, very good to make everything look "real". The shots when the characters are captured by the army seem remarkably documentary. The script is minimalist, but the story is quite complex. In fact, the whole film is paradoxical, it has an intensity in the subject that contrasts with the coldness and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed. There is nothing melodramatic here, there is no compassion, no hope, no apparent redemption. But, as in Liv Ulmann's dream at the end, everything is so beautiful that one can not help but be surprised by it ... It was not as horrible as it was!
