This is one of the best science fiction series. It's about the development of the character, some really tense moments and scripts of reasonable episodes. As another commentator said here, it looked like a mini-series, not a complete series with filler episodes and low budgets. <br /> <br /> The problem with the program, which in summary is a series of Godzilla. , is that it started too big, with incredible monsters, fantastic science, and then everything was reduced to local Americans doing things. Then, the show ended too soon, since the Olympics were coming and hey! A science fiction program is a science fiction program, but half of naked athletic people running aimlessly is much more important. So they only did 15 episodes instead of the 22 expected. The audience was also small, since people did not really get it at 8:00 p.m. In the end the suits did it. Rely on a marketing plan to destroy anything that seems remotely original and promising. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: it has a program with good special effects, like huge monsters that kill people or destroy boats, then they enter genetic engineering, they transform People, human clones, end of the world, tsunamis. In addition, the only fillers are scenes with aggressive hicks or other annoying people who are killed for their stupidity. The disadvantage is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge, the show ends. No real ending, no closure, just a bitter taste of cloth in your mouth, like you just swallowed a suit.
