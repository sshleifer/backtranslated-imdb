I'm not a Sean Penn fan, but in contrast to my German colleague, whose review appears here, I think he was the perfect character as the neurotic and drug addict character in this movie. It has perfected all the nuances and reminded me of several acquaintances who had similar tastes in "recreational chemistry". I saw this movie, but once, 10-15 years ago, and this is the only part of the movie that was indelibly etched in my mind. I do not say it very often, but in this case I will: Bravo, Sean Penn! As for the story line, well, it is based on a fact, and as such, it is a tragedy for people to sell the secrets of their country to the enemy of that time. Again, Penn has shown what he can do if he does not agree with the administration. Use the liberties you have, paid with blood; do not break the law
