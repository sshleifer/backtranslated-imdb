This movie is completely undervalued. <br /> <br /> It's a movie similar to Will Keenan and Patrick Hasson's Waiting, as well as Adrien Brody's Restaurant and the classic film Breaking Away, which deals with young adults who are stuck and know they're stuck, with little or no chance to free yourself. <br /> <br /> Death By Pizza (Delivered) is about an intelligent, free and artistic young adult (Will, played by David Strictland) who is Stuck and waiting, embittered by the hypocrisy of the world and embittered by his own lack of direction and desire. Will meets his enemy, Reed (Ron Eldard), another young and intelligent adult who is so bitter that he has chosen the path of crime. Both end up helping each other to get rid of their bitterness, which allows them to detach themselves. <br /> <br /> For these young adults, detachment or freedom can mean that both advance towards life, and immerse themselves in death. <br /> <br /> Will's life is filled with the trademarks of a young adult "stuck": a sweaty, sweaty, poorly paid job, rude customers, a former girlfriend who left him because he was unmotivated, an education Partial university without title, a house full of art made by itself and, of course, the new friend whose impious choices help him to save himself.
