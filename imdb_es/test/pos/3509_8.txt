The VHS cover says it all: "Without a doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas massacre." I'm a big fan of the slashers of the 70s and 80s and I have to say that I agree 100%. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as ranger). There is a twisted atmosphere, which only TCM has, an amazing soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror. This has to be one of the best-shot horror films of all time! Jeff Lieberman as director of this low budget film of 1981 does an excellent job and, along with his other works (Blue Sunshine, Wrong Turn), he must be one of the most underrated directors of the current film industry.
