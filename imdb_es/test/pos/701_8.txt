I liked this western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford. It has almost everything a western should have. There are shootings, action, horse chases. There is a little angle of romance that hints. There's a nice comic relief in the form of Edgar Buchanan, who plays Uncle Willie McLeod, a character who pretends to be an old fool, but he's actually aware of everything that happens. Randol Scott plays the Sheriff of the city and Glenn Ford plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith, a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change the way he is. I liked the different mix of characters from the movie. It did not always seem fast, but I did not find it boring either. Although the film is from 1943, it is in color. 8/10
