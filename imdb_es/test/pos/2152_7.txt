Biodoc in the enigmatic singer / composer who, according to the stories of friends, spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life apparently on a mission of self-destruction. He died at age 52, overweight and dissipated, of heart disease, after a prolonged bustle of excesses without virtually stopping alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and cocaine, noisy parties, and blatant misuse of his vocal instrument (he confided to a friend who shouted his lyrics in a performance with such force that the blood spattered remained in the microphone). <br /> <br /> All this despite the fact that it was: (1) widely regarded as the most talented pop singing ability of its generation; (2) successful, after years of effort, in terms of industry recognition: a Grammy, an Oscar, a decent recording contract with a top record label and at least two stellar albums: 'Nilsson Schmilsson' (originals) and 'A Little Touch of Schmilsson at night' (standards); and (3) very happily married (for the third time), with a lovely young family that seemed to love. <br /> <br /> The strengths of the film begin with the integrity of your account of Nilsson's life, including the proper use of archival footage and many photos of Nilsson; Editors do an especially good job of bringing movement to still images. We learned of his close ties to John Lennon and, later, Ringo Starr (Lennon used to say that Nilsson was his favorite American musician). <br /> <br /> Even more impressive are the speakers, often the weakest aspect of a documentary. Here we have people like Perry Botkin, Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Dolenz, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idle, Rick Jarrard, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and Robin Williams, do they all tell amazing stories about Nilsson? many graciously funny, others deeply pathetic, and all expressing their deep affection for him. Are the segments of interviews with Nilsson's wives equally informative and moving? Annie and Una, her son Zach and cousin Doug Hoefer. The best set of heads I can remember in a biodoc. <br /> <br /> The most obvious deficiency of the film is that it displaces Nilsson's music. Even the performance of his biggest hit, "Without You", is cut after about 8 bars. Arrrrgh !! There is no excuse for this, not taking into account that the film runs for two hours as is. Lose a few shots to the head and we could have heard at least that song, and maybe one or two more, like "One" or his Oscar winning version "Everybody's Talking." The filmmakers are simply too focused on interpreting Nilsson's psychological information. Mystical and little attentive to his music. My ratings: 7.5 / 10 (under B +) (Seen in NWFC's Reel Music series, 07/01/07)
