This almost documentary look at an enterprising child who lives in the body shop area outside of New York is real at all times. Real lighting. Real sound Less editing in the whole movie than in 1 minute of most movies. And while there is very little script, there is a story. Taken in primary colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we get a real sense of the life of a child who is making something out of nothing. She has a place to live that she makes her own, she has a good job and she is trying to take her sister to her little universe. The people in the area of ​​the article store also took a look at this culture that I did not know. For the most part, they seem decent and they pay Ale what she seems every day, looking really worried about her well-being. The actor (I think) who plays Ale says more with a facial expression than one can imagine. This reminded me of what a real small movie can achieve. It shows what children are capable of, even without much support and love. I definitely recommend it.
