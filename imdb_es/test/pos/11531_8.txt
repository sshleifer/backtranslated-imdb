I realized this in the last and belated Mexican cable and I have to rant about it. The title was translated as "Secrets" (Secrets). Well, there is a secret that has an important part in the movie, but come on! We are not stupid. We know there is a novel behind this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is quite interesting and is carried out by its strong ramáticas performances. The always beautiful and amazing Jordana Brewster and Christopher Eccleston provide excellent performances and have great chemistry among them. Cameron Dìaz is also good, although she has a minimal screen time. Blythe Danner is perfect and her last appearance in the film is moving, sad. Great performances <br /> <br /> The character of Jordana and her sister's ex-boyfriend travel to Europe to deal with their demons and understand why their sister died. Through flashbacks, we learn the sad truth and we can not help feeling sorry for the whole family. The ending is really touching. <br /> <br /> Then there is nudity but it is minimal. In fact, the sex scenes are artistic and do not pretend to be torrid or sexy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I kept looking at them in search of Joranda Brewster on the lovely and beautiful screen. And I ended up liking the story and the dramatic presentations. <br /> <br /> Try this movie if you like solid dramatic features. Great movie. The last, last scene was very sad ... The two little sisters through flashbacks.
