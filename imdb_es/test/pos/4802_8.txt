You know I've seen many Hong Kong movies in terms of production and they were good. But staying without time was great. <br /> <br /> I guess what made it so good was the fact that Andy Lau and Ching Wang have such good chemistry. The film at the beginning has a very fast pace, but slows down, not enough to notice that it is also good, we do not want to have a heart attack, hahaha. In terms of plot, other things are enough to keep you interested. Lau has some very good times, since she wears makeup to pose as people from the underworld. In addition, the film has the best oriental supporting cast from "house of Flying Daggers". <br /> <br /> The movie is great because it is very unpredictable and leaves you thinking about every corner. Definitely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and emotion pacts in one, 8 out of 10
