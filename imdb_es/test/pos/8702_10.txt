The series of subspecies is one of the best vampire movies of all time. There is something in them that makes them special, I think it's the feeling you have when you look at them. <br /> <br /> are set in modern times and, however, they feel as if they were in the 1700`s 1800`s if I think it has something to do with the set`s that is used if so, then it is working. Keep it that way, guys :) <br /> <br /> in a quick summary of what happened in the first part: Radu was supposedly expelled from his homeland years ago by his father and has decided to return and take what he believes is his birth rite. The bloodstone and everything his father has, therefore, he kills his father, who is played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man from the Ghost movies). and it carries the bloodstone that has eminent power to the one who has it, since whoever has it never needs to kill anyone again, because supposedly the stone is destined to shed the blood of the saints and every time the Radu takes a drop from her, he goes slowly insane. (That's all we need a demented vampire as if a normal vampire was not bad enough). Well, Radu's brother, Stephan, tries to stop his evil ones while trying to stop with a tourist who stays in a house / fortress that belongs to a friend of his. <br /> <br /> Well, one thing leads to the other and the two brothers collide, and well, you'll have to watch the movie to see what happens from here on out. <br /> <br /> I will soon review / comment on the other sequels. <br /> <br /> The difference between this and buffy is that buffy is too commercial and it is not so that this will not attract everyone, but it has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy, although Radu does not look as good as the complete wonder Sarah Michelle Gellar :). <br /> <br /> rating of this movie 10/10 a good example of how a vampire movie should be made :). <br /> <br />
