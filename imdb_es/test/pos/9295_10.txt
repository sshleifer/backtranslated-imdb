No matter the country where you have to buy this program, it sure is Australian and if you have ever seen any attempt at our comedy, it is bad enough, but with the hunter the men of forty years who do bad games are not boring. words are a team of people who talk about current issues (practically in Australia) make fun of our ads shit, make fun of our politicians, etc. <br /> <br /> The boys also had a show in 2002 called Cnnnn, which was not as successful as the War that had only started this year, so all they mention is current news that is really good considering that It matters how boring or tragic it is that they try to throw some comic light on things.
