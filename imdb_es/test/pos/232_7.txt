Although the plot of Cover Girl is very weak and tired, it serves as an anchor for the musical numbers of Kern and Gershwin. Following her distinctive role in Gilda, Hayworth chose to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her. In addition to looking as beautiful as ever, she also impresses with her dance. Gene Kelly, who was loaned to Columbia by MGM, coincides with her in the dance and the sequence in which he faces his own shadow was very well done. The secondary characters also acted competently. Personally, I did not enjoy Cover Girl as much as the musicals that Hayworth did with Fred Astaire. However, Cover Girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend. My score: 7/10.
