Venice, in 1596. Jews are separated from good Christians. Basanio, a young but poor Venetian, loves the beautiful Portia, who is a rich heiress. Then he approaches his friend, a merchant named Antonio for three thousand ducats to travel to Belmont and propose Portia. All of Antonio's ships and merchandise are occupied at sea, so he turns to the moneylender Shylock, the one of the Jewish faith. Shylock does not like Antonio, because he spit in his face. He offers Antonio a three-month loan with no interest, but if he does not pay the money at that time, he will own a pound of his meat. In addition, Shylock's daughter, Jessica, runs away with Christian Lorenzo. The merchant of Venice is based on the work of William Shakespeare that is believed to have written. between 1596 and 1598. I read the play last summer and now I have seen the film, made in 2004 by Michael Radford. I liked the work, and I'm not entirely in agreement with the accusations of being anti-Semitic. The Jewish character does not appear as an inhuman monster, even if he is good, he is ready to cut a piece of Antonio's flesh. There is a lot of depth in his character, which appears in his speech where he asks: "If he punches us, do not we bleed?" and much more. There is much more human in the character of Shylock than in Antonio's, who spits out the good Jew. Al Pacino is unbeatable as Shylock. Give such a strong performance. Jeremy Irons is also great like Antonio. Lynn Collins. The most beautiful and brilliant in the role of Portia. Zuleikha Robinson does a great job as Jessica, and Charlie Cox as Lorenzo is also very good. Chris Marshall plays Gratiano, and he does a good job. In the role of Nerissa we see Heather Goldenhersh. Mackenzie Crook plays Launcelot Gobbo. As in Shakespeare, in general, this also contains the most brilliant dialogue. The film presents a fantastic portrait of the era. It deals with some great themes, in a Shakespearian way.
