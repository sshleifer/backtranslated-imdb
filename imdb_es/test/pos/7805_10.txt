There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone you meet and that, however, are box office errors. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls into that category. For once, an Indian director has taken into account the sensibilities of the audience and has not produced a stereo type typical of Kader Khan. The film is about two guys who dream of wealth, and they try to do it by courting the daughter of a millionaire. A humorous drama develops while many complexities arise in the story. The complexities add to the pure comedy of the whole plot. Aamir Khan plays a clever kid on the street, while Salman Khan plays an unexpectedly good role as the dumb boy. The villain played by Paresh Rawal, and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and "Kaliaa" make you laugh while you sleep. Although the film borrows many other films, despite the poor quality camera work, and despite being "noisy" at times, it is still one of the few "fun" movies that Bombay created after films like Padosan , Golmal and other films by Amol Plaekar. It's sad that it did not work well at the box office, because that means that producers resort to formulas and creativity is abandoned.
