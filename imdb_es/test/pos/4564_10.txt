Face it, friends: "DK3" is more challenging, innovative and smart than its predecessor. Challenging: their levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable time. An especially difficult level is called "Lightning Lookout", in which it can be struck by lightning at any given time. Innovative-- it opened many doors. Pity that the SNES died shortly after this title. And smart: the names of the levels range from games with trademark words ("Lake Orangatanga") to witty references that the target audience of the game will not get for many years ("Bleak's House"). <br /> <br /> What bothers me about most people's criticisms about this game is mainly reduced to two words: Kiddy Kong. He is a worthy successor to Diddy Kong's "little friend" and certainly does not deserve to be referred to as "that retarded monkey". "DK3" will remain a classic until the end of time.
