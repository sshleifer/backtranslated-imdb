The congregation of all the monsters in the final film in Universal's renowned cycle of classic horror stories. Count Dracula (an intense and handsome John Carradine), who calls himself Baron Latos, goes to Dr. Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) and asks him to cure himself of his affliction. Naturally, this is just a trick. Then, coincidentally, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney), also known as "The Wolf Man" appears, and of course he * really * wants to heal himself. <br /> <br /> As others have noticed, monsters do not. get equal screen time. The Monster of Frankenstein (Glenn Strange) is released at the end only for the purpose of including all the Universal Monsters. The archival images and music of the library are also reused here. The film spends perhaps too much time with the Dracula part of the story, although Carradine gives an impressive performance, not hammy in the role of the Count. The film is primarily a showcase for Stevens, who traverses his own tragic character and does an excellent job. Women are beautiful, and I have to say that I loved Jane Adams as the luminous nurse, who is humpbacked. <br /> <br /> Of course, it would not be complete without the inclusion of villager villagers. <br /> <br /> A competent and professional cooler is, just for my taste, not very scary, but it is entertaining. It is a respectable series entry in general. <br /> <br /> 7/10
