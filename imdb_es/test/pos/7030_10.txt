This is the best movie, but that's my opinion. Some say it's corny, but I think it's really a beautiful movie. The chemistry between Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze is like no other I've seen, and that's what makes the film so perfect. I always wonder what would have become of this movie if these two actors had never existed, because not only one of them did it for me, they both did. If you've never seen this movie, when you do, you'll understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing looks like it was made from the heart and it feels so real for some reason, like magic, and the LOVE IT soundtrack. In addition to the 2 main actors, the soundtrack makes the film the beauty it is. As you can see, I'm in love with this movie and I know you will be too.
