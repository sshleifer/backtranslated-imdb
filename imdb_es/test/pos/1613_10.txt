The best cinema period began in post-war Europe with the neorealist movement of Italy. During the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, the New Wavers of France attracted everyone's attention, and there was always Bergman there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere, doing bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti completed the artistic circle, geographically speaking, with his miraculous work * Death in Venice *, which could well be called * The Death of Europoean Cinema *. After the sixties ended, so did the great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally sold out and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This film feels like a great summary, not only of the particular obsessions of Visconti, but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in films. And rest assured that you will not find a taskmaster more severe than the one Visconti revealed here. He is not playing with the crowd, friends: either support him and follow him, or stay behind. The rhythm is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. The "incidents" are few and far between, but each of them seems loaded with symbolic meaning in a cosmos of sturm-und-drang. <br /> <br /> We will probably never be in such a strange company again, in terms of the films: one of the great writers of the century who inspired the story (Thomas Mann), one of the best filmmakers who directed it (Visconti ), one of the best actors in the main role (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling almost incessantly in the background, Gustav Mahler 5th symphony. Making the most of Mahler's ability to inspire romanticism even in the most cynical womb, Visconti turns the main character, Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer of his original character as a writer, and even makes Bogarde look like Mahler (geek mustache, specifications, hairy hair, duck foot). Bogarde, by the way, offers what is probably the best interpretation of an actor in the history of the movies: it's a largely silent performance, and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a look, a tricky trick without robberies like Chaplin or simply act like an animated corpse. <br /> <br /> The cinema can not be better than this. I will ignore the complaints of Ritalin addicts who say it is too slow, but even the most legitimate complaint about some Aschenbach flashbacks with that antagonistic friend is misplaced. Flashbacks fit perfectly into the thematic concerns of the film (ie, what is the best path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), And the speed and sharpness of these interruptions serve to prevent drowsiness among viewers . (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway). A continuous current of Mahler and the beautiful and dying Venice would be no more than a pretty image; But this movie is really about something. And what it is mainly about is suffering: romantic suffering (capital R), in particular. Like a romantic who suffered, Visconti knew what he was talking about. <br /> <br /> [SPOILER. . . I guess] If it were not for something else, see * Death in Venice * for your valuable opening credits. . . and for its unforgettable ending, with the jet black tint of Bogarde dripping from his sweaty and dying head and over his white face like chalk. Meanwhile, in the distance, the young Tadzio, object of Bogarde's last wish, stands in the ocean and points towards the horizon like a sculpture by Michelangelo. The climate sequence summarizes with an agonizing economy everything about what the film is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the end of a life in front of the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm and sunny beauty. * Death in Venice * is a miraculous work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD Tip: As with Visconti's masterpiece released simultaneously * The Damned *, I recommend that you activate the English subtitles as you watch this movie. Apparently it is in English, but the sound of the DVD seems murky and, anyway, much Italian is spoken during the movie.] <br /> <br />
