This work is quite atmospheric, with a couple of surprises and some really creepy elements. I found this job more rewarding than I expected, given the bad reviews it receives here at IMDb. The dialogue is presented as something natural and honest (given the circumstances), although the general sequence of the film goes from the predictable to the cliché with the heroines that fall when they should be running, and investigating strange noises when they should be closing their doors. The typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> The local characters are some of the worst clichés, representing the Appalachian natives as developing monsters with developmental problems. The characters of the children and the directors are great! The development given is adequate, and Scout Taylor-Compton seems to be developing his talents quite well. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not going to say that this is completely original or the best since the bread was cut (which is not so good by the way), but this is interesting and I do not have many minutes left . I would not say that this is an impressive movie, but there are some really good horror elements in this document. But there are also some really slow points where the development of the plot / character seems superfluous to the whims of the director (or the editor of the film). <br /> <br /> In general, this is good for a rainy night, but not so good to see on Friday / Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Rate a 7.6 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
