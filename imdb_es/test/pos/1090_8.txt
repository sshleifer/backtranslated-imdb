I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and the lines of the story. An exception for this are the Ramgopal Verma movies. This is a good movie with great performances by the star cast. This is something the movie should see for those who are fed up with watching stupid dances and love stories. The adaptation of the story and the characterization was exceptional. I should see this movie for Nana Patekar. Based on the life of the police of Mumbai Daya Naik, this film deals in a more realistic way. The film delves into the life of the common man, who in addition to being a specialist in meetings. I rate this as one of the best movies of the year.
