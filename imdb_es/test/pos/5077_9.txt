"I'm afraid I'll talk on the perch, where the bound men do not talk at all." This Shakespearean line of The Merchant of Venice is repeated in the new movie Rendition, which presents the viewer with the "improved methods of interrogation," interpretations that began in the Clinton administration and have become more common since the terrorist attacks of September 11. . 2001. <br /> <br /> The film features a star cast, with Oscar winners Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Reese Witherspoon, as well as Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal and Omar Metwally. Support roles played by unknown actors also do so, absorbing the audience in the plot and showing how many people may be affected by terrorist attacks abroad, and our means to investigate them. <br /> <br /> The surrender follows an Egyptian born suspected of terrorism (Metwally) who is taken by US officials after his flight from South Africa to Washington DC to an undisclosed prison abroad. His pregnant wife (Witherspoon) ventures to Washington DC to discover his disappearance through a family friend and an employee of the Senator (Sarsgaard). Gyllenhaal plays a young CIA analyst in the detention center overseas that oversees the violent interrogation. <br /> <br /> This film follows the emotional hardships of the victim of torture (Metwally) and those involved in obtaining the supposed information from him. Some, like the CIA analyst (Gyllenhaal), are visibly moved and horrified by the methods used, while others, the severe senator (Streep) and the foreign interrogator (Yigal Naor), consider it necessary and effective. <br /> <br /> The film can be described by some as a political piece, but ultimately it is emotional. Metwally's performance as the tortured prisoner is worthy of Oscar. The film is not intended to preach, but to question and inform the audience about a topic that often does not have a human face. It is known that representations work, but it is also known that they produce false information from innocent prisoners. The film simply describes the emotional struggles of those involved in such serious issues, and does so in a way that will affect each viewer differently. The movie will keep his interest and will involve him in each of the character's situations.
