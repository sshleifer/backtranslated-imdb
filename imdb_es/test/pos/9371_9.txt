**** SPOILERS WRUGHOUT **** This is a very strange movie, especially for its time, in all aspects. For six years, American films showed American soldiers as the son, the brother and the father of all. <br /> <br /> In films like The best years of our lives and Until the end of time, our hearts feel dragged by the difficulty that sweet returning soldiers have to adapt to peace and their families. However, in this same year, this film shows the soldiers as a mixture of people much worse than the spectator; One of the messages of this film is: "Lock up your daughters." <br /> <br /> Even good soldiers, with a lot of time on their hands, are betting all the time, getting drunk stupidly, and are totally indifferent to whether they still have wives. And his reaction to the police investigating a murder is: conspiring against them. <br /> <br /> Mitchum, the most sympathetic soldier, says things like "I do not know if my wife wants to try." now after the war. I have not seen her in two years. It matters to me? Not really. Maybe we'll try, maybe not. "<br /> <br /> Another soldier is shown as unusually sensitive because, after several years, he would like to see his wife again. <br /> <br /> More Later, when this soldier declares in the police station that he spent the night in the house of a whore, without knowing that his wife is sitting right behind him, it seems that there is no doubt that his wife will be well. It's ... I guess it's "Hey, the soldiers will be soldiers." <br /> <br /> The police detective played by Robert Young who is trying to solve a murder case, claims convincingly and with infinite tiredness about someone's account of their actions on the night in question, <br /> <br /> "I care? No. I do not care about anything anymore. I've done this for too long, I suppose. "<br /> <br /> A man appears in the harlot's apartment He says:" I'm just a man like you, interested in "the whore, then says:" No, That's a lie, I'm her husband. I would like to be in the army, they rejected me before. "When he says:" No, that's a lie, why would I want to be a soldier? "He goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is. the movie, we have no idea who he is or why he is there! He is one of the strangest characters in the history of the movies! <br /> <br /> A man is standing with his girlfriend in a bar talking with four soldiers, when a clumsy soldier gives a drink to his girlfriend, she goes to change dress, and is back wearing another, no problem, however, the man does not leave with his girlfriend, who simply disappears but follows one of the soldiers when he goes to another area of ​​the bar, then the man extrapolates from the minimal information he learned about the soldier, to philosophize greatly about the problems of returning soldiers, and immediately invites the soldier to his house because he is drunk and feels I'm sick, this is something strange. <br /> <br /> In the same way, a girl in the dance hall is irritated by the sentimental soldier who wants to take her out "for a real dance, and maybe a dinner". However, she dances with him, and immediately gives him the key to her home! <br /> <br /> Did people in the late 1940s always urge soldiers to come to their homes after they met them? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan kills his host, a stranger, when he is enraged because the Jewish host is trying to get Ryan out of his house. The motive of the murder? "No Jew tells me how to drink." "How to drink?" Hey, what does that mean? <br /> <br /> This movie is always off center, very deliberately, the soldiers act consistently with a complete challenge to the law, and all the characters are as cold and hard as any movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> And yet, the movie is absolutely exciting! He simply has no idea how these people are going to act, or what new and strange character will appear, without anyone thinking that the actions of the person are strange in the least, for example, the behavior of the wife. <br /> <br /> The performance is about the best I've ever seen: Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Gloria Grahame (who won an Oscar nomination), Paul Kelly and other actors I had never heard of. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of this movie, and it is a real pleasure to have discovered one that I will want to see again and again. It's really weird but it's impossible to look the other way because you have no idea what these creatures will do next.
