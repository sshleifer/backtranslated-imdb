I've seen three of the Animatrix episodes, and this is my favorite of them all. The Second Renaissance provided a feeble story to the already feeble universe. The program was a stylistically impressive number, it felt a bit silly. I guess what gives this special touch is the direction of Shinichiro Watanabe, director of the incredibly popular series (and for good reasons) Cowboy Bebop. It has some of the best elements of Bebop: sneaky, science fiction adventure, a senseless hero, a little apathetic who works for rent, a reward head (more or less) and a chase scene, all wrapped in excellent packaging of black cinema. Watanabe's Tarantino-style cunning comes here at full throttle.
