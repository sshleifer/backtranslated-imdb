In addition to being an intelligent and well-marketed variation on the hugely popular horror genre of today and a splendid formula for attracting potential new fans in general, I have always considered myself "Supernatural" as a massively massive tribute to the genre through of the decades. Although not always visible to younger viewers and / or people who only have an interest in the latest horror films, each and every episode contains some obvious and more subtle references to classic and influential titles. From that point of view, it was only a matter of time before the writers paid homage to the kind of 'spooky vehicle without a driver', and even more specifically the milestones of the 70s "Duel" (the acclaimed debut of Steven Spielberg) and "The car". Being an avid fan of these two movies, I really enjoyed "Route 666" even in spite of its flaws and shortcomings. The episode opens tense and atmospheric in a remote route of Missourian, where a black man is persecuted and, finally, murdered by a menacing truck monster without apparently having a driver behind the wheel. The victim's daughter, Cassie, is Dean's ex-girlfriend and she asks for help from the Winchester brothers. The brothers can not avoid two other similar "accidents" before discovering that the sudden presence of a ghost truck is related to a racial dispute of the 60s, involving both Cassie's parents and several more prominent inhabitants of the small city. Some of my fellow reviewers here tend to label "Route 666" as one of the weakest entries in the first season, mainly because the script is too predicative of racial problems and shows a different and more emotional side to the character of Dean. He is usually the strong and silent type, while here he faces romantic issues without ending the past here. At some level I agree with the debate on racism, but it did not really bother me much. The writers finally had to give an explanation to the presence of the ghost truck, and the racial conflict is acceptable as far as I am concerned. Regarding Dean's emotional vulnerability, I can only say that it is admirable to see how writers continually try to provide depth and detail to the main characters. Dean's behavior towards Cassie throws a new light on him, in fact. In addition, what really counts in this episode is the wonderfully sinister truck and its virulent attacks. It is an impressive and overwhelming vehicle, producing blinding lights and noises of creepy engines. In case you saw the brilliant "Duel" mentioned above, you will definitely find some fun in the convincing sequences of chase shown in the "Route 666".
