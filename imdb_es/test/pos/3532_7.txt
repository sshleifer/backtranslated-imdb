Have I been postponing the purchase of this since its release on DVD? on the one hand, because I had been somewhat disappointed by the other two horror titles of this director (SQUIRM [1976] and BLUE SUNSHINE [1977]), but also by the fact that it is said that the film itself has been trimmed a bit by blood Media Blasters / Shriek Show 2-Disc Set! Now I found it as a rental and I'm glad I did it? because not only is it superior to previous efforts (at least, in this preliminary evaluation), but I also discovered that the film is one of the best imitations of THE Texas CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974). This factor, however, only helped me to remind myself that I still have another similar example to look at. Wes Craven's classic THE HILLS HYE EYES (1977), whose Anchor Bay 2-Disc R1 edition I bought some time ago but, after all, the Halloween time is fast approaching ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film manages a wooden atmosphere without disturbing effort (it was filmed in the regions of forests and mountains of Oregon)? with a lot of effective frissons in everything but, fortunately, not too much violence (even if the last of the villains is sent in a rather outrageous way!). The main young cast here (one of them played by Jack Lemmon's son, Chris) is not as obnoxious as the ones we usually find in this kind of genre offer. Despite freely enjoying the shenanigans, one is associated with films aimed at teenagers and which, in general, persist to this day! George Kennedy appears as a sympathetic forest ranger; Although he does not have much to do, his characterization is decidedly improved by turning him into a lover of plant and animal life. It is also notable among locals the well-known character of actor Mike Kellin in a good role as the drunk who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the narrative. his warning to teenagers, of course, goes unnoticed, but then he can take Kennedy to them. <br /> <br /> The hermetic family that teenagers meet in the woods, then, it is revealed that their skeleton eventually hides a skeleton While one of the girls shows genuine curiosity in the presence of intruders, the the rest is openly hostile to them. and, in the case of corpulent and rude twins, appropriately spooky (one of them is even prone to maniacal laughter during his riots); At a certain point in the narrative, the Ranger even offers an interesting explanation about the nature of his aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior.
