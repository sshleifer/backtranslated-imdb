Yes, I'm sentimental, and yes, I love movies where children are the best humans. It is true that Klatret√∏sen has some logical deficiencies or plots. These are more than compensated for by the great performance of the children (the first role of Julias in the film!) And the charm of a Dogma movie (I liked this kind of cinematographic art long before the Dogma, since the Herz Herz "Herz aus Glas"). Well, I cried during the last fifteen minutes, which is a tear factor higher than the one that Bambi or Fly away home had for me.
