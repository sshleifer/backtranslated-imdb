... this film was made when Hitler (and Mussolini, who is also in the film) was at the top and a lot of politics and even the Roman Church used to close its eyes on the brutality and evil of Nazism. Especially in the USA UU There were many people who had not understood what was really happening in Germany and Europe (Charles Lindenbergh, for example). It would be like today a great actor would make a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac. Chaplin perhaps made many mistakes in his life, but this is truly a masterpiece of humanity and, in my humble opinion, a great demonstration that he was a brave man. The film is fun and deep, the final speech has a terrible force and is still up to date. I think this movie is one of the best that has been made.
