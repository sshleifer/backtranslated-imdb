Battleship Potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. The address of <br /> <br /> Eisenstein is truly a show. The film tells a ship of disgruntled sailors <br /> <br /> who are tired of being mistreated by their superior officers. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the sailors finally have enough abuse and send the packing officers packing. During this period, there was a shortage of films <br /> <br /> in the Soviet Union. The government wanted to convey its message to people, so they created a National Film Company and one of <br /> <br /> between the members was Sergei Eisenstein. The films were filmed in tiny budgets <br /> <br /> and the shortage of films forced Eisentein to be careful <br /> <br /> and be selective with the images he filmed. In the end, Eisenstein had <br /> <br /> reuse the footage to make a feature film. <br /> <br /> The most famous piece of action sets in this movie is the most <br /> <br /> We talk about massacre on the steps. This scene was faked in Bananas <br /> <br /> and more recently in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables. If you want to <br /> <br /> learn to make movies, I strongly advise you to watch Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> It is one of the essential elements. <br /> <br /> A +
