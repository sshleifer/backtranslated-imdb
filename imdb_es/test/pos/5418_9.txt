Man, I'm delighted I can leave comments during these 10 minutes. I love. <br /> <br /> After not seeing it in years, I found it the other day and I looked at it again and again. <br /> <br /> 'Stop shaking your eyes' and' shake A rock and roll band and 'Stop the sawing the table' are classic lines. <br /> <br /> The art is deliciously raw. The scarce and wonderful dialogue. You just have to find it and love it. I can not recommend this enough. <br /> <br /> Thank you, high school art teacher, Mrs. Kogan, for showing us this again and again. Thanks NFB for letting it be done. Thank you MTS for showing it (free at least for the moment). <br /> <br /> I want a Big Snit t-shirt now. I would love an animation cell, but at 440.00 a pop, that will not happen. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and watch it.
