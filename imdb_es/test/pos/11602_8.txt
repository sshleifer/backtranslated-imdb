The Hindi version of the film is 121 minutes. Set in Bengal in the early 1900s, the film (based on Tagore's novel) draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women. Binodini, an educated and beautiful woman, becomes a widow within a year of her marriage, but does not accept the restrictions imposed on her as a widow by her society. The film has a beautiful appearance, but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of his depth to portray the strong character of Binodini with his subtle combination of idealism and cunning. Binodini's idealism does not manifest itself, and as a result, the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried.
