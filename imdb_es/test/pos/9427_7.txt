Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) engage in a battle of wit to control the more recent creation of a sighting bomb by a Switz inventor. Holmes wants to safeguard it for the British, while Moriarty is not above selling to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> While, no doubt, many fans will be disappointed to see Holmes updated to the war setting of the 1940s, this particular movie demonstrates a joyous fun that does not accumulate in propaganda of war as I could have done. . Inspector Lestrade of Dennis Hoey and Dr. Watson of Nigel Bruce tend to steal the program, since the clumsy methods of their characters always provide a delicious comic relief. The battle between Holmes and Moriraty is colorful and well thought out to start. Atwill does as well as Moriarty, although it is not as memorable as others who played the role. <br /> <br /> While this does not provide anything especially new or exciting to the fans of the series, it's a wonderful escape from reality, something appropriate for 1942 in my opinion, which reflects many serial adventures of films from the years 1930 and 1940, but It has a more compact, less repetitive plot. And all this is done while remaining faithful to the basic spirit of Sherlock Holmes.
