Like classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. A must for those interested in the French music room (including a song by Ã‰dith Piaf) and for the wonderful end of Cancan of more than 10 minutes. The dance in the film is not at all like what usually happens with Cancan. <br /> <br /> Some may object to Technicolor costumes and bright lighting, but they give you a clear view of some of the great costumes and ensembles. <br /> <br /> Consider it Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris in which he grew up. Certainly, the film by Jean Renoir for people who do not like his films seriously or who only like his Hollywood productions. <br /> <br />
