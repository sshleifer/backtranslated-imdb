Crackerjack is a simple but very good movie in which the good ones are very good and the bad ones are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sides. <br /> <br /> The combination of the central character is played by Mick Malloy. and the central place was that the local grass clubs attracted an unusually large crowd, from a large number of teenagers to a large number of older people, and everyone laughed at the comedy. <br /> <br /> As would be expected from a movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy there was a bit of insult, but it was not exaggerated and the audience I sat with certainly enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Mick Malloy did a good job as the lazy guy who joined the bowling club (three times) simply to get parking spaces (one for him and two to lease to others in exchange for a premium) but who has everything at stake when he is required to play or lose his membership. <br /> <br /> Judith Lucy does a good job as your local journalist / love-interest and there are fabulous people Performances by Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maughan, Lois Ramsey and many others. <br /> <br /> John Clarke's role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest characters, but he offers solid acting. <br /> <br /> The not so subtle hits in the pokies provide a serious note to this comedy, otherwise slight. <br /> <br /> I'm sure those who enjoyed The Castle and The Dish would also enjoy this movie.
