This is a good thriller at a nuclear power plant in Southern California that was directed by James Bridges and the stars Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas. Fonda plays a television reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist, but is only allowed to be a television reporter. Douglas is an independent cameraman and Lemmon is a supervisor at a nuclear plant. Fonda and Douglas are sent to a routine mission in a nuclear power plant and almost an accident occurs and everything is filmed. Everyone tries to hide it, except Fonda and Douglas, so Douglas steals the movie. Lemmon begins to investigate and discovers that the company is more concerned with the benefits than for the safety of the plant. It's a good movie with a pretty good ending.
