This was a very rough movie about anti-Semitism. However, unlike the GENTLEMEN AGREEMENT (which also deals with anti-Semitism), the film has aged well and does not seem to be a hard hand. In other words, treat the subject without appearing to be a preacher or trivial by today's standards. <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan plays one of the vilest characters, as he hits a man to death just because he is Jewish. Robert Mitchum plays the investigator who tries to get to the bottom of this crime. <br /> <br /> I praise the film for its rough and unshakeable appearance in the face of hatred. In many ways, it is an example of Film Noir, although the issue is not about gang members or habitual robberies.
