Since the last couple of days I'm really hooked on the "Female Scorpion" series and I'm still sticking in my head because I've waited until now. What is too long? Before buying the complete set of the box. "Stable Beast" is the third brilliant effort in a row, and the undeniable triumph of this series is how writers have always created something completely new and different for each delivery. Never before, or after, has there been a series of farms that offered so much variety when it comes to stories, scenarios, themes and filming styles. The original, more or less qualified, like a movie called "Women-in-Prison" (but it is already atypical), but it is not possible to classify the parts 2 and 3 as such, since they almost do not present images inside the walls of the prison. . And the general tone and atmosphere also change with each new episode. The first film was harsh and harsh, while the second was psychedelic and the third part is mostly melodramatic. However, do not let this last description discourage you, since "Beast Stable" still presents more than enough exploitation issues and disturbing scenes despite the dramatic environment. The opening sequence, for example, is downright fantastic. Sasori, still a fugitive from the law, literally makes her way to freedom in the subway when there is no other possibility but to cut the arm of the persistent policeman who handcuffed her. His career in the city with his arm cut off from his while the credits appear on the screen, accompanied by the familiar theme, is pure and genuine exploitation of gold! The story continues convincingly with our heroine desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in the big city, but the poor simply can not escape from her past or even from new types of agony. Sasori befriends a prostitute, although without exchanging dialogues, and takes a job in a sewing workshop. His own retarded brother (!) Impregnates the prostitute, while Sasori gets into trouble with the local network of procuring and clandestine crime. She deftly prevents a bully from taking advantage of her body, encounters a former enemy of the prison and furiously defeats one of the prostitutes when subjected to a barbarous abortion. Meanwhile, the one-armed policeman is still obsessively wandering the streets, seeking reprisals against Sasori. Our multi-talented director, Shunya Ito, traces all these lines of history to form a powerful and complete, and never loses control of the visual aspects or the ingenious style of filming. "Beast Stable" presents some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine, the editing is impeccable and the exterior locations are really depressing. Those who know the character of Sasori a little are aware that the film lacks memorable dialogues, but this is always compensated for by the wonderful charisma on the screen and the menacing faces of Meiko Kaji. There is very little laziness, apart from the incestuous sub-plot mentioned above, but the brief flashes of extreme violence are terrible and the twisted end is almost too bright for words. In fact, I think the third part could be the best (or at least, my favorite) one of the series so far. My only small and totally irrelevant point of criticism is with regard to the ridiculous sounds that one of the birds produces when Sasori is locked in a cage. That bird sounds like a ventriloquist's doll with stomach cramps.
