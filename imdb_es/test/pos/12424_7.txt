In the veins of Jeepers Creepers and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Monster Man surprisingly well done, though meaningless, little horror. Add a little comedy of friends, nice gore and intense fear. It's hard to say that Monster Man is really entertaining. The low budget seems pretty obvious, but it did not affect the presentation of the film in general and put to shame more horror films of big budget. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is as generic as possible. The couple of friends, Adam (Eric Jungman) and Harley (Justin Urich) are driving across the country to interrupt the wedding of a woman that Adam has always loved. While Adam is a more nerdy guy, Harley is a self-proclaimed woman and a very offensive speaker. Adding a bonus to the plot, then picked up a sexy hitchhiker, Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things turn into a nightmare when a monster truck with a scary face stalks them. When the corpse begins to count, they must make the race against the time before their own life at risk. <br /> <br /> The plot obviously reminds of many previous famous horror films, but Michael Davis as a writer and director succeeds in maintaining tension. The scare is well built, where the characterization is never the best, but it is quite good. The script is also full of comedies that work for fun moments and are quite nice instead of annoying and also await the turn in the final. It's hilarious and shocking at the same time, which is pretty fun. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Monster Man is surprisingly entertaining. It deserves more attention on the big screen. Prove that the big budget does not make an effective horror movie, but the ability does! Something that the director has shown and delivered.
