I admit that I have never seen "Waiting for Guffman", the comic mock comedy acclaimed by the critics of 1997 about a small town that is the scene of a contest. When the advertising of Best in Show had the motto "Of the team that brought you waiting for Guffman", a good number of critics implied in their criticism that only people who are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time watching this movie For shame, critics, for shame twice! Any critic that implies something like that with any movie probably does not want to share the richness of the movie with the rest of the world, but this is a movie that I hope people will experience, now that it is the video / dvd. "Best in Show" is, without a doubt, the best comedy of 2000. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a fictional style, presenting the main competitors (not to mention the screwballs) of the annual Mayflower " Best In Contest "Show", where dogs of all races come to compete to see who is the best dog, we have the adorable and docile Harry Pepper (guest) with his hound, the single Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy & O ' Hara) with his terriors, yuppies Hamilton & Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), gay dog ​​groomers Scott Dolan and Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins & McKean), and Sherie Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) millionaires, along with their trainer Christy Cummings (Lynch) Everyone has their mind on a simple object: the blue ribbon, which will be given to the best dog, and ... do I have to tell them the rest? <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​humor director / writer / star Guest is one who assures me that there are comedies that are worth laughing for, and that La idiotez de Movies like "American Pie" or other "teen" movies without meaning will not take over the world after all. His idea is simple: make your comedy not only fun, but also INTELLIGENT. But instead of following the brilliant steps of films like "Effect zero" and "High fidelity", he used a rather unusual approach (and, as I understand it, he also used this approach for "Guffman"). Whether you notice it or not, a big part of the movie is improvisation. In other words, what the actors say and do is probably not written in the script, perhaps not even by the guest and the co-writer / star Levy. But with a kind hand from Guest, he and the actors achieved a hilarious theatrical deed that would have probably failed if it had been handled by other, less expert actors. Now that is smart! <br /> <br /> The cast is, of course, what makes improvisation work the most. All of them are wonderful (comical) to contemplate, especially Guest like Pepper. But the real highlight has to be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, the clueless presenter of the competition who can write the most outrageously funny stories and comments that any advertiser would ever dream of ... that is, if the announcer tried to be one. funny. Williard can go from talking about the dog to passing by suddenly and talking about how much he can do bench press. There is even a part in which he gives an idea for a new marketing strategy: make attractive women put on tight shirts and shorts with dogs and hint at something like "having the style of a puppy of an era". It has no price, as is its performance. <br /> <br /> I hope that people participate in this 90-minute "dogumentary". The film deserves so much recognition. He was nominated for Best Film-Comedy in the Golden Globes, but he did not win. I can not see why. I mean, in the comedy department, it's the best show. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A
