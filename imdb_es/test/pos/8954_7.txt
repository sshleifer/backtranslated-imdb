I watched this movie on the wire on Saturday afternoon. Man, he dragged it. I have the metaphors, the symbolism, and all those things. No, I did not care one way or another about the sexuality of the characters. But, the pace of the story and the scripts almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> That's ... until Ruth Marshall got undressed. If you are a man of breasts that is not homophobic, you may want to rent it. Ruth has a scene of lesbian sex that is quite hot, and then a hetero sex scene that is a category higher than most standard movies. His cheerful D glasses made the movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> - The Mighty Avatar
