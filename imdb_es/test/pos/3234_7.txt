I think this film version of NORTHANGER ABBEY is pretty good. It's certainly fun. Well, it is not a masterpiece like PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ('95) but there are very good things ... especially the surroundings of the City of Bath. ..The Royal Crescent, the Roman baths, the fascinating Georgian atmosphere .. That's excellent. If you are a Bath fan like me, you will love watching this movie! The performances may seem too melodramatic, but I have the impression that this film, like the novel itself, deliberately mocks the popular tales of romance and terror and the society of the time. The only drawback is probably the female lead, since I personally have another idea of ​​the physical appearance of Catherine Morland. The music is also a bit "unusual" ... but strangely I find it acceptable even though it has nothing to do with the historical period represented. I wonder what dear old Jane would think ... :)
