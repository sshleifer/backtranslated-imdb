I saw this film at the Telluride Film Festival in 1997, where one of the writers, Jos√© Giovanni, was honored. It is classified as a great noir-crime drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura. The attention given to each character and the complex psychological representations, which detail loyalty, betrayal, love and hope, are tremendous. It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller and an excellent movie. Up there with the best of Melville. (The title in English 'Class all risk,' in French 'Classe tous risques' is a play on 'Classe Touriste,' which means 'Tourist Class'.
