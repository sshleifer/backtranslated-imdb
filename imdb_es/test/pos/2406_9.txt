I wish the series had not ended so soon. Although the performance may not be the best in the world, it ends on a positive note and teaches moral values ​​and values ​​to viewers. Hilary Swank did a good job of portraying a high school student who had lost her parents, etc. Miyagi was great as in the previous 3! If you do not like the happy ending, this movie, like the previous 3 of the series, is not for you. This day in which we live, you can not see enough about the bad guys getting what they deserve and the good guys who are in front. The Bible teaches that good will always triumph over evil. That is exactly what happens in this. It is a great family movie. Please see it if you have not already done so.
