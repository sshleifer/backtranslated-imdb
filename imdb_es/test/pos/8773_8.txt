I'm a big fan of Hitchcock, since I saw "Rear Window" on television. "Saboteur" is not the best thing about Hitchcock for me, it's very good, but it's not a masterpiece. It has its flaws, some parts are quite slow and, as a consequence of its cancellation, the script felt quite incomplete. But the direction of Hitchcock is excellent, and the performances were not so bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane do a good job, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very close to stealing the show. The story is good, about a man abused in the race, issues very similar to those used in "39 Steps" and "North By Northwest", and skillfully provides a much needed escapism. The musical score was absolutely outstanding; The music in the opening title sequence was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and I liked the excavations at the First Piano Concerto by Tchaikovsky and the Fifth Symphony by Beethoven. The cinematography is also sharp and smooth, the landscapes and landscapes almost dazzling and there is also a series of very effective scenes. Namely, the climax of the Statue of Liberty, but the meeting of the circus company and the shooting of Radio Music City Hall are also at stake. Overall, it's not the best of Hitchcock, but it's definitely worth it. 8/10 Bethany Cox
