This movie is fun in more ways than one. It has action. He has humor He has attitude. You have Dolemite, the army of kung fu girls! And that's just what the movie offers as a movie. Some also act badly, the microphone makes more than one cameo and some "hits" fail at the feet. But when you make such a great movie, who has time to pay attention to those "details"? This movie is cool. Rent it tonight, if you can find it ... I had to buy it to see it, but I do not regret it!
