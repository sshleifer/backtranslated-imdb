In Queen of The Damned, Akasha (Aaliyah) was sexier and had a bigger and more demanding presence, it just got your attention and attention. now the film had flaws, like the lack of explanation of Akasha's past. What I did not like either was that the film really did not explain or show more than it was the relationship between Lestat and Akasha. The role of Akasha (Aaliyah) was somewhat limited in the movie and he did not. appears until the second half of the film and then, to top it off, his death (of Akasha) was 2 quickly. But I liked the way Akasha fought back when the ancients tried to kill her, because in the book the last fight between Akasha and The Ancients was pretty boring (they killed Akasha in about 2 seconds). Akasha's head hit in 1 second and Lestat became the biggest punk in the world. <br /> <br /> Aaliyah played Akasha very well and Stuart was perfect as Lestat, they could not have chosen a better Akasha or Lestat.
