The movie was really good. I am an avid fan of mysteries and I usually realize who will kill and who committed the murder. While I realized who was going to be killed, I did not realize who did it. I was not happy with the representation of the character of Gerda, but given the year in which the movie was going to take place, it is possible that the woman had been so 'cloying'. Keep in mind that while these Poirot movies are good, they just do not have the same dynamics as the series because they do not have Japp, Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings. David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I have seen all the actors who have interpreted it. The worst was Peter Ustinov!
