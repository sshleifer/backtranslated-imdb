This is an excellent and little known movie. Tom Selleck does an excellent job acting in this film, with the Japanese 'Clint Eastwood'. I would love to see if this movie has been released on DVD yet, there are some points that have clearly been cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) has clearly had some parts cut off. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the movie. Baseball sequences are by far the most realistic of all baseball movies, I'm pretty sure that most of the actors were current or former baseball players. I love to upload the film of this film at least once a year. The best scenes involve the lack of hats after Tom fights the big game and an intensely sensual scene of Tom taking a hot bath with Hiroku. Dennis Haysbert also does a great job, it's good to see that he finally gets some recognition, not just in baseball movies (he was also in the big leagues).
