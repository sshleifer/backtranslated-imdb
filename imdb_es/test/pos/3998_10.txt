This movie could be a bit boring for some people, but I think this movie is very interesting in terms of an attempt to reveal a tradition. <br /> <br /> The director, Lim, has made two films about traditional music in Korea before this movie. The film before this one showed the music throughout the film, and this movie tries to achieve similar things by having backgrounds in the film as a picture. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that, the story is written by both the director and the philosopher, Kim, who is a well-known academic in Korea (with many degrees, including the doctor at Havard), I'm not saying that educated people make better movies, but the philosopher is an expert in traditional culture in Korea. So he gives more credit to this film.
