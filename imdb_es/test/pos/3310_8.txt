It is interesting to see how society is represented at the end of the fifties in this film. Men are lusty, chain-smoking and have one thing in mind (time has not changed much for men, but "sexual harassment") and women are in the workplace just hanging out until they find a husband and they are established. Part of the dialogue is very valuable, but it is still charming in an innocent and past manner. I love the opening credits that show a romantic and exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing "The Best Of Everything" on the soundtrack. I want to jump directly to some scenes, filmed in the streets of New York, around 1959 and experience a moment that I have only seen in films and photographs. Some scenes from this movie reminded me of the "Working Girl" of Melanie Griffith. Especially when Hope Lange (who is a cross between Grace Kelly and Dolores Hart) is bombed in Stephen Boyd's handsome apartment, he accommodates her and just watches her sleep (like Melanie, she wants to know if "something" happened between them a day following ). Joan Crawford is definitely comparable to the horrible boss of Sigourney Weaver, except that it was very unpleasant (with a soft core), but Sigourney's character was sweet on the outside and horrible on the inside. I found it distressing how the character of Suzy Parker (Gregg) began as an independent woman with professional goals to be an actress, who supposedly did not need a man to complete it, he finished. She becomes a stalker / crazy / crazy when she lets the man she falls in love drive her bananas after he's finished with her. I loved the character Mary Agnes, the gossip from the office, with her thick New Yawk accent. If you like movies like "Valley Of The Dolls", you will like it too.
