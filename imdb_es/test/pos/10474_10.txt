A soft story, insinuating fury, with a message of redemption and a glorious celebration. The photograph is beautifully executed. The directors of photography see this type of film to perfect their craft, not only for what the eye can do to improve a story, but also what the correct vocabulary of the camera can do to increase the emotion. Feed the soul is, by definition, what this film, but with an elegance and grace of delivery that simply does not happen much, at least with this degree of taste, moderation and delicacy. If you are interested in the development of stories and characters, this is also a great movie to see as an example of what simple lines and correct delivery can do to completely complete the impression of a character. Match all this with a movie score that is almost minimalist in character and that is also perfectly conceived, and you will get "this movie".
