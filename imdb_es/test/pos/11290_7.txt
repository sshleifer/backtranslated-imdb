Although the film does not really care, this is a myth of Creation. God (a convulsive and bloody figure in a chair) cuts his organs with a razor and dies in his own filth. Mother Earth rises from her corpse and becomes impregnated with her seed, giving birth to Man. However, it is very unlikely that you will discover any of this without first reading a synopsis, and it is not especially important for the film that you do it, since it is more a surreal thing of artistic images, all in black processed and black. White. It creates a sickly and somber atmosphere with austere photography and minimal sounds (mostly dripping water, moans, scrapes, etc.), but each scene lasts a little too long, just like the movie in general. This could have been great as a short film, and the scene of God who committed suicide was excellent and extremely spooky, especially for being the first thing you see, but it is difficult to be patient when it lasts so long and you do not even know what you are seeing during a lot part of the time. <br /> <br /> Still, it's a good movie for the original style, images, atmosphere and content.
