It is an interesting exercise to witness the first works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision offered by hindsight, you can see the gears and wheels that make these people what they are. Below is a look at the past of Christopher Nolan, one of the great storytellers of the history of time. <br /> <br /> The cinematographic style of Christopher Nolan puts a lot of emphasis on the delivery of the story. Although people might complain, it relies too much on the change of time from one place to another, I still find it fascinating to see how they use that technique differently each time. Memento was probably the most intricate story I have seen in my life. It discovers the hardened cynics who say it's an old piece of meat wrapped in an elegant dressing. Memento shows how even the simplest stories can be turned into a game of the mind. The Prestige, which was considerably reduced in comparison, still showed creativity in the way its three stories were intertwined. Even in an obsolete company like the Batman series, Christopher Nolan sprayed some of his extraordinary tricks to weave threads, giving a new life to the dark knight. see a dilettante writer, who becomes a reluctant voyeur, who becomes an unknown accomplice to a variety of misdemeanors, and finally sees an ending that no one could have expected. Since I had never heard of "Follow" before, I had no idea what to expect. At each point, the movie kept me guessing where I was going. Since the angle of the mystery was clear, I was constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next. And that's where I think the movie is so successful. The movie has many elements that led me to many wild goose chases. <br /> <br /> The film is completely black and white and is told in multiple timelines, both of which are considered sophisticated these days. The following does all this in the least formulated or artificial way possible. There does not seem to be a reason why the story is told in the way it is, but you do not feel like you are taken for a spin. The lack of pretension or self-conscious arrogance is what makes this narrative style work. Highly recommended!
