I was very touched by the experiences of the young life of a man who ascended so high in the academic world. A difficult life surrounded by the love of a close family and an extended family of company workers created a person capable of success in the world. For the most part, the Hispanic culture is shown as I have always observed and admired: hardworking, optimistic and truly family oriented. The points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the Catholic Church. Undoubtedly, the actress who played the mother deserves an Academy Award. His prayers for his lost son made me cry. I will recommend this incredibly thoughtful movie to my friends and family.
