In Sri Lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organization, has claimed approximately 68,000 lives since 1983. Rights groups Humans have said that, as a result of the war, more than a million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps. The impact on children and families caught in the conflict is dramatized with sensitivity by the acclaimed director of Tamil, Mani Ratnam, in his 2002 film, A Peck on the Cheek, winner of several awards at the National Film Awards of the India. While the civil war is simply a backdrop to the story of a girl's journey of discovery, the human cost of the war becomes quite clear and Ratnam gives the struggle a universal context, pointing to global arms dealers. as the source of evil. <br /> <br /> Beautifully photographed in South India by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran in an environment that reflects the land of Sri Lanka, the film tells a moving story about a 9-year-old adopted girl who He proposes to find his real mother In the midst of the fighting in Sri Lanka. Played with deep feeling and expressiveness by P.S. Keerthana in a memorable performance, Amudha is raised by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after their natural parents, Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fight broke out, leaving her in a Red Cross Field In a loving flashback, we see the adoptive parents of Amudha, Father Thiru (Madhavan), a prominent Tamil writer, and Mother Indra (Simran), a television personality, get married to facilitate the adoption of the girl with the darkest skin. <br /> <br /> Young Amudha has no idea that she will be adopted until abruptly presented on her ninth birthday, in accordance with the parents' prior agreement. While she plays, Thiru tells her almost in a tone of fact that "you're not our daughter" and the answer is predictable. Distressed, she asks who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave up and so on, but there are few answers to come. Amudha escapes several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her real mother, now a fighter for Tamil separatists. The immersion of the family in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, handled mainly by Ratnam, although a sequence in which the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateur. <br /> <br /> A Peck on the Cheek is, of course, a Bollywood movie and that means tons of music and melodrama. The melodrama did not interpose due to the strong performances of the main actors; However, I found that the musical dramatizations of the songs of A. R. Rahman counteract the mood of the film with its high production techniques and its edition of music video style. However, the convincing nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the limitations of the film. Tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country for being too clich√© and commercial, but A Peck on the Cheek is both an entertainment film and one that deals with serious issues. Successfully crossing the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute.
