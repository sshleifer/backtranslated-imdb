Let's take this out of the way, so that those who look at this page and seek information about anything related to the word "Senos" (and you know who they are, googlers) can move forward: this is not in any way pornographic. On the contrary, if this has any value as a material of masturbation, then, frankly, the filmmaker did not do a good job since the objective is to keep it in the subject and in the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and of society and Health and so on. In fact, it would be a little circumspect of someone who found this on a DVD or, if it ever played again, late at night on HBO or Cinemax and used it as a means of pleasure. You could also go to the supermarket and pick up a couple of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and, well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> No, this is a semi-serious movie. what is made for night vision of first quality, but it should not be only for the nocturnal types. This is intimate in the configuration but not in the tone. All women, in all their variety of shapes and sizes, and races, and even with only one man with false breasts, have something of value to say, from the experience of life in the most direct way. If I say semi-serious, it is due to the small segments that the director feels she needs to include, with the archive images of old videos of "how to do" about puberty and sex and breasts and super weird drawings with the knockers flying about. This is not a problem but an asset: we need some small visual segments to go between these interviews. <br /> <br /> Nothing stops, and we see it as a feminism in a liberating way: they do not need to cover themselves, and even if they decide not to take off their blouses, shirts and braces, they are still open, since they can be a natural part of your body that is an object of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort. , curiosity, motherhood and, sadly, cancer. In that last part, there is another brave step since we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast. You know that you have become mature and adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live an almost normal life with a breast (the bittersweet moment is when she says that if a fairy godmother said she could have a wish). to have two full breasts she would have to think about it), and do not laugh or leave "eww, disgusting". That is the test, friends. <br /> <br /> It has not been filmed in the best circumstances, but again for TV it is edited with a tight rhythm. It is never boring for a moment, and we never feel that someone is being repressed, especially when a man can hear the hard truth that breasts may not be really erogenous, or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men. Senos: a documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and uncovered minds and hearts. If that's worthy of a "I was alone" session, then, well, more power for you, I suppose, although it's not the intention.
