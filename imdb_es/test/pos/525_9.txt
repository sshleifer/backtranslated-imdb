I did not know what to expect from this immensely popular (and hilarious) Swedish comedy and satire team, as they released their first feature film. More satire? Well, we have four contemporary, exceptionally memorable stories, about family pains, generational gaps and paternity, in particular. But it's drama, luckily, and what a drama! Epic in scope, since each episode is from geographically different parts of Sweden carefully selected. But each story could seriously include a full movie, if it is expanded separately. <br /> <br /> It's dark, twisted, heartbreaking, but at the same time massive and surprisingly executed. The script, the acting and the cinematography are world class, since three hours seem to pass in the blink of an eye! There are four nuances of domain and, easily, one of the best movies in the history of cinema in the nation. It's Sweden's answer to "Shortcuts" or "Magnolia", if you wish, and instantly on par with those! <br /> <br /> 9 of 10 from Ozjeppe
