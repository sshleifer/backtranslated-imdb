The director loves the actress and it shows. The actress lives in the character, whom we love at first sight and sound. The character loves his unattractive jealous husband and he loves her. His childhood friend secretly loves his wife and the fact that his friend is a beautiful woman makes love tragic and ironic. His wife is jealous of her childhood friend and believes that her attentions are out of secret love for her husband. <br /> <br /> Then there is the murder and the investigative police lieutenant, who loves only his bi-racial son, and the resentments that have been taken from his company by the previous characters, who have had Some unpleasant contact with the deceased and they are lying to one degree or another, reveal the mystery with some of the most accurate and authentic procedural details ever captured in the film. <br /> <br /> And then there are the atmospheres of a post-war Paris, where coal is scarce, music is full of erotic longings and longing memories, and rain has long since erased innocence. <br /> <br /> All this in an environment of magicians whose tricks do not always work, dogs that walk on their hind legs and express musical critiques, news-hungry reporters and exhausted policemen. <br /> <br /> And then there are many of the best actors of their generation who have been through very bad times. Ars is directed by, to complete the circle, a man who is in love with his main actress and who, with full justification, was a respected friend of Picasso. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie often and I love them all and that.
