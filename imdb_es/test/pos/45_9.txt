Only a great soundtrack. Really nice music Exceptional cast, great lead performance. Worth seeing. <br /> <br /> It does not really explain what happened in the neighborhood. It feels that the fault lies with the integration or that, with the departure of the main character, the neighborhood disintegrated. <br /> <br /> This movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted. I especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like Jeffrey Wright. <br /> <br /> The cut during the opening sequence helps express the lively, attractive and desirable experience that nightclub would have had with music, food, and drink. Dance, game and sex.
