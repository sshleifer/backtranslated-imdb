The first time I saw this movie was about 3 years ago. I was surprised how stupid the FBI was for not preventing a tragedy like that. It could have been easily avoided. This movie was amazing. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing her after September 11, I am horrified and can say that this could have been more easily avoided than most people would want to know. <br /> <br /> This film is 100% true <br /> <br /> In the final scene of the film, when the brain of the first attack is taken to prison by helicopter and flies over the towers, it makes a chilling comment. He laughed at that when he said it. "Next time we will bring you * BOTH * down". This was actually said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest. <br /> <br /> This movie reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were carried out right under the noses of the FBI and the NYPD. It shows how Amendments 1 and 4 are partially responsible for the attacks. <br /> <br /> I see this movie now and I know that both attacks could have been avoided.
