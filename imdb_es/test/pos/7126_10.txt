I laughed so much most of the time that there were people who looked at me furiously because they could not hear my laughter. Literally, I fell out of my seat at a specific point. <br /> <br /> I am a Bartender and Bouncer to live in the real world (notice my use of the term Real World, unfortunately always has to come) first), and every time I tell someone that I play role-playing games It is usually followed by one of two questions: 1. What, like D & D? I reproduced it in Junior High. <br /> <br /> 2. Really? I've been searching or a group forever! Do you have space for another? Very rarely, people do not know what D & D and games are. <br /> <br /> That said, almost everyone who watches this movie can get something out of it. Even if you're not a gambler, chances are you can make fun of something in your life that "mocks" you in a joyful way, and that only means you can relate to the hijinx in this movie. It's just happy happiness in an hour and a half.
