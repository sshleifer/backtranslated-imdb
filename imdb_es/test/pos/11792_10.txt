Another brilliant representation of Kiefer Sutherland, who plays Mickey Hayden, a policeman who deals with psychic visions of murdered victims. I love movies that deal with the psychic realm, and I was not disappointed with "Eye of the Killer" (also known as After Alice). I wish the movie had been premiered first in theater.
