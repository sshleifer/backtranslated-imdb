A quick look at the premise of this movie seems to indicate just another silly 'slash-fest fest' of the 80s; the kind in which sex equals death and actors are annoying stereotypes that you really want to die. However, "JBD" offers much more. <br /> <br /> Instead of focusing on naked flesh and blood (although there is a bit of each, however, no sex), the film focuses on delivering an impending tension of fear / mounting in the middle a beautiful scenic backdrop. These feelings are further accentuated by a cast of sympathetic realistic characters and antagonists who are more amoral than the definitions of cardboard evil. Oh yes, George Kennedy is also here and when is not something good? <br /> <br /> If you liked "Wrong Turn", look at this to see where a lot of your methodology comes from.
