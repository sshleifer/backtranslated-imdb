Ross Hunter's new musical version of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's bestselling bestseller, was canceled by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, prompting a backlash against the musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. A group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight outside a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes into snowy mountainous terrain; A rescue group arrives and takes the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun always shines and most of the residents are young and happy. Some of the performances of the cast with class are not so elegant (the effervescent atmosphere of the piece, the melodious melodies of Burt Bacharach-Hal David, as well as the slight direction that conspire to make the performers look a bit silly). Peter Finch is in charge of the international peace that is involved in a somewhat constipated romance with the resident Liv Ullmann; Sally Kellerman is unhappy that she spits out phrases like: "I got tired of taking pictures of people with burned heads, so people with SUNSHINE (and usually under hair dryers) could get one last kick before turning. last recipe "; John Gieguld "as Chang", an Asian who learned to speak English while attending Oxford, is funny with humor (but why are there no songs for Chang?). Hal David's dopey lyrics are sometimes staggering ("On the Good Ship Lollipop / How did Christopher Columbus sail across the sea?") And the rhythm gets stuck with all the talk about the outside world and how nothing is more lamentable today. However, the production is exuberant and the general management affects in a strange way. The two-dimensional characters are so serious that they really become attractive, and the stupidity of the film is contagious. It ends up being very funny. *** since ****
