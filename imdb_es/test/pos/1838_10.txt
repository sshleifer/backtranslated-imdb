Return to Me is a charming movie jewel. With an absolutely starry cast, who can be wrong with this modern fairytale? It also includes many, many jokes written by the fun girl Bonnie Hunt, who wrote and directed this movie. David Duchovny is also very good, showing a different approach to his alter-ego mulder in my favorite program of x files. a great dating movie!
