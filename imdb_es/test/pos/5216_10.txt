I thought it was an excellent movie. Gary Cole played the role of a soldier who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife who fakes his death fabulously! In general, I thought the movie was great, it's definitely not a boring plot. Sad to say, but I think many men can feel this way. I think he should have divorced and asked to be transferred instead of the end he went to, but he felt there was no other way out, so he faked his death. I thought it was great that Cole's real-life wife played the wife he was not happy with in the movie. I think what the boy did was a bit extreme, but the movie was great, despite everything! I definitely recommend it!
