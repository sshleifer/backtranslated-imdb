A while ago I saw this when HBO was showing it and, from what I saw, it seemed like a good movie. So today I'm in Blockbuster and I see it there with the DVD and I decide what the hell. So I rented it. After I finished seeing it, I was surprised at how good it was. <br /> <br /> This movie just touched my heart. Everything was so incredible. The stories, the actors, the black humor, the music! Oh, do not make me start with the music in this movie. PT Andderson is one of the greats. Definitely the best that has come from Quentin Tarantino (a god). <br /> <br /> After I finished the first time I saw it, I saw it again with Anderson's comment (I was surprised at how cool it is.) <br /> <br /> Anyone who is interested in movies you should watch this movie, if you have not done it yet. Anderson is obviously a movie lover. In the movie he starts many other directorial techniques. Like the scene of the pool with the camera following the girl through the water. Obviously cheated of "I am Cuba". But I have nothing to do with that. The movie is very respectable with its scams. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who can discuss some of the content of the movie (porn). <br /> <br /> 10/10
