In World War II, a very burned amnesiac known only as "The English Patient" is in the African desert and is transported to Italy, where he joins a convoy of medical troops and others in an abandoned monastery. Among them are Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose lovers usually find unpleasant ends; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosives experts looking for bombs in the monastery; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a soldier of Canadian fortune who knows the identity of the English patient and has a score to solve. <br /> <br /> Through flashbacks we learn the story of the patient: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who, at the end of the 30s, meets a group of British cartographers, among them Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), while mapping the deserts of North Africa. After Clifton leaves them in government affairs, Katharine and Clifton fall in love in the desert, resulting in an issue that, naturally, has an unhappy ending. <br /> <br /> If one is able to ignore the illogical parts of the story line (for example, why would a patient found in Africa be sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in Italy?), then you can appreciate "The English Patient" as a throwback to The Epics of David Lean in the 60s, intelligent and layered. Much more than "Titanic" or other epic romances of recent times, this film reminds us of "Doctor Zhivago" and "Gone with the Wind", an epic love story in a huge historical context. You should not expect a war movie, although there are some surprising scenes of violence (although too brief) that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is often the case (the interrogation of Caravaggio by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow). ) in particular). <br /> <br /> The movie is very ambiguous, in regards to almost everything. The central question of the film is: How far are you willing to go for love? As critics of the film are quick to point out, Almasy is, on the surface, an unfriendly character: he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by handing maps and intelligence to the Germans, causing death. of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and the torture of Caravaggio, and actually killing a British soldier who has him arrested at any given time. The fact that Almasy is, in many respects, reprehensible, is the kind of thing: he is in love with Katharine, and sees the world narrowly in terms of his love that loyalty to the country (or anything else) is secondary; As Almasy says, he hates "property, being an owner". The two get involved in a pretty daring love story (fucking hundreds of people at a Christmas party) and it's clear that Katharine is more attracted to the mysterious and exciting Almasy than the comparatively bored Geoffrey. <br /> <br /> The secondary plot of 1944 is somewhat unstable and seems superfluous; The romance between Kip and Hannah is never completely credible, and I feel that the film could have done without him. But those sequences do add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the film, so I will not complain too much. <br /> <br /> As in the epics mentioned above, the film can transmit time and place through simple devices such as crowd scenes, strategically placed posters and military presence. We do not need to dwell on the fact that it is 1938 in Cairo, but it is useful to know. Anthony Minghella's direction and John Seale's desert cinematography are absolutely beautiful; Sand dunes, sand storms and desert caves are captured with beautiful details. Gabriel Yared's score is disturbing and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally solid. Fiennes offers a very layered performance as a mysterious, complex and enchanted character. The difference between the Almasys of 1938 and 1944 is remarkable; An exciting and somewhat carefree, the other enchanted and thoughtful. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine, the explorer who seeks adventure, and Colin Firth offers one of his best performances as Geoffrey, who realizes from the beginning that it is not a competition for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does a good job as Caravaggio, the cunning thief turned into a spy driven by revenge. Jurgen Prochnow offers a performance reminiscent of Jos√© Ferrer in "Lawrence of Arabia" (and also a similar character): very brief, but more memorable than some of the main characters. Some of the actors of 1944 have nothing special: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but has nothing special. Kevin Whately, as Kip's unfortunate partner, does what he can with a rather small role. <br /> <br /> "The English patient" is not a perfect movie, but the vituperating attacks are not very good. The public that goes to the movies is not deserved at all. Perhaps it is a sample of how the sensibilities of the film have changed since the era of the Leans and Kubricks, or maybe people expected something simple to understand. Fault complex, brilliantly directed and filmed, "The English Patient" is a wonderful modern epic. <br /> <br /> 8/10
