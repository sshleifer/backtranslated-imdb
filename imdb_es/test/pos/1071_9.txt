First, I loved the documentary. It represents a new history / school theory where a subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical problems. <br /> <br /> First I will take out the camera and the dogs. I hate the quality of Blair Witch from the camera, but I also understand the advantage of such an informal approach. In fact, I agree with the other critic in that it gives us unprecedented access. <br /> <br /> Dogs: Warning, I have a PhD in literature that I do NOT use as a profession, so part of my training can be filtered in: Dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of great human efforts and our need to find work to achieve them. Dogs can reflect their owners, as one critic suggested. But they also serve as a substitute for the workers we see in the movie. While this might suggest the Marxist problem posed by a reviewer, I think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize labor problems. No Mondovi in ​​Italy may not translate as well in other places. (Oh, I'm a Marxist at heart and I hate to hear my cynical resignation dominate!) It's a remarkable bait and change. Dogs are family, workers are family. But, in the end, the dogs are the workers (the last scene with the poor farmer). While it may be at odds with politics, the art of analogy, along with the film's more open politics, are wonderful. <br /> <br /> If only Faulkner (I'm from Alabama) had the power of the film beyond The Hollywood Market, what interesting stories would have been told.
