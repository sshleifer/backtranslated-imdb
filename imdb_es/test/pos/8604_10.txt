This is a fairly faithful adaptation of Masuji Ibuse's novel, "Black Rain". Like the book, it is very moving and stimulating. The story revolves around a couple's attempts to see their niece married successfully. They are having trouble finding suitors due to a rumor that she suffers from radiation sickness, after walking through Hiroshima the day of the attack. Well filmed, well acted, moving, tragic, horrifying and fun.
