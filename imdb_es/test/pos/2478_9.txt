Peter Watkins, the one rarely seen in Punishment Park, is a relentless, relentless and brutally tied political weapon that stretches across an endless desert landscape. A non-authoritarian antipulse feast without apology, the adventures at first seem to be so exaggerated militaristic and sickly that they could emerge as a fantastic dystopian alternative dystopian story, which Harry Turtledove would enjoy. But once we deepen and pay attention to the abhorrent diatribe that springs from those who preside over the crowned tent court, as well as the shotgun guards who oversee the bloody affair, our eyes are truly open. Suddenly, we realize how accurate the Watkins films are, since much of this is the kind of neoconservative talking points about youth culture and the legality of the divergent thoughts that politicians nowadays throw up. Granted, much of this was also silly, but it really shows us how little has changed, and informs how, somehow, we are closer to such a world, where the Parks of Punishment would be a real and terrifying operation. <br /> <br /> The main actors in almost all the scenes are not experienced actors, mostly chosen for their reckless political opinions and the desire to put them on camera. This grants a lot of authenticity without precedents to the whole experience, since never, not even for a second, we question the reality of all the chaos. Recorded in a documentary style with a 16 mm film, it appears as a gritty documentation of some despicable government test project that was classified until it was found years later. At least it seems to have that story now, maybe not so much when it was published (barely). But this gives an additional weight to all the procedures and helps to attract him to this incredible universe of torture not so alternative for convicted dissidents.
