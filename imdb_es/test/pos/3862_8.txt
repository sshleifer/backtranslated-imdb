This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella or Bambi, but it is a very sweet, fun, romantic and well made Disney animated feature. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, lessons included here for children and some very appropriate cheeks, but there is also a lot of content here for adults. <br /> <br /> While this is something like a regurgitation of the Disney RomCom Classic Adventure, it still has some Elements, which only belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the "vagabond" and Dutchess is the "lady", but Dutchess has several kittens and they all try to return home. <br /> <br /> Phil Harris is our cat O'Malley. You can recognize his voice, as he also provided the voice of Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book, and Little John in Disney's Robin Hood. Eva Gabor lends her sweet and silky voice to Dutchess. <br /> <br /> Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, who directed or worked on every Disney animated film worth mentioning until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites from the animated Disney movies, and belongs to any Disney collection. The special edition of 2 albums will be released this summer (2007). <br /> <br /> This qualifies an 8.4 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
