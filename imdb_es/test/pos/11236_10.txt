Keys to the VIP, an original Canadian Comedy Network series (comedynetwork.ca) scored high with this entertaining but inspiring game show. This show is conducted by four funny and good looking guys who judge others in their "game" (ability to pick up women). Each episode features two guys that go head to head in various pick-up games. There are three different sections and the winner scores a night as VIP in an exclusive Toronto nightclub. <br /> <br /> Being a boy, naturally, this show seems hilarious to me. We all know that it is difficult to confront women and to see these men doing it naturally awakens the curiosity of men. The guys who compete in this program can even give you some advice, if you pay attention.
