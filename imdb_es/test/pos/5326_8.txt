Before watching this movie, I read the comment of someone who did not like it very much. I must admit that this made me worried about dedicating 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life, but I'm glad I did. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor, especially I loved the believer. Don Cheadle was fantastic too. The film presented an interesting vision about life and death. It was very moving and very sad, but it kept me interested, which most touching stories can not do. It's a movie that does not matter if you like it or not, you should see it. It was unique, and I do not think anyone can duplicate it. All the young actors did it surprisingly well given the theme and the emotion that must have entered it. I was pleasantly surprised.
