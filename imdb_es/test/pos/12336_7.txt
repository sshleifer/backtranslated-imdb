I did not know anything about this movie before I saw it. It seems to be a lesser-known teenage horror of the 80's. What surprised me were the ways in which it differed from so many other films of that era. <br /> <br /> The first thing I noticed was the slowness with which this movie develops. It does not make the typical configuration of showing characters killed one by one. It takes time to build the background story, leaving a bit of mystery about what might happen. I was almost beginning to think that no one would be hurt in this movie. But everything leads to the climatic sequence for the last 15 minutes, and then it becomes quite graphic (this was a bad time to take a break to eat something, I almost could not finish my pizza once it started). <br /> <br /> The characters also seem a little more three-dimensional than many of the scary movies for teenagers. The conversations were refreshingly leveled for the most part, unlike the superior stereotypes that one would expect. For example, the girl who is the popular, snobby, queen-bee of the clique is not constantly throwing insults at everyone, but is able to have doubts and show some consideration for others. <br /> <br /> So, in short, I felt that this movie was something original compared to what I expected, and also a bit better done. It attracted me, it kept me interested and then it left me. Like I said, it's pretty bloody during the end, but almost all the rest of the time is friendly with the family. I do not need to own it, but I'm glad I discovered it.
