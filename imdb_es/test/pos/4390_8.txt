I was really surprised and wonderfully "O 'Brother, where are you?" The video store was out of all the movies I planned to rent, so I came across this. I arrived home and, as I watched, I absorbed myself and found myself laughing out loud. The Coens have returned to make a magnificent film. But I think that the first time you see this movie, you know the characters. The second time, now that you know them, you laugh so much that it could hurt you. I STRONGLY recommend ALL to see this because, if they are not, they are really missing a cinematic gem of all ages. 10/10
