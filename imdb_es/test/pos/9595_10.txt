As one critic has already commented, this comedy for television is among the best soccer parodies in history. But ... having not recorded it on video when it was broadcast for the first time, I now find that it is not available in any format. OK, so only 17 votes have been voted to date, but an average of 9+ seems to suggest something special. Basically, I suppose it's a case of bad luck if you missed it because it's no longer available to see it. Aaaaaaaargh
