Ah, Batman Returns, is it possible to have a sequel that is almost as good as the original? With Batman Returns, it got close enough. We have great actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton as Batman and he is still amazing than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly placed in its place. As much as I love and is an actress as amazing as Annette Benning, she could not be Catwoman, she really does not have the appearance. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as The Penguin? It was simply great and terrifying! <br /> <br /> Batman returns with a more loving community from Gotham City, they are celebrating Christmas time with Max Shrek, played by a chilling Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his charming secretary, Selina, who by chance hears too much in his office, makes him push her out the window in the hope that she will die and will never reveal the information of knowing the penguin and the attempt to make him love . Gotham. When she survives and the cats wake her, she wants revenge and is ready to go with them! But there is also another active villain, the penguin who is looking for his parents who left him and is now looking to be the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman be able to prevent both super villains from believing their hanous acts and preventing the mayor from destroying the city as well? <br /> <br /> You'll have to see it! Batman Returns is as good as the original Batman, although the first is still the true classic, it still takes you for a ride. And come on, I mean, we have Michelle in leather! Its classic moment to meet Batman and the penguin "Miau" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines and sets! You're going to have a blast! Trust me! <br /> <br /> 9/10
