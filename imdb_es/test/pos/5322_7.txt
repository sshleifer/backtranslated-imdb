One wonders about the state of a society that produces a father like Albert T. Fitzgerald, with whom we meet for the first time on a plane, as he heads towards the place he left a long time ago, and where he left a wife and a son who is now accused of murdering a child with mental problems. When we see it for the first time, it has captured a headline in the newspaper that is reading the woman in front of it. Rather rudely, he asks if he could have the newspaper, and the lady offers other sections. Well, that's not what he asked, what he wants the woman to do, is give him the main section he's reading. <br /> <br /> Matthew Ryan Hoge wrote and directed this disturbing film that reflects, in many ways. , our society as it is today. In fact, Mr. Hoge is pointing out exactly what is wrong. <br /> <br /> The film features Leland, a teenager who can not even differentiate between fantasy and reality. It is evident that killing a human being, even the innocent sweet boy who has done nothing to deserve it, will have fatal consequences, not only for him, but also for his own family and the family of the murdered child. In fact, it seems that Leland has no idea what motivated him to commit the crime because he shows no regrets about it. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Leland has been traumatized by his parents' divorce. His own father is a distant man who could care less about him. It's Pearl, the teacher in the juvenile detention center who sees the confusion within the young man and wants to help, but unfortunately, he has no chance. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the movie is Don Cheadle, a great actor who always delivers. The cast of the set does a good job under the direction of Mr. Hoge. Kevin Spacey has a good chance to play the selfish father of the accused killer and makes us hate him for being an arrogant idiot. <br /> <br /> Although a little long, the film leaves us with more questions than answers.
