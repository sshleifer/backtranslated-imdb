This is one of those movies that has everything in it. I do not think I get tired of seeing it. Hopefully more movies like this will be made in the future. The casting was perfect in all aspects. In a certain sense, the song sung by Engelbert Humperdink "I Never Got to Say Goodbye" is the song that comes to life. Surely you will laugh and cry all over the stage. I'm surprised I've never seen it before last weekend. I think it's worth seeing it positively, and your heart will shine. It would be good to embrace with your "honey"; Take a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy the presence of the other. There is so much heart and emotion that sometimes honestly you do not know where to go. You will know exactly how the character feels. The true family expression is available at all times. In fact, sometimes you will even think that you are part of that family or that they are part of yours. Look at it!
