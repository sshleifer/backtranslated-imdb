The main cast: <br /> <br /> Vlastimil Brodský .... Frantisek Hána Stella Zázvorková .... Emílie Hánová Stanislav Zindulka .... Eda <br /> <br /> Director Vladimir Michalek gives this charming History Of charming old people of turns that make the characters are attractive, really universal. <br /> <br /> Frantisek Hana is retired and with a pension, his previous occupation is unknown. He lives in a very nice apartment with his wife for forty-four years, Emilie. His son Jara covets the large apartment as a problem solver, since he needs to house one of his ex-wives and several of his children. The son is not a ruthless schemer, he is just a man with a past spouse and a blind eye to his father's attachment to the apartment (to which he moved after giving him a previous residence to the son). <br /> <br /> Hana and her also close friend of old age, Ed, spend there more than enough free time doing petty scammers, not for money but for the pleasure of putting one over easily deceived people as real estate agents. A favorite tactic is that Hana acts as part of a retired divo from the New York Metropolitan Opera who returns home and needs an expanding mansion. Ed is his companion, as gullible real estate agents throw themselves on themselves offering chauffeured limousines and excellent meals at French restaurants hoping for a lucrative sale. <br /> <br /> When they do not participate in well-planned scams, the duo participates in quick scams like pretending to be railroad security agents to snatch kisses from breathless teens and tickets that try to sneak onto trains. Kisses married, that is: there is no lust here. <br /> <br /> Hana's long-suffering wife is obsessed with saving enough money to ensure that the couple, individually and together, have a great funeral, an event that life loves Frantisek is in no hurry to experiment. <br /> <br /> Disagreements over money and the promiscuous disposition of Frantisek's marriage funds lead to a crisis whose resolution seems real and attractive. Michalek looks for the emotions of the spectator, but he does it in an open, honest and effective way. <br /> <br /> "Autumn Spring", subtitled of course, is the product of an increasingly vibrant Czech cinema. It was not widely shown in the US UU., But its availability on DVD will, hopefully, this film that affects a large audience. Unfortunately, Brodsky recently succumbed to cancer, so this film is a tribute to a good actor who imbued his character with a passion for the pleasures of life that must have reflected the values ​​of the actor. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
