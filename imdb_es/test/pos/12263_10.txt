I say sadly because if you watch this movie now, you realize how little our media has sunk: all the warning signs are in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, I think it's the last great movie by James Brooks. , but others may disagree. It has rich characters (who are also believable), great acting, great writing, and although the music got a bit corny, I even liked it. <br /> <br /> William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is awesome. And Albert Brooks walks away with every scene in which this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and compelling and makes the whole movie rise above this vital and important theme of the News, and how it is slowly engaging in our nation . <br /> <br /> Watch this with RED for a truly fun and terrifying night.
