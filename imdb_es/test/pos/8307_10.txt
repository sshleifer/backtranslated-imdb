This movie was the second movie I saw in the movies when I was a girl. It scared my life a lot. So much so that I asked my father if we could go halfway. <br /> <br /> Today, the only people who come out halfway are those who have good taste in the movies. <br /> <br /> I, however, still have good memories of this faulty masterpiece of horror. Doug McClure and Peter Cushing in the same movie! Cool! Monsters made of substitute polypropylene. Scary things. When you think about it, a rubber monster is even more terrifying than a real monster. <br /> <br /> The surprising thing about this movie is how good the score is. Really exciting things. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of prehistoric tits in the program, too. Beautiful.
