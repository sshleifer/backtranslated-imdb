"Down Periscope" has been in our library since he came to VHS. Since then, we have purchased the DVD and a digital archive of Cinema Now. <br /> <br /> It's a peculiar movie that is not militarily exaggerated as pro or con. It is, above all, a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, I am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered. <br /> <br /> The movie has gained followers that border an obsession with the cult, even among the very young. I realized this when I visited the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama, in 2002. A group of Cub Scouts, my grandson among them, assumed all the roles of the film and planned to revive it during their stay on board. <Br /> <br /> It's a fun game that makes you proud of both our Navy and Hollywood ... which is a rare company. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for doing what could have been an otherwise uncomplicated movie, great entertainment!
