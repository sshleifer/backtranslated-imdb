Maybe the deepest caricature made in the USA. UU., "Duckman" falls short in 70 episodes in four seasons. <br /> <br /> Unlike the often innocuous criticism found in "The Simpsons" (a pretty good show in its own right), and the rude humor for badness in "South Park", every part of this series follows a plan. The critique of American society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, is much more scathing than in any other animated series. <br /> <br /> The cultural references in "Duckman" also tend to be dark at times (anyone who surfs. The fan sites will realize that most have not even been captured). In that, it's different from "The Simpsons," which usually uses pop culture instead of the high-level stuff often hidden in "Duckman." As other people who write about it notice, there is a growth in the characters (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). Also, by making the main character not only an offensive neurotic but also someone who is experiencing a personal tragedy (as is clear in episodes such as "The Once and Future Duck" ('You will love her until the end of your days ... . ') and in "Bev Takes a Holiday" (when she has the opportunity to tell Beverly all those things she could not tell Beatrice), the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality. <br /> <br / > One can not help but feel sorry for him and his lucid madness. <br /> <br /> In general, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever made in the United States and one of the best series in history Doubt However, it will always be on DVD, Too many things that the duck said make much more sense today.
