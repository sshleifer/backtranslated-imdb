I watched this movie early one morning in the early 90's, when I was about 12 years old. I've been trying to find what it was and, finally, today I did it! I remember enjoying it and I got a little scared at the end when it showed the young man's headstone and his ghostly face! Please, could someone tell me no, if I can get a copy of this since I would love to see it again. I remember that the child got stuck in a tin mine and then made friends with a child. I can not remember that the children were trapped there with the miners, but they should have. The child helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a child who had died while working there, I think.
