Alright, then this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it makes some liberals angry. The thing is that South Park makes fun of everyone, as the Simpsons did. If he is offended that a politician who likes to make fun of him, maybe he needs a better sense of humor and is taking the show too seriously. That said, this episode is hilarious and one of the best. The representation of Al Gores is hilarious, the Cartman scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will make you roll on the floor laughing. Basically, it's all I'd want to get out of an episode of South Park and it's easily one of my favorites. I will not comment much more on the plot because I do not want to reveal anything.
