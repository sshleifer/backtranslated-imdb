A refreshing black comedy starring some of the best in Australia. In the same way that Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels captured the fun side of London gangsters, Two Hands traverses the Sydney underworld. It would not be so much fun if it was not so close to the bone. <br /> <br /> An Australian classic. If Australia could get more rabbits in this way, it could actually have a film industry worth watching.
