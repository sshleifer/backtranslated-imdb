Directly, I love this movie. I love everything about it. It has a great soundtrack, it has many recognizable faces and it's fun as hell. There are so many plots in this movie and each of them is fun in one way or another. <br /> <br /> When Spicolli lit up the screen two years ago, Drake is almost as memorable as a character. All he wants to do is have fun. He moves out of the house without his parents' consent, skips work when he feels like it, is obsessed with sex, loves drugs and alcohol and tries to be a good friend. It is his affectionate attitude that makes him so happy to see. And he comes out with some great lines. And there are so many small observations that you do not see coming, but they make you laugh at speed when it hits you. One particular moment is when Tommy and Bill talk about Bill's ex-girlfriend dating someone else now. At the end of the conversation, Tommy takes his huge bottle of beer and throws it over his shoulder, coincidentally. Then he says good night and the scene ends. It is a perfect scene. Tommy's world is his. He really lives to party and have fun. When the conversation ends, his time is over and he does not care who he offends in the process. He has an innocence about him. "It's casual" is his favorite saying. <br /> <br /> Another one of those classic scenes is Reggie and he gives Bill a dona. He says something to him and my friends that we will never forget, since we rewind the movie ten times and watch that part over and over again and we hurt ourselves laughing. You have to see it to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Wild Life is a release to which teen comedies were funny, lascivious, had good ears, entertained us and just wanted us to get lost in their world for 90 minutes. Wild life does all of those things perfectly. If this is a movie you have not seen, give it a try. Its a classic. <br /> <br /> You can also see the type of army store Jim has problems with. Now it is a very familiar face and it is his first role on the big screen.
