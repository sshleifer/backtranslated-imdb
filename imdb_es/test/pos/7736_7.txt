William Shakespeare probably did not imagine Stephanos as a homosexual doctor, Antonio as an unfaithful wife, or Caliban as a pastor with a Trinitron, but the Bards did the worst they could with their good work over time, and even They could enjoy the sumptuous spectacle of life. that is his "Tempest" reconfigured by Paul Mazursky and co-writer Leon Capetanos. <br /> <br /> This time, Prospero is Philip Dimitrius (John Cassevetes), an architect based in Manhattan tired of designing Atlantic City casinos for the friendly Mafioso Alonso (Vittorio Gassman), especially after discovering that Alonso is tangled with Antonia (Gena Rowlands), Philip's wife. Together with his daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald), Philip escapes to a remote Greek island with Miranda and his new lover Aretha (Susan Sarandon), a beautiful Catholic girl who struggles with Philip's celibate lifestyle. Will a sudden storm bring everything right in the end? <br /> <br /> Here is a thought about Cassevetes' career: How many other actors could make a film so confused in something so fascinating? A favorite of film critics for his previous work, often with his real-life wife Rowlands, he presents a central character who really suffers for his art here, but seems to enjoy it and also makes us enjoy it. It is not Prospero, but it is something rich and strange that makes a terrible change in its own world. <br /> <br /> "Everything is here," he tells one of his faithful companions, Aretha's dog, Nino. "Beauty, magic, inspiration and serenity". What is it. "Tempest" transfers 1611 London to 1982 Manhattan and finds some beautiful resonances in the lives of Philip's displaced people. "Show me the magic", calls a storm urban landscape, and Mazursky's version, augmented by Donald McAlpine's fantastic cinematography of purple seascapes and Greek landscapes naturally shined by the sun, does just that. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie, by any means. In fact, the grand finale, which is the only part of the film that follows the plot of Shakespeare in all its extension, is a disaster. The character of Rowland is difficult to care for much in this film, and after meeting Sarandon in all his immense glory, it is difficult to understand Philip's continuing concern for his wife, let alone his desire in left field to make a " sacrifice "unhappy to be able to restore the natural order of things. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot to love about "Tempest". In addition to Cassavetes, there is Ringwald's film debut as his loyal but restless daughter, here as in the play, an object of desire for the primitive rustic "Kalibanos" (Raul Julia). Ringwald here is, to a large extent, the same adolescent muse of the privileged adolescence that would inspire John Hughes, but with an emotional depth in which Hughes' later films did not deepen. Ringwald and Julia never received the attention of the Oscars, but both would win the Golden Globes for their playful work here. He tries to woo her in isolation from the island with his "Gunsmoke" television replays in Greek, tempted by his 15-year-old body. <br /> <br /> "I want to balonga with you with my good friend Johnny". Kalibanos declares, being pushed aside but gaining our sympathy anyway, especially after interpreting "New York, New York" with a goat chorus. (When "Tempest" hit the screens, Julia was the Broadway toast as the protagonist of "Nine".) <br /> <br /> It's the Mazursky show, although sometimes you feel that Cassavetes is handling things with a line of improvisation Readings and emotional breakdowns in abundance. (Philip introduces himself to Aretha saying "I'm right in the middle of a nervous breakdown.") He plays his character as a kind obsessive, who seeks to crystallize his happiness by building a theater on his island, otherwise uninhabited. <Br /> <br /> Adding to the enjoyment is Gassman's rich performance as the other man, who is as kind as Julia while telling a Philip obsessed with young people: "Children do not have half the funds we do They 'get nervous ... and make love in the back of an old sports car. " In spite of being too extensive and pretentious in places, like so many art films, "Tempest" is entertained in his excesses and a trip very similar to the one Shakespeare intended, even if his dreams did not include smoking in the backstage at a concert of Go -Gos.
