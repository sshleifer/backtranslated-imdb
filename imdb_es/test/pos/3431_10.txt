This works on all levels: it is intense as a thriller, full of tributes to Lars von Trier, but also very typical of his own film, and has a message: happiness comes from within, better personified in the wounded soldier than practically ( and, believe it or not, with humor) disintegrates member to member throughout the film, while he apologizes to others for imposing them. You laugh at him, but you also envy him. The central character is a well-intentioned but clumsy writer who spends the whole movie trying to help those who make friends on a train from Stockholm to Berlin just after World War II. He unites the parallel stories and really ruins people in the process. To say that things go wrong is an understatement, and structurally, the characters are in perfect opposition to each other. It is as if each of them had an opposite: so tight, as to see the antimatter collide. You will not believe the sick things that you end up laughing at. To say more, would qualify as a spoiler, all I can say is that it is a pity that this film has not been released in the US. UU., Not even on DVD. A moron probably told them that Americans would not understand, which is crap, because not only "we get" but also produce things like South Park ... If this movie is sold in the US. UU., It should be sold as a conventional black. Comedy, because that's what it is. Over-the-top, sick and twisted, but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy!
