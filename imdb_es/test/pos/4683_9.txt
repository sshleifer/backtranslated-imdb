I enjoyed the movie very much. Everything in The Italian Job is simple. An explosive guy, a safe cracker, a computer genius, a man with wheels and a man with a spectacular plan to steal 35 million without using a weapon. This movie is entertaining although it has no central idea. It is a non-stop movie with many actions. All the trick work is magnificent. From the beginning of the motorboat in Venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads of Los Angeles, which involved three mini coopers and even a helicopter. The best bragging chase I've seen. I like mini coopers. Skillful thieves used mini coopers for getaway cars. The chase between the mini coopers and the bikes is incredible. They chased underground. I can say that there was not a time when I got bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (left ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) really did a good work. I like the actors in this movie. I've seen a lot of stealing movies, but The Italian Job is one of my favorites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. After all, I love this kind of movie.
