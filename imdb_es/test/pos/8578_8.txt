I love this movie. There is something for everyone. It's fun, sad, exciting and dramatic. The mixture of two completely different cultures creates a completely new world in which the viewer can not stop wanting to be a part. I must admit that I have a bit of bias, since Colin Firth is my favorite actor and, therefore, nothing he does is wrong in my eyes (!), But in this film his tremendous talent as an actor is evident and See even more favored by beauty. Acting from his co-star Nia Long. The problems that your love story undergoes make it, ironically, more believable and the simple features, like the contrast between the colors of Matthew and Nimi's clothes, make this movie even more charming. I challenge anyone who can not be moved by this story. I find it charming and I've seen it at least ten times since I bought the movie a week ago!
