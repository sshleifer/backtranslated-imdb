None of this was seen on television at that time and probably will never do it again. From the first image of the police light that blinded you and from there you heard the words: "Squad of the police - in color", you were surprised to see that this was by no means a common situation comedy. <br /> <br /> Also to kill a "guest star" and then not to refer to him again, where have you seen that before? Then the show started and if you did not pay attention, you would miss several jokes in the background. Do not pay too much attention to one thing or you will regret it. This was the program for which the video recorders were made, long before Married with Children or The Simpsons. <br /> <br /> The stories did not make any sense and the dialogue was sometimes so strange that you had to think about it. for 5 minutes before I realized it was a joke. <br /> <br /> The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came out of Dragnet and were absolutely heterosexual (no accents or funny expressions), but instead there were puns and crooked phrases. The sentences are absolutely inexpressive. Only once I can remember, was there a segment played for silly laughter - a scene involving a trip to a dentist, suction and lots of saliva. <br /> <br /> There were some tedious moments - like the informant Johnny and an appearance by some celebrity. That was strictly a joke, but they had to use it in all six episodes. Oh good. Everything can not be perfect. The important thing is that the rest of the time you were kneeling in tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was lucky that this revived her career when they put Frank Drebin's character in 3 roles, but he must have done it. It has been an Achilles heel too. Do you remember having seen him in any job other than the Naked Gun type? And do not count the horrible Mr. Magoo reworked for live action. However, he probably made a lot of money.
