I may not have had the big budgets, celebrities or backing of Scream, Urban Legend or I Know What You Did Last Summer, but Campfire Tales had one thing that these three films lacked: the real horror. <br /> <br /> This film tackled the theme of urban legends one year before the urban legend did, aptly titled and less than captivating. It was intriguing, with a masterful and logical script in a way that I know what you did last summer could only dream. Finally, he kept his focus and ended with a burst while Scream fainted and died. <br /> <br /> The most exciting part of the film is the variety of horror that writers and directors achieved. The general story of the teenagers around a campfire was the classic fear of the unknown death (but certainly expected) that awaited them in the forest, but the stories themselves are what really shone in the film. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is pure and accelerated urban myth. It is based on a popular legend, and the director plays with this with the style and rhythm of the action, which makes it more fascinating because we know what will happen. <br /> <br /> The first story of the campfire is a direct story. thriller in front. Based on another popular myth, we do not realize this until the end, both because it integrates very well in the story and because the action keeps our attention. Being the thriller of the trilogy, it shows our fear of the unknown and includes several sequences of well-made "jumps" that do not feel as cheap or contrite as those of films like Scream or Urban Legend. <br /> <br /> The second story is more suspenseful. This time, although the characters still do not know what is happening, we do, and this provides the horror. No need for cheap emotions here. <br /> <br /> The final story contains elements of the supernatural and uses a spooky / trivial atmosphere to scare the viewer. Because we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation, our fear comes from their intensity and what they can not explain. This is the true ghost story of the trio. <br /> <br /> I did not expect to enjoy Campfire Tales when I rented it. I thought that if I did not like their most acclaimed and bigger budget counterparts, how could I like it? <br /> <br /> The truth is that this movie succeeds where others did not reach the mark.
