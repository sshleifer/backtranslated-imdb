I decided to write a comment about this incredible movie because here in IMDb it is mentioned that John Woo, a mediocre director who made some decent movies in his pre-American years, but totally ruined his reputation with his last film made in the United States. plans to remake it Well, here are a couple of reasons why it's one of the most stupid ideas for a new version: the plot of the film is simple and even cliche by today's standards, but what makes the film is a masterpiece is the performance of the four protagonists, unique. Mellville's direction, cinematography, music and his style. There is no way that a director of today can make a film of this kind, it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a film in the movie business oriented to today's box office. <br /> <br /> John Woo made a more or less decent movie that he borrowed from Le Samourai - Melville's The Killer, but remember it was made when the director was not affected by big budgets and costly (in salaries ) but cheap actors (in active merits). So, what I'm saying is that this is one of the best movies ever made, along with another Melville movie: Le Samourai. Look at it. And even if the new version will be made, try to avoid it before seeing the great original first.
