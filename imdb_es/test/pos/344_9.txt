I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is the first Indian film I have seen in the Tamil language, and although it shares some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography) , sweeping story), the director tries more than to entertain. The film tells the story of Amudha, a precocious nine-year-old girl whose parents reveal she was adopted, beginning an odyssey that takes them all from India to Sri Lanka, devastated by the war. The magnificent images are mixed with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to highlight a point, although it is simplistic. Amudha is played by P.S. Keerthana, and she is one of the few children actors that I have seen that can be precocious and, nevertheless, does not bother. His charm and beauty kept the film together.
