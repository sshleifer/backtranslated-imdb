How is it possible that you like it and do not like the same movie? <br /> <br /> The plot looks a lot like that Jody Foster thing, Sommersby, but not so good. Nicole was great ... Jude was adequate. They did not give him many lines ... is there any reason for that? In general, he's a pretty good actor. She is so elegant, her character is so crazy. It makes one wonder what they see in each other. <br /> <br /> The romance between two of them was only successful in Lady Chatterly's Lover. <br /> <br /> I think that aversion occurs because the movie is too long. They could have told the story in two hours. <br /> <br /> The story is good. Good places, good filming. The actors of the characters were great.
