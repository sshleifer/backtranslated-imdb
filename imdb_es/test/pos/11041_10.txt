You saw this GREAT classic movie by Greta Garbo and I thought her performance was excellent. However, the German film version that had subtitles in English was his best performance. Greta Garbo even mentioned to the press that the German film was her favorite, where she had to make the switch from Silent Films to Sound. Greta had a high-pitched voice and had to take lessons to lower her voice for her future roles in movies. This story was very sad because Greta Garbo (Anna Christie), "Ninotchka", '39, was abused on a farm by young children and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as captain of a barge. There were many scenes of Old NYC, the Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and the Manhattan Skyline. Charles Bickford (Matt Burke), "Days of Wine and Roses", '62 a classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role.
