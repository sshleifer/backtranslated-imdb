I saw it last night and I laughed loudly throughout the second half of the movie. The entire audience was. Bruce Campbell has made a damn funny movie! I do not want to give anything away, but when the movie turns and goes crazy, it becomes really crazy. Only one funny scene after another. My congratulations to Mr. Campbell and the team for achieving this with such a small budget. Bruce was there to present the film and do a question and answer session, which was a pleasure. Many of the questions people asked were pretty boring, but Bruce would turn them around and it would be all sarcastic. He was cool! Anyway, I loved the movie. I will be anxious to see this on DVD later this year. Be sure to check it out on the science fiction channel this fall. I highly recommend this one.
