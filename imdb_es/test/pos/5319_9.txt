I remember seeing the trailer for this movie and I knew I had to watch this movie. It looked like something that would be right in my alley. <br /> <br /> "The United States of Leland" is a fantastic movie. It is not one that leaves you with a pleasant and pleasant ending, but with a sad and empty feeling. And when I say that it will leave you with a feeling of "emptiness", I do not mean that it is a bad thing. I think you are destined to fill that empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and the general motives of humans and how they act as part of society. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling is perfectly presented as Leland. He is intelligent, but stoic. I like the way he narrates the movie with his diary. The supporting cast is excellent too. Kevin Spacey is very good, as always, and Don Cheadle is amazing as Leland's teacher and mentor. <br /> <br /> This was a great story and it is very intelligent and stimulating. I highly recommend it.
