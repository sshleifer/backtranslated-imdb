The most surprising feature of this good acting movie is the almost surreal <br /> <br /> images of the time and the moment it was filmed. I could feel that time and moments were raw and very real. Even the language was so well chosen. It is very frequent that the colloquialisms of today's world are used without care in films about <br /> <br /> in another time and place.
