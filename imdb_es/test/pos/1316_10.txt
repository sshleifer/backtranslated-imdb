"Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters" is a visually stunning production that handles complex problems with evocative ease. It is based on the life of the controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not really a biographical film, at least not in the traditional sense, but an exploration of Mishima's iconoclastic work. The film manages to present abstract concepts in a non-embroidered, totally attractive way. Paul Schrader makes you sympathize with Mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. It does not solve the puzzle but it makes you understand it. An additional advantage: seeing the fury of Mishima by the lack of tradition in a morally empty modern society, Schrader offers us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and execution in cinema. John Bailey's cinematography is spectacularly good. The grandiosity of the composer Philip Glass's work is perfect for the project. "Mishima" is the best movie I've seen this year, until now.
