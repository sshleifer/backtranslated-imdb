In Dublin, crippled rebel Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) moves into the residential home for the disabled of Carrigmore, affecting the lives of residents. Roy is able to understand the unintelligible speech of Michael Connolly (Steven Robertson), who was left in the shelter by his prominent father many years ago due to his cerebral palsy, and they become close friends. Rory convinces Michael to move from Carrigmore to an apartment in Dublin, and they hire the beautiful Siobhan (Romola Garai) to help them. By living together with Rory, Michael confronts a new world, finds friendship, love and freedom and learns to survive on his own. <br /> <br /> "Inside I'm Dancing" is a wonderful story of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. The performance of Steven Robertson and James McAvoy is impressive and I do not understand how they have not been nominated for the Oscar with such magnificent performances. Romola Garai also has a top-notch performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy. The script is moving, never corny and without redemption, and the precise direction of Damien O'Donnell is very sensitive. Unfortunately, the Brazilian DVD title is embarrassingly ridiculous, giving the wrong idea of ​​this excellent movie. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Melhores Dias de Nossas Vidas" ("The best years of our lives")
