I have seen this movie several times and it seems very convincing and sad to me. The lack of real emotion of most of the characters is very disturbing. They seem empty, without hope. The story is based on a real event. <br /> <br /> A teenage girl is murdered by her boyfriend for no obvious reason, apparently, she felt that way. Then he tells his friends and, as they do not believe him, he takes them to see the body, several times. No one denounces the murder. There are two important clues: Keanu Reeves and Crispen Glover: the character of Crispen Glovers is very annoying. <br /> <br /> Keanu's character, Matt, seems to be the only one who has a sense of right and wrong. This is Keanu at his best, an impeccable and very credible performance, anyone who thinks that this man can not act should see this movie. Matt's little brother is almost the most disturbing character in the movie. Only twelve and no compassion or love factor in your life. It is very sad to think that there are children out there like this. It really makes you appreciate what you have. 9/10.
