I saw this movie in the theater when I was 14 and it changed my life. I immediately cut my hair and started buying all the bands' albums in the movie. These were some of the seminal bands of L.A. punk rock captured in the movie at the top of his powers. Bands like Black Flag (pre-Rollins), Circle Jerks, Fear, X and the Germs have few equals in the history of punk music. I can not believe that this movie has never been released on video or DVD. Great movie for punk rock fans.
