charming. I love the movie I want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. His expressions are great, spectacular. the movie was excellent Julie Walters was also perfect. I think Rupert is the only boy with the red hair I love. Rupert has a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. I think the movie was great and it was great to see Rupert in something else, but Harry Potter. and he's a very good actor, so he deserves that and more. He only has a golden globe, but he probably deserves an Oscar Academy Award. There are some actors who do not act very well but have an Oscar anyway. no matter. But it is perfect, bright and beautiful.
