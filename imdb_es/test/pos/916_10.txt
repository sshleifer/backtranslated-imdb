"Rouge" is part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own. It is not a sequel of any kind. The ending, which I will not divulge, unites the three films, but not seeing the other two does not make it too confusing. <br /> <br /> This movie surprises me because it's so sober, so subtle and simple, but it's as effective, emotionally and intellectually, as any big-budget show or star melodrama. Kieslowski investigates here the phenomena of chance and destiny. Both themes are interwoven in history. The movie is a puzzle, but the message is quite simple: everything happens for a reason. Love is in all our destinies while we open ourselves to it. The title, "Red" refers to the French flag, where red represents "fraternity" or brotherhood. Color dominates the images of the film. I tend to think that it represents love or passion, or the blood of life. It's great when a movie allows the freedom to do that;)
