This small John Ford western without "stars" but with a cast of actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary feel, since it tracks the journey west of a Mormon party and may be the most authentic aspect of all Ford movies (it's on par with "The Sun Shines Bright", which was a couple of years ago later). <br /> <br /> There is a kind of plot (a group of bank robbers join the train of wagons at one point), but the highlights of the film are almost incidental. The splendid performances of the Ford stock company (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr, Ward Bond, Jane Darwell, etc.) greatly increase the authenticity of the film, while the film closest to that of a full-body star It's the Denver of Joanne Dru. Dru was a much better actress than she had ever been credited, as was Bond and Johnson, who at least finally received an Oscar recognition for her work on "The Last Picture Show." As he himself said, 'It could not have happened to a nicer boy'. Add the excellent location photograph of Bert Glennon and you will have a genuine piece of Americana that could not have anyone other than Ford. This is a film that really honors the pioneers of the United States and is full of feelings and feelings.
