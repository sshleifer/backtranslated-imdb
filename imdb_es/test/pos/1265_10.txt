I'm surprised that Memento (which is an excellent movie) is so well regarded in the Top 250 and it does not even appear! What the hell is that?? To be honest, when this movie was over, my instinctive reaction was that this movie is better than Memento. After the euphoria of the fabulous finale disappeared, I came to the conclusion that they are equal in their excellence. I'm confused about why he's not in the Top 50 together with Memento. I will venture to guess that (unfortunately) is because it is black and white or because (again sadly) that all the characters have a British accent ... unfortunately because there is no reason not to appreciate a great movie like this one. <br /> <br /> I tell you that if you love Memento, you will also love to follow him. Sparkly!
