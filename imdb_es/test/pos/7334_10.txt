I just watched this movie in Austin, Texas, at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and it was my favorite of the festival. The gymnast is a movie to NOT get lost. It is an honest story of "coming to an agreement" about relationships, self-discovery, aging and having the courage to change and move forward. This is not only a good story, but the glorious aerial performances of Dreya Weber and Addie Yungmee will leave you breathless! Watch this movie! Soon he will come to a festival near you. This movie deserved to be picked up immediately by an important network or studio. I will definitely buy this when it is available on DVD.
