Regard of Flight and Clown Bagatelles, interpreted by Bill Irwin, are some of the funniest performances (both in terms of physical comedy and visual and visual jokes) that I've seen. My father recorded this special when it aired for the first time in the 80's and my family has loved it since then. We quote from one side to another quite constantly. It is a real pity that the copies are not available for purchase. I have a bad VHS copy that I purchased from a specialized dealer a few years ago, but Mr. Irwin's performance deserves a proper DVD treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with the artists / producers, as well as more examples of modern . clown. <br /> <br /> Bill Irwin's talent deserves more exposure to general audiences than he has enjoyed in his wide-spread appearances. I share "The Regard of Flight" with friends very often and, although they always greet me with a bit of skepticism when I mention that it is a mixture of clowns and vaudeville, I still have to make nobody leave without seeing him without loving him. . In case powers ever occur in this IMDb list, consider releasing this and another Bill Irwin job.
