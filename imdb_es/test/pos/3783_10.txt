The other day I described Woody Allen's Manhattan as perfect for someone, and she thought it was a strange way of describing a movie ... I've seen only a handful of movies that I would call perfect. Manhattan is one, McCabe and Ms. Miller by Robert Altman are another and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is another film that I think achieves perfection. There are some others, but apart from the fact that I do not find faults in the three that I mentioned, I must also admit that the three directors have acquired tastes. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie that could stop and bet on the house that anyone you would show him would look impeccable, it's Shoulder Arms. <br /> <br /> City Lights, The Great Dictator, The Gold Rush and even The Pawnshop have 10, but not only does Chaplin do everything right in this movie, everything he did is hilarious and moving to a level beyond all explanation
