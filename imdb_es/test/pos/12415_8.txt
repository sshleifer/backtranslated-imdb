Two friends of the university - one, a tense nerd, the other a rude lazy - embark on a trip through the country. On the way, they find a vicious vehicle that looks like an army tank combined with a monster truck, which tries to run over it. They escape, but only enrage the mysterious and dangerous driver more when one of them has a leak in the upper hatch while on a rest stop. Later, they choose a sexy hitchhiker who ends up involved in a life threatening situation. MONSTER MAN is an extremely entertaining horror comedy that has some good moments of suspense, as well as some good and bloody ones. The two main characters and their constant fights are fun to see on their own and the end takes a turn like a TCM that was very well done. Absolutely worth checking out.
