This is the first movie I have on video, and 14 years later, I still have the same copy. Elizabeth Taylor was as radiant at age twelve as ever, Mickey Rooney gave a real dimension to My Taylor, and Donald Crisp was as solid as Mr. Brown. The incredible Anne Revere, like Mrs. Brown, seemed to be the wisest woman in the world. After almost 60 years, the warmth, humor and emotion of this film still affect the viewer; We still laugh at the jokes, we look for The Pie and we love Velvet for the spirit and the capacity for love that she shows. I love when I'm an adult, just like when I was a kid. A must for each collection of family videos.
