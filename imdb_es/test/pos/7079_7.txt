I really liked that movie. To be very fair, the film starts very slowly, without any of the characters being so nice. Continue in this way for a good half of the movie. <br /> <br /> But, if you are patient, you will be rewarded enormously. What the first half of the film lacks in character development and / or sympathy is adequately compensated in the second half. It's a bit like riding a roller coaster: a slow and uphill climb to start, and then speed, twists and turns, and some surprises. <br /> <br /> As usual, Meryl Streep is wonderful. She is the best actress of our time. William Hurt is good, although a bit of wood at some points. Renee Zellweger does a very good job, showing that her performance at Jerry McGuire was not a coincidence.
