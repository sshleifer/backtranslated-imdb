This is a phenomenal movie. Truly one of the best movies I've ever seen. I am a serious critic and it takes a lot to cheer me up, but this movie had all the right combinations to "move". The passion of the actors, without exaggeration, the pain for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, make this an obligatory film, despite the fact that it is the 1970s. It is definitely not an "old movie", but a classic / vintage movie. I hope you get involved in the topic as I did when you consider how volatile relationships can be, when you also consider how deep the pain associated with love can be and how the most difficult decisions to make will always be the most painful, but a Once Pain is made to subside, but only gradually. This film, without doubt, shows that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that, of course, is not synonymous with loss / lack of love. The "making" of this film certainly emanates from a place deep in one's heart and mind.
