River's Edge is an excellent film and it is a pity that it has not made more mark in the cinematographic history. There were several high-quality films based on school children made in the eighties, but of all the ones I've seen; This is undoubtedly the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film takes a story that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of the vague adolescents and their indifferent attitude about things, which takes the story to another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and is represented by complex characters. The movie starts with a murder. Then we follow the killer, nicknamed John, when he returns to school and tells all his friends what he has done. Instead of giving the expected reaction, most of them hardly react and the strongest reaction the murderer receives comes from Layne; who makes it his number one priority to help John fix the mess he's in and get him out of it. The other friends reflect on the crime, and in a short time one of them goes to the police ... <br /> <br /> River's Edge presents a lot of excellent performances by its young cast. Keanu Reeves has a reputation for acting in wood, and for good reason; but it adapts very well to this first role and this performance is easily one of the best. Crispin Glover is the biggest standout as Layne, a little crazy. Glover always stands out in all the films he's in, and although he does it a bit above; He convinces well as a protagonist in this film. Reeves and Glover receive good support from a young and talented cast that includes Daniel Roebuck and Joshua John Miller, as well as the great Dennis Hopper in another wild role. The film presents a very rough image that augurs well with its nihilistic tone. The central characters are all of the generation 'slacker / stoner' and the way he does not really seem to care about the murder of his friend is more shocking than the murder itself; and the point that the film tries to make about modern society is strong and well defined. The movie is also quite funny, due to some of the lines of the characters; but the humor is completely black and clearly this movie was never a comedy. In general, this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing.
