Along with virtually all the Republic images that have been made, "Murder in the Music Hall" seems to have vanished into oblivion. A shame, because this article exquisitely produced, directed and written by experts and astute mystery-suspense spins an exciting thriller of detective novels against the backdrop of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the elegant apartments in the attic casts suspicion on the delicious Rockettes, among them, Vera Ralston (who in addition to providing an attractive presentation of subtlety and vulnerability, provides some dazzling numbers of ice skating production), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop and several other delightful B movie stars from the 1940s. The tall, blond and handsome William Marshall (usually cast in musicals) chases the killer as the complex and increasingly creepy plot unfolds, against the most elegant settings I've ever seen in a black cinema. The ending is as amazing as this mysterious murder with sadness and class. It is worth restoring and reviving on cable television, VHS or DVD. Republic had a sizeable budget in this Grade-A production, and "Murder in the Music Hall" is as witty, disconcerting, and immensely fun as any of the major studio films of its time. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Pay attention to the rhapsodic song composed by the victim just before his death. Then, in the midst of the incessant chatter of the dancers in their dressing rooms, try to locate the one who is singing that fatal melody. You'll find out who the killer is as William Marshall does. Great fun, the kind of movie they really do not do anymore, and what a loss, both for the audience and for the actors.
