I saw this movie at the Philadelphia Film Festival today and I enjoyed it in general. It is an interesting and expert analysis of the all-too-common revelation that our parents' marriage was more flawed and difficult than we originally imagined. In addition, this film is an excellent example of the process of discovering truths about the life of our parents after their death and the problems associated with it. However, I found that the sound quality (recording and editing) is relatively poor and annoying. *** It is very possible that it was related to the specific conditions of the theater and the projection *** I am not a filmmaker / student or anything, and I do not claim a real understanding of the process of sound production, but as a consumer, I found the audio Part of the movie that distracts. Specifically, I heard very unpleasant noises on the lips (especially in a long interview with the younger sister) of the film, and often the level of background noise was higher than that of the voices of the people (for example, the scene in which a small group was classifying roles of the mother). Has anyone else seen this movie, noticed something about the sound ... thanks
