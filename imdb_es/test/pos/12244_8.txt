I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It provides detailed information on what executives involved in the news industry will do just to get a story on the air: notably Jane Craig hastening Kenny to finish editing the piece to remove it, and then Joan Cusack struggling to get it, and William Hurt, who according to Jane commits an incredible ethics violation, fakes her tears during her rape interview, a flaw noted by Aaron. Another important point is when Tom uses Jane for his own benefits, and then turns around and sleeps with Jennifer. The script is brilliant, and the address is almost as good. The three main actors were great at representing their characters, especially Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks, who is the most entertaining of the film. William Hurt is also very good. This earned at least three Oscars, best actress (holly hunter), best supporting actor (Albert Brooks) and best film. I liked the last parts of the film where they are shown together 7 years later. <br /> <br /> 8/10
