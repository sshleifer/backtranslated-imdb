I will start from the beginning saying "I like this movie". It's sweeping, it's great, it's exciting and it's fun. Sinhue the doctor, sits in front of his small stone hut writing his memoirs. And what a story it is! Taken from a river and raised by an elderly couple who appreciated him, he becomes a doctor for the poor. He befriends Horemheb, who sees the glory, while Sinhue sees the healing. And both meet the future pharaoh Anknaten (forgive me the spelling), who suffers an epileptic attack. <br /> <br /> And this pharaoh has another "defect": he believes in a god instead of a pantheon of gods. Back then, this was totally revolutionary. They grow sinhue and horemheb. One night, Sinhue sees a woman who makes her lose her senses. She abandons her practice, sells her parents' house and even her graves just to spend a night with her. The? I will not say Meanwhile, Merit, a tavern maid who played with sweet simplicity and with the strength of Jean Simmons, falls in love with Sinhue. She falls under his spell and under the spell of belief in a single god. <br /> <br /> Victor Mature acts as perfect as Horemheb. Edmond Purdom is sincere like Sinhue, the lost doctor (do you find redemption? Stay tuned). Even Bela Darvi, the woman who steals Sinhue's heart, is not as bad as everyone has said. The fact that she was Daryl F. Zanuck's mistress had nothing to do with the casting, was it? Yes, of course ... even so, she was not so bad _ I've seen worse things. I think he did better in "The Egyptian" than what many of today's young actresses have done in anything. I said it before and I'll say it again: I like this movie. I recommend it. It makes you think despite some hammy performances. Have fun with this movie; worth it.
