It is played as his usual teenage audience movie, but the feeling is incredibly grim. If it were done today, it would be considered an art film. He goes through the usual routine of a boy who tries to go to bed, but the results of his efforts are hard, cruel and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> The whole formula of the movie for teenagers is fulfilled, but there is nothing that results. you would expect Imagine a director cut from 'It's a Wonderful Life' where, in the end, James Stewart could not return to the real world. An incredible movie that subverts all expectations of the genre. It makes you feel dirty afterwards: there is no redemption for the characters. I'm surprised it's ever been done. The eighties version of Detective Story.
