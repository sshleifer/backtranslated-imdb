I just wanted to inform anyone who might be interested that the movie "New Jersey Drive" was my personal favorite of all time. I admire the work that Nick Gómez and Spike Lee put into this masterpiece of a movie. This movie impressed me a lot because of its reality and its appreciation of the details of life in the urban area of ​​New Jersey. He played a chord with me, personally, because I grew up with friends like the ones shown in the movie. I was also impressed because he used to spend time in Teaneck several years ago, so some of the characters stayed "real". Sometimes, this movie looked like a documentary because you did not know if they were real events or not. Although films like "Boys in the Hood" and "Menace II Society" attract more attention, I personally feel that these films were "improved" to attract a wider audience. "New Jersey Drive" was an intransigent piece of reality "in your face". Lee and Gómez covered every detail in this urban drama from music, clothes, slang and location. Unlike some of the films I mentioned earlier, the actors acted as if they were not "actors." Nothing was compromised to make a good "theater". The only misfortune that came out of this movie was the fact that many people "slept" in it. I expect more works of art from Nick and Spike in the near future.
