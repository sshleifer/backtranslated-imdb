I have copied my video of this on a DVD to enjoy it every time I like it and it is also a very successful (and rare) wedding gift. This is simply an absolutely wonderful adaptation of a beloved novel. Everything is just perfect and has aged surprisingly well. There is always a possibility with something so old that it may seem a bit creaky next to more modern dramas, but 'Precious Bane' is more than brave. <br /> <br /> The quality of the performance is amazing with Janet McTeer doing a superlative Prudence and a young Clive Owen stomping like the taciturn Gideon Sarn. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone to see the final sequence without at least smelling a little the pure romance of all this. It's the perfect movie to watch when it's cold outside and you cuddle up on the couch. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this enough.
