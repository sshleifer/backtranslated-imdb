Okay, Ghoulies 4 is a bit bad. And he does not even have the ghoulies in it. And the acting is bad. The plot is stupid. But I forget to mention how funny this movie is. It's so cheesy, and so ridiculous it's too much fun to not enjoy. There are only 2 ghoulies in the movie, and they do not really seem to be related to the Ghoulies in the other movie. But they are quite funny. And funny thing, Jonathon Graves returns for this. If you saw the first one, it was a character in that. In my opinion, this is better than the first. There are some classic scenes and some classic lines, one of them in a grocery store. "Attention K-Mart buyers!" Look at this if you like bad movies. It's so bad that it's good. And did I mention that Barbara Alyn Woods is hot?
