He recently traveled to Norway from Bergen, Norway, and stopped in the small town of Voss, Norway, and there was a monument in honor of Knute Rockne, who was born in Voss years ago. To this day, all people know Knute and the tour guides take pride in stopping at their monument. This film is a great story about this great man and his great love for Notre Dame. He never realized that Knute has great talents in chemistry and laboratory science and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time he coached the football team. Ronald Reagan played the role of George Gipp, (The Gipper) who was a prominent soccer player; Reagan had a brief role, but he gave a great supporting role in this film. Donald Crisp, (Father John Callahan) stood out as a priest who always had great faith in Knute throughout his life at Notre Dame. This is a great classic movie and will be seen by many generations to come. Enjoy.
