This is the second Hitchcock movie that appears on the list and the second Hitchcock movie I've seen in its entirety, the first was Rope, which I really enjoyed. With Saboteur, Hitchcock had more room to move freely, while Rope was held in one room. I did not enjoy it as much as Rope, but that does not mean it's a bad movie, it just seems like an average movie that could have been something else. <br /> <br /> It seems like a movie that Hitchcock would make Take a break among his most serious. Like a thriller, I feel like I can not really get on the edge of my seat or commit to the main character who is running around the United States. The climax of the movie feels like a missed opportunity to really increase the tension. The sound design is almost nonexistent. You can listen to their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but important things are missing, the points are torn from the sleeve, the need for music to increase the tension, all that is missing. Intentional, no doubt, however, lacks the emotional shock one would wish for such a scene. Then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside. <br /> <br /> The film does not seem to have to do either, they are almost globe-trotting from one place to another, but they feel more confined. The script itself is very normal and seems to go by the most obtuse ways of making the plot advance. <br /> <br /> The performances are there, but nothing surprising. Everyone plays their part to the words with a script on the page. The relationship between the two drivers is weak and needs more work. The one that stands out is Otto Kruger, who has that rich, ego and evil person. <br /> <br /> In the end, I wanted more of this. I understand that it is one of the less exciting films of Hitchcock, but I had a great time watching it. I can recommend it, but not with enthusiasm.
