Everyone told me that this movie was frankly not good, that I was sick, etc., so I finally rented it and I was amazed. I thought the torture was going to be much worse, but it was shocking near the end, but that was it. I would not call it a horror movie, maybe a mystery or something under the category of Silence of the Lambs and / or Kiss the Girls. He got stupid at times, but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rating R: for strong torture, violence, language and sexuality
