Come, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you about this movie and it is ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them very well; They will hate it But this time, I saw it alone and discovered that it affected me a lot. Although the film is long, it was tied to the story and surprised by the end. Initially I thought it was strange as to how she simply disappeared, but at some level, it makes a lot of sense. <br /> <br /> But as Comeundone said, this movie has no sense of reality. Instead, it challenges him and the viewer to seriously think what the word "normal" means. It also gives you the idea to think personally what the end means, I can say that I loved how it turned out and I am happy for Mithi.
