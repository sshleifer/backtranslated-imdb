This movie is extremely funny: the character of Mama makes me go back to the movie again and again! I can not get enough of her dry lines ... like when she tells her son Owen to bury his friend in the backyard before he smells the place ... and his suspicion that Owen is trying to kill her by giving him nuts Salt! It `s hilarious! <br /> <br /> If you like movies like National Lampoon's Vacation, Uncle Buck, or Planes, Trains & Automobiles, this has a similar mood. It's a great healthy laugh ... a must see!
