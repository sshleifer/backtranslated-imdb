At first I did not like the way the director constantly changed from the past (Gulliver's travels) to the present (Gulliver in the asylum). But in reality it is the best way to film the story, although it took a little while to get used to it. Danson is outstanding as the title character and fox Edward are a wonderful villain. The worst part is Mary Steenburgen as Gulliver's wife. She has never been beautiful in Hollywood and in this movie they make her look pretty sloppy for some reason. I will never understand why directors make an ugly woman when she adds nothing to the story! Besides, you want to strangle her for being so stupid by believing the lies of the bad guy that Bates keeps telling her. Even your son can see through the bastard. It's still a good show and I call it B +.
