If you are a fan of Turkish and Middle Eastern music, you are very lucky. This film is a documentary of current music in Istanbul, which ranges from the traditional to the modern. Is very good. You could not do better if you went to Istanbul for yourself. We received interviews with Orhan Gencebay, concert clips of modern musical icons, a road show with a Romani (gypsy) audience, Turkish hip hop (surprisingly very good) and much more. Some of the best female vocalists I've ever heard. A Kurdish woman who sings in a hamam (steam bath) that will rip your heart out. Many social and political backgrounds. If this is your thing, you will have a great time. I could barely stay still in the theater. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the CD now available on Amazon. Expensive.
