Klaus Kinski appeared in a considerable number of spaghetti westerns throughout the 60s and early 70s; He was usually cast in secondary parts as unsavory villains. Kooky Klaus gets a juicy lead role as the crazy Johnny Laster, a nasty, deranged sexual maniac who has a plan to kidnap a lovely heiress to get his considerable inheritance. Johnny and his gang become wanted fugitives after the plan goes disastrously. Screenwriter and director Mario Costa skillfully elaborates a sordidly compelling portrait of a seriously ill and twisted work of death: the plot develops at a steady pace, the tone is appropriately gritty and serious, and the thrilling action scenes are depicted with scenes real. Ability and brio (the shootings in the rock quarries are especially exciting and exciting). Ironically, dressed in white, oozing oily charisma from every rotting pore, and jumping over beautiful women whenever she has the chance, Johnny de Kinski becomes a fascinatingly creepy and monstrous beast. Kinski is simply spectacular like this gloriously repellent character; receives excellent support from the exquisite Gabriella Giorgelli as the sweet and hot Juanita girl, Steven Tedd as the merry Riccardo, Giovanni Pallavicino as the ruthless gang leader of the Machete gang, Giuliano Raffaella as the smart lawyer Gary Pinkerton and Paolo Casella as the sensitive couple of Johnny. The congratulations are also in order for the bad mood and the energetic score of Stelvio Cipriani. Well worth seeing for Kinski fans.
