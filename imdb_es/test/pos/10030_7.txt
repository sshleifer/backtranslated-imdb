I blame "The Birth of a Nation" myself, for starting the long tradition of Hollywood farces in history, of which there may be few more important examples than this one. Besides writing correctly the names of Custer and his seventh cavalry, Crazy Horse and the Sioux and President Grant, the geography is correct and the fact that Custer and his men were eliminated by one man, the rest is simply exaggerated. Ridiculous limits. Include some frankly trite scenes from the purest exhibition (try to get Custer and his wife to learn the fake "Gold Rush" to excuse the invasion of the Sioux territory, Custer's testimony before the Congress that advocates for the rights of the Red Indians and at first all, Custer breaking into the president's office to beg him to return to his post), honestly, there are many more of the same, some of these almost comic scenes in his wit ... ... And still, and without However, he remains a great action character with Flynn as incredible as ever, DeHavilland as seductive as ever, the young Anthony Quinn started as Crazy Horse and director Walsh as barnstorming as always in his description of crowd scenes and, Of course, the tumultuous sequences of action. Ford taught us in "Liberty Valance" to believe the legend before the truth. Here I think we are closer to the legend of the legend, but hey, it's just a movie and a classic Hollywood film wonderfully funny!
