This series, when the dinosaur lived 65 million years ago. The Dinosaurus seems very real and is very realistic when it moves. It is also very interesting how the weather changes. <br /> <br /> I'm very interested in how the dinosaurs lived and died. I'm also interested in how the dinosaurs behaved. <br /> <br /> The color of the dinosaurs is also interesting to see and discover. They think what color they had. <br /> <br /> The most interesting is why dinosaurs died and what happened next. <br /> <br /> The BBC has made a brilliant series of how dinosaurs lived and died!
