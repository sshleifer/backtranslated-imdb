Colombian terrorists take a military school in the United States as hostages until their demands are met. The students decide to counterattack. Can they do it? <br /> <br /> A stupid premise, but the movie really works. The group of children who are fighting was in full swing when this movie came out in 1991: Sean Astin (very cute); Wil Wheaton (looking miserable); Keith Coogan; George Perez (the Latin token who is very handsome, very muscular and is shown mainly in tight underwear); TEA. Russell (the black boy) and Shawn Phelan. None of them are very good actors (except Astin), but who cares? This is a meaningless action movie. The only other good performances are Denholm Elliott (who has a ball as a director) and Louis Gossett Jr. as dean. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, there is a lot of action, suspense, explosions and small brains. In other words --- FUN! <br /> <br /> Only complaint (and this is minor) - it is a little too long (there are THREE endings) and there is LOTS of casual and bloody violence (the R rating was well deserved). Still, I enjoyed it a lot.
