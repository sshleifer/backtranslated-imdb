Read this: <br /> <br /> BOYZ 'N THE HOOD IS A SCENE BY SCENE, COMPLETE KICK-BACK OF THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Two friends in the hood, one focused on the intellectual Persecutions and the other is an athlete. The friend who is an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and dies. (The athlete turns out to be Washington from 'Welcome Back, Kotter'.) <br /> <br /> It makes me mad that people do not know this. It surprises me every time I go into a video store and Boyz 'n the Hood is in the' Drama 'section while Cooley High is in' Comedy '. It is a shameful shame. This movie is more fun and dramatic than the John Singleton scam. At least Singleton might have had the dignity to say that his movie was a tribute to Cooley High, but no, he never said a word. Boys 2 Men, however, named their successful album after this movie.
