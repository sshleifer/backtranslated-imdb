I really liked that movie! I'm surprised and disappointed that he never made it to the theaters. Each story was better than the previous one ... much better than the highly touted series "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer" and much better than the terrible "Urban Legend". I would recommend this movie to all terror fans.
