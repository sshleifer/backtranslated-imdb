I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not like anyone I know, but I like it. <br /> <br /> I did not like it as much as the first time, but it was still good. The script and the plot may not have changed at all, but the story was better than Caddyshack 1. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not like Caddyshack 2 is ... <br /> < br /> NO RODNEY DANGERFIELD! <br /> <br /> I think the movie would be better if Rodney Dangerfield had the role of Jackie Mason. Although I liked Jackie Mason in the movie, it would be much better if they stayed with Rodney Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> Another flaw in the movie, which I did not hate so much, was Dan Akroyd. The movie was made 8 years after the first one. Bill Murray, "Carl," could have left his job as a guardian's assistant and join the army, you know? If Warner Bros. had thought about that, it could also have improved the movie. <br /> <br /> This was my comment for Caddyshack II. <br /> <br /> I give it 8.2 out of 10 <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but nonetheless. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Caddyshack 1 and you're debating about seeing or not seeing Caddyshack 2, I'm telling you it's an attempt
