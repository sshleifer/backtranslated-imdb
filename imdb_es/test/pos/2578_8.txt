In Mississippi, the former bluesman, Lazaro (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, he misses his wife who just left him. Find the dog of the city and the nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) lying on the road near her small farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazaro takes her home, gives her medicine, takes care of her and nourishes her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety problem, he misunderstands Lazaro and Rae's relationship and tries to kill him. <br /> <br /> "Black Snake Moan" is a strange tale of faith, hope, love and blues. The talented Christina Ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young vagabond who was abused since childhood by his father and who has had sex with the entire city where he lives. It is amazing the versatility of this actress, and probably this is the most mature work I've seen interpret Christina Ricci. Samuel L. Jackson also has a fantastic performance in the role of Lázaro. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I've heard in a movie, with wonderful blues. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Entre o Céu e o Inferno" ("Between heaven and hell")
