Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is rarely one of my favorites, said everyone should watch this movie, since it's something that can help heal the world ... <br /> <br /> It's one of the most touching that I have seen. I have seen and delivered the comments of Tutu ... I have read many comments and although they range from good to average to comments on the choice of actors ... The fact is that it is one of the most extraordinary events in our world. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission ... for the first time that a country has chosen to air its horrible history, find a way forward and create a way to heal people ... <br /> <br /> While the film begins when the White Police is offered the opportunity to absolve themselves for brutal crimes and the Black Man tries to make sure that he does not get away with it, he delves into the humanity of the people and the enormous need for healing that we have . everyone needs ... <br /> <br /> Definitely a thumbs up ..... To all those involved .... Once again, I am proud to be a South African ..... <br /> <br /> An interesting comment can be found here: http://www.biz-community.com/Article/196/97/5223.html
