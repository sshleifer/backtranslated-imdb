The second episode of the new "Lost" gives him just what his fans lacked, a good amount of fascinating action. From the first scene, you still see new features that you did not expect to find. It is the best proof that the series, in its fourth season, is still alive and kicking with force. <br /> <br /> Although the producers do not surprise us with more flash-forwards this time, the return to flashbacks is more than satisfactory, as it brings some shocking facts. Flashbacks introduce some new characters, and family members turn out to be connected in a surprising way. <br /> <br /> The new characters dominate the whole episode and I can not say that it does any damage. Their stage parts and their actors do extremely well, providing us with a sense of support: right after the episode, you will realize that the program really needed people like that. And here they are. <br /> <br /> "Confirmed Dead" is full of exciting action and very written dialogues. I am sure that I will quote the best scenes of the episode for a long time: they are so good that they remain in the mind of the spectator. The episode is entertaining, intelligent and cheerful. You like "Lost", you have to see it. My vote is ten.
