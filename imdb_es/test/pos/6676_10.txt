A beautiful story, magical, stimulating and moving. Excellent direction, perfect cast, wonderful script, excellent score, beautifully lit ...... do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> If you like movies that not only make you think, but also warm your heart (some of what comes to mind are 'Contact', 'Field of dreams' and 'Groundhog Day') '), then I'm sure you'll love K-PAX. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
