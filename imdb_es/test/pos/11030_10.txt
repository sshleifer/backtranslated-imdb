I managed to get an original BBC broadcast of this film on video and I loved it so much that I had to try to locate the original video in its original box; thanks to Ebay. <br /> <br /> Removed in any format since 1990, this exceptional wildlife film is finely constructed and well acted. Directed by Stewart Raffil (MAC & Me), the scenes of tigers jumping across the Alaskan wilderness are incredible and their eternal story of a trapper trying to survive on his own in the frozen debris with two young tiger cubs is advancing each display. <br /> <br /> Why no major company has collected this film to distribute it on DVD is a great wonder; but it makes it very special to know that it is also difficult to locate. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie by chance or eventually track it to add it to your collection, make sure you do not let it disappear from your grasp. Films of this caliber, as shown, do not come frequently. <br /> <br /> A true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and highly worthy of your praised comments, "WHEN THE WINDS OF THE NORTH WINDS" will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it.
