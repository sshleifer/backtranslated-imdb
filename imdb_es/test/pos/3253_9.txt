Two Hands is an exciting Australian adventure against crime, which ultimately succeeds in the way the film easily combines dramatic moments, with characters and very funny situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film happens naturally, and the laughter has not been created in a very elaborate way and has not been worked too much. It's really fun, thanks to the fact that each character in the film is an excellent cast, and that each actor / actress recognizes and can relate to Australian humor. They portray it very well and very realistically. Of course, they are helped immensely by a fantastic script by writer and director Gregor Jordan. I was reading another review of this film by an American who had seen it, and he criticized it harshly, basically made it pass as a clone of Pulp Fiction. I think that's just nonsense. This movie does not try to be Pulp Fiction, the sensation and style of each of these excellent films are totally opposite. Without wanting to sound superior or arrogant, I think to fully understand this movie; The humor, the sincerity, the characters, etc ... you have to be Australian, or at least understand the culture, that the other guy obviously had no idea. Some Americans, whose reviews of certain non-American films, seem to ignore (and have trouble understanding) anything that is not a US product. It's a real shame, because this is a really great movie. The love story presented between the main character and the girl is also presented in a very real, sincere and sweet way. I am very proud to have this movie in my collection. 4.5 out of 5
