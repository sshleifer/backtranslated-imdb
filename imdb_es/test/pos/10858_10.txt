I think Andrew Davies did an admirable job of taking a great book that emulated the rhythm and style of a Victorian novel and turned it into a moving and entertaining film. I'm glad to have read (twice) the book first, which is usually the case for me. I know that one should see a novel and a movie as different media and judge them accordingly. But, even so, it is often difficult to read the original material after a movie gives away the best parts. <br /> <br /> I realize that Davies is a very good adapter, but I wish the producers had chosen a woman to write The Script. Davies, as he admits in the commentary that accompanies the film on DVD, wanted to emphasize especially the most eschatological fragments of the book. I certainly enjoyed them, both in the movie and in the book. But Davies lost a half-dozen moments that are so unbearable and painfully tender that he could have incorporated them if his sensitivity was more feminine. <br /> <br /> I would also disagree with your use of the main symbol of the book, the rose. <br /> <br /> As the script was drawn by Davies, the outcome was inevitable and appropriate. But I really believe that Waters' final nod to the rose symbol was much more interesting. And I preferred that the novel allow Nan "to come of age" than Davies chose. <br /> <br /> A brief comment about the four actors who rehearse the main roles. They are all wonderfully talented, well, except for singing and dancing, maybe, and besides, their physical presences are so much what the eyes of the mind see when they read the novel before watching the movie. I thought they were all great. <br /> <br /> I recommend that any lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction, add BOTH the book and DVD of TIPPING THE VELVET to their shelves.
