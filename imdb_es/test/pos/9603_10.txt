.... Could it be that ITV would not want to release this absolute classic because it would show its current series by Mike Bassett for what it is? When talking about Mike Bassett with some coworkers, I mentioned that the Bostock Cup was a very superior offer and I was surprised to discover that he seems to be the only person in my entire office who has seen him. This may not be right for a movie that has to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, ITV does not have the best recent record of comedy production, so I would think they would jump at the chance of at least repeating something that is really fun. Maybe if it could be combined with lucrative telephone competition where we believe the coach's driver will go later, then he might be interested. <br /> <br /> Come on, ITV, there are still some of us that we would like to see original, quality comedy / drama. Do the decent thing. Repeat it and then take it out on DVD.
