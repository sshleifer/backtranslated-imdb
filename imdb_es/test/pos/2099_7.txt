As mentioned in another poster. 56 (a local television station in Boston) showed this several times over the years on Saturday afternoons. They paired it with the first sequel "Return of the Ginat Majin." <br /> <br /> Now I have not seen him since then ... but he never left me. Apart from the dreadful dubbing and colorless color, this was a pretty good fantasy. Technically it is not horror ... until the statue comes to life at the end. It is a town ruled by an evil man. There is a giant stone statue to which the villagers continue praying to help them ... in vain. But things go too far, the statute comes alive and destroys the bad guys ... but then starts chasing the good guys too! Well done with some great special effects in the end (LOVED how he got rid of the main evil). There was also an enchanted forest in which it was also interesting. <br /> <br /> It is not a masterpiece, but an unusual horror / fantasy movie. It's worth catching, but not if it's the dubbed copy.
