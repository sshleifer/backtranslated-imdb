I consider myself a big fan of horror movies. One night I just wanted to rent some new horror movies to make fun of them. Then, I rented Milo. I was very surprised by this movie. It scared me so much. That is not something I can say very often. Usually, Halloween only scares me. <br /> <br /> Two other friends saw him with me and were left with a sense of uneasiness. A good feeling, if you ask me, after watching a horror movie. If it is not affected, then what is the point? <br /> <br /> This movie was original. I did not follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie. That's why films like Valentine bombed me. <br /> <br /> Of course, many have unanswered questions, like most horror movies. Although it is worth the rent.
