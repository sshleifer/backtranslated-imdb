This anime tells the story of the Battle for King Mamodo. Every 1,000 years, 100 children sucked are sent to Earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original Japanese, the creatures are mamono, which literally means magic / evil object). Each suck is paired with a human partner and given a magical spellbook. The Human can use this book to release incredible powers in Mamodo, and when a Mamodo is defeated, his spellbook is engulfed in flames (alternatively, a Mamdodo book can be captured and burned directly). After that, Mamodo returns to the Mamodo world. <br /> <br /> The titular character is Zatch (Gash in Japan), a 6-year-old mamodo with electric powers. He is paired with Kiyomaru Takamini and a genius of 14 years. Zatch initially is reluctant to fight, but upon learning that some Mamodo are evil and deciding that the battle for the king is wrong, he decided to fight to become a "friendly king". <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell has compared to Pokémon, but a better comparison is with Digimon. Like Digimon, the Mamodo and the Human have a symbiotic one-to-one relationship. Also, unlike Pokémon, both programs have a real plot. <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell presents character growth and evolving relationships, and some fairly adult story lines (such as love versus racism, slavery, mind control, etc.) It even has some twists and mysteries of the decent plot.
