I recorded this when I was a teenager in the mid-80s, based on the synopsis of the cable guide (the aspect of the treasure hunt appealed to me), without knowledge or expectations of the film. What a pleasant surprise when I saw it! This was such a fun movie and I remember seeing it repeatedly. I thought the concept was well executed, I enjoyed the inoffensive competition between the different groups and I thought that the treasure hunt itself was quite intelligent. Sometimes it seems that people have too big expectations for movies. Not all films will have a "message" or stellar performance, production values ​​or important special effects. Sometimes movies are only meant to entertain and be fun, and this is successful on both levels. It was very nice to read the comments of the actors who played the twins. I have not seen this movie in years, but if I did, I think I would have a reaction as warm and enthusiastic as I did when I was a teenager. Even as I write this, fragments of the most cheesey but appropriate theme song are going through my head: "When midnight starts coming at you ... it does not matter what you say, no matter what you do ...!"
