The summary line is the wet dream of some men for the ideal woman ...; o) Seriously, let's go back to the movie, which has a classic cinema written everywhere (word game and literally shown in the picture, also like seeing)! <br /> <br /> How could someone make a silent film in this year and age? It is not completely silent for once (take music for example). With great cinematography is the answer. And it's no wonder that he won prizes (as another user said) in this area! But sometimes it is also fallen. Although the images are excellent, sometimes it gets too far into them instead of moving forward (plot and time). If you can cope with that, then you will enjoy it even more than me. I have not told you anything about the story, but I will never do that, because I do not want to ruin anything for you ...
