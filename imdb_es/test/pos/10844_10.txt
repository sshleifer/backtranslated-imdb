This was one of the most emotional films I've seen. Passion, pleasure, pain, despair, pain, healing, cleanliness and love. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fascinating. Everything was very well done; The adaptation of the book, the actors, the scenarios, the camera shots. <br /> <br /> This movie touched me deeply in many ways. It reminded me of the desperation that can have losing your love and the time it takes to heal that wound. You can love again, but you will always be risking the pain that comes with separation. <br /> <br /> Is not this one of the most important old questions? <br /> <br /> "Is it better to have love and lose? <br /> <br /> What have you never loved before?" <br /> <br /> -Ascensi√≥n
