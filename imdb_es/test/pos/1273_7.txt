If Christopher Nolan had done Memento before continuing, then all the follow-up faults would have been corrected. At Memento, Nolan built the switches on time perfectly. We could say when was the past, when is it current, etc. However, Nolan experienced it a bit and it just does not work. Although I had a small budget and could not use color (which is a way that Memento worked), it was too difficult to distinguish between time. In the DVD there is a function that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order. I intended to write my review after seeing it, so I hope it makes more sense, but, of course, it did not work. <br /> <br /> You can not blame Nolan for not having original ideas. . A young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored, so he decides to follow people randomly on the street. Find one, Cobb (Alex Haw), who is especially interested. Soon, Bill befriends Cobb and accompanies him as he enters the houses and steals them. Then, a young spicy blonde (Lucy Russell) enters, and the movie becomes even stranger from there. <br /> <br /> The end of the following is one of the most shocking endings I've seen. Of course, Fight Club had an incredible ending, but the way Follow was developed was incredible. I felt that someone had hit me on the head and given me a concussion. Nolan has one thing to do for good endings (well, maybe not, I could guess insomnia a mile away), and can really build a great story. The following may not be the easiest thing to follow or look at, but it is such a refined and original story with a surprising ending that you will probably want to see all of your 70 minutes again. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rating R for language and some violence.
