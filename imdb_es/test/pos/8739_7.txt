Ingrid Bergman, the faithful receptionist of the dentist Walter Matthau who is attracted to her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this film. She manages the ingenious repertoire in the script with aplomb and steals an incredible scene where she and Goldie Hawn speak in a record booth (Ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells her to believe in it with all her heart). Matthau is a strange choice for the main man (he is too old for Goldie Hawn and too refined for Bergman, not to mention that he is not focused on being a dentist), but I liked the way he strives to please Goldie and stumbles trying to break free he himself of a lie. Hawn (who won an Oscar of Support) is as fresh and cheerful as she is today. The farce of this room is not terribly sophisticated (and slightly reminiscent of one of "Any Wednesday", too), but it is a welcome relief from the noisy and adolescent-oriented comedies they produce today. "Cactus flower" is a beautiful sigh! *** since ****
