I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to be one of the first to see the movie. It really grabs you. John Paul finally sees the light and makes a living far from being tied to the ropes of his mother's apron. <br /> <br /> I imagine that there must be so many families these days in the same position (especially with older children leaving home but I would not say wiser) with very sad parents who do not really have their own lives and who make their lives a misery. <br /> <br /> I think this movie should definitely have a wider audience. I would also say that the other actors also played brilliant roles. It is such a profound and very moving film.
