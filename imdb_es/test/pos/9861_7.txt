Okay, if you judged the movie for a day, it would not fit right. If you saw FI now the stage and everything was nice (I agree) But it was not all the movies in the 80s like that. Gilligan, Wonderwoman, aso). But also people born from the early to mid-70s or earlier have a cult status. During all the time the plane was approaching. The tattoo ran through the tower, played the bell and with its accent shouted "Da Plane BOSS Da Plane" and one wondered what would be the desire of all. People born in the mid-80s or later would not. I do not understand hippe because if you saw it now. It does not have a Harry Potter computer animation, Jurassic Park Computer. It was just a stage where you could probably even see the cable connected to a guy who wished he was also able to fly. But for us during that time it was a fantastic island.
