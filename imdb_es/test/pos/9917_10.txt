The Opera murders are not real murders but are symbols of past events and parts of Betty's own fractured personality. In fact, Betty is the same person (a man) that Suzy Bannion is in Suspiria, only a decade later in life (Suzy was a ten-year-old boy who befriended another ten-year-old boy with a softer version). of his own story). br /> <br /> Help think of Betty's luxury apartment as a bay of military barracks; he seems to spend most of his time in his room in bed next to his stereo, and other parts of his apartment seem strange to him in some way, as if other people lived in those other rooms. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento the movies are synchronized with a wide variety of rock music, as well as with Funk (Dar√≠o begins the synchronizations from the beginning of his films, the flash of the eye in Opera and the beginning of a battery of Suspiria). There are also standard movies that are synchronized with Opera (and Suspiria). For example, Opera synchronizes with a Judas Priest record album called Priest ... Live (just like Suspiria), and Suspiria synchronizes very well with a Kiss album album called Kiss Alive II. Movies like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, The Image and The Vampire Happening are synchronized movies that Argento uses and that deal with the same theme as Argento's films. These synchronizations, along with many others, reveal that Betty is a man who suffered sexual torture at the hands of her father from birth (even in the womb according to a certain novel by Anne Rice entitled Lasher). <br /> <br /> Anyway, Big budget movies are hidden works that retransmit spy information compiled by hidden media, all in synchronized symbolic / alchemical form. Usually, the synchronization point in a movie is the beginning of the sound score, or it is the first image of the film beyond any introduction of the film company. Sometimes it is more creative. The heavy metal music used in Opera and Phenomena are simply musical synchronizations that were deciphered from other films with which the Argento films are synchronized, an intellectual game among the elite within the industry. <br /> <br /> Then, Betty does not normally respond to the murders she witnessed, because she never witnessed the murder of any real person. "She herself" simply suffers the murder of the soul; she is witness to her own "murder"; the father of this guy almost knocked him down in a pit of an abandoned mine in Arizon at age 4, in 1970; he was about to fall off a wooden board on which his father balanced him before Dad changed his mind, grabbed him and yanked him out; The boy did not feel anything consciously. The memories of sexual torture are lost to this individual through extreme sexual repression, and the vague memories that remain are of the large, square, deep hole in the desert and no meaning is placed in this memory due to lack of conscious trauma (the "The loss of trauma," also a "buried feature", is portrayed in the 1975 movie The Image.) Those sausages in the attic in Suspiria are individual memories of the first three years of life (Toys In The Attic). <br /> <br /> The reason why Betty (or Suzy) is a female character is because the individual mirrors of the character of Christina Marsillach is a man who has been trained in a female role since birth (all the DVDs of the Simpson cartoons synchronized with Suspiria), with its own nature molded along lines of "queen" (The X-Files of episodes synchronized with opera.) This has even altered his body to that is "beautiful" in the way that the woman is. Behavior alters genetics. A more recent film entitled Death Proof deals with the same ideas and the same individual. <br /> <br /> Practically the whole life of this person is reflected in big budget films, album albums and books made since 1966, and the father Before 1966 and after. The Scorpions album titled Virgin Killer is a Suspiria syncing album, the cover of the original album acts as a symbolic mirror image of the fall through the skylight.
