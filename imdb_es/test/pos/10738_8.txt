After a decade of turbulent turmoil, American films began to shift gears and move their cameras away from war-torn battlefields, political corruption and general social unrest into the more intimate world of family dysfunction. The toll that selfish Baby Boomers began to take over the American family as they grew up and had their own children made itself felt. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs. Kramer" is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that would continue to be so popular throughout the 1980s, and is one of the best. It gets a pretty vague rap now, because it's known as the movie that beat "Apocalypse Now" for the 1979 Best Picture Award, but comparing these two movies is like comparing a banana with a marinated chicken breast: they're not remotely The same, but can not we enjoy them both? The director / writer Robert Benton does not try to do anything sophisticated with his film; its strength lies in its performances, particularly those of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, which make a divorced couple who fight childishly and selfishly for their son. The court scene in which they submit to custody and in which each one is forced to hurt the other in a terrible way, is devastating and feels authentic. The film does not portray Hoffman's solid father as a hero, nor Streep's mother as a villain. They are neither good nor bad as people, they are simply bad to be married. <br /> <br /> The movie has a tear in the end, but not in a manipulative way. Earn your right to cause sobs. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
