I just watched this movie on Showtime late at night. I was watching the beginning with one eye open, but instead of falling asleep, I invested in this sly and bitter film. It was very credible and attractive. I could have done it without so much blasphemy (as with all the David Mamet movies I see), but I enjoyed the experience a lot. I know teenagers swear, but I do not need to hear it. Anyway, the story had some interesting surprises that I will not reveal, but if you have the chance to see this movie on Showtime, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I do.
