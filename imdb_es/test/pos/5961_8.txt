Excellent exercise in multiple plans: <br /> <br /> - showing the spirit of colonialism not yet finished in France <br /> <br /> - more generally the boring mentality of superiority of all Western peoples <br /> <br /> - a renewal of spies and suspense films: OSS 117 is uneducated and stupid! <br /> <br /> The good idea is that, despite all these messages, it's a funny movie, full of jokes and Gags, very light and bright. <br /> <br /> Special mention to Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. Wonder how it will be appreciated in the United States? <br /> <br /> It seems to be a success in France, so probably a next version will come.
