Since 1996, I first saw this movie, I feel that I never reached the end of my satisfaction, I feel I want to see more and more until now, my God, I do not think it was ten years ago, and I can believe that I almost remember every word of the dialogues . I love this movie and I love this novel, absolutely perfect. I love Willem Defoe, he has a strange voice to spell the words "black night" and I always say it many times, without getting bored. I love Szararem's music, he is very spiritualistic, he made me enter another world in the depths of my heart. Can someone feel what I feel and someone could make the movie like that? I do not believe it. Thanks Ondaatje, thanks Mingela.
