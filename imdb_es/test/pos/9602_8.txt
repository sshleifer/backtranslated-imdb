Plane apart, I do not think I've laughed so much about a movie in my entire life. <br /> <br /> I love football like crazy, but I tend to hate almost any song or movie about football as they tend to be unrealistic. This was not. <br /> <br /> I saw it once, it was more than 2 years ago and it was brilliant. Everyone I know loved it. I remember the gay physio, the pitch tilted at an angle of approximately 45 degrees and 'Shoes' (a player named like that because he once appeared to train in a new pair of shoes). Brilliant, that's what happens in the park's soccer. <br /> <br /> A final 10/10. If someone in the television industry is reading this, considering all the shit that is repeated on TV in English, have the good sense to show it again (and the Muppets while doing it). Someone also knows if this was shown on BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so it's worth asking if they plan to show it again. Should do
