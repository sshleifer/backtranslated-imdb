This is one of the most underestimated films of the nineties. If you allow yourself to identify with the character of Patricia Arquette, you will discover that it is a very moving story of a woman who regains a sense of purpose in her life and finds a new will to live. <br /> <br /> Arquette's performance is brave because it is deliberately "wooden": it is a way of defining the spiritual death of his character, his complete lack of desire to be alive. He moves through life like a zombie because his family has been killed and he can not see the point of life. What is moving is how, in the course of history, he wakes up again: for the Burmese landscape, for the beautiful quality of his people and his landscapes, and for the primordial choices he is forced to face. <br /> <br /> Boorman supports this visually (and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of his most beautiful and disturbing scores) with a camera often static and with a propensity to shoot through glasses, windows, windshields, etc. . We are looking out, just like Arquette ... until she is deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether or not to fight for her life. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the 1954 film THE PURPLE PLAIN. It's a similar story in a similar setting, and it makes for a fascinating comparison.
