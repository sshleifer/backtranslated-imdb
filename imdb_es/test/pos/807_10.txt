Excellent work everywhere, especially by the actress who played wife Gerda (Claire Price) also, of course, as David Suchet. I really solved the madness, but that's irrelevant. The end, which I will not disclose (someone describes it in the Board in response to the question of another person if interested). I thought it was very sad. Despite Agatha Christie's reputation for writing cardboard characters, I thought they were very complete. <br /> <br /> The pace of the story was good and I enjoyed watching Sarah Miles as Lucy and Edward Hardwicke (the son of Cedric I also believes to be a well-known Dr. Watson.) as her husband.
