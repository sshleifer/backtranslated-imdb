River's Edge is more than the story of a murder. It is an accusation of the wave of apathy that has affected the pockets of youth for decades. Our main characters are a group of what my high school would have called "drug addicts." One of them simply decided to strangle his girlfriend because apparently she had the courage to "talk bad" with him. This dangerous young man played by Daniel Roebuck has an intensity that will startle you. He takes the other children out of the group to show them his girlfriend's body, and oddly enough, no one seems really scared about it. The balance of the film accentuates the desperate circumstances in which these people live, and how guilt can eventually make its way even within these apathetic children. <br /> <br /> River's Edge certainly does not endorse or defend the behavior of its characters. We see clearly the dangers of this apathy without control and that they only have the desire to get drunk or get high. We are shown the dysfunctional home life of these children, and perhaps this should explain their horrible behavior. But could they be just unstable homes that lead to this kind of destructive life? Crispin Glover is his usual crap. Drive through the city in a state of complete paranoia after the murder. He tries to sympathize with the reason why his friend had to commit the crime, but he clearly does not understand what could have made the young man do it. Dennis Hopper plays a man older than these children get their drugs. Although he is certainly a rebellious figure, he can not relate to the apathy and anger of the younger generation. Witness his confused reaction while Roebuck describes how the fact of having killed his girlfriend made him feel. As wild as Hopper's character is, even he knows that this young man should not walk on the face of the earth. <br /> <br /> What will they think of these children? Well, there's really no way they like their characters. Some are less despicable than others, but you can not help but hate them or feel sorry for them. Twenty years later, there is still a healthy and healthy apathy among many young people. When are these children lost? What makes so many of them want to act antisocial? This movie and the questions it poses about teenagers will stay with you for a while. That's a fact. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
