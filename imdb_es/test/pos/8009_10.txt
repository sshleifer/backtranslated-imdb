I like the house full and step by step the same. I do not have a favorite episode, I just like certain scenes. But I do not like some scenes, but I must say that the reason I started watching this program is because I had Suzanne Summers in them. and my favorite character was Dana. Karen could be a snob sometimes, but she also had good character. I just like to see family programs instead of junk that has a lot of drugs and violence. This show is very similar to other family programs where one of the parents is always strict with curfews and dates. Apart from step by step, my other favorite shows are Full House, Sabrina, the teenage witch, Gomer Pyle Usmc, the program of Andy Griffith and Dukes of Hazzard.
