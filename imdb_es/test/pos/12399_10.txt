As a camera operator, I could not help but admire the great appearance that this image achieved. The performances were excellent, as was the story. Just when I thought that this movie was about to slow down, it did not. The tension of the heart, the great rhythm through editing and a score that knows when to shut up, come together under a competent and capable direction. The camera was always in the right place. I love that
