Tim Burton, the man behind the original Batman and Beetlejuice film, brings to the world the sequel to Batman, which surpasses the original in more ways than one. First, Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batman enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to shake some heads inside the story and the penguin works in the same way that the joker worked on the original. The sets are impressive and immaculate. The city of Gotham has so many dark alleys that you could never know what is happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives him a bad name is his script, which sometimes seems to elapse and then does not recover for a while. The direction of Tim Burton takes the superhero films to a new kingdom. Beat all the Superman movies and the other Batman movies for a mile. Although in terms of realization, the new Batman begins has a bite that it lacks, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.
