A type of western that I enjoy greatly is when the apparently weak, who is reluctant to fight and respond to the challenge of the strong, finally decides that there is no other way. There is a great moment in this movie when John Parrish (Glenn Ford) enters the room and decides to face the gunman Wade Matlock. It's the kind of scene that makes the audience applaud. In my opinion, The Violent Men is a great western, I would classify it among the best. It makes great use of the wide screen, a spectacular landscape of the mountains. Women have a crucial part. Caroline (May Winn) is engaged to Parrish, but you feel she is only using it as a means to get out of there and move east. She wants him to sell the ranch regardless of the price. Martha (Barbara Stanwick), is tired of helping her disabled husband Lee (Edward G. Robinson), but will do anything to have an ever bigger ranch and more power. Meanwhile, she is betraying her husband with her brother (Brian Keith). His daughter Judith (Diane Foster) sees everything that happens but feels powerless to react because he does not want to hurt his father. Parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against the Anchor ranch. As he had warned Lee: "Do not make me fight because you will not like my way of fighting".
