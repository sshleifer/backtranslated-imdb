Who does not remember the movie Muppet ??? <br /> <br /> Kermit the Frog is now an icon of American culture. What child does not attract this character? <br /> <br /> Like Muppet's first real movie, the movie simply called, the Muppet movie did very well. Kermit takes the advice of a Hollywood agent and leaves his house in the swamp to respond to the announcement. On the way he meets a pig, a bear, chickens, a rock band and some other quality puppets. Watch for dozens of appearances such as Madaline Kahn, Steve Martian, Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks and many more. I grew up watching this movie and I loved it.
