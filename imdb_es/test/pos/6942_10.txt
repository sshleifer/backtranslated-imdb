In nineteen eighty-two, when it was announced that the Dismisal was to be held, there was a storm of controversy. This was an event that still left open wounds in the hearts and minds of Australians. After some changes (listen to the well-synchronized phones that sound to disguise names) the dismissal went on the air. It was nothing less than brilliant. The cables were perfect. Max Phipps as Gough Whitlam led the way, followed closely by John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and the evergreen John Mellion as Sir John Kerr. Time was created well, people's feelings were well done and political elements did not become two dimensions in melodrama as in so many American series. The dismissal was a faithful recreation of a time in Australia that some would prefer to forget and we can not forget. He did not take sides and pointed out the mistakes and lies of both sides. It leaves us wanting to maintain our anger and change the constitution that still allows this to happen again. The dismissal is already available on DVD in Australia. Look at it, learn from it and learn about our modern history.
