I've loved this movie since I saw it in the theater in 1991. I was 12 years old at the time and Wil Wheaton was my favorite actor and teenager in love. Now I'm 23 and I still love this movie. The best of all is that with whom I am dating, I also love it because it is a total movie of males! It's forged with enough action and chaos to keep men with the shortest attention span glued to the screen. I wish it were available on DVD!
