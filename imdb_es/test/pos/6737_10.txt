I love this movie. The cast was fantastic in the representation of its various characters. Judith Ivey did it so well by portraying a weak, fearful, dependent character who was passive and aggressive in her plaintive and involved nature, that it was a relief to see the character's metamorphosis. Blythe Danner was equally attractive in her role as a somewhat critical Jewish mother, devoted wife and loving sister. Jonathon Silmerman, Bob Dishy, ​​Stacey Glick and Lisa Walz played their roles equally well. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that relate to difficult times without losing your sense of humor and hope, you will love it. movie.
