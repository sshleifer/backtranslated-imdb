I knew almost nothing about this movie until I had the opportunity to rent it. It was a very pleasant surprise. The cast is excellent, including Matthau, who I do not normally care about. He makes a believable romantic lead. Hawn is a sweet kook and Bergman is playing like a woman coming out of her shell.
