"Shivering Shakespeare" could be considered the first classic of the talkie era "Our Gang". At this point, Hal Roach Studios began to move quickly in taking pictures to talk, and "Shakespeare" is the happy result. <br /> <br /> The Gang is appearing in a version of Quo Vadis produced by Kennedy's wife, the policeman. Children do not find fun in the game and are distracted by people in the theater and can not remember their lines. Among the funniest parts is Kennedy the Cop as the giant, who takes off makeup to fight against a man too jealous with a bull costume; and the terrible dancer (played by the daughter of director Bob McGowan). <br /> <br /> Several filmographies mention that "Shakespeare" has the first cake fight on a talkie. This may be true, since they tried different speeds with the movie during the fight. Buster Keaton's brother, Harry, is at the receiving end of one of the cakes. Very funny and one of the first gang talkies. 9 out of 10.
