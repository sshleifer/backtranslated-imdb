The first of the Italian scams of French porn box office success (although it might be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country had its first time with Cesare Canevari's IO 1968, EMMANUELLE, starring Erika Blanc) is a very good fish kettle different than the sordid aftermath provided by the deceased, Joe D'Amato, incredibly large. It is much closer in spirit to the already very past Just Jaeckin film of 1973, with an attentive look at the relationships between men and women, questioning issues as burning as fidelity and jealousy, all in a luxurious and exotic environment. Unlike D'Amato, the director Albert Thomas (also known as Adalberto Albertini, who also made it difficult to find AMANILADA EMANUELA, actually a sexed version of MADAME BUTTERFLY!) Does not introduce us to the predatory drug lords, the tobacco filmmakers or cannibals. becoming an erotic experience less sensational and much more sensational. <br /> <br /> Photojournalist Mae Jordan also known as 'Emanuelle' (the lovely Laura Gemser, born in Java, in her first lead role, after being a Thai masseuse in EMMANUELLE 2 and a 'native virgin' in the part of Just Jaeckin of the PRIVEES COLLECTIONS that are rarely seen) flies to Nairobi, where she takes the photos that accompany an article by the British writer Anne, interpreted by the very teutica Karin Schubert with a haircut that is worn Some get used to Anne shares an "open relationship" (remember when this was done) with her Italian husband Gianni (Angelo Infanti), which means that both jump to perfection with the pulse. Contrary to his later reputation, Emanuelle is positively reluctant compared to his hosts who breathe heavily, and trailed seductively to Gianni as a prelude to the exquisite and tempting reward. Well, then she compensates for this lack of debauchery at the end when she makes a whole men's hockey team on the train. It is not a joke. <br /> <br /> The production of this sexploitation classic is quite impressive, especially the excellent cinematography. And the music theme of Nico Fidenco is a solid favorite of anyone who has more than a passing interest in the genre, a fun song of Eurotrash pop (try to distinguish those letters totally meaningless and have fun all night with the family!). Throughout the film in each conceivable type of slow 'n' performance sexy disco that rotates at the hip. <br /> <br /> This is Laura Gemser's show. Announced simply as 'Emanuelle' (as was another actress of the elusive EMANUELLE NERA 2 by the same director), it illuminates the screen from beginning to end. Not yet subjected to endless rape scenarios (as it would be once D'Amato took over), she seems much more relaxed than in later films, even smiling from time to time, a rare occasion for anyone who has seen some of the work of the lady surely Eurasia knows impeccable, more than as the title of black beauty suggests (it comes from the Dutch India, now Indonesia, and in fact it is quite similar to the supposed author of the novel Emmanuelle Arsan), projects a slightly passive sensuality, even submissive, that somehow separates. of "depravity", his morally corrupted companions surrender. Unlike the French film, the moralization of the cheapskate is kept to a minimum, almost as a last-minute occurrence, when Emanuelle tells Gianni that he has not lost her like never before. I possessed it to begin with. I swear that you could hear the audience of Just Jaeckin's version moan whenever Alain Cuny, Mario, extremely annoying, appeared on the screen, as it meant that we were in the middle of too many minutes of libertine mediators who philosophized as an alibi to get to the divine Sylvia Kristel (now living in the Belgian capital of Brussels, by the way ...) to undress, the real reasons why the theaters were filled for years. Gemser's last husband, Gabriele Tinti (now deceased, has remarried), appears as the writer 'Scottish' (eh?) Who gets drunk constantly and forces himself in Emanuelle in the middle of African ruins at some point, but There is not a real sex scene. even though.
