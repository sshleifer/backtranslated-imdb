Here is another pleasant surprise. Every time I hear a movie is being remade, I shudder. Movies like Gone in Sixty Seconds, and The Day of the Jackal, are remade and the results are less than stellar. Then, when I heard that "Italian work" was being remade, I expected it to be bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews and finally watch the movie. and it was shown that he was wrong. Of course, it is not original and predictable, but it is very fun. From start to finish, they take you on a very fun ride. The scenes with the Minis are great, and the characters really have fun. <br /> <br /> So, even if there are some flaws, who cares while it's fun? <br /> <br /> In general, 8 out of 10. The only lost points are, perhaps, some details and a slight lack of realism. But you will have so much fun that you will not even have the opportunity to stop and realize it.
