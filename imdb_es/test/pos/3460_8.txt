This is definitely a movie that will make you think about the everyday problems that a person can face every day. The great performance of the two main roles exemplifies it even more, and you will not regret seeing this movie in any way. <br /> <br /> It is a moving story of two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life seen from the seat of a wheelchair. Their friendship is tested, as well as their spirits when they get their own apartment outside the nursing home. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all people who like pictures of friends or who just want to see a wonderful and moving movie. That avoids all clich√©s and pitfalls and not once is it soaked.
