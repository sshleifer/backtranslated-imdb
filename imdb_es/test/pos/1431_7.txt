But quite dated today. Otto Preminger made this film without the approval certificate that was needed then. He was enormously courageous and risky, since he could have lost his investment and his future. <br /> <br /> The film is not faithful to this wonderful book and, unfortunately, is hollywoodizada. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra (and I've never been a fan of Frankie Machine, he's amazing in his performance.) One forgets that Frank is up there, the level of realism he brings to the role of a drug addict. he is going to escape, he must be seen to believe it. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak, eternally beautiful and talented, does not disappoint the role of the outsider, always present for Frankie. <br /> <br /> The supporting roles, particularly a young, handsome and talented Darrin Mc Gavin, are impeccable. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker, playing Frankie's wife, is hopelessly inept She changes from annoying to melodramatic and is too exaggerated. performance that can not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> The cheap and staggered configurations are appalling, as if a strong gust of wind blew all the sticky cardboard painted on the horizon, almost laughable at times in its bad taste. <br /> <br /> The music was irritating, sometimes so loud. if each nuance of the script (example: when Louie is removing Frankie's arrangement from a drawer) should be underlined at a high decibel level. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10. Sinatra really deserved his Oscar nomination. Worth seeing.
