For once, a sequel to "The Karate Kid" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did an excellent job playing the orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi broke through with Julie quite different from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie favored karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most sullen person who challenged Miyagi. And there was no tournament in which to compete. And there will also be some humor in this movie. I liked the part where when Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to see how she was and saw her change clothes in the process. That was fun! And the classic "Wax on, Wax off" scene was also different. It was funny when Miyagi says to Julie, "Uh-oh, lost place." The set in Boston was very far from California. The Militant group in that group was like the "Cobra Kai" in Boston. And Colonel Dugan of Michael Ironside was not John Kreese. His group practically abandoned him when Julie kicked a serious ass. Everyone paid the price when they exploded that classic Oldsmoblie. What a cowardly act. At least they will find the redemption of Dugan's poison. This Karate Kid establishes some moral principles, unlike the last three, which spoke of "Honor" and "Respect". Hilary Swank is extraordinarily good in any movie and in everything she does. Movie 9, Hilary Swank 10!
