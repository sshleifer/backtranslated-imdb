TROMEO & JULIET - 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION <br /> <br /> The work of William Shakespeare Romeo & Juliet has been performed hundreds of times on stage and in films. Sometimes, literally, following the original text (which is sometimes vague in the instructions of the stage), sometimes in new interpretations where the directors decided to show their own opinion about the piece. Some are good, many are mediocre. Lloyd Kaufman's film undoubtedly stands out as one of the most original and modern versions of the bard's creation. It can be placed in a New York in modern decadence and full of modern anti-social behavior, body piercing, dismemberment and curly. Sex (which, for the more than casual reader, Shakespeare himself was not shying away), but at the same time remains incredibly close to the general feeling and the point of what the play is about, which is a great effort. Kaufman wrote the screenplay with his co-director in the movie James Gunn, who is now famous for writing two hit Scooby Doo movies, doing the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect movie with his script for Dawn of the Dead and direct One of the best horror films of the year: Slither. Lloyd Kaufmans' innovative vision of direction together with the original and unrestricted writing of James Gunns forms an interpretation of Shakespeare's work that perhaps not all will "catch" immediately, but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and very important vision of a classic. With a script that is written entirely in iambic meters, the appearances of Motorhead's Lemmy and a scandalous and forceful soundtrack watching Tromeo and Juliet is something that no one will ever forget. In addition to its historical importance, Tromeo & Juliet is a treasure for film lovers of all kinds. Not only because of James Gunn's script, now it's a good influence in Hollywood while working from the inside, but also because it presents an early part of the legendary actress Debbie Rochon. Well known to all who are familiar with movies that are made with lower budgets. The tenth anniversary edition on DVD adds to all this by including so many gems yet to be discovered that not only all the information one could wish on the film itself and the experience of doing it is presented in a way that makes it impossible to turn it off. The DVD, but also a very honest (and disturbing) look is given to the ways in which independent cinema has to survive these days. In many ways, the extras on the record are a valuable addition to the already impressive amount given at Kaufman's film school "Make your own damn movie." Historical articles by Furtermore are included in Troma's vaults, including James Gunn, Debbie Rochon and all the other collaborators of this masterpiece, and the film itself is, in addition to looking better than ever, accompanied by four audio-comments, Each and every Informational, extremely funny and all done for a serious addition to the movie instead of the boring and pointless comments that are so common these days. There are new comments (one with Kaufman and Gunn together), but also the one that James Gunn made for the original release of the DVD, but could not be included there for some honesty that shows about other people present on this record. With the recreations of fans of some of the scenes in the film, a video diary of Lloyd Kaufman's visit to the James Gunn's Slither game and a visit to the two reunited at Eli Roth's Hostel's birthday party and much more This is the definitive game. everyone must own Weather you are a film historian, someone interested in the interpretations of the great work of Bard, big movie fan, independent film fighter, James Gunn fan, interested in learning more about how to make movies with little budget, Lloyd Kaufman fanatic or whatever: this is the most important DVD release of this millennium!
