And so was born the most loving skunk that has honored the silver screen. While the plot has a battered cat who paints himself as a skunk and inadvertently attracts Pepe Le Pew (called Henry here), Pepe certainly steals the show. Undoubtedly, Chuck Jones realized that this member of the Mephitis genre, who seeks love, had that special something necessary to be a star in his own right, so he launched Pepe in "For aromatic reasons" four years later, firmly establishing the enduring power of PLP. presence on screens everywhere. <br /> <br /> Then, while "Odor-Able Kitty" can be a placeholder in another way, I try to imagine seeing it for the first time in 1945. Could anyone have guessed that this support? Would the character soon join the ranks of Bugs, Daffy, Porky and the rest? Whether someone did it or not, Pepe is still one of the most pleasant characters to this day. C'est l'amour!
