It is possible to have a good time with this movie and, at the same time, regret everything that is not. In the 1980s, an ingenious US congressman UU (Tom Hanks) supports Afghan partisans who resist the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Hanks is in a windy state, from hail buddies well known as rogue, politically incorrect, Charlie Wilson, is first glimpsed sharing a hot tub with three deeply-looking women available. If only the movie had the same air of unconcern; but apart from Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn as a cynical agent of the CIA, he also tries to be perceived as a patriot. The Staccato dialogue by Aaron Sorkin serves its purpose, but the story is no more plausible than one of Wilson's stories. And there is a strangely tacit subtext: Wilson's Afghan friends later transformed into the Taliban and other anti-Western groups, leaving the world in a worse situation than when these events occurred.
