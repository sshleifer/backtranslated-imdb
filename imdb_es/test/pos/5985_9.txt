This movie is a jewel! It's the story of Juliette, a perfectly normal cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company, and Romuald, the president of it. He does not pay attention, does not pay attention to anyone until several plots to snatch his company at the opposite, at the same time. He is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers Juliette. Like the cleaning woman, no one pays attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that is smart enough to catch and use to help her helpless and hapless boss. <br /> <br /> I have been watching this DVD for years and to see a previous comment about its release in September 2007, I increased my hopes. Unfortunately, I can not find a DVD. Does anyone know if there is one?
