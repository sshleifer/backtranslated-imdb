I was expecting a good movie. What I got was an even better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is simply amazing. I'm glad to see you in a great movie for once! <br /> <br /> The movie works, because the actors perfectly interpret their role. Will Smith is fantastic with his endless charm; Kevin James is very funny, and Eva Mendes ... well, let's say she plays that bitch / sweet / annoying role as best she can. <br /> <br /> What I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith did not even have to try to be nice. Just was !! The "appointment with the doctor" had all the right movements, said everything in the most perfect way, and never reached the top. <br /> <br /> The fun parts are fun ... and the cute and romantic parts are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie. And no, it's not a movie for girls.
