This is the fourth feature film by Marc Recha. For the third 'Les Mans Buides', empty hands, I promised myself not to cut my veins again. But this time, the plot is completely different, a kind of tribute to Ramon Barnils (Sabadell 1940 - Reus 2001) a Catalan journalist. The images in the trailer are impressive, a sparkling river bathed in sunlight, and the promise that Marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother, neither of the two professional actors, convinced me at last, six weeks after its launch. Get carried away by this unusual road / river movie. Do not learn almost anything about Ramon Barnils, but his most moving legacy: his constant struggle against the amnesia of what the Catalans decided to forget. 'The battle of l'Ebre', the battle of Ebro in wikipedia, was lost not once, but twice because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of half-baked democracy, no one has done much to remember the legitimate side of The Spanish Civil War and those who fought it. This film is about the lonely people who travel the same places with very little awareness of what happened there 70 years ago. This movie is about the landscape.
