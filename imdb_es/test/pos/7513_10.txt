Patty Chayevsky was ahead of most of the writers of scripts and most successful dramas when dealing with complicated issues. In this film of 1971, he followed Sinclair Lewis and A. J. Cronin (respectively, ARROWSMITH and THE CITADEL) in a critical look at the world of medicine, although his objective focuses on a special scenario: a modern hospital in Manhattan. Chayevsky's point of view is quite direct: they are places in the hospital for people to recover, or they are organizations that generate money where people die frequently due to incompetence. <br /> <br /> As a person who has recently been in a hospital too many times (and in a short time I will have to return) I find that THE HOSPITAL is a very timely and rewarding satire. George C. Scott is Dr. Block, one of the heads of the Manhattan Surgical Center, a major teaching hospital. He has just started his day when he is told that one of the second-year residents died during the night in apparent confusion. It seems that he was sedated and drugged while sleeping in a bed (he had been having an appointment with a nurse), and someone manipulated an i.v. that he should have contained water with glucose (later, it turns out he received an overdose of insulin in the IV) Soon, Scott discovers that every time he turns around, some other staff member dies of a heart attack or an operation failed The key to all this seems to be a patient who came to the hospital ten days earlier for a regular check-up, and since he lost a kidney, almost lost his other kidney and is now in a coma (Barnard Hughes). <br /> <br /> Hughes' daughter (Diana Rigg) wants to take the comatose dad home to an Apache Indian reservation in Mexico. Scott is not totally opposed to the idea: after all, the hospital's mistakes almost kill Hughes. In addition, Scott is suffering a mid-life crisis with the collapse of his marriage and family, and his growing doubts about what his chosen profession really achieves. It is not just a case like Hughes'. The hospital is in a constant state of chaos in which the regular staff (Scott, Stephen Elliot, Nancy Marchand, Stockard Channing) is overworked and at war with business personnel (typified by Frances Steenhagen in a really cold). The local community is hostile because of the hospital's expansion plans, but when they meet to "discuss" issues with Elliot, they turn out to be so divisive (Black Panthers vs. local clergy versus birth control seeking women and a pro-HIV clinic). abortion). types). Rigg (who falls in love with Scott over the course of the film) becomes increasingly sure that leaving the city's madness makes sense, and Scott also plays with the idea. <br /> <br /> Scott was in his Acting High in this movie, with ANATOMY OF A MURDERER, THE HUSTLER, DR. STRANGELOVE, and PATTON under his belt before the HOSPITAL was made. Her anguish was recorded when he and Rigg met (she prevents him from killing himself because of his desperation). You can not know if anything is worthwhile in the hospital and shout out the words in the "Summary Line". Although he later relaxes a little about how good his teaching has been for the doctors who study with him, Scott really is never completely sure of all this; however, he fully accepts his own sense of responsibility that others simply abandon. Rigg was also at the height of her international fame (if it was not her acting ability): her passage as Mrs. Peel in THE AVENGERS was a few years old, but at that time she was also recognized as one of the leading stage talents in Great Brittany. As one of the sexiest artists of the time. <br /> <br /> Secondary actors are also good. In addition to the spooky Steenhagen (which requires information from Medicare / Medicaid / patient insurance in a coma in the E.R.), there is Hughes as a religious maniac who wins, and Elliot as the hospital's boss. There's also my favorite cartoon: Richard Dysart as Dr. Elwell. Elwell is a butcher who has found a real home for himself in the Big Board of the Stock Exchange, having incorporated as a tax incentive. Anyone who remembers their actions as ethical types, such as the head of the law firm at LALAW or as Melvin Douglas' friend and physician at ESTAR THERE, upon seeing his greedy doctor Elwell, saw another facet of the talents of this underrated actor. .
