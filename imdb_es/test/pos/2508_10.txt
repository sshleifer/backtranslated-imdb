Director Peter Chan, Screenplay Maria Maggenti. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel "The love letter" by Cathleen Schine, the film version of director Peter Chan, released in 1999, was not a big box office draw, not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements. While it was not as popular in theaters, it soon became a beloved movie on cable television and VHS / DVD. Located in a port city in the old EE UU (I forget the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious love letter written passionately that arouses emotions and confusion among the main characters, each one who thinks that the letter is personally addressed to them. . At the end of the film, we do not know who is the lover or the beloved, but the power of the letter has altered the lives of almost everyone in the small town. The cast is made up of wonderful actors who have had good results in television and film, including Kate Capshaw in the leading role of middle-aged beauty Helen, owner of a bookstore, comedian Ellen DeGeneres as her friend / employee Janet Hall , young hottie Tom Everett Scott as Johnny, the 20 year old who falls in love with Hellen, and Tom Selleck, the firefighter George Matthias, who must compete with Johnny for Helen's affections. There are cameo roles from veteran and former Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, who is best known to the modern public as the elderly Rose in "Titanic" (1997) and a cameo from the daughter of Kate Capshaw (with her husband Steven Spielberg) Jessica Capshaw The love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an older man and a young man, each of whom feels as passionately about Helen as the writer of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Will you choose the right person? What man has more to offer him? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl of his age who loves him with a passion of his own and, in fact, is a kind of reminder of how Helen was at his age. George is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a worldly and eventful life. A cultured intellect, he takes Helen to an opera appointment, where the tragic death of Puccini's ultra-Italian heroine, Tosca, makes Helen win explosive tears. There are lots of beautiful views of the charming seaside town, beautifully played by the cinematographer Tami Reiker. The score is a haven of romantic and charming songs: "I've never been in love before", "I'm in the mood to love" and "Only the loner". Ellen DeGeneres as Janet Hall, who is always late for her work in Helen's bookstore, who always dates men without being able to find the right man, is simply wonderful. She has not lost her comedic talent, although at this point in her career she did not appear much on television or in the film because only about two years before her successful mid-90s television series "Ellen" was canceled due to his "exit". As a lesbian and the new lesbian theme of the show. Here you even find comedian Jack Black, long before he became big, on the part of a fisherman. This is a moving film about human emotions and decision making that are important, about the human need for a passionate love and consumer and the widespread love for escapism that is obtained not only through books, lyrics and music, but also through a truly loving and safe relationship. This is a great movie with wonderful moments and an infectious romantic spirit.
