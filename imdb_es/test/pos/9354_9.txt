Exceptional film that manages a theme of great proportions with a very balanced direction. Dmytrik was a very good director, at least from what I can say about this film and Murder my Sweet, but HUAC seriously affected him like other directors and actors in films. In a way, it's ironic that Crossfire has not received an Oscar, because it's an exquisite example of how to make a great movie on a budget. Everything about this film is exceptional: a well written script that makes use of extensive flashbacks, a great cast, an excellent lighting that seems to tell the story more than the actions themselves. What else can you expect from a first-rate movie? I should add that noir is used here because of its style and could add financial advantages. But this proves once again that what was originally considered a B movie can have more impact today than most heavy A-movies that lost their audience over time. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a black movie per se and this raises serious questions about what it really is to noir. The style is definitely noir, in terms of sets and especially of lights, but the theme exceeds the recipe of "genre noir". You can see things from the opposite perspective and affirm that anti-Semitism is only a pretext for criminal investigation, and the enigma around murder is the real focus. This would have been the case had it not been for Robert Ryan in an outstanding performance. Either way, the film has a lot to offer and it is a real pity that the director had to suffer so much iniquity for his previous beliefs in a truly "noir" period of the United States.
