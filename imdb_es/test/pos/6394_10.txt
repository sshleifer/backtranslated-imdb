This show is excellent for many reasons ... The father and mother can communicate with their children this day in age. It is so good to see a real family instead of a family with excess activity. I saw it once and I was hooked. It is great to see a black family on television that is worth seeing. This program left too early, but in his departure he dealt with pregnancy, sex, drugs, bad dating, death, etc. The best thing about the program was that he approached it in a really humorous way. Great show for the family ... I can not tell you how many times I've sat down, I watched this show late at night sometimes and I started laughing. Great pg 13 rated show.I loved every bit of this show.
