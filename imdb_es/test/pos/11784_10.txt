Nothing is sacred. Just ask Ernie Fosselio. These days, everyone has a video camera and almost no film is released before the fakes begin to fly, are written and recorded quickly and are often published directly on the Internet. The deceptions are hot these days, and we strive to make sure that the filmmakers do not get away with their own importance. 25 years ago, when the first Star Wars was made, it was a different world. Making movies was the playground of a select few and parodies were very rare. Then God gave us Hardware Wars. It was filmed to look cheap (or was it simply cheap?) And the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. Does that take away the experience? HELL NO! That's what makes it so great! It was raw and unpolished, and it struck implacably in some of the most pretentious moments of the original film. From Fluke Starbucker waving a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (I did it when I was young!) Up to Chewchilla the Wookie Monster, to the comment of "No, just a little headache" by Auggie Ben Doggie. The phenomenon like any of the real Star Wars movies. Rent it Buy it. Borrow it from a friend And that the Farce is with you. Forever.
