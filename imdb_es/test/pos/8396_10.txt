My mother is what Gone With The Wind can be. She has the collector's plates, the Rhett and Scarlett Madame Alexander dolls, the GWTW Christmas decorations, even a GWTW cookbook! My sister and I had only seen fragments of GWTW but we knew the whole plot by heart. On a whim, my sister bought this miniseries thinking that my mother would like and we were interested in her after a little leaf through the novel. <br /> <br /> Yesterday we decided to see Gone With The Wind and Scarlett. We start GWTW at approximately 2:30 in the afternoon and finish at 6:30. We started with Scarlett right after. Usually, my mother goes to bed at 10:00, ended up staying until 1:30 with us to finish it! We were fascinated! I like how the movie starts at Melanie's funeral, where Scarlett stopped saying "I'll think about it tomorrow." Scarlett does not stay in Georgia for long, she escapes to Charleston in her quest to retrieve it. Rhett is not happy when he finds Scarlett at home, so he goes to the family plantation. Scarlett, being Scarlett, follows him and finally agrees to put aside her fights for a while to keep gossip at bay. Rhett begins to enjoy his company again and takes it out in his boat. A storm rises and sink. He helps her swim on the shore of an island. Terrified that she is dead, Rhett is anxious until she wakes up. When she does, both are dragged for the moment and make love. Scarlett wakes up the next day in Charleston, but Rhett has gone and writes that he thinks it's better that they never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Scarlett is heartbroken and, when she is, she does some stupid things. In this case, Anne Hampton sees her climb into a hotel room alone with Ashley. Nothing happens, but his reputation is tainted, so Scarlett goes to Savannah with her two spinster aunts. She soon discovers that she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right moment to tell Rhett. While in Savannah, he meets many of O'Hara's relatives and grows up until he likes a particular cousin, a Father Colum. She soon receives Rhett's divorce notice and then decides that she will never tell her about her baby just to annoy him. Typical Scarlett. <br /> <br /> He decides to go to Ireland to make sure that Rhett can never discover his condition. Meet many more relatives and buy a beautiful ancestral home in Ballyhara. Throughout this time, Rhett is courting Anne. It is on Halloween when Scarlett receives the notice that Rhett has remarried, she goes to labor that night. <br /> <br /> The movie jumps a year later and Scarlett is very happy with her beautiful daughter Kat. She is being chased by Lord Richard Fenton, who is really an evil man, forcing a young woman named Mary Boyle to sleep with him. Scarlett meets Rhett and Anne again at a horse fair. After a riding accident, Scarlett talks to Anne and learns that she and Rhett are going to have a baby. With a broken heart again, Scarlett leaves and goes to Dublin with Fenton. There he cultivates a relationship with him, as I said, he does stupid things when his heart is broken. <br /> <br /> Mary Boyle discovered that she is pregnant and goes to Colum for help. The priest urges Fenton to help the girl and Fenton murders him after Colum threatens to tell Scarlett. Fenton convinces Scarlett to go to London with him to escape his grief over Colum's death. Maria asks him to accompany her. Back in Charleston, Anne has died of yellow fever. It is clear that he never gave Rhett a son. <br /> <br /> In London, Scarlett sees the true colors of Fenton when he hurts her when she is not in the mood to sleep with him. Fenton rapes her after she tells him she never wants to see him again. She falls unconscious after when she wakes up, Fenton has been stabbed to death. Scarlett is accused of his murder. <br /> <br /> Rhett finds out about this and goes to England with Sally in tow. Fearful of the gallows, Scarlett has no choice but to tell Rhett about her daughter. Rhett is furious with her for keeping that secret, but he stays to help her. Mary Boyle, the real murderer, can not be found. Scarlett is found guilty, but Mary finally arrives to declare her innocence. After promising to help Mary, Scarlett goes with Rhett to Ireland because, as he says, "it's time for me to meet my daughter". The scene in which he sees Kat for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, Rhett sees how much Scarlett has changed and the two finally reconcile completely and admit that they still love each other deeply. <br /> <br /> After seeing GWTW, I'll say yes, Vivian Leigh was a better Scarlett. But I liked the character of Scarlett in this movie that in the first. The reason is that in GWTW, you do not know why you like Scarlett. He is so cruel to Rhett and haughty and spoiled, but you like his vivacious spirit. In Scarlett, you see how much has changed. Oh, she's still in the lap of luxury, but she's not haughty anymore. You see how she becomes a real mother to Kat and a generous person to the poor of Ireland. Joanne Whalley does an excellent job on this new side of Scarlett. Timothy Dalton is not Clark Gable, but sometimes you swear you can see Rhett original in him. <br /> <br /> If you sit down and do not compare Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton with Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, you will definitely enjoy this movie. It is an opportunity to compare yesterday's Scarlett, which becomes after "tomorrow".
