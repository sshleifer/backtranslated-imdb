I just started watching this show. It is being broadcast in Ireland at this time on the Irish television station RTE1 at 12.30 p.m. in the afternoon (as of July 26, 2006). <br /> <br /> This program literally makes me laugh out loud and I can not boast about that in most. Today's episode of TKoQ (July 26, 2006) was that of Carrie who starts a new job, invites to his friends to his house and he leaves. to make some coffee and Doug wants Carrie not to have friends 'out', so he gets up the top and shows his 'belly hair'. And lick the dishes when he goes out to dinner! But another funny episode was the other week when the old friend (takes dad) won at Bingo and that episode made me laugh, especially when they went out and bought a replacement refrigerator and Carries' father stood there looking at him and thought it was new. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I do not know how long this has to work on Irish television or at what stage (registered year) we are, but I hope it does not end soon because I am really enjoying it. <br /> <br /> In summary, there are some great writings, some great characters and comedies (namely, by Carrie, Doug and Carries Sr.), some great punches and they delivered well, a little spicy and close to the Mark a Sometimes (send the children to the room!) but I think this Sitcom from the USA. UU She is a winner and very funny.
