The problem with other actors chosen in the role of Dorian Gray is that they seemed too old for the part (Hurd Hatfield, Helmut Berger, Josh Duhamel, David Gallagher, Ben Barnes) or that they could not achieve the English aristocratic form without being stripped. Dorian is the perpetual 19-year-old (more or less), all milky skin and strands of honey, as described by Wilde, so the challenge is to find an actor who has the maturity and rank for the part (ie , who can portray). Naivety, insensitivity and manipulative ability), but at the same time it looks like someone in his teens. And Peter Firth brings it all out in this excellent adaptation of British television. <br /> <br /> Gielgud as Henry Wotton, though considerably older than Wilde had in mind, does wonders with his scenes: Wilde's aphorisms have never sounded so Natural and unforced. Especially, George Sanders in the 1945 version was quite weak in comparison (and his suit did not suit him). <br /> <br /> Finally, Jeremy Bratt plays Basil as the most masculine and at the same time the gayest in the world. Trio, again an adequate interpretation. In general, the film includes enough gay subtext without becoming the same Dorian: it is all for all people and, supposedly, there is no drugs or sexual perversion that has not proven in the 18 years covered by the story, but that makes it more narcistic . that the homosexual It seems that it also wreaks havoc on both sexes here, as it should according to the novel. <br /> <br /> Of course, the budget for this production was not very large, so everything seems a bit tiered. Particularly Dorian's encounter with Sybil's brother suffers from the obvious aspect of study. Also, the final shot of Dorian (a puppet, I suppose) in his white toad makeup is more hilarious than convincing and the scene of Basil's death is inadvertently funny. (Also, as far as I remember, Basil should have been murdered sitting at the table). <br /> <br /> But in general, this is a very valuable adaptation. I'm sure Wilde would have liked it. The only thing missing is the sensual side. Not so much the sex scenes, but Wilde's decadent world of aromatic flowers, luxurious fabrics and precious gems is not really explored here, that is, aestheticism is completely lost. But like "I, Claudius", the excellent performance makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values.
