I feel that this movie is different from many others in that it shows a family of girls who really care about each other. They may have flaws, but bitterness and contempt have no place with these girls. Try to find that on TV or in the usual movies. It is a breath of fresh air to see the girls being feminine, wearing beautiful dresses and feminine shoes. Contrast that with clothes in today's stores, that is, worn and faded jeans and jackets, etc. The story line has an evil thread, but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting. I know you're encouraged, but you still get the feeling that families can stay together and get it right. I would recommend this movie for boys and girls alike.
