IMAGINARY HEROES is a good little movie. This story, written and directed by Dan Harris, is classic theater, weaving comedy and tragedy with such force that the climax of the film leaves you breathless. <br /> <br /> The Travis family is a strange group: no member is who. each one seems to be. Beginning with a suicide of the reluctant "hero" child swimming champion Matt (Kip Pardue), Father Ben (Jeff Daniels) falls apart and isolates himself and his family, while mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) turns crazy and furious and sarcasm, daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) returns from school rejected by the behavior of her family, and the remaining son Tim (Emile Hirsch) takes the brunt of all the above by avoiding his classmates , girlfriend and teams with her neighbor Kyle (Ryan Donowho) to jump to drugs and sexual experimentation. Throughout the film, Tim tries to hide bruises on his body that have a secret of their own, but they lead his girlfriend to feel rejection, to his mother to rage against the trailer park that she believes is the cause, and finally open the window to the depths. Scars that this family has suffered for years. Secrets and lies, here, and the resolution of them is painfully dramatic. <br /> <br /> This may be the best role of Sigourney Weaver, although Emile Hirsh, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donowho and Kip Pardue (despite the brevity of their role) all contribute to a top-notch performance. The story begins slowly and seems to wander and that fact may lose the attention of some viewers, but stay with this small and powerful film and the impact of the work will surprise you. Highly recommended Harp grady
