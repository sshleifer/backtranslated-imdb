Ten years before "The Matrix" and the cures of "They Live", came this brilliant piece of low-budget science fiction film. If you like the strange, the unconventional, the intellectually challenging, David Lynch finds himself creating movies in the style of John Carpenter that you will love "Split". There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography. Look closely at a sequence taken through wine glasses at an art opening party and just after that a scene involving reference cards. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society and wants to wake us up from sleep. Similar to "They Live", "1984" and "The Matrix", is based on the premise that we are all constantly watched by government agents of the Big Brother type who know everything about us and have invisible probes of robots that constantly patrol the city. All this was revealed quite early in the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will awaken everyone from the illusion of reality. Along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways in which the director complies with his reduced budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues. I challenge anyone not to go back, memorize and quote the classic quotes of this film in the coming years.
