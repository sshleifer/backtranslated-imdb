Let's clarify one thing, this is 7 out of 10, not on a normal scale, but out of the bad scale of the film. This is the kind of movie you rent on purpose, in which you intentionally enter knowing that it is a horrendous imitation and rejected by everyone else. <br /> <br /> I came in with a promise from the movie, that there will be snakes on a train, and it is delivered! <br /> <br /> The gore itself is really good, and the characters have amazing roles. Come on, he has everything from pilots on drugged trains to teen teenagers who traffic drugs, even an electrical engineer who is making his pimp! You can see some topless nudity, explosions, snakes, gore and a Mexican main track running around curing his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke on his face! As I mentioned and many others have done, the pace of the film is a bit outdated, but nonetheless respectable. <br /> <br /> Films like this keep our group tradition of joining bands and all one or two coins to see masterpieces like this one. There can not be better time to get together and enjoy a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> I could learn one or two things from other fine movies like Alien Lock-down or Boa vs. Python, but those are some great shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> A solid 7 out of 10.
