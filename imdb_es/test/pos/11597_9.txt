If you go to the cinema to entertain yourself, to entertain yourself, to fill your time, do not make an effort to see this movie. <br /> <br /> If you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths. From human beings, the feelings of real people, to explore the character of personalities, if you go to the movies to absorb the magnificent picture, make sure you put this film very high on your list, preferably in the first place. The experience is deeply rewarding, which makes the intelligent viewer make various reflections on the meaning of life itself. With 'Mar Adentro', Alejandro Amenábar has overcome the best he has done to date, and has even traded certain deviations in his previous films, which were inclined a bit to point to Hollywood. This is not the case with this visual poem put into music: Hollywood could never approach the effect of this human and human story of tingling inspiration. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should 'Mar Adentro' be interpreted as an apology for euthanasia; This story, based on the real life of the Galician fisherman Ramón Sampedro, is a cry from the bottom of the heart for life and love, an approach to human compassion, to the understanding of emotions. Sampedro was an articulate and intelligent man who, after a diving accident on the rocks of the Galician coast when he was young, was condemned to live the next 27 years in bed. 'Condemned to live' (2001) (TV) was the first version of the life of this man that I have already commented. However, Amenábar has had great success in representing this man, with his permanent enigmatic smile and witty sense of humor, in an equally articulate and intelligent way. <br /> <br /> And Javier Bardem was up to the occasion, he faced the challenge. -In, complete with a Galician accent, producing an electrifying performance, fascinating and fascinating, in such a way that the actor and the fisherman merge to be the same person on the screen. Here, in fact, it is an occasion to take off your cap and whisper softly 'chapeau'. Bardem is driven in his task by a magnificent cast, especially Belén Rueda, Lola Dueñas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (Mondays to the Sun) and Clara Segura, highlighting the Galician and Catalan accents. <br /> <br /> Amenábar produces wonderful dialogues when these six are rotated among them, one by one, or in groups, with excellent chemistry, which shows that this young Spanish director born in Chile is an artist who knows what is. in and how to get your results; his overall concept of the film includes his own music, interspersed with pieces by Beethoven and Puccini on Sampedro's turntable. <br /> <br /> While watching 'Mar Adentro', I met a couple of times comparing it with this movie with Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece 'The Hours' (qv). I refer to the way the dialogues work with tension and passion and the careful sense of synchronization in each scene. <br /> <br /> Javier Aguirresarobe's photography is excellent as always. As I mentioned elsewhere in IMDb, it not only films events and scenes, but captures even the feelings and atmosphere of the moment, skillfully catches that look in the eyes, light and shadows, so that your work behind the camera is at the same time another player in history. An excellent artist <br /> <br /> 'Mar Adentro' is another milestone in the history of Spanish cinematography, among the best five or six works of art produced here in the last 25 years. This film is placed next to cinematographic art like 'The South', 'The Innocent Saints' (qv),' The Grandfather ',' The Language of the Butterflies' (qv), 'The Rats' (qv),' To The That Loves' (qv), and I think I should add 'I Give You My Eyes' (qv). <br /> <br /> Superbly orchestrated story of a real man, and of those who loved him around his bed: can not be lost.
