Unlike some of the previous commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Accept it, Christmas would never be Christmas without the carpenters. Having said that, I think the film did a good job, not excellent, in representing Karen's life. The movie was nice to watch at prime time, but the content was a bit short. I suggest everyone look for some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70s. You can not believe how amazing a Karen battery was. Cynthia did not grasp the extent of Karen's talent. Also, Karen was beautiful but she had a bad hairdresser. My choice to play Karen is Hilary Swank. I would love to see a more important story, because Karen had more than meets the eye when we heard A We Only Just Begun. I have tons of unreleased Carpenters music, and it's absolutely excellent. (His California Dreamin song is to die for).
