This historical film can now be seen in two different versions at the launch of Grapevine Video, which also includes the English translation of Selma Lagerlof's novel, based on a Swedish story. The first version is the Swedish edition under the title of THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. The second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the United States under the title of THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT as published by Metro (before it was M-G-M). The actual release in the United States has long since disappeared, but a detailed review in The New York Times lets us know how the scenes were reordered for the national release, and both are fascinating to watch. Each version of this film was presented at The Organ Loft in Salt Lake City with live scores of the theatrical organ provided by artist Blaine Gale. A live recording of these performances was made and included in the Grapevine Video DVD along with the novel and notes on the two versions. While THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE follows the order of Lagerlof's novel, THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT is somewhat easier to follow. See the two different editions is a way to learn how you can change the silent films effectively for launch in different countries. <br /> <br /> Some viewers see this movie as a horror movie that certainly is not. This is a game of morality with nuances of the supernatural used to hit your message. The leadership and performance of the leader Victor Sjostrom were far ahead of their time. It's easy to see why M-G-M took him to Hollywood to direct films such as Lillian Gish in THE SCARLET LETTER and THE WIND, as well as Lon Chaney in HE WHO GETS SLAPPED. In America he was known as Victor Seastrom. He would also star in the main role of WILD STRAWBERRIES by Ingmar Bergman, giving a masterful performance. Bergman was very influenced by KORKARLEN or THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE in his early days. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful movie that is worth taking a while to discover and study. The launch of Grapevine Video is an excellent way to do this.
