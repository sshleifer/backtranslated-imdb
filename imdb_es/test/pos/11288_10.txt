I want to preface this review by saying that I have no idea what "Begotten" really is about. All I really know is that in the beginning God kills himself, in turn, by giving birth to Mother Earth, who proceeds to impregnate himself with the semen of God. She then gives birth to a son. The rest is quite subjective, and you have to interpret it your way. <br /> <br /> How I chose to interpret the movie was this; The fact that God killed himself meant the beginning of the scientific revolution, when people began to question the doctrines imposed by the church, such as the geocentric vision of the universe and so on. Because God says so. The tribal people were the church that attacked them, trying to force Christianity to swallow their throats. I'm not exactly sure how the Son of Earth fits into all this. Mother Earth and tribal people seemed to be fighting for him, so maybe he represents the freedom of people or something similar. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the final parts of this film are supposed to mean. . Aggressing, raping, then dismembering Mother Earth and the Earth Son and grinding them on the ground like a mortar could mean anything, but that's where the fun of this movie lies; You can interpret it however you want. There does not have to be a definitive meaning, you can let your mind wander. Sometimes you do not even know what you're supposed to see because it's filmed at a strange angle or it's too blurry. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed me was that I expected a truly terrifying movie. I was thinking that I would receive a call immediately after with a "seven day" notice. What I got was pleasantly different. It was not terrifying at all, but it stirred my imagination. Trying to decipher the cryptic message of the film was a creative challenge. There were many scenes that were beautiful in fact. Mother Earth, just after birth and the last take of the forest path, comes to mind. <br /> <br /> So, in general, I must say that I really enjoyed this movie. It's certainly the most abstract film I've seen, but that's not a bad thing.
