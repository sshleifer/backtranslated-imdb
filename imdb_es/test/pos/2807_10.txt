I played with Sam (the goalie, Lou's partner) in the movie "Dead Rail", which was then broadcasted as "Alien Express". And, I have to say that, for my part, I really enjoyed watching this movie. As an actor with difficulties, this was an opportunity for me to work with fantastic people, he gave me great scenes to include in my work and allowed me to work in a dream job for a month and a half (without waiting tables!) Turi ( the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) were very kind to give me this opportunity to participate in the production. I made many friends (Lou, Todd, Steven) and I consider myself very fortunate to have been able to work with these incredibly talented people. There was not a day that would happen so I would not laugh. The real tragedy is not so much the special effects, is that each person who saw this movie could not see what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that really had it. The artisans build the set, the masters of props, the adepts, the costumes, the make-up artists, the scriptwriters, the cinematographer, the production assistants, the extras, the craft services, the producers, the director and the actors. It's a fact that science fiction did not spend a terrible amount of money on the movie (2 million) But there was a lot of time, energy and human power that was instilled in it. I look at the film now as a production that brought together many talented people for a fun project that was filmed without complications in less than two months. It was a great cast and crew and I am very happy to be a part of this! In an additional note for those of you who do not know Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges and Steven Brand. They are fantastic people who are incredibly fun. Lou, I'm still working on my impression of Deniro and I can not thank you enough for introducing me to "Midnight Run." Todd, every time I hear a song by Elvis I can not forget the story you told me about hanging out with him at his house for dinner. "Can you pass me the pa tator?" (IM A GREAT ELVIS FAN!) Steven, "Mr. Brand!" You are a true gentleman and all the advice and encouragement that I received from you will always be appreciated. I miss you guys and I hope you are well. Thanks for the good memories, stories, jokes and friendship. Oh, and Miss Utah says hello! wink wink <br /> <br /> joe-
