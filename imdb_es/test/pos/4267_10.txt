I see tons of movies and had no idea that this would be as good as it was. I looked forward to it after reading the plot (although it seems to me that Nirvana is overrated). It seemed like a lot of fun, but it was more than that. Jansen gives small details such as books (Kubrick's book, among others), movie posters, etc. I like it when I see a director take his time and put his heart in a movie. And you can really feel that in this. There are a lot of scenes and moments that I love, I try to think now about other movies that are like that and I would say that the only thing I can think about are the films of Cameron Crowe. Take small moments and make them stand out and specials. The soundtrack is amazing and each song works perfectly with the scenes and the feel of the movie. This movie is amazingly shot, and the editing is exceptional. I could really go on and on about the movie. I really can not recommend this enough. If you want a funny story with excellent melodies from a director who clearly puts his heart into his work, then check this out.
