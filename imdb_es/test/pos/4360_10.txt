Wow.this is a touching story! First I saw "Rescue Dawn". I did not like". And now I have seen the person, Dieter Dengler, about whom Herzog tells this story. Very impressive. Dieter is a driven human being who found the most opposite emotions in his life on this earth. What extraordinary life does this person have? LED His account of the capture by Patet Lao / Vietcong and, therefore, his suffering is horrific, but what is most impressive is his incredible will to survive. How could I find the strength? In a disturbing way, Dieter is telling us in complete sentences about his terrible experience during his captivity ... he is a great storyteller and Herzog does the justice that this brave man deserves. <br /> <br /> In my opinion. 'Little Dieter needs to fly' says it all! Without leaving anything to the imagination, making 'Rescue dawn' a superfluous movie. The horror does not become more real than in the words of Dieter Dengler himself. Totally manages to paint the painting.
