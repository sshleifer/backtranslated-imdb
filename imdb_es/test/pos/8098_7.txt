Being a big fan of Charlie Chaplin after seeing the good vibes after seeing first 'The Gold Rush' and then 'City Lights', I was eager to see 'The Great Dictator', as I had been told that this was, without a doubt, your best movie I was also intrigued by the fact that it was a talkie; My first, Chaplin-wise. <br /> <br /> The onset is typical of Chaplin and a blatant test that, when it comes to sound, the Chaplain can cut it off without relying solely on music to set the mood and talk. It is fun, it is well synchronized and the elements of the slapstick, like falling off an anti-aircraft weapon, are well related to the jokes. It was good to attract the viewer with this opening of 'classic Chaplin' and, at the same time, start the narrative of characters that know each other. What was also done well was the way in which Hitler is deceived. Any scene involving Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this film was fun and even now; It makes you remember how you know exactly who is cheating and creates an internal reaction of some kind. The way in which English is mixed with the German simulacrum during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way in which Chaplin managed to adapt to the era of the talkie. My favorite joke was Hynkel's five-minute speech, only for the English translator to translate it into a few words; making you remember the images of Hitler, perhaps you have seen a speech at some point in your life and, certainly, laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Historically, the movie also hit on some things. Hynkel is seen photographed with children; something Hitler did for recognition while manipulating the media, but here, Hynkel is seen yawning and acting bored; stabbing Hitler's technique of winning over the German public through sympathy (Oh, he hugs and kisses children, he must be fine!). The film is also given a fantastic premise of a Jewish civilian who returns to settle in the ghetto among all the farces that are taking place, but with the trap that he is alien. Movies like 'The Pianist' and 'Come and See' are two good examples of Nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people that today, we can all look back and shake our heads, while in the late 1930s When this was filmed, the fact that he had the cruelty and exploited it makes it an even more amazing achievement. Chaplin managed to replace guns and truncheons with tomatoes and casseroles and still succeeds. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the movie was the fact that it adapted to a real narrative after the opening. . This slowed down the film and this is very noticeable since the foot was removed from the gas a bit. The movie began to hint stories and sub-stories. These included the barber and the neighbor who fell in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace, while none of them was really developed. The 'giving a shave to a woman' and the 'whoever has the coin in his pudding makes the action gags' alluding to these plots of the plot, but in the end, they only materialized in excuses for the strange and carefree gags, what which was disappointing. <br /> <br /> During the final stretch, The Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact that it was introduced to the Italian dictator who adds some much needed life and an excuse for comedy to the film. It works like a treat when we see them arguing and exploiting more clandestine tactics when Hynkel tries to "dominate" his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (although they are frustrated with humor). Despite some weaknesses in the rhythm during the middle segment and the fact that I felt that the message at the end was a little forced in my throat, The Great Dictator waits to see it today, but that is only because it risked exploiting things that nobody more really I knew they were there.
