For me this is a good series. I'm a little disappointed that Ana Lucia and Libby died, but more annoyed that Micheal lied to everyone about who killed them. And if someone can answer this question, what were the names of the supposedly "Henry Gale" guys? He was like the leader of the others (or was that Miss Clue?) If you know that his name is great. Well, trying to think about what can happen after they finally did not press the button. That ruined the whole DARMA project thing and I personally thought it was great how they had that key thing underground that Desmond used to turn off the magnet thing, yes and what was the central point of that? I'm glad that they finally did not push the button, but what about the people in the hatch? Like Mr. Echo, John, Charlie and well, Desmond probably died, but what about the others? I think they survived, I forget? Well, this is just my little detail about what I thought about this end of the season.
