I was 10 or 11 years old when this movie came out, and it has been with me for 35 years. When the movie came out, all the theaters in the St. Louis area distributed, like a "decoy," a package of flower seeds that had the name of the movie, etc. on the front. On the back of the package, it reads, in so many words ... plant these seeds at midnight. If a white flower grows, you are saved ... but if a red flower grows, you are condemned! Suffice it to say that, for an eleven-year-old boy, I did not plant the seeds for fear of what might arise. Here is the spoiler: When the movie starts, you see a small tank of toys moving on the ground. On a small road, a family is leaving the city and, suddenly, the camera turns back to the tank, and is full-sized. Roll over the car, and you see bleeding limbs sticking out of the rubble, then, suddenly, the tank becomes small again. <br /> <br /> The reason why this movie stayed with me for so long was because I had an exact toy tank like the one in the movie! Unfortunately, I do not know what happened to that, but I kept a cautious eye on that since then! <br /> <br /> I turned off the lights, put the DVD, made a sandwich and watched this movie. Is very good!!!
