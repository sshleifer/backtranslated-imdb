This angry and angry film is against not only the war during which it was made, but the entire war. It does not matter what war it is. It could be the most emotionally engaging experience I have had with the work of Ingmar Bergman. There is no side of the two main characters in this shocking drama, which is not related to any point in any ceremonial symbolism according to Bergman's usual, but clearly shows people and their lives and exercises what Bergman has already shown that understands about a person's reaction. to a movie. <br /> <br /> Your regular customers, Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow, play a married couple who internalize but fight and who were once orchestral musicians. Now they live on a degraded farm on an island. Part of the frustration of the building that we grow to share with these two people is fertilized in the detail that nothing in their house seems to work. They are not intellectuals either. They are a fairly familiar marriage that has resigned more or less to life and is essentially apolitical; they only hear of distant rumors of a war that has been going on forever. Ullmann is concerned about the danger to their lives and their desire to have children. Her husband von Sydow shrugs that the war will happen. His serenity is interrupted by the screams of fighter planes flying over his house, the murder of a parachute aviator, the arrival of dubious troops, his inquisition and, finally, his capture by what seems to be the local side, but loyalties have failed for a long time. <br /> <br /> They are sent back to their home, they witness the gratuitous destruction and suffer the vengeful consequences of a marriage so distrustfully suspicious. This, one of my favorite efforts of Bergman, is the study of a couple far from their safe and carefree lives, raped by a manipulative despair, testing them to reveal who they really are. To some extent, she lacks compassion, too interested and restless to be patient with her capricious interruptions to mourn. Their repressed emotional problems have led to the repression of the initiative and the emotion that attracted them to begin with. The immense last twenty minutes, interrupted sporadically by images of the overwhelming gray sky, are among the closest to the real emotion that Bergman has filmed. <br /> <br /> All systems of dogma and faith are the antagonists in this very essential and downbeat portrait. The basically clear personalities of the characters of Ullmann and von Sydow are thrown into the degenerate world of war because they are accused of to be "sympathetic", but the film, filmed on Bergman's small island in Faro, does not give any information about where or when it is ready, who are the two sides, and why they fight. For an uninvolved civilian stuck in the middle, it is likely that the knowledge base is quite similar. <br /> <br /> Ullmann and Von Sydow do not sympathize with the apparent enemy, but are in favor of those who apparently are on their side. This reactive allegory of 1968 could be about ordinary non-combatant citizens of Iraq, Kosovo, Vietnam, Israel or Palestine, or ...
