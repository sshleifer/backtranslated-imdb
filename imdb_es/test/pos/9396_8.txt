I'm not sure what I can add that has not been said in some of these other fine comments and quite funny, but I'll try. <br /> <br /> So you know the plot: there is a bed possessed by a demon that "absorbs" and selectively disintegrates the bodies of whoever (or whatever) lies on it with his body full of orange soda . We have the man, in some scenes that strangely resemble Robert Smith of The Cure, hanging inside the wall discussing the events, and we have several victims who simply can not resist the comfort of this mystical bed. <br /> <br /> This is not an ordinary bed. Do not serve Bob! Not only do you eat people, but you clean yourself afterwards, remove the covers and even make yourself. Who would not want a bed like that? He can even use his leaves as a rudimentary "loop" to fight the escaped victims (especially if they are taking half of the film to try to escape). <br /> <br /> Our "main" story (if you can call it that), is about these three girls who come to this remote area to stay at home (??). I do not remember exactly, but it does not really matter, since there are many things that challenge the convention and that you just have to give in and accept. The dialogue in the film is like no other; The characters talk to each other, apparently by telepathy, since their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. One of our girls thinks she does not like the rest of "the gang" and makes sure to tell us all of her feelings about this issue through an echo voice-over, but we do not care; The development of the character was thrown out the window a LONG TIME before in this movie, so why start now? There are scenes in which the bed laughs, hoarse, creaks and makes several other noises that we assume judging by the reaction of our cast to those noises, which can not be heard. This and telepathy make the subject of death very difficult to determine ... but that's fine ... this is the death bed: the bed that eats and defies all logic, so that's fine. It becomes an exuberant dream quality for this strangest movie. If you buy (hehe buys ... did I say "buy"?) This DVD, be sure to check the director's introduction. Explains that the filming of this "movie" began in 1972, did not end until 1977, bought it for some years without luck, and then advanced 26 years until 2003 and released on DVD. Supposedly someone somewhere had an impression of this in another country and smuggled contraband after contraband and it was by chance, on a message board, no less, that our director found evidence that people knew it, and he gasps! Careful, about his little known movie. It is from there that he decided to give him a shot and throw it. I'm glad he did it. Once you have heard the title of this movie, you MUST see it. For my part, I'm going to buy this and I'm going to preach his gospel all over the world ... starting with this comment
