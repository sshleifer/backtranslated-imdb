The last days is the best gay movie of the homosexual genre. Do most movies involve sappy stories, one night, and let's not forget infamous baseball teams? The last days actually contain male affection beyond the kiss in the dark, and a pretty graphic material that made me wonder if the movie belonged to Blockbuster or badpuppy.com. The emotional journey of the film is what places it above the rest in the genre. It was not until this film that I had seen such an intense story of passion and love, and the torture it can bring. I think when people cry during movies they should be beaten, but I found myself sobbing in various scenes due to the realistic nature of the world we live in. I suggest that all gay men watch this movie, and if you have a boyfriend, thank him ...
