Krajobraz po bitwie like many films of Wajda is, perhaps, incomprehensible for the "rest of the world". History based on the few short stories of Tadeusz Borowski, who during the Second World War was the prisoner of the fields of Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen. Borowski, in his books, describes the inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the point of view of the Tadek vorarbeiter, the parole of an author who was also in a privileged position among the prisoners. Borowski was ruthless for humanity and ruthless for himself. Describes human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. Ironically, after returning to Poland, he stopped writing artistic prose and became a Communist propagandist, producing a flow of anti-imperialist and anti-American press publications. After a few years he committed suicide. In the film Wajda changes point of view. Vorarbeiter Tadek - character created by Tadeusz Janczar - plays only a secondary role. The story centers on the poet, destroyed, burned by war and imprisonment and his one-day love story with Nina, a Jewish girl who escaped Communist Poland but actually hates Jewish life and mentality. In the background we can observe the sad grotesque life of the so-called "dipis" (displaced people), who after the liberation are solved by the Americans in the SS barracks. Marches, patriotic kitsch mixed with the hunt for extra dose of food and / or prostitution of German girls. <br /> <br />
