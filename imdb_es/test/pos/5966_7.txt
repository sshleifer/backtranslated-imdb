THE ASCENT is a very valuable addition to the recent re-releases of the Soviet Union. The 1977 film by director Larisa Shepitko examines the moral ramifications of loyalty and honor in Russia occupied by the Germans during World War II. On foot and in a snowstorm, two members of a partisan Soviet group are going to look for supplies and are captured by Nazi soldiers. The focus of the film is how each man manages or internalizes his moral alternatives. One chooses dignity and integrity, while the other chooses to collaborate with the enemy. However, in the end, he can not fulfill his selfish decision. The film makes much use of slow, wide-angle pans that switch to extreme close-ups, and highlight the spiritual dilemma within each man's soul. This is not a great movie, but it effectively portrays an intense moral dilemma in the context of a harsh and cold Soviet desert.
