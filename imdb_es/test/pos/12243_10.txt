This film has everything in its favor: fully developed characters, a realistic representation of work in Washington, bathed in the warmth and humor that is only Albert Brooks. The exhaustion of network news is even more problematic now than it was in 1987. Remember, this was before the cable! It is so satisfying to care about complex people who try to achieve complex goals, and everything moves at the speed of light. A representation of friendships so loyal to life that they teeter towards romance. See if you can see John Cusack as the angry messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hackes from real life on Broadcast News? Finally, if you are from DC, see if you agree with Holly Hunter's instructions for taxi drivers.
