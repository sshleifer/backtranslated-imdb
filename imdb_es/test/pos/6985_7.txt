* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I thought the Pitch Black was quite nice, with some nice effects. I liked the bigger beasts, although they are not a patch in the Aliens from the Alien series. It had a pretty good atmosphere, in which I felt that Vin Diesel helped contribute. <br /> <br /> One thing that puzzled me was how it rained. If the planet has three suns and is in almost continuous daylight, where did the moisture come from to form clouds and, therefore, rain? <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that Fry died at the end, he reminded me of the New Hollywood movies of the 70s, with the main heroine that does not make it to the end.
