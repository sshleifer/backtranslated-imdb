From the initial scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE (a game of tribal customs photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator Finn Earl, which shows why this South American tribe of Ishkanani is so fierce) the direction of the film is hazy: are we seeing one? A dark comedy about comparing life on the streets of New York with uncivilized people, or is it a message film with a more serious intention? But as the story unfolds, this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes clearer and clearer. Griffin Dunne's direction of Dirk Wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be a bit neglected at times, as it moves away from the rational development of the plot, but in the end there is a final impact strong enough to mend the holes that created . <br /> <br /> Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his coke-addicted masseuse / sexually obsessed mother, Liz (Diane Lane) in New York, waiting for the summer when he will join his anthropologist father on a trip of studies in South America (a father he only knows from letters and videos), when a drug trade abruptly changes their lives: one of Liz's wealthy clients, Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland) rescues the family from below and outside and transfers them to his ten-acre estate, the epitome of wealth and power. In exchange for being the private masseur of Osborne, Liz and Finn can live in the mansion with the "dirty rich" of Osbornes: his daughter, Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his doctor guide Liz on the road to dryness and Finn joins Osborne and his grandchildren, and despite the disparity between rich and poor, the situation of life works for a while. Incidents occur to alter feelings and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant, a turning point for the film and Finn's vision of the Osborne family. Osborne reveals his past to Finn and together they manage to discover the truth about the disturbing incident of Finn, and also about the fierce illness of the wealthy class. <br /> <br /> The movie uses many clips of tribal activity during the movie. drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the most challenging scenes. For this viewer, that works well, but when the director chooses to place the tribal individuals with all the insignia within the context of Osborne's property, the concept seems devised, as if the public had to be forced to "understand" it. The various subplots between the maid Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and Finn and the introduction of a chalk artist with obese Whitney (Branden Williams) increase the credibility of emphasizing the line between the rich and the "lower class", but the performances by Sutherland, Lane and Yelchin are strong enough to make us forgive the mistakes of the film. It is not a great movie, but it is a lot of valuable ideas that appear on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction. Harp grady
