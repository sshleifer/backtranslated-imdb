I'm an opera fan, and the operas are full of sex, blood and death. It can be useful to know the scripts of the operas of which this film is really appreciated; My mileage is very different from Tug-3. I am a lover of classical music and I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved Ken Russell's "Nessun Dorma" segment, and I'd like to see him produce Turandot, because the opera is supposed to be overwhelming, really multimedia experience, but then I loved Lisztomania. I love * Turandot * and knowing the script so well may be the reason why I do not find this segment the parody that Tug-3 did. <br /> <br /> The Buck Henry / Rigoletto segment is probably the most accessible for the average viewer: they are likely to recognize melodies, and it is a classic bedroom farce. I like the farces of the bedrooms, so stupidity did not bother me. <br /> <br /> The "Liebestod" segment is so outstanding that I recommend that people see this only for that piece. "Depuis la Jour" was, for me, beautifully spiritual. And Caruso's recording of "Vesti la Giubba" (also known as I Pagliacci) with John Hurt as the clown was wonderful. But people who only want naked women may feel that there is too much music and there is not enough meat and sex.
