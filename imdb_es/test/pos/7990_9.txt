When I was a kid I grew up with the 60's TV series (and no, I'm not that old! POW!). However, when director Tim Burton took his vision of the novel to the big screen, I simply gave it an immediate shine and I never stopped preferring its quotas on the latest and exaggerated additions ('Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'). ), that really does not matter to me. Even if they go for a much more rooted approach and want to further explore the psyche of Bruce Wayne / Batman? but, honestly, I do not think there's much to take advantage of. I wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes that's what Burton brought through, and this is the reason why I can see them again and again. <br /> <br /> After captivating audiences with the 'Batman' of 1989, thanks to the striking direction of Gothic art and Jack Nicholson, there are no prisoners in the performance of the encampment, but the psychotic Joker. Burton would return 3 years later to follow up and my favorite of the batman movies so far; 'Batman Returns'. Camp, but well done. In what could be even more expansive, more noisy, sad and nihilistic and having two evil enemies for the price of one. Enter the grotesque Penguin (with Danny DeVito superbly in a limb) and the dazzling Catwoman (a smoky Michelle Pfeiffer who fills the suit very well) coming to spoil the Gotham party. Once again, Batman (a Michael Keaton who is meditating properly is equally commendable and looks quite imposing with the bat costume that you see in his eyes) plays a secondary role to the bad guys, but I always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman that gave him a sinister mystique. , but also a psychological complexity of wear and tear that never felt the need to force food. And his turn of Bruce Wayne was well served as well. Burton's illustrative atmospheric direction opens with his elegant Gothic style recording a world of carnival comics with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes. The bad-tempered narrative (in what is probably a bit too long) is more symbolic in its progression, rather as a demonstration of its extravagant and extravagant pieces spontaneously and a markedly engraved artistic direction covered with somber nuances and gray neon lights / blue of a winter backdrop. The work of the camera, which flows in a magnetic way, takes off, and the majestic and spacious score of Danny Elfman balances the joy and the somber touches with a very hypnotic pull. The rest of the proceedings could be eclipsed, but Christopher Walken delves into the role of a two-sided businessman, Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back, but he has very little to do, since commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough are as charming as Alfred. In solid support are Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also makes a cameo.
