It's not hard to imagine what the main problem is for a screenwriter who wants to have 18 equally well-written characters with the same amount of screen time in a movie that lasts about 90 minutes. It is almost impossible not to resort to stereotypes and that is also what writer and director Ralf Westhoff does here. Very few of the characters can be recognized as people that you and I know in real life, many of them are only characterized with two or three attributes and remain vague. I am aware of that, but I still think that "Shoppen" is successful, that is, that it achieves exactly what it wants. It is a film with a very well written dialogue, an extremely good performance and a movie that made me laugh out loud very often. I do not think that this film wants to make an in-depth analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it wants to be a moral commentary on fast dating. It's a movie about something that exists and the people and their motivation to use it. Funny and entertaining.
