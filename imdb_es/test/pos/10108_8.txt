Perhaps he is one of the only avid fanatics of horror who thinks that the recent overload of Asian shockers is so exaggerated! Movies like "Ringu" or "The Eye"? Which are praised all over the world? they just did not convince me and they looked more boring than terrifying. Well, this strong opinion does not apply to the South Korean gem "A tale of two sisters." This is an elegant and absolutely complex psychological terror-tale that REALLY gets under your skin! The plot, based on a tale of local folklore, may be a bit too confusing for this film to be among the greatest achievements of all time, but the atmosphere and the increase in tension will surely provoke feelings of great respect. This is one of those few films that are impossible to label: the events in "Two Sisters" qualify as an amazing horror as well as an intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait. In addition to a fascinating story, "A Tale of Two Sisters" also has all the great elements that I think are often missing in Asian horror films such as compelling music, good acting and innovative camera work. The mansion where family events are held is brilliantly illustrated as a truly spooky place where secrets and danger are hidden behind every door. Several sequences (such as dinner with family members or the nocturnal appearance in the girls' room) are practically the last thing in concern. They really made me feel uncomfortable and I like to believe that I've seen my spooky horror part. "A tale of two sisters" is a fantastic movie adventure and a must for fans of Asian cinema. However, a small warning for people with a short attention span: this film forces you to focus your eyes and ears at all times. It is also a film that requires repeated visualization, although no one will ever "understand" it 100%.
