There are some things in life that we can not experience more than once and the university experience is one of them. Especially if we are living in a foreign country and in an apartment with 6 stooges from 6 different countries. Xavier, the main character, leaves his life in Paris, his ex-hippie mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study Spanish to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a French doctor and makes friends that make him see things differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy is one of the roommates) who comes from England, the movie starts to be much more fun. Well, anyway, Xavier begins to see things differently with all his new friends and probably lives something he will never forget and will change his life forever. In general, a very good nostalgic film, which becomes even more interesting due to the multinational cast. I thought it was very interesting to be able to see all these children from different countries, all speaking different languages ​​and having different cultures get along and have fun. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because I left the theater with a smile on my face and thinking about things I have not done yet when I'm still in college and I'd like to do it before it's too late.
