eXistenZ was a good movie, at first I was wondering what would happen, organic "capsules" made of mutant reptiles that connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game through an umbilical cord, and it seems a bit strange. <br /> <br /> But once it gets going, it's a pretty good movie, with a few twists with a great open end and the good aspect of the absence of energy throughout the movie is also entertaining , since he is not sure of what comes next. br /> <br /> Security personnel throw away metal detectors; They have bone guns!
