I saw this movie for the second time tonight, after about three years, and it was as wonderful as it was before ... <br /> <br /> There are more than a dozen modern, impressive French films from the hiver couer to the three colors. The trilogy and all of them are special. This movie is one of them. A true delight with so many wonderful things, from the tribute to Hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in Romane and Monica. Although Monica is very beautiful, Romane is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she inhabits. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why people think this movie is complicated since the scenes are a perfect blend of the past. and act in the present as a counterpoint to the extraordinary journey of the characters, that the film simply flows and hardly realizes that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left the audience enchanted and bewitched. <br /> <br /> Like most French and European films, this story would never translate across the Atlantic, as no studio could capture magic without drowning life with Hollywood bleaching common to most the films that are lost in the translation. Americans make brilliant films, but not this type ... maybe if they let someone like a young Polanski work on it, then maybe they would not totally sacrifice an English version ... <br /> <br /> For those who do do not see subtitled films, you will spend a lifetime in ignorant happiness. For those who can read, then you would be sneaking around to miss movies like this ... <br /> <br /> I would describe it as Neo-Franco-Noir, but only for the critic of the critic who called this film elitist. . I think I saw it making a complement for four and twenty feet. Think that Romane Bohringer is a type of French mayonnaise ... it's artistic in the way that Pulp Fiction is artistic ... but with more Gallic savoire faire ... <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 Watching. .. and someone has Romane's phone number ... she is the perfect French salad dressing ...
