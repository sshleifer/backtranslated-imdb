Dr. Sayer (Philippe Leroy), a wealthy doctor with psychological problems related to the opposite sex, kidnaps an employee, Maria (Dagmar Lassander), a liberal woman of free thought who believes that men should be "fixed" in place of women. Sayer retires to his palatial state, passing Maria through a series of humiliating mental games, threatening to annoy and kill her. Sayer's desire, apparently, is to dominate his body, mind and soul, making her his sexual slave, obeying his orders, adhering to all his desires and whims. After the resistance, at the beginning, Maria slowly wobbles towards her goal, but she has her own plans ... she says she wants to help Sayer to give up her sadistic behavior towards women, so that she can love and not feel desires so longing It seems that Sayer has it under his control, accepting certain rather embarrassing scenarios (such as lounging his toes, "making love" to an inflatable doll that is a recreation of himself, often spending time in topless and even When she slaps him in the face with a slap that almost breaks her blood, something happens when the worried doctor slowly falls in love with Mar√≠a ... and for what seems to be a desperate attempt to end the madness. advantage, playing with Sayer's lust for his body. <br /> <br /> It is more a battle of wills, a kind of sexual warfare where it seems that one is in charge when, in fact, the other really has the advantage Throughout much of the film, Sayer mistreats Maria, forcing her (... it seems) to submit to her series of psychological games of a sexual nature, her attempts to escape fail because her home is a very well-designed fortress. ... it's a palac io typical European art deco, created and orchestrated by a man who has attended his retirement this weekend for quite some time (... Walls and doors that open to his orders, with an area in quarantine for his "victims" ). But, once Maria apparently takes a bottle of pills as a result of the anguish in her hands, the tables are turned over and she has it where she wants it. He finds that he really wants her and Maria uses this to his advantage, playing hard to get it when Sayer wants to hug her and destroy her (... and, I could understand her frustration because she has that charm that can drive a man crazy) <Br / > <br /> I felt that the film works, ultimately, as a war cry for women, their empowerment and revolt against men who have the idea that they should always have control, sexually and mentally. The "turn" ends this ideal. I could not swallow Sayer's fate because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen ... we see how he develops his toned athletic figure and how this regimen is part of the normal routine every weekend before the real mental games begin. his victim. If she is doing so well and spends so much time developing for the extracurricular activities that follow her regime, how could she suffer the fate that follows her at the end of her deal with Maria in the end when she stops resisting his advances? <br /> <br /> Maria, I would admit later, is the first time she is kidnapped; others from the past, call-girls, were paid for their services so that Sayer could feel the power to dominate a woman, even if everything is a fictional farce brought about by a deeply troubled individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex . The spontaneous decision to do so, to take a leap from the norm, costs you more than you could ever know. <br /> <br /> All this psycho-sexual sub-text is quite fascinating to unravel, but Dagmar Lassander, such a delicious sex kitten, was my reason to enjoy it so ... without it, I would not have liked it so much because it is vital as a victim that is worth trying to obtain. Perhaps the highlight of the movie, Lassander's delicious dance, dressed in gauze (!), Unravels the wardrobe exposing her breasts to an incredible score ... is the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes her mouth water and your forehead sweat. Dagmar Lassander must have been a joy for fashion designers because she wears those clothes so well ... she has this kind of genius, sophistication and presence on the screen along with her beauty and seductive powers, Dagmar transcends the part to create an iconic character that would define his career ... even if the film is not well known (... I found word of mouth). The provocative nature of the script and the daring theme may not be attractive to certain crowds, since it is about sex (... and pain) in many different ways, and the dialogue is quite illustrative and elaborative. Sometimes, I could not help but laugh at Sayer's comments to an incarcerated Maria, about how she enjoys making women suffer, and the emotion she feels in forcing them to become a kind of slavery (... in an attempt to make Words are poetic, everything feels pretty cranky). But, Dagmar is the real reason to see it, and the film, for me, works better as a fetish movie, a possible male fantasy with this seemingly primitive and appropriate idealist, captured and held against his will, forced to be precarious. situation, its destiny possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist. His submission, and how he reacts to her aggressive behavior with her (... there are moments when he collapses before a hesitant desire to embrace him, revealing a possible attraction to him that, in itself, could surprise some of those who come). The most fascinating aspects of this exploitation. My other favorite scene, besides the dance, is the piano concert with Sayer caressing Maria while playing a relaxing melody.
