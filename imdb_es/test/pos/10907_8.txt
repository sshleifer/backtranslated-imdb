This is really a funny movie. His dance scene made with the ribbon is one of the funniest scenes I can remember. I think the "I'm gay" scene at the high school graduation ceremony is a bit surreal, although it was funny. While I watched it for the third time, I began to catch some small segments that I had missed. One was when Matt Dillon's girlfriend, a classic ditz, tried to use a dial phone that she had never used before. Kevin Klein made this successful movie throughout Tom Selleck. This was also the first time I could appreciate Debbie Reynolds; She showed that she can be funny. She confirmed it in the TV series 'Will and Grace'. One discovery I found after the third visit is Lauren Ambrose of the fame of '6 Feet Under'. She excels with her red fringe, but it is obvious that this is one of her first films. Bob Newhart is also very funny at the beginning of high school.
