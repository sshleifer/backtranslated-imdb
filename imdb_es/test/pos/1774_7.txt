This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ Jean Peters actually does an acceptable job as a pirate and does a decent job in his sword fights. (As long as she can have a double action, it's hard to tell ... but Peters herself is obviously doing quite well, and she's doing it right). ++++ With a good and serious script, this could have been an excellent movie. But it's basically corny. Still entertained though. ++++ It's not up to a Jacques Tournier movie, but it's definitely above a Jean Peters movie. The color is typical of this time period of the 50s, that is. too garish and not realistic. The actors of Blackbeard and his first partner and the drunk doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a little weak. Nor do I think Debra Paget was right. But, undoubtedly, Jean Peters and Debra Paget were probably the two female stars with the best appearance in the 50s.
