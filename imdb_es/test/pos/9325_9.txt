When it was announced that the "King of Pop" had died at age 50, a month before a series of live-back shows began at the O2 Arena in London, it was a great shock for millions of people around the world . He was, and will always be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry, and he will be missed terribly. I decided to remind myself how wonderful it was to see that many consider that not only is Jackson's best video (and possibly the song), but the best music video ever made by director John Landis (An American Werewolf in London). The film begins with Michael and his girl (Ola Ray) with the breakdown of his car, and after giving him a ring, the moon rises and he becomes a werewolf. Then we see Michael and his Girl watching this horror movie in the movies, she is scared and leaves, and Michael soon follows her, singing the iconic song. Very soon the voice of Vincent Price is heard, and the zombies begin to crawl through the earth and open coffins from the cemetery, and Michael and the girl are obviously surrounded. She turns around, and Michael has become a zombie, and with all the other creatures make the iconic dance, before it returns to its normal state, at least for the choir. The Girl runs towards the house almost creepy, blocks the entrance, but the zombie Michael still manages to break through, and when he touches it, he screams to see the normal Michael who says "what's the problem?" The film ends with him taking her home and looking at us with evil eyes. Michael Jackson was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and number 6 on The Ultimate Pop Star, Thriller's album was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Albums, and this video was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and it was number 1 in the 100 best pop videos. Very well!
