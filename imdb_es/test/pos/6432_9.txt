I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Hauer at the 2005 Sarasota Film Festival for the premiere of this film in the US. UU Not only was he kind enough to autograph my copy of BLADE RUNNER, he also took the time to answer some questions about the film before projecting THE ROOM for a packed theater. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed with the film that I used it as the criterion for comparing all the other films I had seen at the festival. It was powerful and moving, but subtle and brief. The film tells the story of how a young man, (earlier version played by Rutger), one day is fascinated by a seemingly normal room in an uncomplicated building near the street. When passing, observe a single window, always open, from which you can hear a disturbing melody. Every day, he passes by the room, sometimes standing outside for hours, watching him through the silk curtains that flutter in the light breeze, hoping to catch a glimpse of his occupants. Towards the end of the film, we discover how important this room really is and what has attracted our protagonist. <br /> <br /> The movie was cut beautifully. He did not miss a second of screen time in an uninteresting shot. Any frame of the movie could be alone in an art gallery. Rutger is amazing. He is mysterious, but accessible. His dialogue includes a series of reflections on a life that has run its course, for better or for worse. His words evoke familiar feelings and thoughts of the audience. I was particularly moved by a scene in which he is looking at some old photos, remembering his favorite dog, his favorite horse and his first love. You have the feeling that you are in his presence, since it allows you to enter his world to glimpse the precious memories of a life that is nearing its end. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who does. Look for something fresh, intelligent and moving. The visualization must be required for all the elders of the film.
