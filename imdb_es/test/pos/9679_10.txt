If Family Guy offends you or you just do not understand humor, unfortunately this show is making fun of you and the masses of overly religious, bored and politically correct people in the United States. So put aside your moral and have fun with this show. FG is a hilarious developer about the reality of today's society. Whoever said that this show is for a young and immature audience is very wrong. With all the references to old movies and politics 10-80 years ago, I could not imagine an immature child who found it funny. Family Guy is definitely for an open-minded mature public that is not afraid to criticize American society. Congratulations to Seth and to all the team that could make this show take place.
