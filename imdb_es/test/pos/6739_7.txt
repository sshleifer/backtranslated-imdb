This is a comedy of mildly entertaining maturity that comes from the later and more mature period of Neil Simon's writing. Although there are a lot of jokes, this is not one of those pieces by Neil Simon where each character emits jokes from a single line for 2 hours as if they were invited stars in a Bob Hope special. There are also dramatic elements (some works, others are excessive) that give a certain weight to the story. <br /> <br /> The performances are good in all areas, especially Blythe Danner as a mother (although she and Judith Ivey were oddly the WASP-ish elections to play Jewish women). I have never been a fan of Jonathan Silverman, but I will say that he plays the right notes as the storyteller / protagonist of the story that is hateful, ungainly and totally rickety. <br /> <br /> The movie is very similar to Woody Allen's "Radio Days", but the latter is much more imaginative and fun than this one.
