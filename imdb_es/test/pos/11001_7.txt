I enjoyed watching Squire Trelane whirling the crew in this episode, although after a while it all seemed a bit too long. Sure, the histrionics were a bit funny for a while, and the ending was a good way to wrap the whole thing up. I think the problem was that I enjoyed watching Trelane when he was full of courage and fun, the fun seemed to vanish when Trelane became vengeful and unpleasant. Talk about a mood killer: move from the hostile but affable host to the guy who condemns Kirk to death! But, despite this, the episode was nice and it was worth my time. For the staunch Trekkies, this is something that must be seen, for others it is just a good race.
