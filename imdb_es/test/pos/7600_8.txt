I just watched this movie for the second time with my 8 year old daughter and I remembered why we liked it the first time. All these people who say it is bad are too tense and critical! It's just a little entertaining movie, it's not supposed to change the world. I thought all the actors did a great job with their characters. (Except Jeremy Jordan as Guy, he was a worm who was seriously looking for the need for soap and shampoo - if he is supposed to be the hot boy at his school, then they have slimming). But I digress ... -Drew Barrymore was charming, as usual, and David Arquette was even nice, and I usually can not stand it, if only for those STUPID AT & T commercials. Molly Shannon is always entertaining, and Leelee Sobieski did a great job as a tortured brain. Some parts were really painful to watch, they remind me of high school. Although fortunately I did not make fun of it, it made my heart ache for those who do it. Movies like this are really good for children to see; My daughter made several observations about the cruelty of some of the students and how wrong she was. This movie is appropriate for anyone and is a good way to spend 2 hours. If you ever want to see a small happy movie with a happy ending where you do not have to think much, then this is definitely a consideration.
