Good movie. At first, I thought it was a high-fidelity movie of medieval detectives, but the end surprised me completely. I guess the whole movie covers too many subjects, each one of them can be the main theme, for example. Revenge, friendship and dream. But he mixed them all up without focusing on any of them. I think it would be a great movie if it was built around the end from the beginning. <br /> <br />
