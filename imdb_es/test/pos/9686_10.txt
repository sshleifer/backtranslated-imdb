.... but at the same time a part of you is thinking "Am I ready for what I'm going to see?" <br /> <br /> In the end, you're happy to have seen it. I was, at least. Jackass Number Two has twice the laughs and double the action. Some tricks will leave you breathless. Besides Little Miss Sunshine, I think it was the best movie I saw this summer. Maybe even this year. <br /> <br /> The full cast returns, along with some like Chris Raab and Rake Yohn. I do not think any of the cast members had a dull moment. Each and every trick was fun or dangerous or a combination of both; stupid. The beginning was as fun as the first, and the ending was very funny; The cast performing a musical number. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is the perfect movie to watch with your friends. Stay during the credits, there are some pretty funny moments. One involves Luke Wilson.
