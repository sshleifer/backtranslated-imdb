<br /> <br /> my favorite science fiction, incredible journey through mistrust and deformation of reality. Probably the best performance I've seen playing Jude Law. Incredibly original, with interesting character developments and a story that turns and rotates so fast that it takes a couple of minutes after the film to understand his genius. Even more fun to see him again for the end changes the beginning.
