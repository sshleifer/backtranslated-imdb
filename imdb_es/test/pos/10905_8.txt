This movie is extremely fun and funny, with appropriate, fun and experienced deals. I find this film enjoyable not only for the elements of humor but also for the music in various scenes. Kevin Kline, a good comedian, has done a good job of being funny in many parts of the movie along with Tom Selleck, which is incredibly different from many of his other films. The humor within this movie is ridiculous, which makes several exaggerations within many scenes, especially the initial parts. Joan Cusack is also remarkably funny and exaggerated; And the same goes for all the other molds. This movie has many elements of ridiculous humor and it's nice if you want to laugh.
