I'm not exactly sure how accurate it is with this movie, but I can tell you that this movie entertained me completely. the burst character, played perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, was one of the most unique and entertaining characters in recent memory. This movie reported, but managed to avoid preaching to the audience. It made me laugh, it saddened me, it made me feel alive and I was glad to spend time watching the movie. It does not take long to understand what is happening, and it takes you on a roller coaster of genuine and human emotion. I thought you knew my story, apparently I did not know it at all! I give this movement 9 out of 10, and I recommend it for all adults, and young adults, and the young at heart, but not the young. but as soon as you are allowed to watch movies classified as "r", make them a priority.
