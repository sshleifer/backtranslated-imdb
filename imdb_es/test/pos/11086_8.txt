Christopher Boyce (Oscar winner: Timothy Hutton) stops being a priest and returns home for an uncertain future. When his best friend, Daulton Lee (Oscar winner: Sean Penn) is a drug dealer, he always gets into trouble and enjoys taking drugs too much. When Christopher gets a job working in a top secret government place titled "RTX". Boyce and Lee have wealthy families, who hoped to survive on their own. When Boyce decides to take secret documents out of curiosity, these documents must be destroyed. He decides to sell these secret documents at a cheap price to the Soviet Union with the help of his best friend. But the two never knew how far they will go to seal documents to make a living and since they are both amateurs. Both have betrayed their country to obtain top secret information. <br /> <br /> Directed by the late Oscar winner: John Schlesinger (The Believers, Eye for a Eye, Midnight Cowboy) made an interesting character drama about two young men who take the wrong path in life. Oscar winners: Hutton and Penn are extraordinarily good at the movie. The movie is occasionally funny and quite disturbing at times. David Suchet almost steals the show as the man, who works for the Soviet Union. This image has a familiar cast in the supporting roles. I was quite underestimated, when it was first released. Despite some great criticism from some of the best film critics. This photo is based on a true story. There are some flaws in the narrative, like these two main characters, but in general, it's a movie worth watching. Based on a novel by Robert Lindsey. Script of the Oscar winner: Steven Zaillian (American Gangster, Hannibal, Schindler's List). (**** / *****).
