If you are looking for a typical war movie, this is not all, so a note for all war lovers who are looking for the testosterone butcher shop, do not bother. Although the film is about Russian characters in World War II, do not expect to see any Nazis, cannons, blood, blood, etc. It is not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war. It's a film about ordinary people who go through the war and the decisions they make when dealing with it. <br /> <br /> Acting, cinematography, writing: everything perfect 10 here. You will certainly appreciate it if you are Russian like me, but even if you do not, you will probably love it. If you do not speak Russian, look for the DVD version of RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council). It has subtitles in about 14 different languages, but the English dubbing in this one that I would say is just as good. Of course, it's not as good as the original Russian song (some things get lost in the translation), but it's as good as the English subtitles. So watch it, especially if you are studying film in any aspect.
