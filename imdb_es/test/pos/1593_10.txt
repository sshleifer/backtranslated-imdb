Death in Venice is a film that I need to see once every ten years. It is always different, because I am always in a different stage of life. <br /> <br /> The film is about art, beauty, longing, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others simply annoying to see, especially if you've seen them before. However, I would not like to lose a single painting. The music is repetitive, the main theme of Mahler's fifth adage is used again and again. However, I would not like to lose a single note. When the last image fades, the last note dies, I'm stunned and exhausted. <br /> <br /> This movie is a monument to film making. As with most really good movies, the Saturday night crowd should stay away from it. And this is simply the best movie of all.
