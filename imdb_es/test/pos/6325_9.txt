The episode begins with scenes of a dead woman bathing on the shore, a carefree Jim strolling along the beach lost in reverie and a night trip home that ends in murder and mystery. Yes, this is a small atmospheric number with a super spin at the end. Jim does a good job to unravel what is, a priori, an unexplainable case of a woman missing 20 seconds after entering her home. Without a doubt, the final explanation is a little exaggerated. Why, for example, did he try to replace a woman halfway on a car trip when simply rubbing her and her companions together would have been so easy and would not have left a trace? However, apart from these problems, it is a memorable episode of TRF full of inventions, even if STILL YA Jim re-bound in a frame by an always suspicious Police Department. How many of your files have been resolved by the beloved Jimbo olimbo?
