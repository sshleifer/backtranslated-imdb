Unconditional love is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's an emotional roller coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he did not want to go to the pub because the villagers do not like it, you expect the worst. When the old woman raises her glass and says "To the memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows his example, I wanted to cry". The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical style of Julie Andrews. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor. Grace is one of the best roles of Kathy Bates. Meredith Eaton steals almost all the scenes she is in. Rupert Everett is part of his best work in Unconditional as Dirk. The kiss between Rupert and Meredith took me to another fit of hysteria. At the time when the rights of homosexuals are questioned, I believe that this film should be seen by all. As a gay man in my last 40 years, I have seen people lose everything when a loved one dies. So kudo is for everyone involved in the making of this movie.
