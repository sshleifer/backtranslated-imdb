This film by Friðrik Þór, director of Children of Nature, is powerful. It has good music by Sigurrós and good acting. It shows how sad madness can be as an illness. There are many good jokes but the humor is dark. If that's not a problem, then you should watch this movie. Keep in mind that this is not a comedy but a drama.
