Well, you know what, I was painting my house today and a song by Elton John appeared on the radio, which immediately took me back to this movie I saw in 1971. Long ago and so far away. Ten years later, I took a field trip to France, and I would have liked to see Michelle. Probably the film is not very sophisticated by today's standards, but it is a pity, but at that time it seemed quite spicy. A few years later, a sequel was made with Michelle living in a high-rise building in Paris and Paul returning to meet her, just like in the life in which they had moved, the movie was very sad. Still, the original was fabulous, and if you can get a copy, change it, just remember to give it in due time and treat it with care. I observe that Americans can be quite cautious, so take note, it contains scenes and themes that possibly upset the middle of America.
