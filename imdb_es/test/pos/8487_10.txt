Jamie Foxx was the epitome of Ray Charles. After a few moments, you stop watching a movie and you see a biography played by the great man. Ray Charles was truly a genius of music and the film represented him in an excellent way. No one has ever written, played or recorded music like this musical giant. When he passed into the flesh, the world lost one of its greatest American heroes. As for the film, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a classical music scholarship for college and could play as Ray was an advantage for the director. What could be better than that? You do not have to have a double "double" piano and then try to split the screen from another person's hands to Jamie's face. It worked very well I loved the fact that he also detected how difficult Ray was. He was not always a good man. You did not support it either. He was a drug addict, a womanizer, and, sometimes, just a fool. But I guess that's what genius did, so I can not blame him for that. I choose Jamie as Best Actor!
