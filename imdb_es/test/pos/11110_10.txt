Fame, I think, was the best movie I've ever seen. In ways it was fun and dramatic, but that's what a movie does. It's true, it has some loose ends, really many, but I still think it's a fantastic movie. Some of the fun things happen at the audition at the beginning of the movie. I think it's very funny when the girl tries to represent O.J. Simpson in "The Towering Inferno" and Raul / Ralph go to all the art departments saying that his father was great at all. He says his father danced with the Rockets and left Ralph his running shoes. The Rockets, as far as I know, are made of women. And the tap shoes were just regular shoes with bottle caps on the bottom. The guy who read Juliet's lines in Romeo and Juliet's work was also funny. One thing about the movie that excites me is the music. I have never heard anything like it! My favorite song is "I Sing the Body Electric" and the second is the song "Fame". Irene Cara has a great voice and is a great actress. I like the way the film focused on many ethnic groups. He showed all the types of people in what is now called "The Guard School of the Performing Arts." This film showed the triumphs and trials of many young performers, such as Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary and Liza. Everyone had a bad time, but they did it their way. This movie could have been added in another 30-45 minutes (before graduation), but it's still my favorite movie no matter what!
