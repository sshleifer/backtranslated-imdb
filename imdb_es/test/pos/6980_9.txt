I've seen the Director's Cut version and I can not be more than content. Excellent performance (especially Cole Hauser, although I felt sad about the little space for Claudia Black), subtle visual effects and photography in general, a credible plot (considering the genre) without many logical holes, really unpredictable turns, construction up characters. These are the biggest assets of the movie. Combined with style, some may consider this film as a B-grade effort, but I do not agree with that. The whole thing is really very original and elegant. <br /> <br /> And although I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel, this role of Riddick was very suitable for him. I can not wait for Chronicles of Riddick, it's great that this movie has a sequel ... <br /> <br /> 9/10 if you ask me
