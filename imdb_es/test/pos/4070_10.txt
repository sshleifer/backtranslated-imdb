It is exactly what I expected from him. Relaxing, humorous and entertaining. The pair of actors was amazing, as well as the selection of the scene. I personally recommend this. It is the kind of movie that can be seen by the whole family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or bored. This beautiful movie will make you smile and laugh too. And the action scenes are tasty. The classics of modern American comedy. And very well done.
