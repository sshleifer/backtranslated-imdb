I must say it was a disappointment. In general, it is great to see how Aparna Sen has handled the problem of schizophrenia, I do not have much knowledge about this and I got what was represented in A Beautiful Mind, and here also its interesting description. <br /> <br /> But what disappointed me were the artificial dialogues and the excessive use of English. It is true that a new class is being formed in India that speaks in English even at home, but I am sure it is not as formal as in the film. Also, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable speaking everything in English. Charu's dialogue in Bihari's tone was apparently much more realistic and digestible. <br /> <br /> The second thing is about the abstract flavor that you have tried to give the film. I generally like movies with an open ending, but here there were many loose ends. It's like cutting pieces come together to make the film. Nor did there seem to be any central theme for the film. No doubt, Schizophernia was the main line, but mixed sister-sister, mother-daughter, adding a medical-Azmi relationship, without a real use of the relationship between brother, Bose and Bose's wife. what he really tried to describe. <br /> <br /> In general, a watch for people who like out-of-the-box movies, something that should be avoided for those who only see movies as an entertainment tool.
