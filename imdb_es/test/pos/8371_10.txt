Surely the best film directed by Claude Lelouch after "L'aventure c'est l'aventure". The inspiration of the life of Jacques Brel is really present. Richard Anconina and Jean-Paul Belmondo played a really amazing duo and are really great at the psychological discovery of the two characters they play.
