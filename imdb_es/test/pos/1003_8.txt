So Keira Knightly is in it ... Then, automatically, we compare this film with the atonement. Apart from the fact that this movie is also wartime and its appearance is deviating, these films are totally different. <br /> <br /> The Actors work well, I think one good thing is that there is not a memorable person, they are a team. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie where things happen, then I advise another person, since the story of this film is about human interaction and their physical damage due to their experiences and how their lives intertwine. <br /> <br /> This movie has a genuine interaction, perfect moments of pause that make you hold your breath. No, it's not exciting, but it's exciting if you can empathize with these characters. In moments I wondered if this movie could have been better as a play instead of a movie. We expect a lot from the movies since everything is possible, and yet, with the theater we allow the interaction and we trust in the belief. <br /> <br /> There are bad things in this if you are looking for a blockbuster, if you are not looking for anything and allow the film to take you, move you, allow yourself to forget these stars and not judge them as actors, but rather become people, you will really move. <br /> <br /> FOLLOW! ! give it a try!
