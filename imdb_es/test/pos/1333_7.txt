I felt cheated by knowing the whole story. While there might be a twist, this turn was so important, that I felt betrayed. I think I could have used a better writer who could weave all the elements of the story better. The writer could have revealed more of the 'twists' throughout the film, instead of all at the same time in the end. Apart from that, I think the actors did very well with what they had, in particular Matt Damon, who actually had a little character in his character, little quirks that were not selfish or like a soft criminal who always knows what what are you doing. The other main characters were their own separate entities that simply conversed with each other. The group's cohesion in Ocean's Eleven was gone.
