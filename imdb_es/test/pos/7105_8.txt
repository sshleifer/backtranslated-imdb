The last of the sequels, not counting Abbott and Costello, is with Frankenstein, which was more or less a parody. At this time, Dracula (John Carridine) occupies center stage looking for a cure for his vampirism by a kind teacher (Onslow Stevens). Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) also appears looking for a cure. The good doc manages to heal Larry's werewolf, but Dracula cheats the doc and ends up polluting his blood and makes the good doc a crazy lunatic. And all this time, Franky. (Strange of Glenn) lies on a table waiting for his electricity solution so that it can cause some havoc. This was a kind of short film, about 70 minutes and some change, but the action is there, and the great actors are there too. Atwill appears as a police inspector, here are some trivia, Lionel atwill appeared in the son of Frankenstein, the ghost of Frankenstein, Frankenstein meets the werewolf and the house of Frankenstein. and then this one If there was another in the series, it is possible that they have added the creature of the black lagoon to the alignment, I am giving it to Dracula's house 8 out of 10.
