As most other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of 'After The Funeral' is very good. It was always one of my favorite stories of Poirot and I was worried that he might be "stuck around". Well, it was a bit but ONLY a little and in the end the result was completely entertaining. David Suchet is still almost impeccable as Poirot and (as others have pointed out) the other star of this show is Monica Dolan, who surely could not be surpassed as Miss Gilchrist. I also really enjoyed Fiona Glasscott, who was very successful as Rosamund Shane's court, but in reality, the casting was pretty impeccable! <br /> <br /> A point is noted for the adapters who can not resist including too many revelations in the last fifteen minutes. The business with the will and deeds of the house was a little unnecessary, although I did not care how they adjusted the structure of the Abernethie family (in the book The family tree IS really quite complicated). The final moments in which the murderer is revealed, however, are really well done and I found the end, when everyone left Enderby, very touching. This is really one of the best in the Poirot series so far.
