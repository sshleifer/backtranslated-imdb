I agree with msinabottle; It's a good movie. Here are some fragments of dialogues: <br /> <br /> Raisuli (Sean Connery) to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): "You see the man in the well, how does he extract the water? When one pail is emptied, the other It fills. "The same goes for the world. Currently, you are full of power. But you are spilling it, wasted. And Islam is licking the drops as they spill from your bucket. "<br /> <br /> Raisuli: The English have paid very well in the past Pedecaris: Well, you will not get away with the Americans. Roosevelt will have his head for this Raisuli: Roosevelt This President Roosevelt, would he try to take it himself Pedecaris: He would certainly do it He is a man of grit and strong moral fiber He does not kidnap women and children Raisuli: What type of rifle do you use? Pedecaris: A Winchester! Raisuli: Winchester.Winchester.I have no knowledge of this rifle.Pedecaris: You will. <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): The American Grizzly Bear is a symbol of the American character: strength, intelligence, ferocity, a little blind and reckless at times, but courageous beyond doubt ... Oh, and another trait goes with all of the above .. Journalist: And that, Mr. President? Teddy Roosevelt: Soledad, the bear lives his life alone, indomitable, unconquered, but always He has no real allies, only enemies, but none of them is as big as him. Reporter: Do you feel that this could be an American trait? Teddy Roosevelt: Certainly. The world would never love us. He can respect us. It can even grow to fear us. But he will never love us. Because we have too much audacity. And sometimes we are also a little blind and reckless.
