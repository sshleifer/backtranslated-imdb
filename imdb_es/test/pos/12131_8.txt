I agree with Vince, this movie paved the way for Goodfellas. The scene in which Pesci was throwing peanuts at the pianist reminded me of his "How am I funny?" Routine at Goodfellas. This is a very underestimated film and deserves some attention. As with many other mafia movies, the theme of The Death Collector sounds true: always respect the Don.
