I saw this movie during the Mod & Rockers festival in August. I was so inspired and moved. Harry had an incredible life and one of the best and different voices ever recorded. For those of you who do not know about Harry Nilsson, do some research and you will see that Harry has probably found his way in his life in one way or another. Maybe it was his special "The Point" or "Everybody's Talking" by Midnight Cowboy. For me, it started with "let people tell you about my best friend", the main theme of "Eddie's father's courtship". By watching this movie, you can really feel the love and admiration of Harry's true friends and companions. Do not shed a tear for Harry, he had a ball ... <br /> <br /> Brett
