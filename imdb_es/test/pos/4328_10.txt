Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find Desmond completely lost. His traumatic experience of the past before sailing to the island is revealed through flashbacks. Sayid plans a plan with Jack to surprise "The Others" in case Michael doubles the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button on the computer to see what will happen. <br /> <br /> This episode is one of the best of the second season. . Unfortunately, lovers of "Lost" we can see the lack of respect that the producers of this impressive series have with the fans. In the USA UU., The date of transmission of this episode was on May 24, 2006. Therefore, throughout this period, fans have to wait for the Third Season in a situation of great suspense, with Jack and his group surrounded of "The Others" and finding the truth. about Michael and the death of Ana Lucia and Libby; John locked himself inside the hatch without intending to push the button and Mr. Eko desperate out of the hatch. I hope that the fate of "Lost" is better than "Angel" and its conclusion very disappointing (or lack of conclusion) after five seasons. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
