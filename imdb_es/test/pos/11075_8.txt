Being from eastern Pennsylvania, right on the northern border of New Jersey, I still have the feeling that this was a documentary rather than a movie. I have friends from New York and New Jersey and this film represents the kind of lifestyle that "still" exists today in the area of ​​lower income outside of the "Big City" lifestyle. If you have not seen this movie and have ever wondered what happens REALLY in the urban jungle, take a look at this movie. There are no actors of great renown, it is as if they had just removed these guys from the street and said act, which adds to the realism of the film, the performances are FANTASTIC, however! SEE THIS MOVIE!
