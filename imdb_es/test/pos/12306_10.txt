John Huston made many remarkable and memorable films. The most often and easily remembered ones were released long before his death in 1987. However, it was that year that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game, as evidenced by his faithful adaptation of James' acclaimed novel Joyce "The Dead". "<br /> <br /> A long time ago, a very wise man named Doc asked me:" Does not "The Dead" look noticeably more vivid and bright than any of the other stories in Dubliners? I tend to think that it is. The story and the film contain some of Joyce's comments and criticisms from society, but for the most part, they paint a warm and loving portrait of an Irishman. Joyce himself often criticized and would soon leave. <br /> <br /> The handling of the protagonist, Gabriel Conroy, on the part of Huston, who realizes the world as he sees it, is nothing more than an illusion, it is simply remarkable. To affirm that the film lacks plot is to lose the point. As with any of Joyce's Dubliners, the plot, although certainly present, is not the goal. The plot is simply a tool to convey the epiphany of the protagonist. In addition to an apparent lack of action, there is a frankly small dialogue in Joyce's story for the director to rely on. Huston's ability to translate what Joyce puts into words in pictures is possibly the biggest triumph of the movie. Feelings, thoughts ... The discomfort of Gabriel during the dance ... all these intangibles jump to life and reach the viewer in the representation of Huston. <br /> <br /> Claiming that Huston has softened his writer's criticisms of society again loses the brand. While "The Dead" can be painted with a cheerful tone, the complacency and simulation of the characters in the film is nothing more than a commentary on society on a smaller scale: we are old and small aunts; the sultry drunk; the tenor with the sore throat; the wife of the sad and soggy secret of the rain; Even the self-deceived middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> But "The Dead" belies his title. It is not a dark story. Nor is it really so grim. Forget for a moment the snow that falls on the living and the dead and the symbolism inherent in it; Forget about the confusion of a life that Gabriel wakes up at the end of the film: only with the destruction of the illusions Gabriel has of himself and his world can he go on. Such is the central point of the film. Such is the central point of our lives.
