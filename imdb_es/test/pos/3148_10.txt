I saw "The Reader" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. He touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In about ten minutes or so, he tells a touching story of two characters that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done an excellent job capturing real and tender moments in the film. What I really admire about this movie is that the director has chosen an appropriate story for the short format. These are really interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect time. This is not a small feat. Have not we all seen shorts that are simply longer stories compressed to fit the format, or scenario stories that did not fit the screen properly? I applaud "The Reader" for doing it really well, and I encourage anyone who is interested in film and telling stories to seriously consider it. It's worth every moment!
