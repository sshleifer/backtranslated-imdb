* They can be spoilers * Without doubt, one of the best dramas, if not the best in the genre I've seen. Is Prot an extraterrestrial or just a crazy nut? This is the question you will ask yourself throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is simply amazing, just like Jeff Bridges. You can not beat this kind of acting, apart from a bit of humor sometimes. Some of Kevin Spacey's actions in this movie are very funny. For example, when he was in the tree and when he spoke with the mental patient "queen", he hid half of his face around the wall and stared. <br /> <br /> To put it simply. From the beginning, you'll be hooked, and if you really like dramas, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> A solid 85%.
