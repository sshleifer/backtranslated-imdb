I just saw this movie the other day at the Santa Fe Film Festival. I loved its honesty and humor. It was the most provocative film I've seen in a long time, I just can not forget it for some reason. It may not be for everyone, because it makes you think. I do not know if people like to think about movies so much, which is a shame. The actors who play the Franklins are a real find. I could not imagine interpreting these complicated people so frankly. Although I thought that a couple of supporting characters were not as good as the Franklins, I can forgive them completely, because in my opinion, this is an important movie. I did not expect to like it that much, but as I have thought for a few days, it is proving to be a very important piece of entertainment.
