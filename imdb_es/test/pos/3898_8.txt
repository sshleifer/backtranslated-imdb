"A Slight Case of Murder" is an excellent movie for television, which is definitely worth the rent. William H. Macy is a great film critic who accidentally kills his lover and then has to try to hide the crime. Although it may seem dark, the film is actually quite cheerful and fun, with many memorable lines ("Acting is harder than I thought, have you ever seen BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology" and personal favorite "For For next week answer these two questions about black cinema, what do these people do during the day and why does it always rain?" The film has a great supporting cast that includes Macy's real-life wife , Felcity Huffman, James Cromwell and Adam Arkin, must be seen for Macy's fans!
