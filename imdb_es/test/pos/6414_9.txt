(The description of the mood of the film can be considered as a spoiler, because in fact there is not much action). <br /> <br /> A great ... <br /> <br /> Is it for me peculiar interest for dystopias and utopias? It's because of the atmosphere of the movie. Or is there something more magic? If yes, it is undoubtedly the most human ... <br /> <br /> This film is undoubtedly extremely artistic / artificial (it depends on taste). I can imagine that most people who hate watching slow movies (and those of Tsai Ming Liang (of whom I did not enjoy other times) are one of the slowest I know), who suffered during the movie. Yes, people can not slow down and let time pass, and see it without feeling that they waste it. One can take this piece as a torture or as a therapy ... <br /> <br /> The issue on the surface? The lack of communication, even if we live in rabbit cages, side by side, but not really together? People are tired, tired of something and unable to describe it, simply do not want to meet, touch, talk, confront others ... as if they had disappeared. The large block of flats seems empty and the rain constantly causes a strange melancholy inside. And sometimes it must be something abnormal, unexpected, an unwanted decomposition like a hole in the concrete floor, which allows us to reach us. <br /> <br /> One of the possible ways to see it is this: Do not survey the inner world of the characters: consider that all the space of the film is inside you. And ask, why is it there? Where could these depressive states and moods be formed? Is there a place for them, do not they have the right to be here? And look for the answers (if you need them) between the walls and corridors of the block, rather than within the barely transparent mind of a man. <br /> <br /> The key to understanding is not understanding, to let a film lend us, as a subject of study, within itself and, in the end, return us to our more colorful and "normal" reality. <br /> <br /> Then, maybe, it will come to: Me: the feeling of real hope, possible, not pathetic, that, deep down, we are still human beings ... and this mental state can help a lot to live in this world.
