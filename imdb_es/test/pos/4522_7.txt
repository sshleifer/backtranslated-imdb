Chan is in New York and is involved in an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft design. <br /> <br /> The war was more than a year away from arriving in the United States, but World War II was already at its peak elsewhere in the world. and so it colored everything since most people probably realized that the war was coming. The war is not mentioned here, but the fact that the film deals with the production of airplanes at least alludes to it. The mystery itself is quite good, the notion of airplane sabotage lends itself very well to a couple of rather tense moments. To be sure that we are talking about Charlie Chan, we can be sure that he will live to fight another day, but there was no guarantee of the condition he would be in, or of whether someone around him would survive. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. It is not one of the nests, and far from the worst. It's one of the really weird things, a really nice one. Definitely worth a look or six.
