There must be a sale in this story in the 1940s. An epidemic threatens New York (it's always New York) and nobody takes it seriously. Some might say that Richard Widmark and Jack Palance did better in Panic in the Streets, but I do not agree. <br /> <br /> There's always something about these Poverty Row productions that really touch a nerve. The production values ​​are never so polished and the performance is a bit rough, but that is the reason why I think that this film and the ones I like are effective. Rude, grainy, nervous. And the cast. All the 2nd stringers or a list of actors passed their peak. There are no egos here. These people were happy to get the job. Whit Bissell, Carl Benton Reid, Jim Backus, Arthur Space, Charles Korvin and the melodious voice of Reed Hadley that flows in the background like crude oil. By the way, I've been to the hospital a couple of times; How come my nurses never looked like Dorothy Malone? In this type of movies they do not care much about makeup and hair, but they really managed to turn Evelyn Keyes into a witch. Or maybe they just skipped makeup and hair completely. Anyway, it was quite effective. She plays a smuggler of jewels in love who picks up a case of Small Pox in Cuba while smuggling the jewelry for the ultra-villain Charles Korvin (who is stripping her sister in the meantime). You made the customs agents look for the jewelry, and the Health Department looked for it because it is about to depopulate New York. There are no 4th Amendment rights here. Everyone gets upset <br /> <br /> You have to have the right attitude to enjoy a movie like this. I have a brother who scrutinizes the films until death. If they do not meet their Orson Wellian standards, they are ruthlessly bombarded. They must have the excellence as director of a David Lean film, the score of Wolfgang von Korngold, Sound and Art of Douglas Shearer and Cedric Gibbons, respectively. This is not. <br /> <br /> But I have the right attitude, and if you do, you will love this movie.
