** 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. <br /> <br /> Another classic horror film remade with the performance of devil-headed teenagers despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the Vincent Price movie, House of Wax, where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into useless wax figures. Even with the fantastic stage design to turn the whole house into wax, the film is a classic horror remake like the Tobe Hooper classic, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was later remade, despite creativity and action, movie was still a gore image. The director Serra showed a slight enthusiasm with his address, but it's still worth seeing. My final grade 7/10.
