Unlike most people who have commented, I was born after the last episode of Sylvester Mccoy and, therefore, I could not compare the two centuries of doctor that at the beginning. I enjoyed it a lot when Christopher Eccleston took control of TARDIS and the continuation of the series. Since then, I've seen old episodes of Doctor Who and some of them great, but, like the doctor, the series needed to regenerate to continue. The doctor of the 21st century who is very well, I thought that Martha was great, almost a rival for the doctor and if Jack's appearance is something to pass, she will be brilliant when she comes in series 4 or 5. <br /> < br /> Speaking of Jack, the twist of Torchwood is also brilliant and you should see both programs (although this is definitely more suitable for children). However, if you insist that this is not the same and you simply are not Doctor Who, please just stay in your basement. <br /> <br /> 10/10
