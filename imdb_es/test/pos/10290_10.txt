I just watched this movie again, I think for the sixth time. No doubt I will see it many times more. This is one of the brightest French films ever made. Although the film is mysterious, even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director, Gilles Mimouni. For ten years he has not made another film, and this was the only one. The history and the execution of this ingenious film are perfect, and clearly it is paying tribute to Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. The fractional second time of the movements is controlled as carefully as the scene in which the side of a house falls on Keaton in 'Steamboat Bill Junior', and only is not killed by centimeters. In this movie, people crouch, turn and pass each other without noticing, and if they had been a second away, they would have crashed. Therefore, the story travels random events to such an intense degree that you can not look away from the screen for even a millisecond, or you will miss something crucial. The disturbing, though intentionally repetitive, music of Peter Chase is reminiscent of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', and the whole movie has the same strange quality, but while Hitchcock had a woman and two women, Mimouni has two women and one woman, what reverses the structure of the plot. There are references to other Hitchcock films, but it is 'Vertigo' which is fundamental for the inspiration of this film. The subject may superficially seem to be an obsessive love, but the film really is about the magic of the casual events of everyday life, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the ineffable. Everything is hyper-charged with love and passionate desire, but desire transcends its object and fights for something behind and beyond the object. That is why it is so easily transferable from Lisa to Alicia, when she realizes that it is Alicia who is more mysterious than Lisa, and it is Alicia who truly embodies the Eternal Mystery. The film is finally 'made' by Romane Bohringer. She is so fascinating that she eclipses Monica Bellucci, which is really something to achieve, considering that Bellucci is a spectacular beauty, while Bohringer is what the English call "plain". However, Romane Bohringer even at this early date dominated more than the art of "personality dominance", so the beautiful girls stay on the road and are not noticed because Romane is so fascinating that you can not look away from her. her for a long time. Enough even to look at the beautiful girls, and you end up just thinking about her. Most of us remember, I'm sure, his father Richard Bohringer lying in a bathtub listening to opera in the movie 'Diva' many years ago. I prefer to see Romane than Richard lying in a bathtub, but there seems to be a genetic secret to be fascinating, because Richard Bohringer is also fascinating, and not even a woman. Romane looks as if she could become Anna Magnani when she is much older, and that means she will get an Oscar, if someone can only write another "Rose Tattoo". The girl has so much passion inside her that she could set fire to the Seine. Would not it be wonderful if she and Julie Delpy joined? This movie made wonderful use of the places of Paris. But where is this 'square in the Luxembourg'? It seemed to me the place Furstenburg. Maybe I missed something. I have to watch the movie another six times, just to study the precision of the moment and who happens to whom, and make sure I've understood it well. All this is like ten giant simultaneous chess games blindfolded by a great teacher. How exciting everything is! Romane, you can look out my window at any time! Mimouni, come on, let's talk about impossibilities, unpredictations, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that is happening is invisible and how it affects the visible. And once again, we have here the spirit of Breton's novel, 'Nadja', embodied in a great work of French art. Plus! Plus! Plus!
