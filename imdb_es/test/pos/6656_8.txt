I saw Cold Mountain and the English patient again this weekend. The first is a melodrama from the Civil War about Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who leaves the army to return Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) a girl she barely knows. Both films were carefully directed by Anthony Minghella, who does an outstanding job. Although, Cold Mountain is very good, it could have been a great movie with the right cast and a less sumptuous and meaningless dialogue. <br /> <br /> Romantic epics need a compelling heroine. The English patient had Kristin Scott Thomas, who was perfectly chosen as the intelligent, attractive and beautiful Katherine Clifton. The main problem with Cold Mountain is that Ada, who seems silly and unintelligent and lacks that quality, would make you believe that Inman could become obsessed after a kiss. As an actress, Kidman has a limited range, usually playing severe-faced women who face adversity with stoicism. Kidman was too old to interpret Law's wit and love interest. The film needed a young actress who could interpret charmingly, warmly and vulnerable. For someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation, she seemed ridiculously well-fed and overdressed. Kidman was so impeccably groomed that it seemed like she had spent three hours preparing for each scene. Michele Pfieffer in his younger days could have played the role perfectly. Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement. <br /> <br /> Renee Zelleweger was better dressed, but her lively performance took the stage, but maybe she was trying to compensate Kidman. Jude Law was in his own silent film in the role of Odysseus, but he did his part well. Ray Winstone was excellent as the villain of London / South. <br /> <br /> During the Civil War, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and maybe they spoke in monosyllables. However, if you see adaptations of the BBC by Dickens, Austen or Mrs. Gaskill, everyone expresses themselves. Maybe this is not realistic but it would improve my entertainment.
