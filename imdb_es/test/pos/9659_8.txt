It is a film about love, violence, illegal affairs and Romanian magnates. A Romanian story combined with a Western adaptation that results in a modern international film that can be understood both by Western audiences and by Eastern European audiences that HAVE LENGED the oblivion of the conservative communist regime over the making of films. <br /> <br /> A film full of scenes of violent struggle that are very numerous and create increasingly tense situations as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> A story that impresses with its vision of the hard life of the neighborhood. Two young people make illegal car races. They work together as a team and prosper thanks to their occupation, but when a local magnate asks them to lose a race, things start to get dirty and the bomb fuse is lit creating a very tense movie that will keep it close to the field. Screen until the end of it, when you will still ask many questions. <br /> <br /> The brilliant performance of Dragos Bucur and Dorina Chiriac along with the high quality of direction and writing of the screen by young people, but the talented director Radu Muntean also gives a unique charm to Fury. All these and many other elements that can be seen while watching, have created a film that everyone who loves the world's filmmakers should see, and their message is clear to everyone, not depending on the race, the language we speak or the country. It is a real hope for Romanian cinema, as it tries to keep up with the most advanced western cinema. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy watching it as I am sure that all the people who have seen it have liked it. I understood it and I understood it.
