This is my favorite movie of all time! <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this when I was younger and since then I have been in love with her. I used to rent it so often in this video store that I used to take it, and when I moved I could not find it anywhere, so I stay behind to go to the store, so I can watch the movie again! <br /> <br /> I finally found it for sale, I bought it and I saw it again and again ... a great movie! <br /> <br /> Since then, although it was my first DVD, I got it after getting my DVD player ... Well, well, I got them at the same time, the quality of the DVD is much better. I could not believe it! You have to see this one!
