Recently I have seen a zhan. Not because it was a Hong Kong movie, but because it was looking for a change in the films that are produced here in the United States. In my humble opinion, I think the film could easily compete against the action thrillers that take place here, except for the traditional idiocies of the Hong Kong movie. The one that still bothers me was that of chief inspector. I still do not understand why there has to be a complete character, idiot, comic and in relief, even in the serious films that come out of Hong Kong, but I can live with that when the movie is so good. The characters are credible even if the situations they are in are not. The story is fast-paced and really absorbs you. The real cinematic scenes for me were the two bus trips that the thief character takes. In general, a very solid movie.
