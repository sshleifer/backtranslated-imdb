This movie is a gem hard to find! It's the story of Juliette, a perfectly normal cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company, and Romuald, the president of it. He does not pay attention, does not pay attention to anyone until several plots to snatch his company at the opposite, at the same time. He is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers Juliette. Like the cleaning woman, no one pays attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that is smart enough to catch and use to help her helpless and hapless boss. The complications are wild, she is not as common as she seems with five children of five different ex-husbands who are still madly in love with her, and he is not as shrewd as he believes. This movie does not follow a predictable path and that is what keeps you watching. The performance is excellent and there are also some very moving moments along the way. The working class shows more skill than those who are above them, in much the same way that "Gosford Park" showed that the upper crust is not all that has become something mental. I recommend this movie a lot. Look at it! 9/10
