Although it has been a failure in the cinemas because mainly Mylene Farmer, one of the 3 best stars in France did not have the first role. The fans had changed their minds after that and they were waiting for it on DVD. When it was released on DVD this year, it has had tremendous success! The other faults were the slow pace and the incredible duration (3 h) at that time (1994) that bothered the critics. But the melancholic story makes this slow and long time obligatory. The moral of the movie is that you can not escape the death for which you are destined. It is the same theme as in the movie "Final Destination" and turns it into a Gothic tale. The atmosphere is very melancholic.
