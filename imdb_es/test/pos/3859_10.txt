As the mother of a 3 year old boy and a 2 year old boy, I adore AristoCats. It is a film that does not contain double interpretations, almost insulting words like devils or curses, or parents who are functional idiots, or crushing crushing jokes or flatulence that are so frequent in even the "best" children's films these days. . The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the other characters are unique and they attract attention. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. The characters are also pretty good. I love listening to the velvety voice of Eva Gabor, and there are many others that are familiar from childhood and that fit very well with the characters. It is really a movie about love, tolerance, good manners and fidelity. Who does not want their children to be exposed to these values? It is a film that I do not mind seeing it again and again, unlike Happy Feet, where I could not see it even once because it was very irritating. I would like the production companies to move towards making more movies like this one.
