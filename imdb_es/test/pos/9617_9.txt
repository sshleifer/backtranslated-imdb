I was introduced to this film for the first time when I was in San Antonio, Texas. This movie was the 2nd. In a double characteristic. Unfortunately, the theater where I saw it was demolished. Anyway, Five Fingers of Death (also known as: King Boxer), was released in 1972 and introduced in the United States the following year. Like many "other" Kung-Fu movies that were released while riding the "tails" of Enter the Dragon, this particular movie was quite good. It is the story of a country boy who is sent to a martial arts institute to improve himself and improve his fighting skills. Meanwhile, the plans and plans of the martial arts school "opponent" to frustrate our hero, use dirty tactics to try to divert him and try to prevent him from participating in the tournament. By surprise, I thought that since Warner Bros. distributed this movie in the United States, Warner Bros. would issue a DVD. Never happened. As far as I know, this film has been released in English and Cantonese, with subtitles ... the latter is a more "clean and clear" version. Although the fight sequences are a little fun to watch (ie, fly in the air and hit, jump on buildings, a fighter who uses his head ... literally ... to hit his opponent, etc.), without However, it is classic Kung Fu action beautifully planned and executed. If you like Enter the Dragon, Five Fingers of Death would be an excellent addition to any movie collection ... if you can find it.
