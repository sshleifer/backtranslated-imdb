... scratch it. Just like the rhythms created by Africans with the jawbone of an ass and the islanders of Virgin Island welded the oil drums into steel bands that are pleasing to the ears, so did the urban DJs in search of new methods of creative expression . "Scratch" is a completely non-narrated documentary that will take you to the heart of the hip-hop / rap movement and explore the genesis of the tune, the art of scratching vinyl and the ultimate expression of contemporary DJ / MC entertainment. The film reveals some surprisingly clever and articulated "Scratchers" with amazingly unique abilities in concerts and competitions where the rhythm meets the street. Good information for anyone interested in the roots or movements of the ghetto channel in sound art. (SECOND)
