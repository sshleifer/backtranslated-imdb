In one sentence, moral ambiguity. In the remake of Soderbergh, there are good and bad. The character of Benicio del Toro is clearly the good guy, morally clean and incorruptible. His counterpart in the original BBC, Fazal, the farmer turned merchant, has realistic flaws and is in conflict over his fate. The two implacable policemen are equally different.

In the original BBC, they are too enthusiastic, almost obsessive. <br /> <br /> The best time for me in Soderbergh was when the university student rhetorically asked the drug czar: "What would you do if you were poor and rich black people came to your neighborhood in search of drugs? That point was hinted at throughout the BBC show and crystallized in Jack Lithgow's final speech, both of which are excellent, but the BBC rises above the remake, and my conclusion after seeing the two shows is that the traffickers are pawns. innocents who are only supplying a demand, and it is the demand that causes so much suffering.
