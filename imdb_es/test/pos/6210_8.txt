Tom Garner's story begins with his grand funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his lifelong loyal friend, Henry. Henry and his wife debate whether Tom was a great man and a genius or an utterly useless scoundrel. The film is beautifully written, acted and directed, and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Tom was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a great railroad, dominating his board of directors and his competition, terrorizing his employees, killing the strikers. Tom's ambitious wife, Sally, was responsible for all of Tom's success. When he met her, he was illiterate and completely satisfied with his work as a railroad walker. Sally teaches her to read and takes over her walking job while Tom goes to school. It begins to ascend step by step through the railway hierarchy until finally assumes the position of president. <br /> <br /> But when Tom becomes a business tycoon, his marriage to Sally gradually melts away. His spoiled son despises him, and faces a much younger woman (the aptly named Eva), with predictably catastrophic consequences. In his business life, Tom is a total success; In his personal life, a disastrous failure. Like the figure of Hearst in "Citizen Kane", Tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy is excellent in the role of Tom Garner and the business scenes sound authentic. Colleen Moore is also excellent as Sally; both age wonderfully in multigenerational history. The film was written by Preston Sturges, but it is not at all like the comedies for which Sturges became famous.
