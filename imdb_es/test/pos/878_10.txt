Jewel Thief is one of those thrillers of suspense in which the spectators stay guessing until the end who is the villain. The suspense is built from the first scene in which the jewel thief becomes a national problem and there are clues ingeniously hidden in the film so you can guess who the jewel thief is. The story portrays that Dev Anand (Vinay in the movie) and the jewel thief have identical faces. But you get a 1000 watt shock when you finally get to know the villain. There are many surprises and many malicious things in progress, but there is time for romance and six melodious and everlasting songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar and Mohmmad Rafi. <br /> <br /> This movie was also talked about the videos of his song. Consider the taunts and the contrary taunts in Asman Ke Neeche. Or the blocking of the road by Dev Anand when Tanuja went out with her friends in Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara. Or the romantic Dil Pukare Are Are in the beautiful Sikkim. Or the wonderful dance of Vyjantimala in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Add Rulake Gaya Sapna Mera and Raat Akeli Hain and you will never forget this movie for any reason. <br /> <br /> Capable performance of Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Tanuja and Vyjantimala and direction of Vijay Anand (Dev Anand younger brother) makes this one of the most beloved Hindi movies of all time, even today .
