Iron Eagle has always been one of my favorite movies for a long time. It seems that Topgun, but with a different plot and (many people will not agree with me here), in my opinion, is better than Topgun. through the air. He also has the Queen song "One Vision" hitting in the background, which in my opinion is a fantastic song. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Iron Eagle was very good, but its aftermath was garbage. <Br /> <br />
