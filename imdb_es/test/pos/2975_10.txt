When I first heard about this movie, I noticed that it was one of the most controversial films of the seventies. I noticed that the music was by Elton John, so I thought I had nothing to lose, so I got it. What a surprise!!! The movie was incredible. It was true love. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes they had no food, however, they were still happy. I recommended this movie to all my friends, but they all criticized my tastes and even called me names, because the film featured two nude minors. I think that just made the movie more realistic. The cinematography was excellent and only showed the great skills of director Lewis Gilbert.
