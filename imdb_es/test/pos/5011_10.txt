I watched the movie at the Nashville Film Festival on May 1, 2003! It was incredible! All the things I had read about Stuey were portrayed incredibly well by Tony Vidmer (writer, director, producer, editor), Michael Imperioli (amazing work like Stuey) and everyone else involved in this. I am glad that he (Vidmer) has not followed the routine of "Leaving Las Vegas" with Stuey's bad habits, but that he has put us into his life, his family and his gift. Tying the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his ability to write scripts. A great "thumbs up" in this!
