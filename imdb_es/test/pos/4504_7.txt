Can a film be too faithful to the book on which it is based? Judging by the 2007 temporary adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's huge salesman in 2003, the answer is ironically "yes". Like many, I was captivated by the book, an impressive first effort by the Afghan-American writer / doctor. So, obviously, the director Marc Forster ("Stranger Than Fiction") and the screenwriter David Benioff ("Troy"), who pay meticulous attention to the most significant details of the story within the 127-minute length of the film . However, the transparent tapestry of sincere events in Hosseini's novel is often presented as episodic and truncated because Forster and Benioff sincerely try to remain faithful to the reach of history within time constraints. Part of the challenge is how Hosseini carefully used symbolic acts to provide a literary symmetry, from then on, to what is essentially a three-act story, a technique that may appear artificial on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, the filmmakers do the most important things correctly, specifically giving the viewer an intimate look at a hidden culture transmitted so far through the CNN news reports, ensuring authenticity by doing Let the characters speak in the Persian Dani dialect of the Afghan language and capture the emotional. Tangled complex narrative. The first part of the film takes place in 1978, Afghanistan, before the Soviet invasion and the eventual takeover of the Taliban. The focus is on the relationship between Amir, the son of an affluent businessman named Baba, and the devout Hassan, the son of his father's servant. Connected by their mutual love for running kite, the two are thick as thieves until a tragic event separates them irreparably. Unable to find the courage that is so natural to his father, Amir is paralyzed with guilt for not having rescued Hassan from an indescribable act performed by a trio of local thugs. Forster makes ethnic tensions between the Hazara and the Pashtun in Afghanistan especially palpable. <br /> <br /> After the invasion of the Soviet troops in 1979, Amir and Baba fled to the United States, where history takes up its history nine years later. Fremont, California, a suburban enclave of Afghan emigres. Baba is reduced to working at a gas station and operating a market kiosk. Amir meets a local Afghan girl and gets married. This is the least interesting passage of the film, since Benioff's treatment gives little importance to auxiliary characters such as Soraya, Amir's wife, and the most critical is that Amir is portrayed by necessity as a reticent young man with a slant down towards your self-esteem. The final section shows twelve years in which Amir, after the publication of his first book, is summoned back to Afghanistan dictated by the Taliban to rescue Hassan's son from the Taliban, as a means to atone for his cowardice years before. There is a real suspense and fear generated in this part of the story, as the shocking and old known revelations come back to haunt Amir during his trip. <br /> <br /> A British actor of Egyptian heritage, Khalid Abdalla (the main kidnapper of "United 93" has the central role of Amir as an adult, a challenging role, since he has to convey a constant feeling of shame and The other professional actors do better: Shaun Toub (the savior of Tony Stark Yinsen in the current "Iron Man") as Baba's business partner, Rahim Khan, who holds the key to the truth Atossa Leoni silently affecting Soraya, and best of all, the Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi, who brings pride and dignity to Baba Three nonprofessional youths were recruited into the Kabul school system to play the leading roles of the children, and they are all pretty good, Zekeria Ebrahimi is up to the challenge of the toughest part as the young Amir, and Ali Danish Bakhtyari is as touching as Hassan's almost catatonic son, Sohrab, but it is Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada, with an eye Sad and moon-faced, who will break your heart like young Hassan, especially in the devastating grenade throwing scene. It is fair to say that his performance is on a par with the young Enzo Staiola in the classic "Ladrones de bicicletas" by Vittorio de Sica. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are well done, in particular, the clean cinematography of Roberto Schaefer (Western China convincingly substitutes for Afghanistan), the evocative score of Alberto Iglesias, and even the CGI effects shown by the kites in turbulent flight. The 2008 DVD has a solid set of extras that start with an insightful comment from Forster, Hosseini and Benioff, although part of their dialogue seems quite forced. Two functions are included: the first is the "Words of the Comet Runner" of 14 minutes, which focuses on Hosseini's connection with the story and the development of the novel, and the second is the "Images of the kite runner. "25 minutes", a look behind the scenes more standard production.Completing the extras are the original theatrical trailer, some previews and a PSA Hosseini on how to help Afghans in their current time of need.
