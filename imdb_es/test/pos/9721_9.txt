I have not seen these shows for years. I have been looking for years for anyone else who has seen them or knows something about them. I thought I invented them. The one I remember the most is the soldier and death. I would ask the fans of the movie if they had seen them, mentioning that he is a Jim Henson and that people still did not know it. These are great fables. I was very young when I had these, not even 10 and left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs. I would recommend to anyone who sees them, just remember that they are from the 80s so they do not look like today's movies. Just give them a chance. Jim Henson was well ahead of his time and died early.
