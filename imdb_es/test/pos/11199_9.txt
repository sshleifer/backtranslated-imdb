Maybe many viewers who got frustrated with this movie live their lives without even thinking deeply about life itself. What I want to point out here is that "distant" is not just an artistic film, but one of the best artistic films. Of all the art house films that I have seen, "distant" is the one that really stands out as a piece of brilliant gold. It is even fair to say that the cinematography and the representation of the human emotion of this film overcome the nostalgia of Tarkovsky. One commentator correctly understood that sex, a common and common feature among foreign films, is surprisingly absent in "distant" and in a good way. The most notable thing about "distant" is that it captures the details of life that we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that is often buried under the din and visual extravagance of our commercialized world. Fortunately, "distant" does not have much to save the public and what we see on the screen is a naked portrait of human beings.
