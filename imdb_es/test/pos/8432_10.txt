Highly politically charged drama that, although biased, is extremely well managed and one of the most intelligent films ever made. It contains almost no preaching, but follows a naive television reporter who gradually realizes the threat posed by nuclear power plants, not because of inherent danger, but because providers are more interested in the final results than in the safety of those. affected <br /> <br /> Many hated the film because they saw it as a political stretch created by ultra-liberals like Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, but if they see it simply as a drama, it's exciting, exciting, full of well-developed characters. , distinctive and, ultimately, a truly exciting contemporary thriller that comes close to home. <br /> <br /> Historical note: for some, especially for those in the energy industry and the inhabitants of the Harrisburg metro, PA perhaps came too close to home, since less than a week after the premiere of the film, there was the devastating explosion at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility. <br /> <br /> Update, 08/04/2007: In the almost a decade since I wrote this review, I've heard many comments about the film. One thing that I think you really have to keep in mind is that this movie is not the "ultra-liberal" antinuclear tirade that is usually labeled as. <br /> <br /> While the creators and the stars are (or were) notable "Hollywood liberals," what this film is attacking is not the very idea of ​​nuclear energy, but the idea of ​​human greed, corruption and fallibility that call into question the potential dangers of something that nature has already made dangerous. <br /> <br /> No one who accepts reality can argue the fact that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least quite likely to be fatal. Some friends of mine who worked at a nuclear plant for several years even told me about their employer's official policy on the maximum "safe" exposure levels their employees could handle. <br /> <br /> You do not have to believe that corporations are intrinsically bad to accept that individuals, in search of wealth and power, are greedy and often corrupt. And even if you refute that claim, you can not deny that all humans are prone to make mistakes. When it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation, we can not afford any error, and that is, most of all, the argument that this film seeks to present. <br /> <br /> Condemn him if necessary, but try to have some perspective. We are currently engaged in a war whose ongoing results are quite different from those originally predicted, an incredibly expensive war with no end in sight. And whether or not he feels war was necessary to combat global terrorism, he can not deny the reality that the duration, the financial cost and, more importantly, the loss of human lives have far exceeded the levels that the "experts" assured. We return to the year 2003. Then, even if no one is greedy or corrupt, "errors" and errors of quite serious magnitude were committed. The same kind of serious errors, if allowed to arise in the nuclear industry, could make much of the Earth's surface uninhabitable.
