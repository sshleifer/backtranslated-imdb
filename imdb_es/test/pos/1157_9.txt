Why could not it have been the end of the film Sean Connery's men fighting the French instead of the Germans? Since the French had occupied Algeria in 1830, the tribes of Morocco and those of Algeria were making incursions into French civil and military settlements. This film could have been a continuum of that historical aspect where the French had seized the Rasuadli so that their followers were not attacking Algeria, and then their followers had attacked the French to free it. <br /> <br /> The movie The shooting between Germans and Americans is still stereotyped. When the Americans shoot at the Germans, their guns (even guns) make loud noises, create huge bloody bullet wounds, and their enemies scream after being shot. When the Germans shoot the Americans, their weapons do not make great sounds, they do not create bloody wounds, and their enemies make little or no sound after being shot. <br /> <br /> In real life, the American Krag rifle was the worst rifle that America had produced until the first version of the M-16 appeared. The Krag was hard to maintain, unreliable, and the rifle lock was always locked. The German Mauser was one of the best rifles in the world. We were so impressed during the Spanish-American War, that we made a copy and called it the Springfield rifle. <br /> <br /> Finally, the people of Morocco must have an artillery word since the French were using Them in their raids against Morocco. I did not like it when they made the Rasuldai feel stupid because there was no word for artillery in the Moorish vocabulary. Instead, the Rasuadli declared that the Europeans had weapons on wheels that make the ground tremble.
