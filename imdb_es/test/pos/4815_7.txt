*** SPOILERS *** Well made and interesting film about the alienated youth of America in the 1950s. In those days, many fathers who earned a lot of money and who lived at the height of the pig forgot that their children, especially adolescents, they needed much more than a car and a considerable allowance to feel part of the family. They also needed love and attention, due to their growth problems, which is what Hal Ditmar, James MacArthur, 16, never received from his successful film producer, Father Tom Ditmar, James Daly. <br /> <br /> Never really connecting with his father, Hal moves further and further away from him and his mother, Helen Ditmar, Kim Hunter, and society. After his father told Hal that he wanted to borrow his car, a state-of-the-art luxury sedan, he and his friend Jeffery Silver, managed the 1930 kalopy and Hal's operational barley to the local dealer to catch the last movie. from West. <br /> <br /> Eager to attack the world, Hal acts like a real first-class asshole, poking his smelly feet almost into the face of a couple, Eddie Ryder and Jean Corbett, sitting in front of him and Jerry trying . To see the film This leads Hal, as well as his friend Jerry, not only to be expelled from the theater, but also to him and the director of the theater, Mr. Grebbs, Whit Bissell. It turned out that at least Hal was willing to leave the theater, without even recovering his money, but when Grebbs tries to grab him, Hal turns around and ties him in the kiss. <br /> <br /> Hal is now in hot water, is accused of assault and battery, puts himself in his act "James Dean", at the local police station, making it too cool or just plain stupid to realize of what he has done; I almost pulled the teeth of Mr. Grebbs. It's when Sergeant Shipley, James Gergory, tells Hal that his father will pick him up when he finally cares about what he has done. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has Hal trying to straighten out, but he can not because the low esteem his father has of him. He begged his father to understand that what he did, by hitting Mr. Grebbs, was in self-defense, Hal's father acts as if he had been there, in the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son Hal acting as a street thug instead of a young man being gripped and pushed without provocation. <br /> <br /> Without excusing what Hal did, in exposing Mr. Grebbs, he was in fact willing to admit his hooligan behavior but he wanted Mr. Grebbs and his father at least treated him with a bit of consideration. ; Gebbs in the fact that he provoked Hal and Mr. Ditmas without even bothering to listen to him! Feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone, but his mother, to become too much, Hal loses it slowly only to have the sergeant. Shipley and Mr. Grabbs agree to withdraw the assault charge. You might think that, for now, Hal's has finally learned his lesson, but the actual lesson, rather than a stretch behind bars, that Hal so desperately needed was a lesson that his father completely ignored! Being there when his son needed him most and in that Mr. Ditmar failed successfully. <br /> <br /> In fact, things are arranged for everyone in the movie only after Mr. Grebbs is tied, ending with a Butte of a shiner, again by Hal who, returning to the Grebbs theater, He tries to phone his father and tell him that Hal was only defending himself when he first, and not the second, hit him. In the end, Hal learned a real lesson in how to get along with people and not let their problems turn into other people's problems. But, above all, Hal's father, Mr. Ditmar, learned the most valuable lesson of all ways of understanding his frustrated and alienated son and acting as a father to him instead of a combination of jailer and father. of sugar. As the song "Everything you need, love" says to put things on the right track and it was both love and understanding for his son Hal that Mr. Ditmar, until the end of the film, lacked the majority.
