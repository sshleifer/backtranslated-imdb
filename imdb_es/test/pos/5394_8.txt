I'm not going to tell anyone what happens in the end, but it did not fit the movie. The rest of the Imaginary Heroes, however, portrayed a realistic family that was going through realistic problems, such as death, drugs, relationships and high school. I could have sworn they were my own family, it was not a joke. <br /> <br /> Emile Hirsch was completely credible when a teenager struggled with her brother's suicide, and Sigourney Weaver plays a mother who tries to keep the remnants of her (slightly) dysfunctional family together. <br /> <br /> Although this family can take their problems to the extreme, anyone can relate to what is happening, be it graduation, meeting expectations or being a parent.
