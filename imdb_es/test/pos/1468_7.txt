This British documentary was recently shown on Comedy Central during his "Best of ??" week and can also be seen on the DVD of the second season of South Park. I remember seeing many commercials for the DVD that show clips of this documentary, most of which happens with Matt Stone, Trey Parker and some other guy in a jacuzzi. It was funny when I saw it in commercials, but I was already used to seeing it when I saw the real documentary. <br /> <br /> In general, "Goin 'Down to South Park" is quite fun and an interesting look at how South Park episodes are made and the story of the series that goes back to when Matt and Trey had the idea in the university. However, there was something in the tone of this documentary that really felt somewhat depressing. It's not as fast, fast, and as lively as the real episodes of South Park. Instead, it has a slow, dry style, which can sometimes be fun, but most of the time you're just waiting for something to happen. If you have the opportunity to see it, do it by all means, but I do not think you are really missing much if you never see it. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 7/10
