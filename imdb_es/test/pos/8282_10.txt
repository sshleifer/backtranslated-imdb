I loved this movie and I never knew it was as old as it was on the day I was born and now I am 19 years old. I still love this movie, especially the songs like "My Mother" and "Boys and Girls of Rock N". Roll "and I remember when I was a kid I think I was 5 years old, my sister was 6 years old and my cousin (boy) was also 6 years old, we used to pretend to be the characters in the movie, I was Eloner, Janette and my sister, Britania and My cousin was Alvin Simon and Theodore, they were good times and I miss him, having this movie reminds me of good times, since my cousin is old for these things, and me and my sister are not going to forget the squirrel. The squirrel movie I still remember songs and words from memory although I have not seen this movie for 12 years, but now I'm starting to love it again ALVIN AND THE CHIPETAS AND CHIPETAS <3 <3 <3 <3
