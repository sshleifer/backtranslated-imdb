This show is really great. It is smart. It's fun. It is a great performance and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've seen. The dialogues are very funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have great chemistry. You really think they are mother and daughter. This program really showed that mother-daughter relationships do not have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends, but at the same time it shows that sometimes it is very difficult to be more than mother and daughter, especially with Lorelai and Emily. Just look at this program, I recommend it. It's great and definitely the best program in the air. 7 Star Season Tuesday, September 26, 2006, 8 / 7c in the new The CW
