I'll be brief: I usually hate movies like this with poison ... but there's something in this that attracts me and does not let me go. Of course, there are some major flaws (some of the performances are below average at best and the dialogue is sometimes so bad that it's fun) but there are enough redemption features to make it visible until the end. <br /> <br /> But what are they? Well, it has a great little plot, in no way is original, but it is better presented than other films of this type. The three main stars (Whalin, Johnson, Long) performed quite decent performances that more than compensate for the clear lack of quality support cast (the fat police and the coach Quinn really bothered me), and the scripts are witty and witty . (even if it is poor in some places). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, however, this movie is so CUTE: I smiled all the way and has a place in my collection of videos simply because I could encourage anyone. You really have to be a type of insult without humor so that you do not like this (I DARED someone who feels this without smiling!). <br /> <br /> I recommend this if you want a simple, fun, and, above all, a nice watch. You will not regret! <br /> <br /> ~ Top $ ~
