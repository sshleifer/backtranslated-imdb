A little-known strange western with amazing colors (probably the same material that was used in "Johnny Guitar", I guess "Trucolor" or something like that, which makes the blood drops look like bright rubies), almost surreal scenes with action twisted and characters. Something different, far from being a masterpiece, but more attention should be paid to this little jewel in Western encyclopedias.
