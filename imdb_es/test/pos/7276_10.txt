If you like subtle psychological dramas / thrillers, this is a movie for you. Those who want to see an erotic thriller about sex and crime will not understand this movie, as Colin Firth did when he called it "garbage". But Jennifer Rubin is the true star of the movie anyway. She is such a brilliant and beautiful actress! Along with the plot and twist of the story, that becomes increasingly psychological and makes you think of yourself, the wonderful direction, photography and especially music make this movie a masterpiece. Also the small parts are very good, especially Belinda Waymouth is excellent in her little scene. I hope it's released on DVD soon, and that a soundtrack album is a dream come true.
