I just returned from the European premiere of The Gamers: Dorkness Rising. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if you are a player (CRPG, RPG or LARP), then this movie is for you. And if you're not a gamer? Well, it's still very funny. <br /> <br /> The performance is certainly not worthy of an Oscar, but in the whole element of the film adds to the charm. Humor is everywhere, along with some very nice touches (the homage to Gary Gygax is especially well done, if you can see it). The cast is very realistic in its appearance, according to the fact that they are ordinary people who enjoy a common pastime. <br /> <br /> The sound quality and vision of the film are adequate, but once again, everything adds up. to the atmosphere that helps define this film as the movie Dungeons and Dragons, written and made by gamers for gamers. <br /> <br /> They do not fear using system-specific terminology, they still manage to allow product placement to be part of the movie, but in a very understandable and absolutely fair way. It also touches some of the perceived prejudices that some players may have about other players and solves them quite well. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very much directed by a well-planned fair balance of character, plot and entertainment (the Bard has an incredible value for money). <br /> <br /> In the end, it makes the score of this movie quite difficult, so I give it 2 scores. <br /> <br /> Scoring (for those who are not RP'ers): 7/10 (A few moments could miss your head, but the main sections of the film just work very hard and achieve much more). <br /> <br /> Scoring (for RP players): 10/10 (Everything fits, in perfect amounts, and with the perfect charm and feeling)
