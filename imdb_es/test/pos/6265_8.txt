This movie is about so many things. The most obvious thing is the control the film can have over an audience and how to capture life in a movie can be a type of magic. There is also the tense relationship between China and the West, as many Chinese saw (probably rightly) that the "barbarians" try to take over and contaminate their way of life. Liu even seeks to preserve his lifestyle in the film because he sees that one day he will disappear. There is also Liu's internal conflict between China's loyalties and traditions versus Western philosophy of self-determination. All these themes are skillfully interwoven into a coherent and enjoyable whole by Hu. A very nice movie.
