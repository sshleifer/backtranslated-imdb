Funny bad movie that should have fun. One of the latest performances of Joan Crawford as a successful editor driven against all those young and beautiful eager beavers newly arrived from the elite universities of seven sisters. Great atmosphere of the 50's of New York. Wonderful period costumes and hairstyles. Fantastic art direction. A trite story, but tear rousting. Interesting cameo by Robert Evans as a rich cad.
