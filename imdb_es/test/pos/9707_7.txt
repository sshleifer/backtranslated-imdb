Johnny Knoxville has gone crazy. <br /> <br /> In the first Jackass, did he enjoy practical jokes more than physical things? Was your car rental gag opening and the back that involved an air horn on a golf course were they more like some kind of extreme candid camera? but in Jackass: Number two, he's really out of his rocking chair. <br /> <br /> Starting with a sequence in which a bull chases him through the living room, or later, when he sets up a rocket (a trick that almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket), and especially when standing in front of a defense mechanism and carrying a large amount of pellets to the stomach, Knoxville is crazy. In the first movie Bam Margera and Steve-O ?? notorious party animals? They were the most daring, but you know it's pretty bad when you see Knoxville seducing them to do a trick. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a series of tricks achieved by people consumed by testosterone, who constantly try one. one on top of the other Will it eventually end in death for one of the cast members? In Jackass 2, Steve-O almost loses a leg to a shark, Knoxville (as mentioned above) is almost impaled by a rocket explosion, and so on. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed due to the success of 2, and, frankly, I can not imagine any tricks that exceed the bullish run in the opening scene of this film. that's incredible footage. It's almost unbelievable, and I was wondering if it had been faked, but apparently it was 100% genuine. (Which is actually a bit scary.) And in terms of extremes, does Jackass 2 far surpass its predecessor? It also feels more cinematic than the first movie, with less of the cheesy titles that preceded the stunts that became famous on the original MTV television show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the guys were given too much freedom here, and a good number of gags are simply boring exercises in rawness? I can occasionally enjoy the poop joke, but seeing a man break free in a miniature toilet, or seeing Steve-O take beer down his ass (yes, honestly), gets angry after a while. Even the boys of the fraternity in the projection attended? Who was enthusiastic when Wee Man took a game card in the back and was hit by a rigged chair? They were disgusted by some of the scenes in this movie. Is not it a matter of getting away with as much as possible? It's a matter of saying: "Is this even entertaining or fun?" Many times, unfortunately, it really is not. <br /> <br /> But for every lame trick that involves fecal matter and farts on people's faces, there are some bright bits of hidden camera. The crazy director Spike Jonze ("Adaptation") dresses like an old woman and goes out naked, with breasts sunk and without shame. And my favorite masterpiece involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man, going out to lunch with his grandson, allowing him to drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people. That is the classic comedy taken to new extremes with the freedoms of an R-rating. It's a shame they had to ruin all the great things. Including a final segment that involves an elaborate terrorist joke? with poop jokes on the road. <br /> <br /> Even so, there is enough pure spirit and madness in this film to deserve a projection, and it has really taken the concept of limb in cinema to new heights.
