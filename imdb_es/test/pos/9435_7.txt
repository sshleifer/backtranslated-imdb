Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) were hired by the British government to protect the Swiss scientist Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.). He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately, the evil Dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) is working with the Nazis and will stop at nothing to get the doctor, and his invention. It works for a reason - Basil Rathbone. It could be said that he is the BEST that Sherlock Holmes has put on the screen. He plays the character so well (and accurately) that it does not matter at what time he is solving crimes. As for Nigel Bruce as Watson ... everyone has problems with that. He plays Watson like an old fool ... that is NOT the Watson of the books. Seriously, you wonder why Holmes supports it. Even so, he grows in you (in some way). Then there's Atwill having a great time playing Moriarty. The arguments and the battle of wit between him and Holmes are just great! I've never liked Dennis Hoey like Inspector Lestrade, he's an idiot. It makes Watson look like a genius. And Post Jr. is pretty good like Tobel (even though his accent keeps changing in a funny way). <br /> <br /> This movie is elaborate and only lasts a little over an hour. Still, it has slow points and I never understood the section of the secret code. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth catching it only by Rathbone and Atwill.
