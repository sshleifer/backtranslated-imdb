I have not seen a Van Damme movie for a while, it has pleasantly surprised me, it still has it, it looks older, but more rude, like Sly, it becomes more resistant with age. This is a good movie and it has taken me to take a look at all the Van Damme films that I've missed in the last ten years. I would like to see a good director put Van Damme on the big screen with a good argument. Van Damme still has the moves to surprise the audience, the last movie seen with Van Damme was Legionnaire, which was also a good movie. Also, I looked at the story of Van Damme's first matches, and I was also surprised to see that he is the true martial artist very successful in his youth.
