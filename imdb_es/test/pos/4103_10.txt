I am surprised that the production companies demand due to the reproductions that they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all kinds of movies online ... old movies, new movies ... but they all target a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can not get a copy. Maybe if enough people write, the owner of the copyright will get a clue. It's time for this to happen. Yes, it's a date, but so is The Wizard of OZ. It does not seem that this should be so difficult. So, for now, I will continue to see those illegal copies in search engines like many others.
