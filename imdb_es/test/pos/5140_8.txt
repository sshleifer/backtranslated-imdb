I took a group of young people of the same age as the protagonists and attracted us all. I agree with the other post, Wilson's boy turned an ungrateful script into a great secondary character. It is good to have a film for a certain demographic age (too old for PG, too young for R). It also shows how they think and maneuver in high school. You had to love how good Jimmy Buffett was like a great teacher. He kept adults awake. The level of questioning authority of the children remained reasonable. Their motives were specific and not like some A.D.D. rebel. The stage and the music were beautiful. In general, if you enjoyed the holes, this is really similar.
