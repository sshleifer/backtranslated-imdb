Plunkett and Macleane is a wonderful update of the bluff tradition, which precedes Johny Depp and his pirate friends. The tone is cheerful, with a touch of social comment, but nothing too heavy. You can almost see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in this. <br /> <br /> It begins with little speed, with the introduction of the characters and the establishment of the themes of social inequality and rebellion; but, it gets going once the kids hit the roads. The robberies are large and elegant, with romantic touches that are the bread and butter of garbage fans. The actors are committed and help raise a little the material, which is quite empty. The figures do not have much depth, but they touch with so much charm and skill that it does not matter. <br /> <br /> It has been said about modern music. The period music tended to be more serene, which seems out of place. A classical score with Celtic rhythms for the action pieces could work, but the more modern and rebellious music of rock and techno seemed to add an edge to the action. Since the characters are more legends than reality, precision in music seems useless. The pieces tend to adapt to the mood of the scenes broadcast, so that mostly works well. I wonder how they missed the "Stand and Deliver" by Adam Ant. Make no mistake, this is not a serious movie. It is pure escapism and a wonderful lark. Tony Scott shows some of his father's visual style, but I think we're still not going to see many Oscar winks in his career. He seems to understand the material here and pulls out a good movie. Over time, it can be a name to consider. His father took time to mature beyond visual stylization and become a more complete director. This is definitely one that should be taken into account for an entertaining night or for a boogie film festival.
