I served as Corpsman on Parris Island in the late 60s, just over 10 years after "The D. I." It was shot. It was in some of the barracks where they filmed some of the interior scenes. I knew many drilling instructors and many recruits. I think the film is as close as any movie to show the life of a recruit and that of a Mock Instructor. Undoubtedly, I think it's the best that Jack Webb did. If you've been in the military, you need to watch this movie. That's how it was. It shows how important it is to take a group of raw recruits and turn them into men ready to defend our country. One feature that I found fascinating is that most of the characters are played by real marines, not actors.
