This was recommended to me by a friend who told me he was cute and cute for a "Lesbian Sexuality Movie". Chico was wrong. I guess he just did not understand it. Growing up without understanding and then discovering yourself through trial and tribulation is more similar. <br /> <br /> The characters are full and vibrant and the story has enough fun in the theatrical performances to keep everyone interested. <Br /> <br /> Rachael Stirling as "Nan" goes through so many attempts to find the love she wants, only to discover that she was the only person she was afraid to reveal everything, and ran away. Johdi May as "Flo" was remarkable. I spent a couple of hours trying to remember where I had seen her before, only to discover that she was the quiet sister "Alice" in "The Last of the Mohicans." Fortunately, I grew up in a liberal family and had no trouble trying a movie. I like this. A lot of people are getting lost in movies like this. I'm glad I took my friend's advice and tried it. But, I'm sure I enjoyed it more.
