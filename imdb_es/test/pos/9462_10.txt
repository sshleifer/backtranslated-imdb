This film is about Viola (Amanda Bynes) and her quest to beat the Cornwell boys team at her school after they ejected the women's team. So she goes to the rival school Illaria and joins the men's team, in doing so she falls in love with Duke (Channing Tatum) who thinks he is a boy and likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Viola as her brother. <br /> <br /> I was in a version of the work of night 12 and the beginning was very modern. So I knew the play well. I was very excited to see this movie and when I saw it, it exceeded my expectations. I kept many of my favorite lines and could see great connections with the work. Although it was like the work, it was not so complicated. It was also more a chicken movie than I expected, but it was good. It was very funny. It attracts you to a lot of crazy love stories and lies. You saw how Viola (Amanda Bynes) mistakenly thought about what the boys thought and their complications when living in a world of boys. He also sees his roommate, Duke (Channing Tatum), impression of this. I really liked seeing the characters portrayed in a modern way. It also tells the modern theme "Follow your dreams", but this time it has a twist. I think this movie was a great movie about a girl who loved football and defended herself, her family and her dreams. I think this movie will be the great opportunity for many rising stars.
