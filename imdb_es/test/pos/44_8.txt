Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some quite unusual people. <br /> <br /> The editing and the soundtrack really drag you into the story and allow you to experience the film the way the writer really wanted it to look. <br /> <br /> The music really linked to The Story, which made the characters come alive. The edition made the story more progressive and captivating. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast, particularly S. Epatha Merkerson's. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see a man's show with this movie The writer, ruben santiago-hudson.
