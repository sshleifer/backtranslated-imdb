This parody is cleverly done: from the songs (Express Yourself becomes Expose Yourself, Like a Prayer is now Party in my Pants and Vogue now Vague) to the fake interviews of the cast of the show, this movie is hilarious. Remember Madonna said she did not know about the rainy season in Asia? In this, she does not know about the volcano season. It is a precious jewel. They got a lot of money in that parody, and it's worth it. Highly recommended !!!
