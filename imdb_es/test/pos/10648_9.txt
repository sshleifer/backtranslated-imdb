This film is a point of reference in the history of unconventional cinema. The use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtapositions of Strike (Eisenstein's first film). Take the scene on the steps and watch the repeated firing of the soldiers descending, to reiterate the point of the horrors that really happened! A very intelligent monumental film, a must for all film students.
