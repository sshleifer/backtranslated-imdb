She's the Man was the funniest movie I've ever seen. I laughed so much I was crying. It was also very romantic. Channing Tatum is absolutely beautiful and can really act. Surely it does not hurt that he also has enough scenes without a shirt. Channing and Amanda have incredible chemistry and they were absolutely wonderful together. I love this movie. When you look, make sure you look at the last deleted scene. It was a big mistake to cut that scene because it's one of the best scenes in the movie. I recommend this movie. Amanda has never been more fun. And Channing is going to be a great star. This is just the first of many for this brilliant new star.
