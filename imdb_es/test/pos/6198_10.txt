I'm not sure how it could have been better, so I gave it a 10. The performance was excellent (the main woman was very HOT), the guy who played Darwyn was a thoughtful, hot and thoughtful character, showing internal confusion I was suffering. (The death of the driver of the truck is an example) excellently. The story was believable and the length of the series was almost right (ie, I love Lost, but will it ever end?). As a Brit, I tend to think of Yanks as gung ho. The Los Angeles Police Department was in its ill-advised attempts to arrest him, but the other agencies were portrayed positively. My main thought about programs like this (and the also excellent 24) is: could it happen? Will it happen? Is it happening now? Possibly, probably. <br /> <br /> I hope they do another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it would seem that no. <br /> <br /> To summarize: if you have not seen that, be sure to do it.
