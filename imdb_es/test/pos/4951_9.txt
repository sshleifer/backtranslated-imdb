I really like the opening of the film, when Colonel Ted Masters realizes on his combat radar that four enemy planes were approaching from 10 o'clock. The good news is that the film does not mention from the beginning that the colonel, along with a fighter who was a lieutenant, was trying to do an exercise of "freedom of navigation" along the eastern Mediterranean Sea, but it was a little too much. beyond the area of ​​restricted airspace reserved for an unscrupulous Middle Eastern nation, as they accidentally fly through it. <br /> <br /> I also like everything that is interspersed in the Colonel's combat radar readings and on computer screens when the enemy aircraft aggressively takes the two American fighter pilots in a compromise for violating their air space. That first dog fight reminds me immediately of the famous fighter pilot movie, "Top Gun". From the depilation of the enemy bandits to the thirty-millimeter rounds of the enemy plane that hit the colonel's jet engines and forcing the plane to go down, forcing it to eject, all this reminds us of one thing ... the hunting techniques of Dogs can keep him alive. ... but a false move can make you topple. <br /> <br /> The only problem in the movie was the "snake sequence" scene. It was a bit too long Yes, the opening of the movie was great when you see the conflict ... that was the confrontation of dog fights. Only when a child tells Doug Masters that his father was shot down after the Cessna planes landed in the "snake" race, forces us to return to the moment the conflict began. I guess the sequence of snakes in the middle should be interrupted a bit by Colonel Masters who was dragged by the wives in the middle of the Bilyad desert on the way to the detention center ... while the musical sequence for the "snake" continues . The movie does not ... if it was, the details of the conflict would have been softer at that time. Still good otherwise. <br /> <br /> When it was learned that Colonel Ted Masters' trial for high treason (which violates territorial air sovereignty) had ended and he was sentenced to be hung by hanging in three days, Doug Masters decided to enter action. With the Air Force having useless attempts to save the man, Doug decides to attract his friends and Colonel Sinclair (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) for a plan to rescue the Masters. With a high risk of facing a court martial and spend more than a year in a military palisade, it goes against the policy of the Air Force and makes a plan to rescue the Masters without the consent of the government of the United States. <br /> <br /> Doug and his friends sneak into several classified areas of the base to get a lot of stuff in the area where Masters is found for the next run, and the surroundings of Bilyad (which turns out to be a false country of the Middle East for the movie). One plan included firing firecrackers out of the darkroom area of ​​the Air Force as a detour to get classified photos and maintenance material on the fighter plane, combat base, intelligence and all the other military things around Bilyad. <br /> <br /> When all was said and done, and Sinclair studied all the intelligence, he almost rejected that plan because Doug was too arrogant. I did not realize what they were going to do abroad until they got the two F-16s and tried a dry run at a shooting range. I noticed that Doug's shots and bombs are not good until he hears rock music. I can remember when he threw a Mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target and the bomb went down by 20 feet ... I realized that Doug is unusual. He likes music when he fires ammunition. <br /> <br /> The last part of the conflict, the final combat action in "Iron Eagle" was better than the Top Gun climax of hostile dog fighting sequences. I liked the way the final conflict developed, especially when Doug Masters confronts an Ace fighter pilot from the Middle East who actually ran the trial against Ted Masters. Short but sweet when Doug pulled the enemy fighter after a second attempt with a side winder missile. It seems that this colonel of Bilyad was similar to "Darth Vader" in Star Wars ... in the air, it can be very evil, because if you've seen Star Wars, Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker, who was a pilot pilot in space . Unusual connotation for this, but it still works!
