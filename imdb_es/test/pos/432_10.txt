I'm not a fan of musicals, but I'm a big fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this movie on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised, even waiting for the greatness of the classical director. This movie is BEAUTIFUL. The shots are like oil paintings with movement, something that many directors fight for Renoir MASTERS. I can not express how much this movie transcends ... it's not really a musical, it just has a couple of well-placed musical numbers and a great dance ending. But there is something in this particular movie that makes you feel an absolute JOY when you look at it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of foreign art movies, but I'm also a fool who loves things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger Films. Things that are too happy or "la la land" turn me off very easily, but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is irresistible, not to mention that every painting is magnificent and the plot is good. 10 out of 10
