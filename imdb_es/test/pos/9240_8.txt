I must also apologize for a somewhat biased opinion of this effort, since I contributed to the soundtrack. Still, I received my copy, I laid back and enjoyed the cast of characters that were perhaps more colorful than the characters they were creating in this story of a sequel to Shanghai. For those who believe that George Bush is a "credible Texan," one should not look beyond this film to destroy the image that Texas is full of driving trucks, one-size-two buffaloes. The cast contains some of the most intelligent, quirky and humorous people you'll find anywhere while spinning their stories of agony, happiness and disappointment by going for a great movie sequel, no budget, guerrilla style (ie, " punk rock style "as each person helps define). <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary made with passion and courage and all the poison you will need to move to the other side of any bs and double discourse industry you are dealing with (note the authors, painters, musicians and fellow filmmakers). It goes back to the credibility of the first wave of American hardcore music when the term "D.I.Y." It was the standard, a period in which courage, passion and commitment mattered much more than technique, style or precious calculations. It's not that there is not much technique or style for this ... the tone of the documentary is quite refreshing. Editing cuts provide both drama and the dialogue it contains. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​creating a documentary from the sad demise of the cast, the initial intention of the team and the director is brilliant, totally Texas and absolutely punk rock. In the truest sense of the term.
