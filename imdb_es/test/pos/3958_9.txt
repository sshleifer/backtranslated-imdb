The films that belong to the genre "film noir" usually contain similar elements: a twist of the plot "deus ex machina" that drives the main character to become bedlam, a beautiful but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, a lot money, a lot of brutality, and usually an outcome in the desert. Think of "High Sierra" or "White Heat." <br /> <br /> There is a lot of hard and fast black cinema out there. But when black film is good, you can not take your eyes off the train collision of human lives. <br /> <br /> It is this last tradition to which "Punto Ciego" belongs. The film follows Danny Alton, a troubled teenager (superbly portrayed with depth, grace, emotional integrity and sincere frankness from James Franco, who is completely involved in this role) who has fallen in love with Streetkid, Darcy. /> <br /> From the beginning, you know that this is going to be bad. <br /> <br /> Darcy invites Danny to his house. But the house is empty and for sale, and there is a bloody check for thousands of dollars on the floor. Danny is robbed of his clothes and belongings, but uses the check to track the suicide April, Darcy's other lover. When they arrive at Darcy's real home, they find Wayne, a bully who is looking for Darcy for the money he has stolen. Together, the three manage to locate Darcy in a dusty and run-down motel in the desert. But that's just the beginning of the story, as plastic explosives, drugs, the use of weapons, a spooky funeral home, bisexual murderers and a half-finished house in the desert bring events to an explosive head in an alley in front of a tattoo parlor. The Angels. <br /> <br /> This movie contains some of the best movies I've seen in years. In one scene, Danny runs on foot through the desert to the half-finished house in the desert where he believes Darcy may have been captured that night by the gangsters. A very long shot with crisp lighting effects shows Danny: arms and legs are shaking, palpable fear etched on his face (visible even at this distance), a cloud of dust trails behind him as the wind whips in his direction, running through the plains of the desert towards the house The loneliness, the desperation, the desperation that Danny feels is scandalous. There are many of those scenes in this movie, beautifully created by the experienced Maximo Munzi. This is an Oscar winning material. <br /> <br /> The edition, too, is simply amazing. The film contains small moments in which the characters get a vision of themselves or their situation. Bits of time, where memory and feeling flood again. At this time, quick montages of images appear on the screen. This is an excellent edition by director-writer-editor Stephan Woloszczuk. In a first montage, Danny describes the wonderful feelings he has now that Darcy has entered his life. Quick pictures of Danny's diary appear on the screen: the words "4 life", "luck" and "sure" stop momentarily, while page after page of words, the content of a human heart, runs across the screen - out of focus, too fast to read. It's like the flood of emotions that Danny himself feels. <br /> <br /> The flood of images reveals something else about this film: how beautiful Nathaniel Waters' production design is. Darcy's quartets-hut house is the perfect combination of high tech and slob (a tribute to stage decorator Kimberly Foster). The stunning scene of the desert house is simply creepy. The ruined motel where Darcy hides can be found in any small abandoned city in America. The creepy funeral home (and surprisingly lit) where the plot takes a horrible turn mixes the harshness with the mantle of death that hovers over the entire film. (It is a pity that the lighting director of the film is not credited). This film has an excellent production design, one that improves each frame and the performance of each actor. <br /> <br /> That's the fourth element of this movie that makes you grab and hold on to you: acting. James Franco is an excellent actor. Even in "Spider-Man," where he was given virtually nothing to do, Franco showed that he understands human emotions like no other actor of his generation. He is not a pretty boy who slips by his good looks like Brad Pitt. Franco portrays deep emotion with all his strength. Their performances contain a pure human heart. Consider the scene in the phone booth outside the funeral home, where Danny collapses after telling April and Wayne that Darcy is dead. The minor actors could not carry out the complete emotional breakdown of a human being. Franco does it. <br /> <br /> Shawn Montgomery, in his first film, simply surprises you with his performance as the suicide bomber in April. Deeply in love with Darcy, suffered a massive depression after having to bury her unborn child alone (after the fetus aborts spontaneously) in a box of perfumes in the woods, her life of luxury and perfection is now a disaster: April is one of the best I drew characters in the movie I've ever seen. While Danny's relationship with Darcy slowly filters through the film, April's nervous breakdown reveals itself only to the audience. Neither Danny nor Wayne seem to be particularly interested in her as a human being. April's despair when she realizes that Danny has also been Darcy's lover is moving and powerful, even if it is truncated by the character's total inability to feel any emotion for long. Montgomery brings to April a pathos that puts your heart through the squeegee. <br /> <br /> Mark Patrick Gleason has the hardest job in the movie: having to do something human and real to the bully, Wayne. At first, Wayne is simply one of any number of violent, malicious, obsessed with drug dealers / arms dealers who appear in any number of movies (from "Kindergarten Cop" to "Beverly Hills Cop 2"). Gleason is doing very well with what he's been given, but he does not get where you feel about Wayne. It is difficult to say if this is the Gleason problem or the material. There is a moment, in which Wayne (who is Darcy's brother, although Danny and April do not know it) reads Danny's diary and realizes the sexual and emotional bond between the two men, in which you only know that Wayne it will become homophobic. Danny's ass But the explosion never comes. (Thanks to God! The threads are death for the black movies). Once the revelation about the brothers reaches the end of the film, the audience is amazed to realize the depth of love and compassion that Wayne really felt for Darcy, so deep that Wayne accepted. Danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother. But all this happens off the screen. Gleason never has the opportunity to represent Wayne's feelings. It must have been very frustrating for the artist. <br /> <br /> The story is quite inventive, although it is likely that the smuggling device seen at the end of the film reminds viewers of "Diamonds Are Forever" (yes, James Link). A traditional narrative voice over (which proves that Franco is a great broadcaster and a physical actor) provides a fabulous atmosphere, although it tends to flow into the schmaltz a few times towards the end of the movie (providing an unintentional laugh)) . Fabulous locals play key visual roles in the movie. Congratulations to the location scanner for finding such amazing buildings! The end of the film seemed a bit hasty; do not pat, but a little too firm for my black film tastes. <br /> <br /> Now, I have seen people who hate or love the "Blind Spot". Modern film audiences, exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence, often have little appreciation for the subtleties of film noir. My suggestion is to take a small group of friends who do not see the laughter as despair, emotional collapse, despair or depression. Take them to a small theater, where you can glory in the spectacle of the vision of the film, but your audience will not be ruined by a crowd of people who will not recognize good black cinema. Get them popcorn (believe me, they'll be so engrossed that they will not finish it), get them a soda and let them overwhelm. Go somewhere bright and cheerful later, to clean the dirt and restlessness of your soul. Because this movie is so good to make you feel, you will need that restorer.
