Bob Cummings is excellent at this, since this technically brilliant Hitchcock film does not really get fame like some of his other films, but it is very visible even today. Priscilla Lane demonstrates in this case that she can defend herself with other blondes who worked with Hitchcock later. She just made a handful of movies after this, which makes her almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> There are sequences in this that will remind the viewer of the arrangements in later films of the director. The performance is so well done and the story so well done that this film is still very entertaining today. Each person in the cast performs well. There are several fantastic backgrounds in the film in black and white. <br /> <br /> This was the first Universal movie for Hitchcock. In the long term between the feature films he made at Universal, plus the television series, Hitchcock would win both the box office for the studios and anyone who worked there. This fact is lost in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Norman Lloyd is considered to be the real villain in this movie. The story is going really well, including the only western sequence filmed by Hitchcock. This film is very good, with a great work on the part of all those involved in its realization.
