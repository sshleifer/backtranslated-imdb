Anyone who criticizes 'Jacqueline Hyde' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that is intended to be, is simply not playing with a full deck. Just for the title, it is obvious that this low budget horror comedy should not be taken seriously ... it is as ironic as the French kiss of a nympho, and so exciting. The female members of the cast are great and fun to watch. Look at this, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown prince of soft core horror. Unlike most horror movies, this one is entertaining with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses. The film does not even try to follow the plot of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, but seeks all possible means to create visual jokes and erotic situations. Blythe Metz, the dark woman who plays the sexiest and most murderous side of Jacqueline, is a true knockout. Look and enjoy!
