I'm NOT one of those who like those anime cartoons (eg Pok√©mon, Dragonball Z, Naruto), but Zatch Bell is different in my opinion. Zatch Bell is more exciting, has better characters and does not focus as much on a kind of weapon or Mamodo as the episodes I've seen, like episodes "Big Brother Kanchome", "Zatch vs. Kiyo" .Zatch Bell really focuses in the life of The Strange Zatch, The Smart Kiyo, The Clueless Suzy, and WeIrD Ponygon.Zatch Bell is probably my Fav Cartoon for now, but I encourage others to watch 1 Episode, it's likely that you like it! <br /> <br /> -Robbie H.
