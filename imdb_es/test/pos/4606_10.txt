This is the last thing, and I mean the last thing, CLASSIC ADVENTURE! The plot is good against evil. There have always been a lot of films that represent gray areas, and not enough about the basic good versus evil to explain the real cases of good versus evil in the real world. Only recently have the filmmakers tried to match the odds. In real life, more than half of the situations are black and white, but only a fraction of the films make it look like that. This movie is the best example of a back and a white look. It looks better in black and white. The hero is in the worst situation. He is in the territory of a man who wants to kill him, and among several enemies. The film gives the feeling that it is totally outnumbered and can not count on the help. Your enemy (the count) has many resources. The count's wife was forced to marry him, and she knows from her past history that sooner or later she will kill her like all his wives. She and the hero become allies and fall in love, which could be won by anyone watching (unless that person just wants to be a contrary brat). Anyone who helps them is killed. They have no escape. The situation is desperate. So will they survive in the end? You will not guess unless you've read spoilers. The film also has a great atmosphere, adventure and intrigue, along with Lon Chaney as a bad guy, and Boris Karloff in his best role, as a decent guy. Usually considered a bad guy, Karloff was at his best when presented with more complex roles like this. Chaney rarely received a complex role, although he excelled in some films like "Of Mice and Men". This is little more than a cameo to him. Still, the tension never stops. There is suspense and danger in everything. Perfectly written, perfectly fused and perfectly directed. This is what a movie should be: pure escape, pure adventure.
