This is a reflective film that exposes the inequalities of the so-called upper class and those who work for them, those who have and those who do not. Robert Shaw does creditable work in his role as a proper and helpful driver, Steven Ledbetter, who helps Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) overcome her mental depression from the start. However, Steven has many mixed feelings regarding this lady of the upper class. He inevitably falls in love with her, which of course is surpassing the social limits that separate them. <br /> <br /> I have not read anything before this and I only judge the film as I have seen it. I consider it a very honest story about the realities of daily life and the conflict of what we might want or expect from life and what we receive. It is a good drama that is worth seeing again.
