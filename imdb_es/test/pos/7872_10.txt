I saw this at Sundance one of the first years I attended the festival - it left me impressed ... <br /> <br /> It happened very fast, and I could never find it again. I thought it would appear in a compilation somewhere, but still it was not a joy. My memory is blurred in the details: I only remember being surprised again and again, and on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Does anyone who reads this have any clues? Online, DVD, copy of abused VHS: I would try to make it worthwhile ... <br /> <br /> Over the years, I have probably seen more than 200 short films (I used to live near Aspen). Where they have an amazing Shorts Festival in April). This is definitely among my favorites, and I hope to see it again! <br /> <br /> Thanks a lot to everyone who has clues on how to see it :)
