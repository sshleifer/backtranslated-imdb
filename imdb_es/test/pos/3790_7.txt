The big names of the cinema tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandistic image is part of his contribution, although the war was almost over at the time of its launch. The vagabond goes to war, performs with humor acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the ass. It's a very funny movie, although I do not think it's one of the best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his best start for First National before he made his first masterpiece 'The Kid'. They are his first three reelers, which contain sustained and more elaborate gags than those he could normally orchestrate in his two-reel shorts at Mutual. <br /> <br /> It can be difficult to balance a war message with the slapstick antics and burlesque scenes on the front, but one would not think of watching "Shoulder Arms". It is also preferable in many aspects to a "more serious" dramatic work with a similar message, such as Griffith's 'Hearts of the World'. Chaplin had become a true virtuoso of the film comedy at this time; He makes it look effortless. I knew very well that a movie with less jokes (with more elaboration, refinement and careful timing) could be better than any Keystone-type farce with a dozen raids per minute. The sequence in which Chaplin disguises himself as a tree is a relevant example. Even with furious wars, Chaplin can raise the spirits of millions.
