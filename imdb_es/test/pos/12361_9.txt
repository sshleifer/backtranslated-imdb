The last person who dies before the New Year is cursed to drive the Phantom Carriage for a whole year, collecting the souls of the dead. <br /> <br /> I saw a scene from this old Swedish horror movie on Youtube. , and decided to track the entire movie. It was worth the trouble finding it, because it is an absolutely incredible movie by the time it was made. It has a wonderfully mysterious atmosphere. The old horror filmmakers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, many of today's filmmakers do not seem to understand how important the environment and atmosphere are, and opt for the fears of cheap jumps. The visual effects are excellent, considering their production date. If you can find a copy of this, I recommend you give it a watch. 9/10
