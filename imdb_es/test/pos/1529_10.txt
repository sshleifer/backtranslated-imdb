Rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion. What makes this movie so disturbing is that the drama feels so real, it's almost hard to remember that it's just a movie. This is, by far, the performance of their careers of Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman. The movie almost feels like a theatrical production in the way it is represented and lit. The only bad thing about this movie is that it is very difficult to get a copy. I have not seen it yet in Laserdisc. This truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and a special DVD editing treatment. It's really that good.
