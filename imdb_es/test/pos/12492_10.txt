"Quai des Orfevres", directed by the brilliant Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a film to treasure because it is one of the best exponents of post-war French cinematography. M. Clouzot, adapting Steeman's novel, "Longtime Defense", shows his genius in the way he sets the story and in the way he interconnects all the characters in this deeply satisfying film that, as DBDumonteil has pointed out in this forum, shows how influential Cluzot was and how much the next generation of French filmmakers, especially Claude Chabrol, is in debt to the maestro. <br /> <br /> Armand Thirard's black-and-white cinematography has been superbly transferred to the Criterion DVD we have recently seen Working with Clouzot, Thirard takes full advantage of the dark tones and shadows in most key scenes. The music of Francis Lopez, a man who created light music and operettas in France, works well in the context of the film, since the action takes place in the world of music halls and nightclubs. <br /> <br /> Louis Jouvet, who is seen as a police detective, is perfect in the part. This was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of French theater. Jouvet clearly understood the mechanisms for the creation of his police inspector, who is wiser and can thoroughly analyze the souls of his suspects and finally steals the show from others. In an unfair comment from someone on this page, Jouvet's inspector is compared to Peter Falk's television detective Columbo. Frankly, and without disrespecting Mr. Falk, it's like comparing a good champagne with a good house wine. <br /> <br /> Bernard Blier is perfect as the jealous husband. Blier had the kind of face one could associate with the man consumed by the passion that his wife Jenny Lamour has awakened in him. Martineau is vulnerable and does not act rationally; He is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong, since he is in the middle of a crime he did not commit, but all the evidence points to the opposite. <br /> <br /> The other great character in the movie. It's Dora, the photographer. It's clear from the way she interacts with Jenny, where her true interest lies. Simone Renant is tragically attractive like this woman with problems and makes a huge contribution to the film. Suzy Delair, who plays Jenny, is attractive as the singer who suddenly jumps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts men like Brignon, the old libertine. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best Clouzot directed during its A distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way it brought together all the elements.
