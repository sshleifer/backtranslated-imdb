I caught this at the IndieFest in Chicago and I have to say that YOU ARE ALONE is much more fun than the other comments and even the website would lead you to think. No, HA HA Wedding Crashers' funny, but sick, twisted, I can not believe she said that, but it's so damn funny. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl, who deservedly won the Best Actress, is amazing to watch. There's never a time when you think, oh, I'm watching a movie and she's an actress. She is too real for words. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are 2 scenes in which I'm still laughing, and I'm not going to give them away, but in one of them she's in the bathroom talking about how much she earns. paid for the performance of a certain service and how "impressive" it is. (I almost wonder how many people in the audience are thinking the same secretly!) <br /> <br /> In another, she talks about a definition of "sex" of teenagers against an adult, and if not, the Truer dialogue that I've heard in a movie in a long time, I do not know what it is.
