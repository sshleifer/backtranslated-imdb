The first time I saw this film at the Istanbul Film Festival was in 1994. It was so good that I took a couple of friends and saw it again the same week. The characters are very well interpreted and the humor here and there is incredible. Surely it is a very powerful gay movie. Some scenes make you feel that you are watching an episode of Friends with much more sophisticated lines. I guess I'll put it in my VCR and see it again tonight ...
