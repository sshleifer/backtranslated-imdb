Honestly, this is one of the BEST horror movies I've seen in my life. I was captivated by the story, petrified by Captain Howdy and on the edge of my seat during the entire trip. I really do not understand all the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> The configuration has already been discussed in depth; Captain Howdy is an online predator who organizes meetings with teenagers, abducts them and presents them with his favorite hobby of body modification and piercing. Dee Snider is Captain Howdy and is one of the most terrifying psychopaths ever created; perhaps the most frightening because it is so human and you have the feeling (especially if you like body modification) that there really are such people in the world. <br /> <br /> But the most important reason why I liked The movie and the reason why it's so horrible is that Captain Howdy becomes the hero. At the beginning of the film, the roles are clear; The victims are innocent, the policeman is the good man and Howdy is the pure evil. For the second act, however, things have changed a bit. You want Howdy to be evil, but it turns out that he's really just a victim of circumstances and maybe the good and the bad are not obvious. It is scary to find yourself encouraging the "bad guy". <br /> <br /> A couple of people have mentioned that Strangeland should have been divided into two separate films. To be sure, there are definitely two separate "acts", but this movie works very well because the two acts have their backs. The first act is the typical psycho-thriller, but the second is the most disturbing due to the reaction of the spectators to the situation. I do not think it would have worked the same way if the second act expanded and became a sequel. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of horror movies, I recommend this movie. It's the first horror movie that has given me nightmares.
