Of course, entering it, one would expect it to be a typical and stupid T & A movie, and it is. But it really has some pretty well-designed humorous moments. Given the era in which it was made and the obvious aspect of exploitation, it is still one of the best B-comedies of the time. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, you will very obviously see inspiration for many. of the scenes in "The Revenge of the Nerds" and many other movies of the same genre. Most of the acting is horrible, and way above, but that's exactly what I expect in a movie like this. What he lacks in terms of his ability to act, he more than makes up for with his camp value and his total disregard for anything of merit. <br /> <br /> The surprising thing about this movie is that there was obviously some money. that came into it Movies like this made today do not have the same style. If you can turn off your brain and increase your sense of humor for an hour and a half, you will enjoy this movie. I dare that nobody finds at least SOMETHING in this movie that thinks it's funny, if not funny.
