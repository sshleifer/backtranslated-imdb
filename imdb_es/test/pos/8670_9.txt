Yesterday I saw this movie and I can not stop thinking about it. I moved to Norway four months ago, and since then I have tried to find the source of the strange emptiness I felt. When I saw this movie, I was surprised by the brilliant image of this society. Yes, all this is true! I also found an excellent job with an excellent salary, and I live with my Norwegian boyfriend in a nice apartment in the center. But, until now, everyone I've met has left me with that feeling of bad taste and emptiness that I've never had before: this is what this film is about. Dinners with nothing to say, but comments without emotion, long silences, no stress, a creepy calm and icy smiles of kindness. This Scandinavian nightmare is perfectly represented in Den Brysomme mannen. Watch this movie !!!
