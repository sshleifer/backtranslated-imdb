With the Nazi rise to power in Eastern Europe in the late 1930s, Charles Chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction to it. The catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication that refers to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin created a parody of Hitler that is as funny as it is sometimes terrifying. The film traces Hitler's experiences in the German army from the First World War to the present day. Simultaneously, Chaplin plays a Jewish barber who dresses like the vagabond who leaves a hospital after a long time, only to discover how different the world is under Nazi rule. <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife in At that time, plays a Jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie has an excellent supporting role, Oscar nominee, as a Mussolini impersonator (Benzini Napaloni) who gives Chaplin Hitler's character, Adenoid Hynkel, a lot of attacks. Henry Daniell is his usual seriousness as Garbitsch, principal advisor to Adenoid Hynkel. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his screenplay and performance. The film was also nominated for best film. <br /> <br /> Chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and others not so well known. He financed the entire film with great risk due to the theme, and so far no other important films about Nazi Germany were made. The film spent about twenty-one months in production with Chaplin even rebuilding a set and re-recording a scene so that everything went well. At the time of the film's release in October 1940, the war in Europe was underway and Hitler conquered one country after another, so the film became much more current in its release than when production began. <br /> <br /> There is not much plot in watching the movie in hindsight; The film looks more like a series of comedy sketches and / or setbacks together to achieve an independent purpose of the film itself. Several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the encounter between Hynkel and Napaloni. The scene is very very funny, but it does not lead anywhere in terms of the plot. In the same way, the escape of both the hairdresser and Schultz simply leads to the wrong identity of the hairdresser for Hynkel in order to give Chaplin (through the character of the hairdresser) an opportunity to pontificate before the public at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to make a point about narcissism than Aryan superiority than to have a Jewish barber confused with Hynkel? <br /> <br /> Even so, the film contains many comic moments, like the rally speech, the new developments of the war (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the world scene dancing, the currency in the pudding scene and the complete stage between Hynkel and Napaloni (including the scene of the barber chair) to highly recommend the film. Nor can we forget the risks assumed by Chaplin to make his first talking film, an anti-Nazi film and finance the film himself. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
