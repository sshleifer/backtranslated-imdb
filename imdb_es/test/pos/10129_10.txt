The radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt, in his heart, it was the right thing to do. The viewer will be forced to wonder what he would have done. The adversity faced by coach Jones and Radio was tragic and predictable. The people did not understand; They did not want to understand either. But in the end, the power of circumstance forced people to understand and appreciate much more than they did before it happened. Radio is a young person with mental problems who understands very little, in addition to three of the most important things that are often forgotten as we mature: intuition, compassion and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who can not ignore the plight of the underdog who only try to play a bad hand of cards the best way he knows. It was sad how they met Coach Jones and Radio. The practical joke that terrorized life outside of Radio was enough to make you want to punish severely, not only the children involved, but all the children who knew what was happening and did nothing about it. However, on the positive side of the scale, the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives the way most of us believe it only happens in movies. This movie is a real-life fairy tale that should not be missed. Ed Harris was his usual brightness. Gooding was impeccable. The radio is an inspiration.
