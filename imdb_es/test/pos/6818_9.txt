This short film has all the elements of a great movie. Every time I show it to my friends (in DVR) they also love it. The dialogue is like that, 'real'. The acting is excellent. While the effects / accessories were not so convincing by themselves, taken with everything else in the shot, they are placed / used by experts. The music is so disturbing, perfect for this kind of "moment" movie. People who appreciate their beliefs and thoughts are shaken to the core of what they see in this film. Most say 'is that all?', But in the end they blossom with a new understanding, and leave the movie with a word to describe it: <br /> <br /> 'Beautiful'. The beauty of the film is also profound. I love the fact that there are no conflicting points of view, there are no other voices and the voices that do hear are in agreement with each other. There is no conflict, but at the same time there is one. And the end made me love him more! The harsh reality is sometimes more film-worthy than any plot device, or spin. <br /> <br /> (was not Joshua Leonard the boy in Blair Witch Project?) :) Film of a fictional dead man ... excellent!
