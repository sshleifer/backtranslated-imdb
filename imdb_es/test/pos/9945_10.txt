When I was growing up, Voyage into Space was my favorite movie. I remember the time when KTLA (Channel 5) ran the movie all week and I and my sisters saw it every day. I still remember every part of that movie. The ending was so sad when Giant Robot exploded along with Guillotine and then saw Johnny Sokko with all the tears running down his face asking for a Giant Robot. There should be a sequel to the movie, in which Giant Robot somehow survived the explosion. :) I can not believe there are so many other Voyage into Space fans still out there. I really want to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD, but my sister said that the ones that are now are pirates and probably copies of the film's poor quality. I do not know why they have not released it yet, since more than 40 years have passed. I think Voyage into Space was created in 1968. Only now, my second favorite Japanese monster movie of all time (The Gargantuan War) finally comes to DVD and will be released on September 9th. I can not wait! :) Now if only they did the same with Voyage into Space. The giant robot, Johnny Sokko and the trip to space will never be forgotten! In my eyes and probably many others too, it will always be a childhood classic for me! :)
