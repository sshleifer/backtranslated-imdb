This is how I would summarize it! There were others who said: Naked Gun meets James Bond. I think mine is more precise, but I'm not neutral at that point ...; o) <br /> <br /> This movie is a kind of explosion of the past. It reminds you of old movies (from the 50s and 60s) and not only because it is played in that period of time (1955 to be exact, with the exception of Flashback), but it is the mood in which it is created the movie. show on screen! The main actor here (which is, as I have been told, very popular in his homeland, France), is perfect in his role here. He is the spy with the number 117 attached to him. There's a character that sums it up in the movie, by asking a question, about whether it's good or not ... you'll see it when you see the movie! <br /> <br /> In fact, this is very fun, and if you like your spies mixed with comedy with an old-school style, but do not take yourself or any of that seriously, then You need to see this! : o)
