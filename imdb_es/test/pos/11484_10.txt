I've seen this movie at least ten times. I do not agree with the previous comments. This is a tongue-in-cheek movie and part of the performance is bound to be forced. Men like Paul Cowley are few and far between, women like Linda, unfortunately, are a penny a dozen. The sad thing here is that although similar relationships like this rarely lead to murder and framing, it is a familiar scenario. The boy loves the girl, the girl does not know that he exists, they grow up, the man sees the woman with whom he fantasized and rescues her. In short, she never loved him, he came at the right time and she used it. Thomas is excellent as the nerd but adequate Paul. His representation is sensitive and moving. Madsen is perfect as the femme-fatale. What really moved me was the final scene. Paul says that he finally cried, but not for Linda, his wife, but for the unknown girl he had seen from a distance many years ago ... and he longed ... and loved. And I loved the close-up of Thomas at the end.
