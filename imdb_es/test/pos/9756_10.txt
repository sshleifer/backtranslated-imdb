"The Gay Desperado" is wonderful in everything. The joke between Leo Carrillo and Harold Huber is as funny as anything you would hear in a movie today. Better line? "That would be my third choice!" "Diego" is obviously the archetype of "Silent Bob" by Kevin Smith. The black and white cinematography of Lucien N. Andoit (particularly with the shadows of the bandits) was surprising. All I can say about Ida Lupino is: "Thank God for the DVD!" You can go straight to the scene where you are trying on hats and serapes and see her standing in front of that mirror again and again. <br /> <br /> So that he does not forget, that boy of Nino Martini also sings purty. .
