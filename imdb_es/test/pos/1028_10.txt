>>> Great news: there is a BBC DVD release scheduled for July 31, 2006, United Kingdom. There is also a launch scheduled in States. I do not know the date. I can not wait! ! <<<<< br /> <br /> >>>> below is my original comment <<<<<< br /> <br /> I agree with all the other reviewers: it is simply amazing that one of the best television dramas have never been released on DVD <br /> <br /> The story line is exciting: the acting is exceptional and the development of the character is fascinating. <br /> <br /> Here in the UK a whole history of making TV drama series and DVD movies through popular campaigns <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to see why the owners of the rights Do not enter a DVD production? I will email one of the main actors in this grassroots movement and see what happens. Who made the production? Was it the BBC? RW
