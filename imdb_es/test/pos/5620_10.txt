The story itself is a routine: a child runs away from home and ends up in a music school for children. He convinces a famous violinist to sponsor the school. The film is a splice filming for 11 weeks, and leaves many fun holes that the observer observer can find for himself. <br /> <br /> For as long as the whiskers of the plot have been, the film is justified by its music and its performance. There is a lot of music, with classical works performed by Heifetz and by the Meremblum Orchestra, one of the main youth symphonies of that day, and he said that the music is excellent. By itself, it would make the image worth seeing. The tasks of direction and punctuation were put in the best hands: those of Alfred Neumann. <br /> <br /> The performance is a study of contrasts. The children of the orchestra, most of whom had little or no experience as an actress, must have driven the director Archie Mayo crazy, looking at the camera, exaggerating the parts they had and overdoing the instructions they were given. But the spontaneity that results from his lack of training adds an interesting charm to the image. The veteran actors were wonderful with the material they had to work with. Walter Brennan was chosen perfectly in his role, one that he emulated in real life. Joel McCrea and Andrea Leeds were ideal for their parts. And the casting performance was a true Who's Who of the actors of the characters: Marjorie Main, Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, Charles Coleman, Perry Ivins and Porter Hall in his typical role of the heavy, all the ideal cast. And the bit players: Jessie Arnold, John Hamilton, Marjorie Wood, Jimmy Flavin, Dulcie Day, Gravelly expressed to Lee Phelps in his usual police role and many more. If you are a fan of the character actors, this movie will bring you many memories. <br /> <br /> In general, the image is very nice and recommended, even if you are not a fan of classical music. . <br /> <br /> tvcat
