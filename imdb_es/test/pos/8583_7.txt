The dialogue is too dramatic at times, and the transitions between scenes could be softer. <br /> <br /> Still, "The Bruce" has the feeling of authenticity, if it's not polished, <br /> <br /> story ... even if it plays freely with some important facts <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sandy Welch is not Gibson or Branagh, but he's unconditional. <br /> <br /> Bruce.
