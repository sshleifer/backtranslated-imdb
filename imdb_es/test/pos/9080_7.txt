Nostalgia is not always the best reason to watch a movie. Most of the time, the movies you loved as a child will disappoint you when you are an adult. While there are exceptions to this rule, it is difficult to justify owning a Krull DVD, regardless of how insightful the director's comments may be. But stay alert with the X / Y'ers generation, as the dozens of disappointments that dominate your memory path can keep you from stumbling over a visit worth visiting. <br /> <br /> A surprise movie worth watching is Joel Schumacher's Flatliners, the supernatural thriller starring 80 popcorn heavyweights Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts and Billy Baldwin . You would think that a stew made up of this cast, the flamboyant style of Schumacher and the slick eye of filmmaker Jan De Bont would lead to something terribly heavy, but with calories aside ... Flatliners are not that bad. Although its production design is inexplicably exaggerated and the photography is too stylized (replete with neon-soaked streets throwing endless waves of steam), Flatliners still manages to be an effectively dark and compelling thriller. If there is an explanation as to why the Flatliners were forgotten, it could be that in 1990 another supernatural thriller was launched: the Jacob's Ladder. <br /> <br /> If Flatliners had been cast one or two years after Jacob's Ladder, it's probably Schumacher's flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a commercialized scam from Adrian Lyne's nightmare masterpiece. But with these films that premiered in the same year, Flatliners enjoyed a different fate, tripling the take of JL at the box office despite being a diluted version of a similar premise. The passage of time has not been so kind to the Flatliners, it has been lost on a lot of disposable Brat Pack of the 80s, while JL has consolidated its reputation as a timeless classic. Leaving aside the destinies, JL is terrifying and manages to keep audiences guessing until the last frame, while Flatliners is the victim of excessive simplification and the comforts of Hollywood that drag the final act to a predictably ordered outcome. The comparisons between the two films are unfair and, ultimately, overlook Flatliners ability to represent the 80s at their best. Launched at the end of a decade of superficial excesses, Flatliners will always be dated for their styles of hairstyles and clothing, but to be fair, it should also be remembered as a well-executed movie on (or at least near) the top of their heap particular of dreck. For purposes and purposes, it is an entertaining walk along the path of memory.
