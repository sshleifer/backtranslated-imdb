Meatballs is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it is impossible to tell. <br /> <br /> In what was merely a precursor to what was to come, Murray rules the screen in what can only be described as a comic domain. Tripper Harrison is one of the best comedy characters in the last 50 years. Sarcastic all the time, intelligent when it has to be, severe when it has to be, and attentive when it suits him, Murray infuses Tripper with that SNL flash in the eye. <br /> <br /> The CWIs are simply amazed as they hide under the comic genius that is Mr. Murray. <br /> <br /> Summer is not summer without a vision of the Meatballs. One of the best comedies to decorate the screen.
