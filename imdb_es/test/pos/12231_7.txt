Most Christmas movies have a theme of "redemption", but most are a variation of a very similar plot. This movie is extravagant and has an unusual plot. You may have to stay there for the first half, where events may seem hard to believe for a movie (but not as amazing as real life: Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, says he never invented anything in any of his cartoons ) they are all based on real life stories told by their fans). The second half begins to fit the plot. I loved it. <br /> <br /> By the way, one critic pointed out that the idea of ​​someone not having cash available is not credible in these days of ATMs, but it is perfectly credible if you have lost your wallet - who carries the ATM cards automatic anywhere else while on a business trip?
