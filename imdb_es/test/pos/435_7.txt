This was a nice musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge ballroom. In many ways, this reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s, in the sense that it has many clichés that lead to the inevitable conclusion ("Is the show still YET?"). While, of course, none of this is new, it was nice and well done. The musical numbers at the end are frantic and beautiful to watch. In many ways, it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life, Ziegfeld was a pretty important player, but this was cleaned up in the American movie. But, in FRANCÉS CANCÁN, the characters have libidos that work completely, but nothing is actually shown, so the film is fine for children. <br /> <br /> Nothing new, but it's well done.
