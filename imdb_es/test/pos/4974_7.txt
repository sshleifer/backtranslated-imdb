Violent men are a good western. Maybe the story is not original. The owner of a large ranch dedicated himself to exhausting the small competitors of a valley he needs for his growing cattle, but the film has many ingredients that raise its level and make it worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The cast is a highlight. There is the reliable Glenn Ford (John Parrish) as a former army officer and now one of the small ranchers, who tries to avoid problems until he is under pressure. Edward Robinson (Lew Wilkinson) is as good as ever as the great crippled man and Barbara Stanwyck (Martha) plays her treacherous wife in one of her usual bad wife roles that she easily deals with (others were in "Double Indemnity" and "Blowing Wild Brian Keith (Cole) does it perfectly as the armed man of Robinson, an ambitious man who tries to take over his brother's big ranch, no matter what happens." Dianne Foster (Judith Wilkinson) plays the daughter of Robinson who does not approve of the way her father, mother and uncle handle things with their neighbors. <br /> <br /> Rudolph Mate brings a standard but acceptable address, perhaps helped by The beautiful and wide-ranging stage and good and proper music also helps. <br /> <br /> The inevitable final showdown between Ford and Keith is one of the best in western movies, each man in his own style of duel (note Ford's shooting with his Traight Arm and pointing to your objective in a military way) resolve your differences once and for all. <br /> <br /> This is, without a doubt, one of Glenn Ford's best appearances in the west, second only to the classic "3: 10 to Yuma" two years later. It is likely that it is the cast that puts the film as "A" and, as far as I'm concerned, it enters the list of the 10 best of the genre.
