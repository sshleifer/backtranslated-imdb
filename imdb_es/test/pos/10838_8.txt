This drama apparently caused a stir six years ago when he debuted on television: I did not take much television news, but ignored the radar; but after having seen it, I'm not surprised that it caused a stir. Not particularly for the content (although it is a bit more 'unconventional' than the usual TV fodder), it has more to do with the reactionary media of this country. Anyway, this series of three parts is based on a book by Sarah Waters and focuses mainly on lesbians, although the plot also has room to explore other "dark" aspects of sexuality. Our main character is an oyster girl named Nan (short for Nancy) from Winchester. Kitty Butler, the sorceress from woman to man, bewitched her after seeing her in a theatrical show and soon begins to attend all her shows; finally, it attracts the attention of the artist and becomes his dressing table. It is not long before Kitty is offered the opportunity to play on larger stages in London and, after becoming good friends with Nan, invites her to join her. The act becomes bigger when Nan also takes the stage and the couple becomes a stage duo ... but Kitty breaks Nan's heart, taking her to an odyssey within the sordid belly of London. <br /> <br /> I must admit that my DVD collection has no shortage of sordid and sordid movies, so there was nothing in this that was enough to surprise me. Despite being a bit tired, I have to say that I am still surprised by anyone who says that this movie went too far; Naturally, there is some lesbian sex and other things, but it is never exploitative or overused and the film really could not have been done without it. The main focus is always on the story; And the story is very well made. The film lasts almost three hours in total, but it is something that is not long enough for everything to be understood. Sarah Waters is obviously an inventive writer, and the film is still interesting for time. The acting is solid as you would expect, but I must admit that I found the main actress Rachael Stirling clumsy and difficult to understand at first; although she grows well in her role as the movie progresses. Execution is a small problem and director Geoffrey Sax is a bit too sophisticated for my taste. The story also gets a little sad at the end, which is a shame because this movie is stronger during dark times (episode 2 is the highest point of three for me). There really is no definite point for the movie, or at least not one that I could see. That is not important as far as I'm concerned; however, as Tipping the Velvet tells a good story and far exceeded my expectations. It's worth checking out, for people who like this kind of thing.
