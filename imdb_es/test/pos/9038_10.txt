This film was set, filmed and released in Oxford, Mississippi, the hometown of W. Faulkner, the place of the 1948 book. Most of the extras were local. I have been to Oxford, and it has changed a lot. This film presents Will Geer as the sheriff; He was later included in the blacklist. They were the authors and actors of social dramas like this movie, and Grapes Of Wrath, the goals of the HUAC a few years later. I do not remember if the actor who plays the young Mallison (Claude Jarman Jr.) did something after the television series Centennial (1978), but it was fantastic in this previous film. And do not miss Elizabeth Patterson who later played in Little Women.
