How is the bear's foot, the trunk of an elephant or the brain of a monkey for dinner? Let Tsui Hark tell you in this wonderful and happy comedy about the art of cooking in the traditional way (?) China. <br /> <br /> This movie shares the common structure of an American sports film, but instead of focusing on baseball, it focuses on the kitchen, which makes it even more interesting. I even think that the character of Leslie Cheung looks a lot like Charlie Sheen in the Major Leagues ... <br /> <br /> This movie also contains a bit of Zhao Wen Zhao vs. Xiong Xin Xin fighting (I love seeing more of that's after The Blade) and a pretty funny joke about a pop song by Leon Lai ... <br /> <br /> Although it may not be the ideal movie for strict vegetarians.
