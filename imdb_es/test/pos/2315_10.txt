I've seen this movie at least 8 times, and I still laugh every time. The film is about how an intelligent and motivated man, against all odds, can fool the whole system of self-confidence. <br /> <br /> This movie is for all people who like a funny movie. <Br /> <br /> The action and the comedy are well mixed in a brilliant movie, which I hope to see on DVD soon. <br /> <br />
