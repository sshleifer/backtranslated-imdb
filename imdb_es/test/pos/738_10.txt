In the 70s, a small Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent and low-budget horror films that seem to have developed a little cult over the years. Before watching your first movie, Do not look in the basement, I was not sure what to expect, but I sure did not expect it to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the chainsaw. Slaughter. I do not know, this could be my favorite horror movie of all time. <br /> <br /> We started in an isolated asylum. At first, it seems a quite relaxed place to recover mentally, considering that all patients can roam freely and all that, as if it were their home (I guess so). None of them seems so dangerous, just delirious. The residents include a love-nymphomaniac, a 700-year-old woman, a man-boy, a girl, a guy who thinks he's in a war, a woman who thinks he has a baby and a man who thinks he's a judge. One day, out of nowhere, the judge kills the doctor with an ax, shortly after, the baby that wants to be killed by the nurse. Ten minutes in the movie, and things look really ugly. Maybe the new nurse will know what to do, then, again, maybe not. Giving more would do more harm than good. It is better to dive headfirst into this, knowing as little as possible. If you can appreciate honesty to God, without the horror of horror, then you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you liked Scream, if you liked Wrong Turn, if you like that unoriginal, overproduced, digital Hollywood garbage, then it's very likely that you will not see beauty in it. Do not look in the basement, being a first attempt makes the quality even more amazing. The atmosphere and the granulate fit in the location and score like a glove. Unfortunately, good ol 'S.F. he used most of his good ideas in his first film, though, the next entry in his Texas-sized quadripogram is something of a masterpiece, that is, if you like extravagance, evil, Hixploitation as someone what I know If you fall in love with the first two of Brownrigg, and you absolutely must find out what else he had to offer, take a look at Do not open the door and The house where hell freezes. Do not Look in The Basement has everything success needs, no stars, no budget, no digital effects, just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum, with a dozen cast members and a grim and subtle score . Of course, the turn. This is a real horror for the true horror fanatic. 10/10
