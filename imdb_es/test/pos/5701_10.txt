A surprisingly good documentary. My surprise was mainly due to the fact that I was confused by the title. I assumed that it was the influence of the drug culture on the making of films, but it is not a much more intelligent and far-reaching film than one might have expected. Demme has done a great job encapsulating the period from the late 60s to the late 70s. From 'Easy Rider' and the collapse of studio influence, through all those 'real life' introspective movies, where they sparkle Young directors tried to express themselves politically, sexually and artistically, until the beginning of box office success and the return of the reigns. To the men of money and their studies. As someone who watched the "real life" movies of Britain and the rest of Europe through the sixties and then the revolutionary films of the 70s in the United States and it is sad that the sequel to the sequel is so much On the agenda, this was a most fascinating movie. Interview clips are measured (thanks to the DVD, full interviews are available as extras) and movie clips are well considered. Also, as someone who has just caught up, 'Joe', I'm impressed that this important little movie has its deserved entry here.
