When I saw this movie, I expected it to be a cheesy American movie made with gruesome actors. I was very surprised to discover that he was totally wrong. The film focuses on Bartely or B, who has been rejected from all its universities (the actor who plays B is very natural and makes his character look real) and decides to create a simulation school to stop his parents from harassing him. However, many people see your website fake and join. Feeling their sorrows, B can not drive them away much to the chagrin of their best mate. The university is the ideal place where you learn what you want or do not do anything. The school faces opposition from the appropriate university that ends up closing. The film ends up high and I recommend you see it. It has its faults, but it is a happy movie to feel good with some unpredictable turns.
