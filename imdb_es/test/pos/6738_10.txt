One of my favorite movies. Great cast, directed by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious drama situations with brilliant comic strikes. An exact mix of character and history. Real people with real problems, and each person has a different relationship with each member of the family. Sensibly it moves from a little sad to a hilariously funny one. Read the quotes. This is the best adaptation of a work by Neil Simon. <br /> <br /> If you want to see more of Eugene, see Biloxi Blues (starring Matthew Broderick who played on both stage versions) is fine, a little darker. Get away from the Broadway Bound made for television.
