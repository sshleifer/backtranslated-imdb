A photo starring Danny Devito and Billy Crystal. Both are famous actors, and in this charming comedy he forces them to try to kill their pets. Billy Crystal's favorite motive is to be his ex-wife who stole his book and put his name on it, and Danny Devito's favorite motif was his evil mother. Billy Crystal is an author and teacher apparently and Danny Devito is one of his students. This comedy classic is very entertaining and for all ages. <br /> <br /> Danny Devito seems to act like a child in this movie because of his evil mother, who keeps repressing him all the time. She says things like "You have no friends!" and when Billy Crystal fell, she said: "Burry before he stinks the basement!" She puts Danny also calling him "butter ass!" and other things just to make him angry.
