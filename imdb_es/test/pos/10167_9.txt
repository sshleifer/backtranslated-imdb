A film that tends to be buried under prejudice and preconception - it's a remake! Doris Day is in it! She sings! - Hitchcock's second foray into 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' is his most undervalued film, and arguably a masterpiece in its own right in its own right. <br /> <br /> This is, in more ways than one, Doris The Movie of the Day. Not only gives the best performance of his career, rather than defend James Stewart, but the whole film is subtly structured around his character and not him. This is, after all, a movie in which music is both a motif and a plot device. What better casting than the most popular singer of his generation? Consider: Jo McKenna de Day has given up her career onstage to establish with her husband and raise her son. This seems to be a mutual decision, and she does not seem to be unhappy. But look at the way Stewart teases her in the horse-drawn carriage because of her worries about Louis Bernard, which implies that she's jealous that Bernard is not asking her any questions about her career. This is clearly a recurring joke between them: it responds with a 'har-de-har-har' that denotes the familiarity of this gag, suggesting that it has some latent resentment about its confinement and that both realize it. br /> <br /> After her son has been kidnapped, Stewart insists on doping her before breaking the news. This is a cruel scene, brilliantly interpreted by both actors, which illustrates the imbalance of power in their marriage: he is trying to control and repress his reactions, in essence he uses his professional knowledge to repress his voice in marriage, as well as his medical career He suppressed his career as a singer. <br /> <br /> The power of that voice is demonstrated in the sequence of Ambrose Chapel, when it has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to mingle with the congregation of drudge women, it almost acts as a warning of what it will be hers if he continues to repress his talent. In the Albert Hall, it is your need to shout, to exercise those impressive lungs, what saves the life of a man, and at the end of the Embassy, ​​it is your talent and reputation that allows you to locate your child. In contrast, all of Stewart's masculine activity is counterproductive: his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end, he stays behind in the church while everyone else moves to Albert Hall, and his efforts there only get the murderer killed. depriving the police of potentially useful information. It is only when his action joins the voice of his wife, in the rescue of Hank from the embassy, ​​that he really manages to do something useful. <br /> <br /> Far from being forced to participate in the film to give Day a chance to sing, 'Que Sera Sera' acts as the first musical device in the film, prefiguring the nightmare that is about to engulf to the McKennas; 'The future is not ours to see' in effect. It also perfectly prepares the way to the end, in which the close bond between mother and son through music will allow Doris to save the day. <br /> <br /> The film's most famous sequence makes music the main feature: the accumulation until the assassination attempt at the Albert Hall. This long sequence without words may be the most extraordinary thing Hitchcock promised to film, the ultimate expression of his belief that movies should be visually told stories. We see people who conduct conversations in this sequence, but we never hear a word of what they say. We do not need, the images say everything. It is also his most exquisite suspense sequence, with the pieces moving slowly in place as the music develops. The edition is incredibly tight, perfectly combined with music. There is no out of place framework; anything that is not directly related to the murder is giving the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which all this is developed. It accumulates slowly, but in the end the suspense is almost unbearable. When Jo screams, it's not just a relief for her, but for the audience. <br /> <br /> The sequence of Ambrose Chapel is ingenious and particularly effective for anyone who has had to attend a service to a non-conformist Church in the mud. The Embassy sequence seems a bit flat after the Albert Hall that preceded it in the first viewing, but the second time actually seems more effective, since the final walk at gunpoint really benefits from the magnificent use of the Day singing in the background, reminiscent of the Music-as-noise-environment in 'Rear window'. The score as a whole is subtle, which allows the music of the on-screen sources to be brought to the forefront in an effective manner. <br /> <br /> Bernard Miles is a discreet villain, a bit banal, but with a dry wit. He is surpassed by Brenda de Banzie as his wife, who walks in a thin line between sinister and sympathetic. Just look at the way you smoke a cigarette while your husband prepares the killer; his stance is pure gangster moll, dominating the exterior of Central England, but clearly has a soft side and possibly maternal feelings towards Hank. <br /> Stewart is excellent, although if Hitchcock really chose him as 'Everyman', as the Director's daughter seems to think, then he confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who supported the fascist ideology in Rope, a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in Rear Window and a necrophiliac obsessive in Vertigo. The day is nothing less than phenomenal. Just look at his reaction to the news that his son has been kidnapped, never exceeds, but neither sells him short. This is one of the most emotionally effective films of Hitchcock. It never lets us forget what is at stake for the McKennas; They feel the most human of all their central characters.
