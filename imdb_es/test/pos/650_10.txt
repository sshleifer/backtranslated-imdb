A wonderful movie before its time, <br /> <br /> I think so, in the eighties everything was about winning, is greed good? Do you remember that? I've seen this movie more than 20 times. For me, this is a true movie of a desert island, I still see why there is always something more to learn about these defective characters that I love, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin, they are simply wonderful. Also, Beverly D'angelo, Beau Bridges are in second place, do not get me wrong, there are many more great performances in this movie, and it's also the way it is written what made it for me, and I hope you, a movie that will want to see again and again, I think TV shows like "Northen Exposure", and now "Earl" owe a lot to this movie. But remember it's not a Tom Cruise movie.
