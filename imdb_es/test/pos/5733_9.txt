The Elegant Universe brings to light many ideas of the universe and existence. After watching this documentary, one can not help but step back and reconsider his vision of the existence of everything. There are a lot of scientists, mathematicians and others on both sides of string theory. It is continually challenged as unproven, unverifiable and possibly incorrect. The closest thing to proselytizing someone is doing is explaining that Quantum Physics, the set of mathematical ideas that give extremely good approximations of what happens to subatomic particles, has never made an incorrect prediction. Not so with string theory; nobody is willing to say, in the camera, that string theory is the truth, and in doing so, the piece retains a certain respectful distance from the subject.
