Since the golden period of British films, this has my vote for one of the funniest of all time. Presented yesterday in my Film Society before an enthusiastic public, I was surprised by how well the comedy has lasted (made in 1950!). It's really about expert time and the inimitable interpretation of two of the best actors that Britain has produced: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. Adapted from a work by John Dighton, this farce is handled energetically by director Frank Launder. The plot is simple: a ministry error charges a school for girls in a boys school. I will always laugh when I think about this movie.
