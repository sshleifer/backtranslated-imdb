It is true that Alex has become a small podgey, but they are still (for me) the best rock trio of all time. I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD to any fan. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed that they canceled their recent planned concert in Munich (logistics) and I regret not having made an effort to see them elsewhere. The DVD is a small consolation: the biggest incentive to acquire an adequate DVD playback configuration. <br /> <br /> Maybe naive, but I still do not understand the meaning of dryers on stage; I would appreciate any clarification. <br /> <br /> Greetings, Iain.
