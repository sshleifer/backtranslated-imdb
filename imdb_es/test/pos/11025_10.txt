Henry Thomas and Robin Tunny are one of the most underestimated artists in the business. I can not understand why they have not received more recognition than they have. This movie is a perfect example of how unlimited your skills are. <br /> <br /> Acting the lives of people who might be called a bit strange seems to be their specialty, and if these characters are not strangers I can not find anyone who is. <br /> <br /> The story is funny, romantic, dramatic, complicated and tragic. I hated the end, but if I had not, I would not have loved history as a whole. So you have to go.
