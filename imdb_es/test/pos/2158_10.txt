Yes, in fact, we have a winner, a winner in the best fools action movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I chose to vote a 10 for this movie is because it is incredibly poorly done and it really becomes fun. <br /> <br /> "Night Hunter" is basically about Jack Cutter, a vampire hunter (vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries, apparently), and his mission, is that he has to kill the last remaining . Vampires <br /> <br /> This movie contains one of the funniest scenes I've seen in my life. Not to mention the very bad shooting scenes. When people are shot in this movie, blood splashes, as thick as ketchup all over the place, this makes the film look so cheap and boring that you simply lose interest. A constant shake of the camera is what bothers me most during the fight scenes. This is, I suppose, done to create an "action effect", although in my opinion it does not have any effect at all. It's completely ridiculous! <br /> <br /> All the doubles scenes are done extremely badly. For example, a scene in which the dead vampire leader is thrown from a ceiling. When the corpse touches the ground, it bounces like a tottering rubber doll. A scene in which Jack sniffs the ground, getting a vision was so unconvincing that it made me laugh hysterically. <br /> <br /> The music licks, the corny scenes, the bad acting and the simple filming techniques are the functions that make this movie so. a bad operation Affirming that this is a good movie would be the same as saying that nuclear bombs are good for humans. Clearly those of you who say that this is one of the best action movies, have not seen many in your life. <br /> <br /> This is basically a class B vampire action movie that deserves 0/10 but I'll give 10/10, just for its ability (being the most horrible action movie I've seen) to make me laugh and because I can not live without that.
