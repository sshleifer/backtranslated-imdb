This is my favorite Hal Hartley movie. All his films are small gems. I love independent films and I hope that Hal Hartley never reaches the mainstream or is sold. What would happen if the Lord Jesus returned and loved his people so much that he could not open the final book and destroy the unbelievers? It was nice to see P. J. Harvey in a movie since I'm a fan of his music. Do not see it if you are a fan of Hollywood movies, you will be disappointed.
