This biography of the movie by rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The highlights of the film are the theatrical performances of Busey, where he plays the guitar and sings songs by Holly. It brings such energy to the proceedings that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's toothy, contagious smile lights the screen, creates a totally credible and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved. <br /> <br /> The movie follows Holly's career since she grew up in Lubbock, Texas, to Stardom and New York and her untimely death in a plane crash. One thing that I found interesting, if true, was Buddy's driving ambition: he had big plans to go beyond recording and performance to produce. As young as he was, he was already establishing himself as a shrewd businessman and definitely wanted to take things to a higher level. We will never know if he would have catapulted his initial success to a commercial brand like The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The lyrics of many of Holly's songs are pretty teeny; read the lyrics of "Peggy Sue" or "Oh Boy!" and you will see what I want to say. Perhaps to a large extent this explains his popularity among adolescent audiences, but his instrumentation and performances on stage surely explain his influence in the groups to follow, both The Rolling Stones and The Beatles have recognized its importance. <br /> <br /> Clearly some liberties were taken for dramatic effect. For example, I doubt that Holly ever hit a producer in Nashville or that the audience at the Apollo Theater in New York would respond so immediately as to be dancing wildly in the hallways. If you are interested in approaching the truth, see the documentary "The Real Buddy Holly Story" (1985) that is produced and presented by a very relaxed and attractive Paul McCartney. This contains interviews with Holly's family, friends and peers (Holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in "The Buddy Holly Story"). Members of other bands like Keith Richards and Don Everly also offer opinions and stories and there are recordings of old Holly performances. The production of McCartney can stand on its own, but it is an excellent piece of accompaniment for "The Buddy Holly Story" and maybe should be seen by anyone who sees the fiction story.
