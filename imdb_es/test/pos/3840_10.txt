This is one of my favorite movies, ever. The story is so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the time, this film never bores the public. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, all were good, but they lack what we have here. This is fun, creative, and always blank. This movie only has something extra that you can not learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story. But this is a respectable second, followed immediately by The Lady and the Tramp. Just watch it and enjoy one of the greatest achievements of cinema. And, by the way, I'm not a small child, this is for the older audiences who want to recover their childhood. An absolute necessity!
