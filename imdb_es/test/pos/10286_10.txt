A lot has already been written about the film itself, so instead of increasing the noise, I just want to say a few words about the two female actors. <br /> <br /> It has to be a daunting prospect for any actress. to star, in a certain sense, against the spectacular Monica Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer takes it to sensational extremes. A movie starring Monica Bellucci where I fell in love with the other girl? That is not supposed to happen. <br /> <br /> It has been said a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci hits the saddest figure in modern cinema. I had never seen such an innate sadness before. She would not be out of place breaking Lon Chaney's heart.
