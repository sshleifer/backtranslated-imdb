I was not familiar with this film, until I saw it included in a list of the 20 best spaghetti westerns I found recently (after the marathon I made these last weeks of subgenre films); So, it was promising that the film had to appear almost immediately on Italian television at night (for the first time, I'm pretty sure, in a good number of years). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcasted has not been excellent lately: I recorded the movie on VHS but decided not to keep it because of this factor; As it happened, the day after I saw the movie, I discovered that it was available on a DVD of Region 2 of Italy (with an interview with the uncredited screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi) and, after being impressed enough, I decided to order it. there and then, even if I knew I would not be coming to the DVD for a while, I'd like to let some time pass between one viewing of a movie and the next! A brief parenthesis here: when I recently bought a series of Spaghetti Westerns in an Italian DVD, I opted not to order FACE TO THE FACE by Sergio Sollima (1967), since I had the impression that it was a matter of few words; however, I just found out that the album contains an interview with the director (as had been the case with THE BIG GUNDOWN [1966], which I bought). I found it disconcerting that Sollima did not offer a similar contribution to the DVD edition of that film when in fact she considered FACE TO FACE as her favorite work (according to the biography of the director's talent included in the album Blue Underground Region 1 of another Sollima Spaghetti) . Western - RUN, MAN, RUN [1968]); The problem is that I loved THE BIG GUNDOWN so much that I followed it with a FACE TO FACE visualization through the recording I had of Italian TV. I ordered the DVD of that movie now, especially because it's still discounted, but as I said with respect to a second look at THE PRICE OF POWER (although I can still see Sollima's interview when the record arrives) ... <br /> < Well, rant: the movie under review is a very unusual and very interesting Spaghetti Western, certainly ambitious, as it is a transposition of the JFK murder case to an Old West stage. Actually, remember the tense black and white thriller by Anthony Mann, THE TALL TARGET (1951), which dealt with an assassination attempt in the life of the United States. UU President Abraham Lincoln. He has one of the most popular Italian stars of this subgenre, Giuliano Gemma, in what is perhaps his most impressive western role (many of his other films tended to have a slight inclination). The cast includes at least two other notables: Van Johnson (in one of his few and mostly mediocre Italian films) as the US president killed in the postwar Dallas and Fernando Rey as head of a conspiracy of southerners, who not only plans his murder , but also conveniently maneuvers the new acting leader, Johnson's vice president, through blackmail. <br /> <br /> Benito Stefanelli also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who chases Gemma through the image, and with whom he has engaged a couple of times in a 'duel in the dark' - with the Weapons supported The floor instead of their respective covers and the only light in the room provided by the end of the cowboys' cigars! Ray Saunders is also involved as Gemma's black partner to whom the narrative eventually becomes the doomed figure of "Lee Harvey Oswald." Stelvio Massi, who later became harmed, as a director, in a series of poliziotteschi, is behind the luminous cinematography of the film; Similarly, Luis Enrique Bacalov supplies another great qualification of "Euro-Cult", which is sufficiently different from Ennio Morricone's style to be equally distinguishable. Valerii's direction here can be as impressive as that of other Spaghetti Westerns, but he manages the procedures efficiently enough (the final shooting is especially well done); The film is undoubtedly one of the most underestimated entries in the subgenre and, for those who want it, the novelty of the plot alone should make ...
