This is the third short of the Three Stooges that the team made, and like many of its first ones, this is absolutely hysterical! Now that I own it on DVD as part of the collection of three Stooges Vol. 1, whenever I feel like it, I see this! <br /> <br /> In this short film, Moe, Larry and Curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help everyone, but they end up making a mess of everything! <br /> <br /> This short is another of my favorite shorts from Three Stooges, I'm also a big fan of slapstick comedy, and the Three Stooges are the slapstick kings! <br /> <br /> When I heard that he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Film, I was very curious about this, when I heard that he had lost, I was very disappointed! <br /> <br /> This short is one of the three funniest by far, I recommend you see this hysterical disturbance! <br /> <br /> 10/10
