Most of Brigitte Bardot's films that I have seen have not been able to take full advantage of its captivating presence on the screen. Unfortunately, they gave him very few really good papers in films of undeniable quality, which was a real oversight. She deserved them and she was able to demonstrate all of her cinematic power when they approached her. As Genevieve in "Love on a Pillow" we had a clear exception to the trend of light and fluffy vehicles, since it was an interesting artistic film by any reasonable measure, and in it there was a BB of 28 years of age. more attractive. "Une Parisienne" is another, with an extremely captivating Brigitte in an interesting and well-crafted comedy that explores how you can convince the man of an ambitious lady to stay true to an incredibly beautiful young wife. There are several good performances here. Her playboy husband, Michel, is one, "the prince", played by Charles Boyer, is another, with entertaining efforts on the part of a good cast. As for Brigitte Bardot, the way she looks in this movie is the way I remember her as a child in the fifties. She was 23 years old in 1957 and was far ahead of her time, more beautiful than any other actress of the time, including Marilyn Monroe. Her coquettish and coquettish sexuality, widely shown in several tight and tight dresses, simply jumps off the screen. She was more current and beautiful than the women of America today, almost fifty years later. Obsessed with their careers and still clinging desperately to feminist politics, they emerge as a group of clueless lesbians. In stark contrast, the sex kitten was sexually liberated, intelligently and clearly independent long before it was fashionable; however, although he fully understood the power of his exceptional femininity, he used it for a higher purpose than mere personal interest. love. A still picture simply could not do it justice. You had to see her slender but voluptuous shape (with her 20-inch waist) slightly crossing a room. You had to see that wild blond hair, look at her big, brown and seductive eyes, and listen while her lips full of pouting spoke in French. In the foreground at the end of this film, she winks and flirts with the camera, her beautiful orbs twinkle. Drinking For the fans of Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" should not be missed.
