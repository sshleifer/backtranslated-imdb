I'm not a big fan of music movies. "Annie" was a theatrical show that I loved, but the movie was a failure. The "films of The Phantom of the Opera" (and I think there were three) could not coincide with the staging of Weber. But I loved this. The DVD will have a place of honor among my "guardians". Although it is a film adaptation, it somehow captures the flavor and atmosphere of live theater. Bette Midler, always a delight, is exceptional in this role. There is good music, lots of laughter and even a tear or two. I have seen most of the great musicals of the eighties and nineties. Somehow I missed this one, so there's no comparison to make. But if it revives, I'll be the first in the ticket line! But this movie is so good that I will be in the strange position of wondering if the production on stage will be at the height of the film.
