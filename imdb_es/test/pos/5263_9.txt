Most of the comments so far have nailed this right in the head. Viewers under "certain age" and with three-digit IQs should avoid "Chance of a Lifetime" as an employee of George W.Bush in front of a congressional grill. <br /> <br /> The cast is mainly composed of veterans who know their way around a well written script. Is the premise wildly original? No, but the film stands out as a beacon at midnight in the current and endless clutter of movies / TV geared towards the most desirable demographic audience of teenagers and "young adults". <br /> <br /> In addition to Betty White and Leslie Neilsen up front, the cast also features always reliable veterans like Elaine Stritch and William Windom. The acute dialogue is delivered effortlessly and effectively by these professionals. <br /> <br /> "Chance of a Lifetime" is definitely not a movie for Will Ferrell / Adam Sandler / "Saw" slasher gore-fests, "American Eye Bored", and ninety percent of the rest of the mud of Hollywood and television.
