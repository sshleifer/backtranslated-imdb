I avoided watching this movie for a while, but I finally picked up a copy. Having been born too late to see 'Hair' in its contemporary setting, I have been familiar with the UK and the Broadway cast recordings for many years; and I saw him on stage at the end of the 80s, where he seemed a bit creaky but still, very funny. <br /> <br /> The movie. Drop some of the songs (The Bed, My Conviction, Frank Mills) and cut others (Walking in Space). However, what remains is very well presented. "All the singers and dancers are excellent, and the key artists (especially Treat Williams as Berger, Beverley D'Angelo as Sheila, John Savage as Claude) are memorable. <br /> <br /> Like a hippie celebration and a hymn " Hair 'manages to be powerful even in a movie made ten years too late. It was no longer the era of peace, love and Biba, but the era of punk rock ... although seeing this film now, in the era of Iraqi problems, gives a new resonance to the problems of Vietnam of the decade 1960. <br /> <br /> Milos Forman, who also did 'Amadeus', did a good job in directing. In its scope and sensation, it reminds me of the "Superstar of Jesus Christ" by Norman Jewison, especially with the joy of the "Aquarius" scene and the intimacy of "Easy to be difficult". <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this Movie and consider it a good representation of a musical born of the first truly hedonistic era.
