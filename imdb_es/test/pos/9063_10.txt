Many films try the ambitious. Few succeed. This movie is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although it is categorized as a black comedy, that term seems too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind Max and Grace. The multi-screenplay Michael Parness has managed to weave elements of the most absurd comedy with an incredibly real human emotion. Without a doubt, a remarkable feat. <br /> <br /> While the comic aspects are certainly present, the heart of the film lies in its protagonists: David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. The delicate balance of the film, really crazy against real love, falls on them and they do it, taking it from the opening scene to the heart-rending climax and to the touching end. David Krumholtz, in the title lead role and as the narrator, anchors the image and does an exceptional job. We see the world through the eyes of Max and Krumholtz imbues them with a kind of wonder and hope that one would not expect to be credible from a character who had previously attempted suicide. From this point on, there should be no doubt that he has really achieved the status of leader, well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles. Natasha Lyonne could be a kind of revelation for anyone who has seen her in less difficult roles. Grace's role has an expansive reach, which requires her to show great anger and great tenderness, sometimes in seconds with each other. He manages to convince us of Grace's deep and deep desperation, which lies just below her alternate mania and mania. <br /> <br /> This is not a laugh of a kind of comedy, so do not watch the movie strictly expecting humor from the start. to end. Think more dramedy than comedy. There are some very dark moments, as would be expected given the subject of suicidal individuals, and some strangely real moments presented especially by Emma Adele Galvin as Max's sister, Sis. The most humorous scenes are those populated by the large number of renowned actors in supporting roles. While Lorraine Bracco and David Paymer lend the most surreal aspect to their scenes, the other supporting characters that populate the institution where Max and Grace meet are the real pleasure. Guillermo Díaz is a thief of whimsical scenes like the weird and frantic freak, Héctor. Ralf Moeller, like Bruno, acts like his straight man, but has his own charm and appeal. Rosanna Arquette completely inhabits the role of Vera with the rude vitriol of a bitter waitress at a truck stop. Even his unconditional character melts over time, as do all those who are moved by Max's literally eternal love for Grace. <br /> <br /> You can conquer love, everything can be the question behind the film and although the realist inside says no, the films are about an escape from reality, if only for a few hours. I recommend seeing this movie as an antidote not only to reality but also to cynicism that says a love story like this never happens. Spend a few hours immersed in a world where you can and do wonders in the psyche. <br /> <br /> (Seattle International Film Festival, June 2005)
