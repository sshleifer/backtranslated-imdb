When I was five years old, it was my favorite television show. I remembered that I was on channel 11 at 2 pm every day. The premise of the program was simple with Carole and Janis as hostesses of the children's television program. They sang songs and read stories to us from children. It was done in a study with only 54 episodes that was retransmitted again and again. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. The show taught us to count, add, subtract and the alphabet. For thirty minutes a day, I learned something new with Paula and Janis. I remember those days as pleasant memories and now I hope that today's children can learn to love simpler things like listening to stories, cheap accessories, riding swings and talking with puppets. The set was ideal and simple, but it was Carole and Janis who made it worthwhile. I miss my childhood and those days when the most important thing was to see the Magic Garden. Life seemed much simpler and better. Now, I hope that the children of today enjoy the show.
