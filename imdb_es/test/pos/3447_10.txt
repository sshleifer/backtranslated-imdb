I have seen some of Mr. Boorman's films and I did not like many of them. They are not bad films, on the contrary they are good movies, but they are not content that I personally thought was entertaining. However, I believe that Where the Heart Is, although it is designed to serve the American public less skilled in art, is masterful as a satire, and as a social commentary from the time it was made. I have had to replace this film in my collection at least half a dozen times, because every time I lend it to someone I know, I can appreciate the art in all its levels, my copy does not come back home, lol. The last time it took 7 years to replace it, since it was sold out for VHS sales, it has never been done like a DVD that I know, and I had to wait until one of the premium cable channels ran it before I could record it again. . <br /> <br /> My favorite aspect after the social comment I nail in the head are the paintings of Timna Woollard. I have searched for 15 years to find someone or any place that can take me to where their work is available for sale. Or better yet, a copy of the film's paintings without the final credits rolling on them. I have a room in my house that I dedicated to putting copies of his paintings, and nobody seems to know if it was ever published as a coffee table book, a video aquarium or a documentary of his work. If anyone knows where I can get any kind of copy of Timna's work or where her studio is located in England, do not hesitate to contact me by email.
