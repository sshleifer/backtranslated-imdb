If you have ever been, you have a friend, or a child who is or was skating at the same time, then watch this movie! I've seen it several times and I get something new every time I see it. It reminded me why I started skating in the first place (a long time ago). It reminded me of what skating brings to a person and I have found that it will also help a person who does not understand why skaters, well, skate. Of course there is a very dark side to everything that is seen, that the film plays lightly. But it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating. Only one person on a blackboard, doing it because they love doing it. This movie was so inspiring to me that now I'm skating one more time (I'm 32 years old) and I have not been so happy with myself over the years. Give this one an opportunity, you will not be disappointed.
