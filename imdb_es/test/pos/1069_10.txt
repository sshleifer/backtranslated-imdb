The first time I saw this movie about 15 years ago, and I've loved it since then. It is such a nice experience that I could see it at any time of the year. However, for me, it is the best Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is in black and white is irrelevant, although I often wonder what it would look like in color. You can get that warm and bright feeling by watching the Christmas events. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together, and Greenstreet is the antithesis of their usual character, Sakall is a stressful joy to watch. <br /> <br /> It's a light relief and certainly does not tax the brain, but it leaves you with the joy of having seen it. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for it to be available on DVD in the UK. I will certainly be at the front of the queue to buy it.
