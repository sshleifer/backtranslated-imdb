The second episode of "Mr. Eko" has somewhat less interesting flashbacks than the first ("The 23rd Psalm"), but in almost every other department it is one of the best episodes of Season 2, advancing in the mythology / background of the series as well as the characters. Locke and Eko discover a new station of the Dharma Initiative, The Pearl, and the orientation film that they find and observe in their interior complete Locke's transformation of a believer ("Orientation" - after the end of the film: "We will have see this again ") to a dubious (" SOS "-" Did you press that button, Henry? I need to know ") to an unbeliever ("? "- after the end of the movie:" Do you want to see this from again? "No, I've seen enough." Terry O'Quinn's performance is powerful as always ("every second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button"). Meanwhile, Eko takes his place as the man who makes sure that he was brought to the island as part of his true destiny, which is to continue pressing the button.Other high points of "?" are a unique and surprising sequence of dreams where person A has the dream of being the person B (this is the kind of bold idea from which the current LOST season could I would use much more), and the disturbing scene of Libby's last word before death, and the way Jack and Hurley can not know their true meaning. *** 1/2 of 4.
