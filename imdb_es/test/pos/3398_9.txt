This commentary analyzes the "Book North and South I" that deals with the period 1842-1861 <br /> <br /> The history of the United States in the 19th century is identified mainly by people with Civil War (1861-1865) . This is a reasonable opinion because it was the Civil War that subjected the Union to severe testing; that was the Civil War that made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was the period that finally put an end to the shameful system of slavery. <br /> <br /> Since the birth of moving images, there were people who adapted that time to the screen. D.W. Griffith, in the early 1900s, made his unforgettable BIRTH OF A NATION. However, the most famous film about the north-south clash is still, I suppose, GONE WITH THE WIND (1938). Unfortunately, fewer people know about the magnificent television series based on John Jakes' novel, "North and South." It is the best television series ever made and the time spent watching it is really beautiful. I recorded it in my Polish television video many years ago and I have returned it with pleasure since then. Why? <br /> <br /> First, the whole story is deeply rooted in historical reality. The two families, the Maines of South Carolina and the Hazards of Pennsylvania, represent two completely different ways of life. In spite of that, friendship unites them. However, what they experience is the struggle that all people do: the friendship attacked by the "truth" of "political correctness", the love attacked by the hatred of the "legal spouses", the kindness by the force of the "social heroes" Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character: someone who finds love and who is deprived of it quickly; Someone who cares about friends, but political fanatics get in the way and ruin a lot. Finally, he is someone who can see the tragic future of his land, but there is nothing he can do about the inescapable destiny of the south. His friend, George Hazard, is similar in most aspects, but sometimes seems to have a stronger character. It is he who shows Orry that, although there are tragedies, he must rise from despair and live, since life is the most precious thing we have. Although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship seems to be stronger than any prejudice, politics or conflict. <br /> <br /> Other characters are also particularly well developed. There are villains, like Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones, who are really evil, but most people are ambiguous as the nature of humanity has always been. Charles Maine is, at first, full of rebellion, prone to struggle; later, however, he learns to be a true southern gentleman for whom the pride of the south are not brave words but, above all, courageous actions. Virgilia Hazard represents the most fanatical side of the abolitionist movement that strives to condemn slavery and punish the owners of the "black breeding farms." His marriage to Grady seems to be a symbol of equality but also a symbol of saying "NO" to southern politics. Two interesting characters are the sisters of Orry, Brett and Ashton, sisters in whose veins runs completely opposite blood. Brett, in his kindness but also in his ingenuity, believes in absolute fidelity. She marries Billy, even though he is a northerner, because she really loves him. Brett is the representation of everything that is precious in any young woman. Ashton, however, is a vampire, a tigress, a woman who does not hesitate to do the most perverse things. The clear image of his visions of the world in conflict is his talk about men and family ... unforgettable moment and how universal! Most of the characters are directed to their values ​​... even so, the war breaks out and they will have to set aside a lot ... <br /> <br /> Second, the performances ... someone said no all people act naturally. I would not say that. I prefer to say that all the members of the cast do very good works on behalf of the main characters that are represented by younger staff to the guests that consist of famous stars, such as Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry does a great job. I consider this role one of its best. Lesley Anne Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. His part, perhaps, involves too much suffering, but manages to express very well all kinds of feelings. Kirstie Alley is very attractive and truly memorable as the abolitionist Virgilia Hazard. It is worth considering Phillip Casnoff, since Elkanah Bent is terribly ambitious, and David Carradine as a monstrous husband, who disgusts Justin LaMotte. And, unlike him, one must mention Jean Simmons, who is truly excellent as Orry's mother, whose heart beats for the glory of family life and the harmony of union. <br /> <br /> Third, the memorable moments of "North and South" leave a mark that does not disappear in the mind. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine? What a charm, what sweetness there is in this scene! Or is it possible to skip the moment when Madeleine's father dies? I found it really powerful, there is a real drama right now, a drama of a woman left by someone who really loved her. I also liked the Churubusco sequence and George Hazard was so concerned about the life of his dearest friend, Orry. So his encounters with Constance are great. Virgilia's speech in Philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance. And the last moment of the first part: although the North and the South can separate, their friendship will never die. Orry and George join hands symbolically as the train advances. Simply, there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it is impossible to mention even half of them here. And these beautiful melodies by Bill Conti and shot in bright landscapes. The music in "North and South" is very moving and memorable. <br /> <br /> What to say at the end? "North and South" is something that really should be on DVD, simply an incredible television series about the victory of everything that is precious in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truthfulness, absolute fidelity. 9/10
