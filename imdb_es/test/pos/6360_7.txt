"The Couch Trip" is one of those silly comedies they made in the '80s. In this case, Dan Aykroyd plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist, and goes to Beverly Hills to replace Charles Grodin. Most of the humor in the film comes from the satirical look of Beverly Hills and the empty lives of the people (a woman has a power struggle with her maid). <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie you only watch to have a good time. Do not expect any kind of religious experience. But most likely, you laugh a lot about how the people of Beverly Hills show off their wealth. Also starring Walter Matthau, Donna Dixon, Arye Gross and Victoria Jackson (from "UHF").
