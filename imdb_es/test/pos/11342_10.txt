The incredibly impressive romance of Kar Wai Wong that is for me, perfect. Located in the 1960s in Hong Kong. As shown, this is established at a turbulent time. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan. A man and a woman who are in an apartment in Hong Kong, where they both move. Chow Mo-wan works for a newspaper company. His Li-zhen Chan is a secretary. Two very different people. Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan create a special bond after they both discover that their spouses are constantly committing extramarital appointments. Among them. <br /> <br /> The characters of Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan are incredible. Both Leung and Cheung manage to collide with such amazing chemistry, it's better than any Hollywood romance that is published today. Set. The film has to do with the focus of the two drivers and their feelings after the infidelities of their colleagues. Kar Wai Wong manages to create such a strong character development between these two characters, you really start to feel for them. Leung and Cheung are incredibly amazing, they are better than any Hollywood couple that shows up on the screen today. Combined <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to describe Fa yeung nin wa than the beautiful and energetic romance that also presents a piece of bad humor, atmospheric and with a beautiful cinematography. Many elements of this movie help create it to be perfect. In addition to Kar Wai Wong and the acting, the cinematography of Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee is disturbing. Beautifully underestimated. The shots of Kar Wai Wong help your mind create a world of its own. A world that creates these characters. Original, melancholic and nostalgic. This movie is incredibly unforgettable. <br /> <br /> The costumes created by Kar Wai Wong's usual, William Chang, are absolutely beautiful. Cheung, who wears an elegant dress, with ankle ornaments, beautifully printed in each scene. She is a scene thief. Her costumes tell a lot about her character and all her dresses combine colors that are used vividly and intelligently. Very original. Chang, also the production designer, creates a brilliant stage for the film in a bad mood. Especially with the help of the wonderful music used in the scenes and the masterful editing of films, again by Chang. William Chang seems to be incredibly versatile and is an unknown hero for this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is one of the best of this millennium. Incredibly convincing and full of nostalgia. The shots are fascinating and disturbing. Kar Wai Wong proves to be a master at the top of his game. The acting; music; cinematography; edition; production; Costumes and direction help create a small, small and perfect film. A masterpiece in romantic cinema. Visually spectacular In general, a masterpiece to make movies. A movie that reminds me of the old Hollywood classic was the one that never was. Never forget the Fa yeung nin wa. I know I will not.
