Shtrafbat: The Criminal Battalion is poignant, and mostly honest, analyzes the lives and deaths of Soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash their crimes with blood during World War II. You can almost say it's the Russian equivalent of the acclaimed miniseries "Band of Brothers." <br /> <br /> Formed in July 1942, on the eve of the Battle of Stalingrad, the criminal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties. (sometimes as high as 90%). The prisoners of GULAG (political prison / concentration camps), deserters, soldiers who were captured by Germans but managed to escape, soldiers accused of violating the protocol, had the opportunity to join the Shtrafbat and demonstrate that there were no "traitors of the homeland "With their lives. Those who suffered injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and reincorporated in the eyes of the law. <br /> <br /> This miniseries presents a look at one of those Shtrafbat, under the command of Tverdokhlebov, an honorable officer. Who was captured by the Germans, was shot and left for dead. It has a colorful and varied group of people, pushed into a situation from which there is no escape. Antip "Kulak" (The Fist), his authoritarian and honorable criminal leader, and his small gang of unreformed criminals, a young Jewish intellectual who beat his anti-Semitic officer, Father (Orthodox Priest) Mikhail, who joins the battalion when his parish the house-to-house battles are destroyed, the political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to GULAG but who, nevertheless, are willing to fight for the last time for their people and their country, must find their courage and their reasons for keep living, and keep fighting. <br /> <br /> Although during a war, not all episodes present combat, in fact, the combat scenes that do exist are often chaotic, sporadic and short, which was probably the director's intention. In between, the miniseries focuses on several relationships between the cast, its antecedents, its thoughts and tragedies. The rape of a young woman by the soldier of Shtrafbat and then his execution, execution of course AWOL, periods of boredom in the march, the celebration (and the consequent consequences) of finding a German bunker with food (and champagne), the moral . The dilemma of officers who can not save their men from their own superiors, the deception of a spouse and other situations, occupies a prominent place. The camera is unbreakable: it does not get away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature, nor of raw human emotions. The dialogue does not censor the oath either. <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent and profound, and the script is also well written. Everything, from rage, fatigue, resignation, to finding a piece of joy to cling to, translates almost flawlessly. One complaint might be that some of the Russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone who is not familiar with the language and culture. Because it is a historical drama in a certain sense, some of the terms and situations (military rank, mention of other battles, certain historical references) may be lost in some spectators. This understanding is not necessary to fully enjoy Shtrafbat, but these references are a good touch of authenticity. Another complaint that could be imposed, is an occasional anachronism and a fold of the story to adapt to the plot, but, frankly, this is a miniseries so fascinating that one will probably forgive these small setbacks.
