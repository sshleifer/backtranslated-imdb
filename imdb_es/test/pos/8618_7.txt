Catherine Brreillat is a French director who loves to provoke her audience. She takes us to witness how a movie is made in the place. The film in production seems to be based on itself, since the person at the center of the story is Jeanne, a director, very similar to Mrs. Breillat. Jeanne acts as the alter ego of the royal director. <br /> <br /> Jeanne comes to a standstill at the beginning of the shoot. Not only has he chosen the wrong moment to photograph this movie during a cold period, since it is about locations on the beach that are obviously too cold for actors and extras. Jeanne has problems with the two main actors, especially the male protagonist who has trouble accepting the way the director has decided to show it in the film; The main actress is not an angel either. <br /> <br /> Making films, Mrs. Breillat tells us that it is a process like no other in a creative work of art. First, there is the writing period, in which, in this case, Jeanne, has written a screen work, which when it enters production reveals problems in which the writer / director did not think. There is the problem of how he wants to photograph a love scene in which the girl in the story has her first sexual contact. What seemed clever on the written page does not necessarily translate into an easy moment in front of the camera. The actor is made to use a fake penis and has many problems accepting the fact that a make-up has to touch him in ways he never thought another man would touch him. <br /> <br /> The luminous Anne Parillaud is wonderful as Jeanne, the director. He makes observations about the production, the actors and the team that fit well in the story that is told. Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play the main actors, with all the insecurity that some actors bring to the set of a movie. Jeanne has to massage her egos to get what she wants in the end. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant. <br /> <br /> "Sex Is Comedy" allows Ms. Breillet to give us her own opinion about films in general. This is a great look at how movies are made in a typical Breillat style.
