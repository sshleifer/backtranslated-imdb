I remember that almost every day I would run home from school to see the monsters movies on KTLA channel 5, but I never ran home faster than when this movie was scheduled. Somehow, the idea of ​​being a child and having a giant robot as a friend attracted me in a very unique way. Sure, I pretended to be Spiderman, Batman and other superheroes, but I really wanted to be Johnny Sakko over any of them. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie in 30 years and I can still remember it vividly. Who can forget the way the Giant Robot fired missiles from his fingers? Or how about the way Ghuillotene threw her nails to make explosions! Geez, I can even whistle the theme of the music that plays at the end, which is so tragic that I remember crying several times! <br /> <br /> Only another movie has the kind of magic that This movie does in my mind and that is the Wizard of Oz. But I've seen that movie many times since I was a kid. Of course, the Wizard of Oz is a true classic, while Voyage Into Space is a low budget nonsense. These two films should not even be mentioned in the same sentence, but for a child it is not the values ​​of high production or continuity that capture your heart, your flying monkeys and giant robots! <br /> <br /> P.S. My cousin used to make a very accurate impression of the Giant Robot (he called it "Robutt Giant"). If you remember, the Giant Robot had a particular way of firing its missiles and my cousin had it cold. I made him repeat the routine without ceasing for my personal amusement.
