The only thing I really can not forget about this movie is its beginning: the classic comedy, brilliantly elaborated. I love. See it for yourself (there are no spoilers here! :-). The fight between DeVito and Crystal also shines in this movie, with DeVito as the perfect oppressed son. One of my favorites. Highly recommended for crystal lovers.
