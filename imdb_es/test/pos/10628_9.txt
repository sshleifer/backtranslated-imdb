Isabelle Huppert plays a talented piano teacher who is serious, hostile and distant in public, and bitter towards her students. In private, she sees violence and frustration, and her sex life is lonely and perverse. She lives with her dominant mother, who obsessively pushes her to be noticed (and thus advance in life) as a talented pianist. The key to the characters of mother and daughter is the "obsession". These characters can not change their impulses any more than a rabbit trapped in headlights can avoid death. <br /> <br /> The piano teacher meets a young, attractive and talented pianist who is attracted to her from the beginning. They start a relationship in the least conventional way, but from the beginning she establishes perverse and violent terms that he should have, which makes him sick enough to want to end the relationship before it has really started. <br /> <br /> The film is linked to the female protagonist. Isabelle Huppert surprises with a brutal and convincing performance as a piano teacher. She ingeniously shows a woman who is attracted to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fueled by her perverted impulses. Like a movie that is based so much on the characters, you know it would not work half-heartedly, if it had acted wrong. <br /> <br /> This is powerful, has acted with intelligence and has adapted intelligently and sensitively from the novel. The camera work is also adapted to the film. There is something I can only think about calling: framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eyes to launch. This is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall, and is a testament to the director's expertise. <br /> <br /> Expect to be disturbed and sick by this movie. But, be brave, have the guts to go and see it. This is a very private vision of a person's life, but do not expect it to entertain you in the Hollywood sense ... there are no persecutions in this movie!
