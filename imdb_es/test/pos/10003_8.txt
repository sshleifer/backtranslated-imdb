Bill Paxton took the true history of golf in 1913 in the United States and made a film that deals with much more than an extraordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches on the deep anti-Catholic biases of British and American establishments. But deep down, the film is about the perennial favorite of triumph against all odds. <br /> <br /> The acting is exemplary at all times. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the film is Shia LaBoeuf, which offers a disciplined, dignified and very understanding performance as a working-class French-Irish child fighting the prejudices of the WASP establishment in New England. For those who are only familiar with their slap-stick performances in "Even Stevens", this demonstration of their maturity is a pleasant surprise. And Josh Flitter, like the ten-year-old caddy, threatens to steal every scene in which he appears. <br /> <br /> An old-fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: good acting, clear direction and a great story that catches to the end: the final scene, an affectionate gesture to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.
