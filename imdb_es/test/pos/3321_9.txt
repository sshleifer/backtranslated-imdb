A classic film from the late 50's. The main graduates (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography and performance of the younger cast are convincing. In a sense of the 50s (which I love). <br /> <br /> The look and feel of the contemporary artistic film (too artistic?) "Far from Heaven" reflects exactly this type of film (and I suspect that this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959!), But like a movie ... glorious! As a reflection of society, extremely interesting. And as a testament to how Hollywood breaks with the idealistic portrayal of American sexual mores, it's fascinating.
