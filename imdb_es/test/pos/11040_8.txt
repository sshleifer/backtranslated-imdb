I loved the great enlightenment and this story of the American working class society and the port life excited me in the first half of the 20th century. I was attracted by the timeless vigil of this realistic performance. See and feel the power of the stars. "Greek" melancholic comedy. Someone wanting a drink with a beer back? ... or a little ginger? Hey, mailman!
