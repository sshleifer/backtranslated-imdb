Commissar Mattei (André Bourvil) is a bachelor with a small weapon who loves cats and his boss in the Paris police department is a philosopher who knows that even the police becomes guilty sooner or later. That's what the movie is about. And a theft of jewels in Vendome place. <br /> <br /> Corey (Delon) brings the plan from prison, Vogel (Volonté) joins him and helps him against two tough guys, who chase him, because he took the mafia post. Rich (Andre Eycan) money, while Rico already took the girlfriend Coreys and left him alone for five years in prison. Corey and Vogel find a third man, Jansen (Montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by firing special ammunition made by hand in a hole. A perfect plan and cooperation, but they have to sell the loot and there is Mattei in the role of a disguised buyer. The circle closes. Running to help each other, Mattei and his little gun are shot by the gunshots. <br /> <br /> It took Melville 20 years, he says to make a movie of theft after he did not get a contract for RIFFIFI. Melville wrote the script and it was filmed in the south of France and in Paris of yesteryear. The great Henri Decae is as usual the lighting cameraman. It's the last previous picture of Melvilles who died after another movie with Delon in 1972. <br /> <br /> Melville actually wanted Belmondo instead of Volonté, he did not like that Italian, but Volonté-Vogel is a excellent fugitive and gives with Bourvil the most convincing performance. But look: Melville points out that Volonté is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very tired and absolutely impossible in a French scene. Melville did not like it at all and did not want to work with him ever again. <br /> <br /> Melville is wrong. Volonté gives the most animated character in the nothing of not so many interesting characters. You can see what it feels like being chased by Mattei and his dangerous little weapon and all the dogs of France in winter 70. A wild actor. <br /> <br /> André Bourvil, who died near the time of the shooting, was also not the first option, but definitely a great substitute. Transfers the instinct of a lone hunter throughout the film and in the end has the opportunity to be guilty again. <br /> <br /> Jansen entered the jewelry shop at night with a rifle and a tripod, but eventually runs the risk. Freehand a successful shot. When he meets Delon for the first time, we already know that the elegant Jansen has a serious problem with drinking. After the robbery, Montand refuses to take his share of the booty and mentions Delon, who looks at him, who only entered the red circle, because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. Delon does not get what he wants to say. The public remembers seeing Montand in a big scene in his haunted house fighting against the helpless nightmares that come out of the closet and attack him. At that time a very rare scene, one remembers a long time later. I bet it was always so difficult to organize and direct those things at a time when nobody imagined the next days of digital film creation. A great work of art when art was made by hand. <br /> <br /> Sure we'll remember a team like the actors, it still seems that even after 33 years, this is still the least popular of Melville's six thrillers. What's wrong with it? I am afraid that one is not very interested in those three actors (who show three criminals) and their police hunter. We learn very little about Corey and his fatal 5 years away from his beautiful girl (Anna Douking). Montand is still a great sniper, but what made him become a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe. Delon acts as if he were in a previous adventure of the samourai, Volonté is the man in the trunk of the American automobile of Delons and moves extraordinarily, and Mattei is a great actor at the edge of his life. But how could he possibly doubt that everyone is guilty? <br /> <br /> In an interview, Melville states that there is no woman in the movie. Not in the very red circle, but I remember well that cheerful woman Anna Douking (no future career). We are in the 70s. There, in fact, a woman gets up from the bed of an old gangster who wears nothing and walks slowly towards the door to hear the voice of her former lover Delon. Bardot did something like that 10 years before. This time Melville was directing. Well done. <br /> <br /> The RED CERCLE has certainly added some but not many brilliant gems to the history of cinema. The robbery in Place Vendome and Montands surprised the inhabitants of the locker room and Volonté escaped from Bouvil in white underwear and carefully carrying his pants through a stream. That's too little for a great gangster and robbery movie. But the 110 minutes never bored you and it's a high level game. And there are probably some secrets that you learn when you watch the movie over and over again. None of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late Francois Perier also appears. <br /> <br /> Michael Zabel
