What can I say? You expect that only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and chilling story about a serial killer who cuts the tongues of the victims. and replace them with silver spoons. Police officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team are tasked with trying to solve the mystery of seemingly random events, before more lives are lost. <br /> <br /> But be careful, despite your '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit scary movie. Some of the murder scenes are similar to those of SE7EN, and one or two can really be upset. But if you can resist that, sit in your chair and enjoy ... although it is most likely that you are on the edge or hide behind it. <br /> <br /> Rated as '15' by the BBFC for Moderate violence and strong horror.
