It is always a known and important direction device to set the atmosphere of a movie in the first 5 minutes. In the crucial opening scenes, the film must prevail and make the spectators realize and be interested in the rest of the film. Here, in "Mute Witness", we find an excellent example of this. <br /> <br /> * Scene spoiler * <br /> <br /> In the first 5-10 minutes, the film opens very Hitchcock scene of a beautiful blonde lady in her apartment, with the radio on. She is wandering around, applying lipstick, grimacing and ignoring the news report of a loose serial killer. Of course, the serial killer is at home, and monitoring his movements, knife in hand. She hears a noise, looks in a room, and there is her partner in a pool of blood. At the same point of her screams, she turns around to face the maniac who wielded a knife, who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrific act ... <br /> <br /> ... then something strange happens . When the woman convulses in her agony, the murderer sits down and pulls out a cigarette to see his victim perish. Before you find your lighter, your cigarette is lit ... from someone else in the room! The camera moves, and we realize that there are more and more people in the room, some taking notes, some filming, others recording death, and that the lady is taking a long time to die, and is doing a great job. Of that too When the public realizes what is happening, and the whole scene is part of a movie, the scene of suspense and horror takes on an element of humor. <br /> <br /> * End Scene Spoiler * <br /> <br /> I have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. First, it perfectly portrays the atmosphere of the entire movie. A thriller in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma, with very disorienting and even humorous moments. - Transmits a central theme (the difference between a "film screen death" and a "tobacco film death", a theme that develops later in the film), and finally, presents the viewer to the characters , as quietly as possible. <br /> <br /> The plot of Mute Witness centers around Billy Hughes, an American special effects makeup artist who is working on the shooting of the film, and is filmed in a large warehouse in Moscow. . Billy can not talk, but she communicates in sign language through her sister. After the end of one night's filming, Billy, inadvertently, finds himself locked in the warehouse by accident, and in his attempt to escape, he witnesses that two of the crew members do what appears to be a porn movie, but they turn out to be a rapture. movie. Suddenly, his escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death. <br /> <br /> Without doubt, the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely exciting. Billy's saving grace, and its disadvantage is the fact that he is not able to utter a sound. (In fact, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the movie is the fact that it is not full of screaming women). There are some absolutely disturbing moments, and some magnificent sets of real suspense (the corridor and the elevator shaft are perfect examples). Time is fluid, and the entire first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film presents new concepts. While there are still several moments of suspense, the focus is on the twists of the plot. New characters are introduced and it is ambiguous as to which side they are on. While there is nothing wrong with the second half of the movie, it just is not up to the first half. There are some good moments of black humor that are juxtaposed and perfectly mark some very dramatic scenes, but there are also some very boring comedy moments (which come specifically from Billy's sister and his girlfriend, who is the director of the film in which Billy is working), which almost ruin the movie, simply because they are badly placed and / or badly placed and ruin the rhythm. - In the end, the turns continue to arrive at great speed, and the climax of the film is, as it should be, as tense as the first half. <br /> <br /> There are several things that really make the film work. The communication barriers that Billy must face, as well as a mute as an American in Moscow, make even an emergency call for help become a dangerous situation. The actress who plays Billy, Natasha Zudina, does a wonderful job in the film, with a captivating presence on screen, and a brilliant performance, and finally, the direction as a whole, but more particularly in the first half of the film. what really is a study of the suspense / suspense techniques of Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> As I said, however, the disappointments in the film come from some terrible moments of comic relief that really are not necessary. be added There is already a consistent and effective line of black humor that appears in the film without the need for the characters of Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (The Sister and the Filmmaker) to turn their scenes into a series of unusual comedies. However, despite these shortcomings, the film is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller, and ideal for a group visit on Halloween. (Certainly better than the usual slasher horror movie ...!)
