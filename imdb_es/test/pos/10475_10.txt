Some have commented that subtitles are not a problem in this movie. I ask to disagree, the discomfort in the facial expressions and the subtle interactions between the characters are such that they can not afford to look away for a fraction of a second. . I tried to see, on the DVD, in English to overcome this problem (do not make this mistake, the result is a farce). The only way to get the full benefit is to look at it two or three times in rapid succession so you know it and then ignore the subtitles. A master class in functions, not in dialogue but in body language. <br /> <br /> These are the small things: the post office manager / shop keeper inflates his chest and enters to put on his cap before delivering a letter of! France !. The bewildered expression of the general as his delight in a cluster of perfect grapes obtains a biblical reference with a depth worthy of "Being there." <br /> <br /> The cinematography is impressive and the somber minimalist village with its discolored color only accentuates the sumptuousness of the party when it arrives. I have a friend who claims to be a descendant of the Borgias and whose family motto is "If it's worth doing, it's worth doing too much" - Amen. <br /> <br /> I laugh out loud and cry every time. I see this movie
