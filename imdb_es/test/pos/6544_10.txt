For those of you who have seen this picture on VHS, I would recommend the DVD. In fact, VHS is a complete garbage. The main reason is that the film was shot on wide screen (2.55: 1) and the producers ran out of money making the VHS version and released it as 4: 3. The result is that several actors are not on screen at all, and In many drag races, less than half of the cars are shown, since one is on each side of the screen. The DVD is actually a reasonable version of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many of the best scenes in the film were cut before the final release. They were seen as too offensive for minority groups. In fact, the prospect of a US release caused even more cuts in the movie. For example, the Americans supposedly did not understand words like Petrol & Strides. <br /> <br /> Mike's father and mother were destined to be hippies. The father survives in the film as a wasted smoker guitarist. But the next scene with the mother was cut. The scene took place in the space of the roof of the house, which was lined with aluminum foil, fluorescent lights and full of plants ... you have an idea. The producers had gathered many real plants for the foreground and when they saw the result on the big sheet, they got scared and the scene was cut off. Cowards! <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is known as a classic of the Australian cult. Voted # 2 on Street Machines, the best 100 films of all time, almost entirely Mad Max ll. The latter had more than 10 times the ROE budget. In fact, ROE's budget was so small that the director could not afford to ruin any of the cars ... even though there had been a public outcry if someone had ruined a real HO. (Compare that with Smoky and Bandit or Blues Bros, where dozens of cars were destroyed). <br /> <br /> So there is a real GTHO and two false ones. One of the fakes was purchased from the local indigenous community in Cobar after the reserve GTHO crashed in the back of the Country Boy truck. (That did not have a script!) The car was destined to explode from the side of the truck.) Because the budget was very tight, the car was made with a common brown masking tape instead of the real painted gold border. <br /> <br /> The 55 chev is absolutely real. The car started as a very simple 4 door and became brilliantly and quickly blown '55 into the film. The engine was a marinated 545 that produced around 1000 bhp. This was reduced to around 600 for filming. The car was easily able to 170 mph as shown in several scenes of the film. <br /> <br /> Just for the record, anyone with $ 12,000 could have collected ALL the cars after the movie. The HO, the Dodge, the '53 Ute, the 53 Chevmer of Rammer ... the lot. I wonder where they are now? <br /> <br /> SW
