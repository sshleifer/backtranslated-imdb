Italian soft X Exorcist clone. <br /> <br /> Woman buys statue of crucified thief. The thief comes alive and turns out to be the devil with fantasies of rape. <br /> <br /> Ivan Rassimov plays the devil brilliantly. Especially because of his gift of evil looks. And because he was never above doing nudes. Good for him. <br /> <br /> The actress in the lead did a decent job. Her innocence with her eyes open and the fact that she looked very well nude helped. <br /> <br /> This has a plot element similar to most Italian horror films. The girl's parents are immensely rich and depraved. Watch it to get the details. <br /> <br /> Laura Gemser's husband, Gabriel Tinti, also appears as a random stallion. His part is basically telephone, but like a cheap beer, he did the work. <br /> <br /> He missed the director because of his failures. This could have been a horror / sex classic.
