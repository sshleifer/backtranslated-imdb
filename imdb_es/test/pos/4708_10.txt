My ex-wife and I saw and were intrigued by the trailer of this movie. We waited for him to leave, but when he did he did not stay long in the cinemas. Several years later, I bought it on VHS and I'm transferring it to a DVD to keep it. <br /> <br /> I found it very moving. These are real events in a real country. BURMA has such a bad reputation for political oppression that it created that they changed their name. <br /> <br /> Women with little makeup are very sexy. Patricia Arquette is in this movie. Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray only mention it briefly. <br /> <br /> After returning home to find her son and her husband, Laura's brutal killer (Arquette) fears the blood. A bad trait for a doctor. His sister (McDormand) tells him to go on vacation to Burma. While there, he witnesses a peaceful demonstration and his passport is stolen. In a bold move (or stupid) she asks a tour guide to show her something outside the tourist circuit. Your guide is hurt by the soldiers and spends the rest of the movie trying to get him safe. <br /> <br /> Every time I see this, it reminds me that in the United States we forget a peasant. living under a military government, SOCIALISM, where at least eating is virtually guaranteed, it looks pretty good.
