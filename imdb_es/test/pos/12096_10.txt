This movie is one of the most memorable movies I've seen. I went reluctantly with a Turkish friend who recommended it to me. I am not a very enthusiastic supporter of musical documentaries, but when Aynur Dogan, a Kurdish woman who was forbidden to sing in Turkey for years, sings her piece, the theater was amazed. I would give my all to listen to a CD recording of this beautiful and fascinating song. And she is just one of the many interviewed and recorded artists who talk about her acting experiences in Istanbul. Even now, a month later, I remember the images of Aynur singing in an acoustic auditorium, and I try to remember the music as it was echoed in the cinema. Well done to Faith Akin, the director of this film, and his great idea of ​​capturing the many splendid sounds of such a cosmopolitan city. I would certainly encourage myself to visit Istanbul.
