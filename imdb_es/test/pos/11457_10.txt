I remember seeing this movie as a child and I was completely amazed, I could not take my eyes off the television. This movie has everything for horror fans! This movie did not have fun moments. I expected a couple of puppet liners (which was my favorite character in the movie) Kevin Tenney directed this gem and did a wonderful job on a low budget. I thought the ending was amazing, the only thing that could stop them was to survive the night they were unstoppable killing machines! The effects made by Steve Johnson are excellent. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves low-budget horror movies because, as the old saying goes, they do not do it that way anymore. The sequels were also quite good, but not as good as the original ones. This is something you should have in any horror collection, buy it if you can find it, you will not be disappointed.
