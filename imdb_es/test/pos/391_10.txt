Beautiful ... that word sums up this whole movie pretty well. Everything, from the cinematography, the direction, the acting ... great. At any point in the film, you can pause it and, without a doubt, you will be seeing something of mosaic or "artistic faros√≠a", as some people would say. I assure you that after a visit, "Bobbycrush" will be stuck in your head. I know it from firsthand experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It combines very well with the tone and rhythm of the movie. Thank you that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real (and surreal) images.
