This is a movie that in no way reflects the real world. Nothing in this movie makes sense in the real world or has a logic of the real world. It works completely in your little world and your ability to accept it or will not determine your love or hate for this movie. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the from the beginning I bought the completely unrealistic premise that the murderous woman will recover her memory when the past comes back to haunt her. There was an early moment in which I remember having accepted that this was going to be one of those movies where the heroine would not know anything until it was necessary, despite the logic that it would not happen that way. "Oh, it's one of those movies," I said to myself and was hooked when the movie took off in a savage two-hour chase. <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with brain and physical strength, as things are still there, proper. Logic and you really have to pay attention to follow some of the twists and turns. I like it very much and I am pleasantly surprised when I meet people who also feel the same. People love him or hate him, if they have ever heard him. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies, this is a movie to try. You may not like it, but it's certainly worth the effort to find out. <br /> <br /> And, as always, leave reality at the door.
