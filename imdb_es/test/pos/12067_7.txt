Like many situation comedies, "The War at Home" is getting better with each episode. The characters begin to become real and I create them as a family. I agree with many that the first episodes were not so fun; I thought the show would be canceled safely. But with the absences of "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Arrested Development," "War" offers the much-needed live action comedy for FOX on Sunday nights. And compared to the rest of the comedies that are broadcast at this moment, "War" is an even better option. <br /> <br /> Its appeal, at least for me, lies in its real situations. The teenagers have sex. Not all parents like how their children are getting out. Parents fight and they are called names. But instead of trusting to be "petty" as in many programs, everything is fine in the end, which is the number one rule of a good sitcom. <br /> <br /> One drawback of the program is the narration during / between scenes The flashback style of "Arrested Development / Family Guy" works quite well, but the narration may be too much. <br /> <br /> Therefore, anyone who needs something to see on Sunday nights should consult "War at home". especially considering what is in the other major networks at that time.
