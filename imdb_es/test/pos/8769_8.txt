"Saboteur" by Alfred Hitchcock (1942) (not to be confused with another Hitchcock movie, "Sabotage" made in 1936 that has a completely different plot) is not the best movie of Master of Suspense. The dose does not have the depth of "Vertigo" (1958) or the cloying environment of "Rebbeca" (1940) and certainly does not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in "Notorious" (1946), but Su Dosage is exciting, adventure and a climax to bite your nails. The two cables, it is true, are quite weak. It is easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the role of Robert Cummings and Barbara Stanwyck for the role Priscilla Lane played. In addition, the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (that were written by Dorothy Parker) date badly, and the encounter with the company of circus is badly made (the beard of the bearded woman is clearly false). However, the last half hour is the visualization on the edge of his seat, the climax at the top of the Statue of Liberty is very well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of "North By Northwest" (1959). The two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and the start of the fire at the Aircraft Factory is an excellent sequence. This is not the best movie Hitch did, but it's one of his most entertaining.
