It's good to see that I'm not the only person who remembers this great movie. I have very good memories of this movie; I seem to remember vaguely when I was about 8 years old and watched TV shows for children after school (someone with Broom Cupboard?). This was the first and the last movie that scared me, and the images of the boy surrounded by fog on a hill will stay with me forever! Like most films of this era, it has a happy ending: aimed at children, but with a defined capacity to capture the attention of adults. The beautiful landscape of Cornwall really makes the film feel isolated, and the "ghostly" scenes are simple but very, very effective! I'd love to try to find this movie again, see if it still comes home!
