Disney, Gene Hackman. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Finally, our Odyssey resumes in earnest with Greta Garbo's first sound movie, a simple character study called Anna Christie. An excellent performance by Mrs. Garbo, who showed from the beginning that her talents could move from the silent era (she wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix does not seem to be storing them. One thing I noticed again and again was the way the Swedish accent sounds, like replacing the letter J with a sound of Y. Anna ends up being the only character that I liked; I really did not care about his separated father or his possible suitor. It seems that the sound recording systems are improving (no one leans to talk about the mysterious can), but the camera still does not move. We will make sure that changes as our odyssey continues. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Our first film from the 1930s is the first sound film by the silent star Greta Garbo, Anna Christie. This is a very simple movie, with only five different places where we spent 89 minutes long run time of the movie, often with a static camera. It was also great to see Marie Dressler in the sound, and quite funny, since what we hear is an endless chain of sincere insults but intoxicated. I really enjoyed the performance of Garbo, since she holds the film even in the most sinuous moments. I really did not like George Marion or Charles Bickford, maybe because I did not like any of them, so I felt relieved and excited when Anna finally defends herself and shows them that she does not "belong" to either of them. his estranged father or his muscular Irish boyfriend. It's also great to see that the renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion has not lost a single step of silence to the sound. <br /> <br /> Last movie seen: Speedy (1928). Last chronological film: The Love Parade (1929). Next film: The Blue Angel (1930).
