In 2004, I wrote the following statements in an IMDb forum when a user wondered if The best years of our lives were a forgotten movie: <br /> <br /> ***** For me, seeing this movie is like open it a time capsule I think that, in many ways, "The best years of our lives" is probably one of the most fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the United States in the mid-forties after the Second World War. I think "Coming Home" and "The Deer Hunter", both released in 1978, were the most recent films that captured the numerous problems of the military that returned from the war and that were mentioned in "The best years of our lives". . <br /> <br /> What really impressed me was seeing the film in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many, if not all, of the university students applauded at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie still has a lot of details and I am very happy to read in other publications that other users feel that a movie that will definitely stand the test of time. ***** <br /> <br /> I am very happy to see the film ranked among the 100 best films in IMDb and AFI. In addition, although it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic, it is a wonderful life, it could be said that the victories of the Oscar to the Best Years of our lives, including the Best Film, were well deserved. <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie again in 2005 and after almost 60 years, The Best Years of Our Lives is still a powerful, beautifully acted and well-crafted movie.
