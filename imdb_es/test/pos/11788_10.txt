Aah yes, the training program was great. Not only did many women get fit, but many teenagers also did a great exercise. I am not saying that the program was not appropriate in any way for family viewing, but if you check the other works of the producer of the program, you will find more themes for adults in their works, which are also excellent. Many of the spectators were eager to see the show, both men and women got good information and a wonderful launch of the training. The girls were perfect, and beautiful, the show is a classic and should work well in syndication. The program should still be on, as there are never enough options to see when it comes to health and beauty.
