A very insightful psychological thriller! Footprints is an elegant example of the powerful Italian cinema of the 70s. And Luigi Bazzoni, an underrated director and visually striking "author". The film develops its unusual plot with an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere and never disappoints, especially in its sad and dramatic ending. Florinda Bolkan offers an excellent performance, full of nuances and a touching sensibility, being able to portray a dark lady that is not only fascinating, but also painfully real and tragically lonely. But the whole cast is a delight, too! Lila Kedrova, Nicoletta Elmi (the mysterious girl on the beach), the legend of the Italian screen Caterina Boratto and the incredibly beautiful queen of the movie B, Evelyn Stewart, in the brief but disturbing role of the friend of the protagonist. And Klaus Kinski in a surprisingly unsettling cameo! It's peculiar to notice how incredibly well done movies like Footprints were! The humorous and spooky cinematography of Vittorio Storaro, the scenarios and stylized scenarios, the unforgettable music of Nicola Piovani and, above all, the story, so intense and disturbing, so intelligently layered and structured! A thriller with fantastic elements, but above all with a soul and a personal vision. I want films like Footprints not to be forgotten! I wish the movies were more insightful and personal today as they were in the 60/70! And yes ... I hope someone soon makes a panoramic DVD digitally remastered of this little masterpiece!
