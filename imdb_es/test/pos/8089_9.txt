This satire is really, really on, and nobody is safe. But even though this movie has a lot of laughter within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here, intelligently renamed as "Hynkel", and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo-German), the overall tone is quite sad, maybe because of The place of the movie in the story. And the actors are not even exaggerating a lot, I suppose. One of the best cinematographic moments of all time should be the final speech of the Jewish hairdresser, if only things could have ended that way. It's not even the character that speaks the most, it's Chaplin saying something he really meant. If you ignore the technical aspects, the film does not seem outdated or old, it actually moves at a nice pace. And the sharp humor that we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing I do not care about is the slapstick, but that only comes with the time, I suppose. This is an incredibly bold and harsh version of fascism, it is very strong after all these years.
