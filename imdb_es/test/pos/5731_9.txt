This program was quite interesting. The way the program was shown made it even more interesting. String theory is also very interesting to listen to as well. The whole three hours in my opinion were worth it. I enjoyed listening to the ideas given by physicists. The extra dimensions really amaze the mind. If you have the opportunity, watch this incredible documentary.
