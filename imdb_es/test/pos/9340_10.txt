Before this clip, the music videos were simply to show an artist. "Thriller" by Michael Jackson created a new section of music videos that, honestly, can be called mini movies. "Thriller" follows a couple as they travel to the girl's house from a movie. On the way they meet zombies announced by the immortal Vincent Price. My favorite part is where the zombies wobble over the couple and the girl turns to see that Michael has become one of them. Then, they do a little dance. The most terrifying thing about "Thriller" may be the fact that it is always more fun and fun than many movies that are made. After twenty years, it is still the main music video. <br /> <br /> P.S. My music video Top 5: 5 - Madonna "Like a Prayer" 4 - Guns N 'Roses "Sweet Child of Mine" 3 - Ninees of inches "Closer" 2 - Peter Gabriel "Sledgehammer" 1 - Michael Jackson - "Thriller"
