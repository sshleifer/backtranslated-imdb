I enjoyed two of the three films in the trilogy "Sarah, Plain & Tall". This, the final of the three, was definitely one of the "good". It is an excellent family movie with the wonderful performance of the three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. <br /> <br /> The story is simple but well told. The only performance below the average was one of the children. It was interesting to see how the children had grown up since the first movie. <br /> <br /> Of the three, that initial "Sarah" was the best filmed with a beautiful cinematography. This movie did not have that, but it had the best story. He had some sentimental moments really full of tears and a very pleasant ending. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
