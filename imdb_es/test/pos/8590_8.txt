The story of how the (communist) leader who liberated the Congo from Belgian imperialism was eliminated by the Western powers at the hands of Mobutu. A story of struggle and injustice, of hope and the search for freedom. The story could be that of any African country. A very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty. If you only have to watch a foreign movie this year, watch this one.
