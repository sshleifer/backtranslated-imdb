But soon he will change his mind about Barry and they will discover another sabotage attempt that will take place soon. There is a group of anti-American fascists. Frank Fry is a member of that group. Sabote (1942) is another example of the fact that Alfred Hitchcock could not make a bad movie. Robert Cummings plays Barry Kane and he is very good at that. Priscilla Lane with her good looks plays Pat Martin. It is also really good. Otto Kruger makes a great main villain as the leader of th The fascist group, Charles Tobin. Norman Lloyd, who still lives at 94, plays Fry and becomes a very credible thief. Vaughan Glaser is the most sympathetic character of the blind man Philip Martin. The sequence of the ballroom is fantastic. And also the moments The train of the circus. In the end we are in the Statue of Liberty.
