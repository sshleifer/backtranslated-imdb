I could not help but savor the whole premise of CAT IN THE BRAIN because it explains diligently that a director is getting more and more crazy, seeing people killed by previous films he has made. Even mundane activities, such as cooking a meal in the microwave or turning on a water tap, produce a horrible butchery of a movie in the past. The director Fulci playing himself, is directing GHOSTS OF SODOM (?) And it seems he can not deprive his mental well-being of a constant murder. He seeks help from a psychiatrist who, in turn, uses Fulci's work as a method to execute a series of innocent people, hypnotizing the director so that he thinks he may be responsible. <br /> <br /> This is obviously a movie that has fun playfully. In the image of Fulci, while exploring the issues of how such a profession, which produces so much death and destruction, rarely indomitable, could shape and shape a legacy. The film presents almost an enveloping story surrounding endless graphic violence with all possible ways to kill a woman expressed in a creepy detail. This has a barrage of murders that Hitchcock could never address, or would probably want. The savagery of the film complements the state of mind of Fulci Fulci (.. I know) during the execution time. Reality and cinematic fiction have merged and Fulci can not find an escape. The end (... explaining the old cliché: "It's just a movie") could not work better than here. Fulci's boat says Perversion (... excellent touch) and leaves ... I can only wish that this is his last film because it is a perfect closure if there ever was one. David L. Thompson is the deranged psychiatrist who plans to kill his adulterous wife. Jeoffrey Kennedy is a policeman. Fulci's fears had a family killed by a demon. <br /> <br /> The extreme violence in the film presents many unique ways of removing the head, like the door of a chest, a scythe. , a chainsaw, and ax. The most brutal violence stems from the chainsaw's unpleasant activity, as a corpse is cut to pieces (... how a chainsaw's gardener works on a log fits perfectly in a nightmarish hallucination sequence). The most shocking of a chainsaw is when a small child is beheaded! The opening scene with the puppet cat tearing up, feasting on Fulci's brain, is a howler. The scenes that are spliced ​​into the film, with a horrifying aspect of Fulci, are obvious, but I could not help but enjoy this anyway.
