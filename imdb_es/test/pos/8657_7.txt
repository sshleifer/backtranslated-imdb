The Bothersome Man is an intelligent and surreal movie that makes you reevaluate what you are doing with your life and what motivates you. When you see these people in zombies as trances doing everyday events and you realize that this is what we do and what we want in real life, it really hits us close to home. This is a surprisingly effective film that in the end leaves you asking questions about your direction and not so much about the film. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the main character from whose life we ​​get a third person vision when he tries to adapt to a new life after being relocated. At first, he seems to be the most popular boy in the city, since everyone at work attends him and invites him to dinner, etc. A good example of this is on the scene with your new boss, who offers you an envelope of an unspecified amount of cash saying "Here's something to get you started." Andreas even gets a girlfriend 20 minutes into the movie, with whom he eventually moves. This seems like an ideal life situation, since his girlfriend is an established, attractive interior designer who never bothers her about anything she does. But Andreas is not satisfied with their relationship as with everything else in this world. Then he begins a romance with a co-worker named Ingeborg, from whom he finally leaves Anne and tells her that he is in love. After telling Ingeborg how he feels, she tells him that she is also seeing other co-workers and says that all relationships are "nice". Shortly after seeing Andreas at a train station where he tries to end his misery and for the audience, disappointment does not occur. Still looking for salvation, Andreas meets Hugo, who has found a hole from which music can be heard. Then they embark on a mission to get to the other side, will it be better or will it be worse? <br /> <br /> "The Bothersome Man" shows us the obsession of society with appearances and its materialistic mentality. He does a great job making fun of us by filling the houses with IKEA products that the characters spend each lunch choosing. I think he mocks Scandinavian society and its high rates of suicide. For example, there is a scene in the film in which Andreas meets a man who jumped from a building and got into a fence. In addition, Andreas, fed up with this world, cuts a finger and then jumps in front of a train; This is one of the strangest / scandalous scenes I've seen. This world created by Lien is equivalent to purgatory where there is no punishment or reward. In this world, drink after drink, Andreas never got drunk, sex was unsatisfactory and, no matter how hard he tried, he could not commit suicide. This movie reminded me of "Fight Club" and how the two main characters were not synchronized with the world around them. In "Fight Club", Tyler Durden creates a second person who does everything he would not do and in this film, the awakened Andreas is the equivalent of Tyler Durden. After a while, he wakes up and tries to escape from the bland life of the now separated one by escaping through a hole in a wall. <br /> <br /> Lien does a great job with continuity in this movie, which means that when a character has a half-filled cup in his hand and cut it, then he comes back, they have the cup in the same hand and they do not It is full or empty showing that the shot was made another day. Nowadays, the directors are more concerned about the sound effects and overlook the little things, is that character wearing the armband in the same hand as yesterday's filming? Since I took television production for three years in high school, it's hard for me not to look for continuity or voice-overs that drive me crazy. Lien does the little things well, has great lighting in each shot, never leaves you wondering why something is in a shot and generates an interesting subject. This movie really worked for me because it not only mocks the Scandinavians, but the western society and what is wrong. The only real problem I had was with the man who commits suicide by jumping on a fence with spikes. Because eventually you discover that this world has no death, but he remained motionless, forcing you to assume that he was dead and this is never answered in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the only main character since the others come and go, and they never do more than support him. His first girlfriend, Anne Britt, is an interior designer who, apparently, seems perfect for him, but in the end it is boring. This takes him to Ingeborg with whom he starts a romance and falls in love with him. She soon discovers that she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real. Andreas finally meets Hugo in the bathroom of a bar complaining that he already knows nothing and that he can not even get drunk. Follow Hugo to his house to find the hole in the wall that is full of laughter of children and birds. <br /> <br /> Lien does not have much in the curriculum, but "The Bothersome Man" is more than a good start to a great career, but it's a preview of a promising director. If this is an indication of his talent and potential as a storyteller, Lien has a bright future and we can only hope that his future films do not take so long to go abroad for our visual pleasure. So take a seat and enjoy the trip, since Director Jens Lien takes you from the comfort of your home to the dream world that is "The Bothersome Man".
