The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime that left me very impressed. Partially for the characters, many of whom fall into the fantasy / science fiction stereotypes of the anime, but placing these stereotypes in the rather mundane environment of the high school is a turn I appreciated. Then there is the titular character, a bit insane, which is something else: a stubborn girl, almost amoral, with ridiculous amounts of talent and a secret of which she has no knowledge. <br /> <br /> The configuration of the series is a bit of a mental journey. Basically, Suzumiya, unknown to herself, is a kind of super powerful being, capable of performing divine feats of creation and destruction, since she can destroy and reconstruct reality at her whim. Our narrator and main character is Kyon, a high school student whose sympathy / curiosity about Haruhi seems to cause her to drag him, against her will, to a club where she is beginning to spice up her life, because she is bored with life normal. In search of adventures, he affirms that there are three more unusual members, each with secrets, and all end up being dragged into their crazy plans. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of philosophical consideration, but nice, very nice from the beginning. debate if the world is simply the creation of Haruhi when he gets bored of the old and if our characters exist to serve her or so that she continues to exist or if they could exist without her. It's a bit of an enigma, but it's nice anyway. While the science fiction / fantasy scenarios occasionally occur in the series, I think the joy of the series lies in how normal things are, while the tension persists in knowing that if things are too boring, Haruhi could destroy the world with the hope of making it more interesting. <br /> <br /> The art is clean and in line with what I have come to expect from the anime that is normally imported into the United States; I like the character designs and, although there is not much action in the series, I think it looks better that way. The series is narrated from the mind of Kyon and does not play an omniscient narrator, only comments what he knows and what he feels. He has a lot of things in his head, but he does not really talk much, so it's good that we can listen to him. <br /> <br /> The voice acting in the English dub is quite acceptable, but I prefer that the Japanese act on it. There are some stranger aspects in the series, some of which are parodies and traffics in fanboy-ism, which I found amusing. For the first season, I must admit that there is a lack of closure, since the series does not really have a larger story arc, but it seems to take things one at a time, so it's an easy-to-learn series. , although I think that due to its quite entertaining qualities, it is still quite difficult to underestimate. It is also based on a series of light novels and the author participated directly in the writing of the series. <br /> <br /> Although it is based on novels, I wish that the previous series has arcs of stronger stories, but I love the naturalness of seeing these characters develop and how well the series can play. quiet moments, as well as the craziest. Seeing Haruhi grow herself was a pleasure, as well as observing the development of relations between the SOS Brigade (Haruhi's club). <br /> <br /> It is not for everyone, due to its premise that makes you lose your mind and "extraordinary beings". In a mundane world, "Adjustment" is probably not going to get angry with fans who are interested in action / science fiction / fantasy and may be too off-center for drama lovers more relationship-oriented, but for those who are willing to try something a little different, or something like that .. Strangely extravagant series like this, I think The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a pretty refreshing, unique and enjoyable series, but please, 9/10.
