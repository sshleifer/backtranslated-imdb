Orchards, and he has the brilliant idea of ​​trying his invention on the unfortunate bunnies once they are captured. Of course, as in other films by Wallace and Gromit, things do not go as planned. <br /> <br /> Similar to A Close Shave, there is a love interest for Wallace, in this case the Lady Posh people, and a bad villain with a bull dog. Gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions that make the character laugh with laughter. And, of course, Peter Sallis again gives Wallace's voice and it's a perfect fit. <br /> <br /> And as in A Grand Day Out, the cheese has a great comic effect as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> On the negative side this movie is a bit long. There are great effects and some pieces that make you sit and look, but maybe this story would have worked better as another short topic instead of pushing it to the fullest.
