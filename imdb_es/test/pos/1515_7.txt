Well, this is new ... The famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci records a film about a famous Italian horror director called ... Lucio Fulci. After years and years of witnessing horrifying sequences of horror, Lucio finds it difficult to separate reality from fiction and often hallucinates about committing violent murders. It quickly descends further into a spiral of seemingly endless madness and unverifiable poison. Even the dedicated psychiatrist can not keep Fulci on the right track ... Now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value, Cat in the Brain is one of Fulci's most enjoyable movies. The gore is overwhelming and copious, to say the least. The amount of dirty massacres is impossible to describe, especially when you manage to have the completely uncut version in your hands (known as the "Nightmare Concert"). The beheadings around, the victims' intestines extend on all sides of the screen and the chain saws work overtime. The film also becomes involuntarily funny (since it is very exaggerated) and is a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there is beer in the fridge. Of course, from a more professional point of view, this production can not be called exactly a masterpiece! There is not the least tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely empty. In order to make more space for the gore, the characters are introduced for 5 seconds and then die of a horrible death. Especially compared to Fulci's highlights, such as "The Beyond" or "Do not Torture to Duckling," this movie looks like a sandwich that heats up quickly. The best way to interpret "Cat in the brain" is as a personal statement made by Fulci and a direct attack on censorship. Maybe after seeing so many of his movies? Especially the last ?? being cut by censorship committees and beaten by pseudo-artistic critics, he wanted to avenge himself by delivering a bloody mess that simply can not be cut! If you eliminate all the explicit violence and makeup effects really sick, you only have about 10 minutes of images left! Especially because the crazy murders happen again later in the movie when Fulci hallucinates over them again. You can almost hear our director think things like, "Let's see how you're going to censor this now!" Even the whole development of the murder investigation happens in the background. Are the victims lost by one of their friends or relatives? Are there police officers looking for clues to take them to the killer? You do not know and Lucio does not bother to inform you about that, because that would lead to sequences that do not need to be cut. Oh, and it's also pretty pretentious! The name "Mr. Fulci" or even "Lucio" is mentioned every 3 minutes (34 times throughout the film, to be exact) and our director clearly enjoys being in the spotlight for a change. Hey, I certainly do not blame him ... After more than 30 years of delivering funny movies; I deserved to have some extra fun. You are a god, Mr. Fulci!
