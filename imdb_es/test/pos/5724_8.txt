Tempo Di Uccidere (Time to Kill) by Guiliano Montaldo is a bit strange movie, but it's good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I will not bother with a summary of the plot. Most of what I have read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most of the people who wrote them did not really understand the film. And you need to understand it at some level, even if you can not describe what it is about. This movie is strange in an "Once Upon a Time in America", but shorter. <br /> <br /> Many 'Hollywood' stars (whatever that may mean ...) have played in lesser-known Italian productions. It is known that many actors who have reached their peak or who are slowly rising do so. Cage was not yet a true star when this was done. I'm not a fan of him. He is very good in some roles (Raising Arizona, Bringing the Dead) and weak when he plays the hero. I really do not know what to think of him in this, but he does not portray the main character of the typical hero. This film could have done without him, but the fact that he was the protagonist may be the only reason why he has made a DVD. <br /> <br /> The cast is good. None of them seems fake and acts as if they were really there. Solid support <br /> <br /> I have seen 3 films by Montaldo (Marco Polo, Sacco & Vanzetti and this one) and I think he is one of the most important directors of this era. Unfortunately, nobody knows him. This film was the last in a long time (a recess of 19 years). I think this movie could have failed in the office, but because of the way it is made, I think that for Montaldo it was a personal project that he really liked. <br /> <br /> The production is excellent. It is always enough. The dusty army camps, the clausthobic cities and the magnificent landscape play an important role. Everything feels very real. In some scenes you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but the music of Ennio Morricone is very good. It is not a piece that you will whistle when you are in the shower, but it sure works very well. <br /> <br /> So this movie looks, feels and sounds perfectly. It does not serve the lessons learned in a gold tray, but that may be the biggest difference between Hollywood and the euro-cinema in general. It may sound strange to give an 8 and not recommend it to people, but that's what I do. If you are looking for action; Avoid this one! If you are looking for a well done Apocalypse in a different time and configuration, but with a little similar travel towards a "state of mind" (sorry if this sounds corny but I do not know what to call it) you could just enjoy this a lot.
