In this short film of approximately 34 seconds produced by Thomas Edison, we see Annabelle Moore performing the choreography "Serpentine Dance" by Loie Fuller with two different and fantastic tunics. <br /> <br /> Moore was one of the biggest stars of the late Victorian era. She appeared in several shorts of the Edison Company, including this, which was one of the first Kinetoscope films to be shown in London in 1894. <br /> <br /> Loie Fuller actually patented the Serpentine Dance, which Moore performs here in The Tunics (as well as the entire frames) that are often dyed by hand in the film, presage one of the most common symbolic devices of the silent era. Supposedly, Moore's films were popular enough to have to be remade frequently (including remodeling). The version available to us now can be a later version / remake. Moore became even more popular when it was rumored that she would appear naked at a private party at a restaurant in New York City. He later went on to play the "Gibson Bathing Girl" at the Ziegfeld Follies in 1907. He appeared there until 1912. <br /> <br /> The short stands out for its movement structure, which, especially during the "The second half ", it becomes almost abstract. In a way it resembles a painting by Morris Louis, although this is almost 60 years before Louis's relevant work. <br /> <br /> I should be able to find this short DVD on several different anthologies of the first films.
