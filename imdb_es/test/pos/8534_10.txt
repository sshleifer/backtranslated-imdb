(Spoilers warning) I can not say enough about this movie. It's a great horror / parody comedy that does everything right for a change. The humor is great and it goes from the funny to the funny, what you will shout funny. In one scene, Ed goes crazy editing and erases a great scene. When his boss is looking at Ed's edition, he shouts: "In what part of my scene is the beaver-rape?!?!" Hysterical. There are also many other dates and great moments, fun and memorable: Ed shouts "Do not look at me!" While hitting a poor idiot repeatedly in the face. Very funny things. The plot of the movie itself is so ridiculous that it is priceless: Ed is a guy with manners who moves to the horror film editing department, and after a while he goes crazy, sees monsters and attacks people while he quotes the horror Movies he has edited. This movie has it all and it's just hilarious. The DVD only costs around $ 7, and it's a big bargain since it's the wide-screen cut with no rating. I have many DVDs, most of which cost a lot more money than this, but not many are as good as this movie. My Evil Ed DVD is one of the highlights of my collection and I would beat someone with a phone receiver if I tried to steal it. Evil Ed oozes style and quality, something that Hollywood filmmakers need to learn. Evil Ed is a rare gem, and I would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie. You did everything right and I love Evil Ed! 10 out of 10 !!!
