This film premiered when I was 15 years old and could easily relate to the themes that the film described. <br /> <br /> That was more than 24 years ago and I have not seen the movie since then. This time I cringed for some of the acting, but I still appreciate the movie for what it is. <br /> <br /> Life is not always fair and good people do not always win, in fact, I think the film did well. to reflect that, especially when I was a teenager, the punctures always did better with many girls. Also, no matter how kind you are, you can not make them like you. Girls / boys like who they want to like, no matter how much they try otherwise. Sometimes you just have to let it go and say the following. <br /> <br /> Gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for Karen. This is so true of teenagers when they look at someone. <br /> <br /> I remember sitting with classmates laughing at our culonas. The performance is not at all compared to the Fast Times at Ridgemount High, but it is at stake with this movie, simply because FTARH has a friendly ending for the lame viewer, since this movie has a realistic ending. Good guys finish the last ones! Gary is presented as a very valuable and lame material, but we all know that these types of people are very sensitive. We all know a David, a funny guy who makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Some people here keep the ending, but hello the end is exactly what can happen in real life. Some girls only come back for more no matter how bad the boy treats them, especially at that age. I have experienced that first hand. <br /> <br /> Great sound track too!
