Extraordinary Surrender is a terrifying practice, surprisingly authorized by Clinton, that allows the United States government to capture and detain any suspect, apparently for any reason, of being a terrorist against the United States. This is a sensitive issue, especially after September 11, because supporters of the practice will always criticize the opposition for denying the US. UU The power it needs to fight terrorism effectively. Fanatical supporters will label the opposition as terrorists in themselves. <br /> <br /> But as a recent film that lent a similar level of humanity to the death penalty, The Life of David Gale, Rendition shows us a story of the misuse of extraordinary interpretation, or at least the facility with which it can be exploited and applied falsely. The story involves Anwar El-Abrahimi, an American chemical engineer born in Egypt who is impounded on his way back to America after giving a lecture in Egypt. The cause is that he made phone calls to a known terrorist. There is never (or need) any proof that it was Anwar who made the calls, that his phone was never lost from theft. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Anwar's extremely pregnant wife, Isabella, is back in the states trying frantically to find her husband, who took a plane to Chicago but apparently never got off. The faint explanation that she was never there evaporates when she discovers that she made a purchase in flight with her credit card. <br /> <br /> Lately I have been investigating modern Chinese history, particularly that of the amazingly selfish and brutal dictatorship established by Mao Tse-tung, and it is more than a little frightening to see the similarities between the extraordinary interpretation and some of Mao's brutal tactics of fear, including his public executions (which people were forced to observe), and the extensive use of torture specifically used to obtain "confessions". <br /> <br /> It is quite disturbing to note that Mao specifically did these things to create an atmosphere of fear in order to achieve the obedience of the Chinese. To say that the Bush administration has not created an atmosphere of fear and continues to do everything that is worth, would be extremely naive, and although an extraordinary interpretation was not created under Bush, it is clear that it does more harm than good. <br /> <br /> Adding to the thickness of the film is Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works behind a desk for the CIA and has little field experience, until his boss is killed and suddenly finds himself supervising The torture of a man who quickly comes to doubt, has something to reveal. The daughter of Fatima (Freeman's boss) also plays a pivotal role, as does a senatorial assistant played by Peter Sarsgaard, who could have the most satisfying role in the film. Meryl Streep is also appropriately cold and clinical as a cold-blooded senator with dogmatic support of the need and practice of surrender. <br /> <br /> Like a political thriller, the film is remarkably well crafted and in rhythm. But the most frightening thing is that all this is real. The goal of the film is to get people to really think about things that are done in the name of the United States, especially when they say they are made to prevent those same things. Carrying out terror in the name of preventing terror will not gain any compassion for us, nor extract confessions through brutal torture, which is the most basic form of criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we gradually move in that direction, to do these things more instead of less. The terrifying question is what is the event that will take place at some point in the future to convince us to stop and go towards civilization and peace, or will we continue heading towards a military dictatorship until we finally achieve there?
