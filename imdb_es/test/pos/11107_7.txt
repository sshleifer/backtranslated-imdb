When it comes to these extravagant and disquieting films of small criminals, the genres that revolve around characters that border scum and live in equally rugged environments, and also transmit that hesitant and somber feeling thanks to a rather dirty cinematography and a very black comedy ; Dead Bodies is the kind of movie that Paul McGuigan would like to make. Unfortunately, the maddening and sporadic Gangster No. 1, as well as the same throughout the store, but the interesting exercise in surrealism mixed with realism, the effort entitled The Acid House are the only ones we have so far. Dead Bodies is a piece by Robert Quinn based on a screenplay by Derek Landy, a film that stretches along the line between psychological horror and neo-noir; mixing elements of crime and terror with issues related to morality and obsessive and unnatural disorders. <br /> <br /> McGuigan's criminal efforts in the UK carry that wavering and distorted feeling, like witnessing someone's nightmare and having front-row seats in the process. His films are capable of disliking some areas and amusing others with their extravagant and general approach. Do they carry a very dreamlike sensitivity despite being rooted in a very realistic, trite, dirty-looking world? the real world with as much emphasis on the horror and terror of the situations that its characters generate than anything else. Dead Bodies is a film that addresses some situations guided by the characters, as well as a brief inclusion of a study of a delicate psychological mentality, only that here, the film balances both the eccentricity of its characters; The terror of the scenarios in which they find themselves and the questions of morality that arise much better. <br /> <br /> Dead Bodies is effective and quite simplistic without feeling manipulative. His suggestive and wise tendency to want to hammer home exactly what people are thinking and feeling does not detract from the experience. At first, we find Tommy McGann (Scott), a young man whose girlfriend Jean (Davis) dominates him, his life and screen every time he is on for the brief time it is. The point regarding the fact of their situation of living in a less than desirable house; with a job of stacking shelves and a partner with whom he does not take anything well is exposed in a different way. How is the way in which the public is given a different permission so that Jean does not like it, with the spoiled, spoiled and expectant attitudes that he so clearly possesses. Later on, the film will stop, quite obviously, in the face of a police officer as suspicions and tensions increase in what is clearly a cheap and easy way to tell the audience that our hero is still not out of trouble . <br /> <br /> But compare this with Gangster No. 1, in which such is the episodic and wrong approach that McGuigan applies to the material; that a vital and vital point of the plot arises when a character is seen leaving a building for another person in a 'random disc' in a scene set several months after the previous one. The feeling is not so deep-rooted or satisfying. The Dead Bodies organization is dominated by Jean de Kay Davis; an aspiring fatal woman simply wanting to fight in some way, but not being able to find her. She has driven Tommy by jumping through rings; go there, do this and that without Tommy really reacting in the way he could, mainly because it is controlled by his promises of sex. The beginning generates a certain amount of tension due to Tommy's underestimated reaction to what is happening and culminates in a different release when the initial incident occurs, and Jean dies. <br /> <br /> If the configuration is simple enough, then that's one thing, but the pinch of the project is the way Tommy decides to get rid of Jean from his hands by burying her without informing anyone about his best friend. Things tensed when it happened that there was a second corpse in the same place where Tommy buried Jean, with suspicions, denials and general problems with the ingredients of the day. It is at this point that the film blurs the lines between noir and horror; in fact, Tommy inhabits rather: a large, sinister, spooky and even Gothic house that he shares with a senior relative who lives in the upper areas of said house. This evokes memories of the 1960 Hitchcock movie, Psycho and Bates', which he has with his mother and where he is. Furthermore, it is no coincidence that this possible place of horror is the scene of Jean's unfortunate demise. <br /> <br /> The placement of a corpse in the hands of the hapless man, leader to act. since the initial incident is a classic created for any noir; From Ulmer's 1945 film Detour to a more recent and more contemporary film compared to Dead Bodies, 2006, entitled Big Nothing. In what develops this film, is a twisted; A rather unpredictable and rather frightening tale of genre hybridity and mental games told in a palette of clearly drained images. The voices in off and the tread on the thin line that makes the protagonist in most of the film between the right and wrong help to push it towards a realm of neo-noir; If we consider the fact that lead is, in essence, innocent and his murder charges are unfair, then that's one thing, but his attitudes toward Jean saw him act without thinking and his cover-up of his death is the antithesis to dropping the murder charges. The dead bodies are taught; It is entertaining to see it without feeling exploitative and provides a consistent tone for the rather unpleasant physical and psychological content that is being explored.
