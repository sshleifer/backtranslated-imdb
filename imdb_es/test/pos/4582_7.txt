Yes, I know that this movie is a comedy! And the humor is exaggerated! But the issue of people becoming less intelligent in the future may not be that far away! I can not say what will happen, but if we do not take proper care of our educational system, this could be a possibility! I have noticed that some schools no longer teach facts! (As history, geography, basic matter). The focus is more on learning practical skills! The theory behind most subjects can be boring, but it is essential to understand how things work! In the movie there is a ridiculous example of people who cultivate with Gatorade instead of water. Well, we can laugh at that! But if you were never taught that water contains minerals necessary for plants to grow, how would you know? For me this is a terrifying notion! So now you understand why this topic is not fun anymore! It could be that Mike Judge is mocking but at the same time warn people of a real disaster if education does not improve quickly! Am I taking this movie too seriously! Yes of course! To each your own fun! I loved the work of Mike Judge (Beavis and Butthead and Office space)! In these he was able to be critical and fun at the same time! In "Idiocracy" I missed this! Most events are too absurd and, as I said before, very frightening! I think if you're in the mood you'll like this movie!
