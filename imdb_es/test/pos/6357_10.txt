First, I must say that I do not speak Spanish and I generally do not enjoy Spanish-language movies ... BUT Two Coyotes is an exceptional movie. There is enough action and drama that it does not matter if it's a Spanish-language movie. The subtitles were easy to read and did not block the action - or the drama! <br /> <br /> I would tell movie fans in Spanish and non-fans of Spanish movies to watch this movie. Action and drama are worth every penny. <br /> <br />
