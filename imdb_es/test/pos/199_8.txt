While watching this movie recently, I had to constantly remind myself that it was made in 1957 .......... and in the USSR. That makes it even more remarkable. Many of the cinematic effects in the film seem clicheados in 2002, but they were quite original in 1957. The first time I saw this film was in 1963, when it was released in the USA. UU., And I was surprised by its originality at that moment. Now that I've seen it 40 years later, I have no reason to change my mind.
