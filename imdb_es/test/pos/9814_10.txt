In response to the "state of confusion" Dog injuries seem to disappear quite abruptly, but that may have been just an error in continuity. But, as for the children who try to build a plane with garbage, it's just a matter of imagination. These are two very young children who have a very active imagination and must rely on that imagination to avoid being exposed to the reality of the level of abuse that occurs in their home since their stepfather. As for the stepfather, it is very interesting that the director has decided not to show his face. That makes it seem more monstrous. If you show your face, then that character becomes a person and not just this "monster" that is terrorizing the childhood of these two innocent children. By showing only the consequences of their abuse and not focusing the scenes on the abuse itself, children become the main focus of the film. This movie has no loose ends, but it runs like a father's story to his children. It has ornaments. This is a good American classic.
