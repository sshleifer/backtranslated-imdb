My opinions do not flow with the majority in most cases. I tend to lean towards the artistic, imaginative and different. This film is reminiscent of Frances Ford's "The Black Stallion", in which a fantasy situation is created to show the beauty of a magnificent creature that is not available to see in its heyday, except in these multitudes of documentaries as natural. Unlike nature films, this offer uses the best film creation techniques that the industry offers for a diva that creates one of the most sensual superstars (the cat) on the screen. <br /> <br /> This fantasy represents the love relationship that develops between a French soldier (he is also very kind) lost in the Egyptian desert and a female leopard he finds when he runs the risk of an Egyptian temple abandoned be fascinating. I bought it wholeheartedly. If you are a little open to fantasy and appreciate the grace, beauty, power and sensuality of the feline, you should enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in my book was the end. It was a perfect setup for a Romeo and Juliet finale, which would have taken me to the top. <br /> <br />
