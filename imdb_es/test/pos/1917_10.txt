I saw this movie on TV and I loved it! I am a true fan of disaster movies, and this was great. The cast was made up of some really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in a league of his own. You can play both the comedy and the thriller in the same movie as few others can. The story line is great too. The idea of ​​being able to follow a timeline of what will happen and using this timeline to avoid a global disaster is an interesting idea. And this movie reveals it in such a way that it is almost totally credible.
