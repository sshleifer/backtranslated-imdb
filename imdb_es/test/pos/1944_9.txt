I've seen this movie three times. Returning to the VCR, in the 1980s, and again on the channel of The Encor last night (February 11, 2010). Based on a true story that I remember being in the news, in the early 1980s, I decided that it seems too disturbing to see her again. However, it is difficult to look away from a car accident. The most spooky character is Joshua John Miller, who plays Keeanu Reeves' younger brother. <br /> <br /> (The story on which this film was based can be found anywhere on the Internet, only on Google.) It is Anthony Jacques Broussard, who murdered Marcy Conrad in Milpitas, California, in 1981 .) The characters portray Pre-grunge Generation X, bordering sociopaths, with the exception of Keeanu Reeves, who is aware. <br /> <br /> The old hippies did a great job raising that generation. <br /> <br /> For such a Young Man, I thought that Joshua Miller was excellent, like the serial killer in the character of creation. Actually, he went to Yale, and has written scripts and directed. His acting abilities in this movie were incredible. In the same way that he treats his little sister by drowning his doll and breaking the tomb of his wrists, it gave me the chills. He gave me nightmares. Even with what is happening in our world today, in 2010, it is still the most degenerate film I have seen to date. <br /> <br /> The apathy and dysfunction of these families are enough to make you vomit. This exciting death almost makes Manson's murders pale in comparison. <br /> <br /> Crispon Glover put too much into the character. He ended up with David Lettermen to talk about his role, and almost kicked the host in the head. Apparently, Glover had to seek psychiatric help after portraying his character. <br /> <br /> Also, fight the good fight against the great Dennis Hopper. You are one of the best!
