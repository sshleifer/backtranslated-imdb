Here we have an intelligent mix of typical hongkongmovieshootouts, themes of world destruction and intelligent cinema. It's not that the script does not have its big holes and some special effects are a little more economical in appearance. But cinematography is an optical treatment and the soundtrack is first class. The combination of fast action sequences and slow colorful parts, sometimes almost poetic, has no comparison in its type of film, so a classification is quite difficult. The closest genre is a disaster or a terrorist film with human and political notes deeper than usual. It is worth being seen around the world in theaters. But I expect this for so many other movies (mostly Asian) before and nobody seems to believe me. Unfortunately.
