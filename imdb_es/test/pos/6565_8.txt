Hey, I've never seen a Manga comic, but apparently this movie is based on one. Oh, well, that's life. Anyway, this is a pretty strange movie, to say the least, since things literally get out of control in a small Japanese town. People are becoming obsessed with the uzumaki (spiral) and this young woman looks at her friend's father videotaping a snail, and later in the film, do people start to become snails? It also seems that the father of this child becomes so obsessed that he somehow commits suicide on a household appliance. There is a bit of weird humor here that could be at home in a Tim Burton movie, but there is something nasty and bloody that only the Japanese can do with justice. However, as with many Japanese films, the end is the end, was something resolved? Well, not in my opinion, it was not like that. There are some indications of why all this is happening, but they are not explored and there is much left for the imagination or it was not considered important. However, there are many things to look at to celebrate and if you are not obsessed with everything having a perfect sense, it is worth seeing, because it is very original and bizarre. My favorite was the father with the rotating eyeballs, personally. 8 out of 10 stars
