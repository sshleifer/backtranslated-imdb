What's there to say about "Pink Flamingos"? It's beyond criticism or even explanation, since it really does not aspire to be like any other movie you've seen. You will get it, or you will not, you will laugh or roll your eyes with disgust (or both). John Waters is a strange filmmaker (who expresses it gently), mixing both the childish and the innocent humor with surprisingly offensive moments destined to ... well, who knows what his intentions were. It's like a form of assault, although fun. <br /> <br /> What makes Waters humor so contagious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that may seem strange and completely familiar to the viewer. Like the little rivalries that make up the plot of "Pink Flamingos". Surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point, but it is almost certain that the issue at stake was not the title of "The vilest person". What makes the visualization of the film convincing to me is the way in which Waters creates dazed and self-contained environments and does not allow him to participate in the joke immediately. The people in his films are completely in tune with each other. For example, when Cotton tells Babs that she does not want to accompany her to the city because Crackers takes his "friend" to the trailer, Babs reacts with a knowing smile and says, with a conspiratorial tone to the side, "That's the small shed is simply PERFECT ... "At this time, we do not yet know that Crackers plans to take his" lady friend "to the shed to throw live chickens on his naked body while Cotton looks orgasm through a window, but this rarity is totally common and understood by the characters in the degenerate fictional world that Waters creates. <br /> <br /> Another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and Channing, the devious butler of the Marbles. The first time we see them, Waters cuts from a scene in the cozy office of Connie to Channing that descends to the basement, where we see that there are two women down there, one dead and one very alive, who disappeared. Susan is not a shrunken victim, but she is furious and abusive to Channing, and she launches to launch a full-scale verbal attack on her jailer. Both have a strange understanding of the strange situation, and she does not feel intimidated by her abduction, as she is violently insulted and justly furious. She does not stop for a second while Channing is in her sight, and the two scenes that show her delirious banter are two of the film's most salient comedic aspects. Later in the film, when Divine and Crackers break into Marbles' home and discover their crimes of keeping women kidnapped in their basement, it represents the total lack of support that Divine and her family have for the mark of depravity that marbles They are pleasing -there is something that Divine is not familiar with, a corruption created by her new rivals, and she despises it. Also, although kidnapping does not seem to be something Divine would think twice about, she is outraged by the fact that the girls are detained there and released happily, enjoying the revenge that is made against Channing. <br /> <br /> In At the other end of the spectrum of filth, Waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the "real" world. The first time we see Connie, she is disparaging a minor character named Sandy Sandstone, who has never heard of Divine. Cookie, on the other hand, reacts with a hilariously objective assessment of Divine's title as the "dirtiest person in the world," revealing that she inhabits this world of tacit insanity as well. <br /> <br /> You should also say something about the way players are in contact with their respective roles, especially Divine, who does not lose a note. Not once does he hesitate in the ridiculous attire and character that has been given to him, and he takes "Pink Flamingos" to a new level or rarity. People really believed that Divine was like that in real life, and it's easy to understand why, because as you watch the movie, you're not really thinking about the movie, but about the people who made it. Since you are really doing the outrageous things in the script, you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a strange documentary. <br /> <br /> But even more, "Pink Flamingos" is not so much a movie as it is an event, or something that happens to you. Even though its shock value is almost non-existent for me (I say it mainly because the ** hole scene and the chicken scene still make me shudder), I still find this movie hilarious and addictive.
