This short film was nominated for an Academy Award, losing to Anna and Bella. Not since Dr. Strangelove has been so funny about nuclear war! Condie takes a situation and puts it on his ear and then turns it around just in case. The visual gags abound in Condie's work and I always see something that I got lost every time I see this. In the biggest animation in the world, it's worth watching for this and many other shorts. Recommended.
