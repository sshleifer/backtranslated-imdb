This was really a "nightmare" of a movie; I saw it about nine years ago on cable television and I have not forgotten it since then. Pixote is a 10-year-old boy who lives in the streets of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends Lilica, Dito and Chico; they steal, manipulate, sell drugs and murder to survive every day ... In the first half of the film, Pixote is captured by the police and sent to a sadistic shelter where he witnesses all kinds of abuses on the part of inmates greater. Guards for the rest of the children. One night, Lilica's boyfriend is killed after a beating, so Pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot. The rest of the film shows Pixote's descent into a criminal life; he does not show any feeling or remorse after killing someone, maybe because he knows that good feelings are useless in the world he lives in ... But, nevertheless, there is a soft scene in the middle of the film; Pixote and his friends are on the beach, missing (and wishing) one of his friends from the reformatory that was there. I thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible events ... the boys obviously crave not only their friend, but also a better life. "Pixote", by director HÃ©ctor Babenco, is a brave and depressing film that does not escape showing the harsher reality that many people, including myself, tend to ignore or misinterpret. This movie will probably open your eyes and make you a better and more compassionate person.
