This movie, one of the best I've seen, talks about the lack of communication. He does it by plunging us into a livid Taipei, dyed in cold colors, where the rain falls incessantly; A DAMP world. It shows us the story of two people living in this world, a man and a woman. a coincidence, or destiny, links their existences, but they can not open one to the other with words. The characters are the mirror of the difficulty of our society in relation to interpersonal relationships. An incommunicability that here takes to the extreme limits. all the characters exchange only a few words during the film, the dialogues are almost absent and, when pronouncing some words, they are often weak and empty, far from describing the true feelings of the people. Therefore, the progression of the story, the revelation of the feelings of the characters develops (brilliant idea!) By the musical digressions, although seemingly meaningless, that stain the film. The procedure of the sentimental event, and the drama of the female protagonist, lead us to a splendid ending, strongly symbolic. A film totally different from the usual, an intelligent realization by a director of great talent. P.S. Forgive me for my bad grammar!
