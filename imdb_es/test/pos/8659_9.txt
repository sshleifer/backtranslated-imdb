First real movie this year. Incredible long shots, sometimes with a fixed camera, so specific for Nordic cinema (for example, Dogma). A real author's film I find it. Athmospherique :-) He just loved all my senses and keep in mind how the image becomes violent and painful during the scenes when he tries to commit suicide. That is the point that I do not think stands in the whole plot. Why, if this was an ideal world, you could not die but you were still maintaining your consciousness? Either the real world had "personalized" rules or it was a "fantastic" world, but in this case accidents can not happen as people remember what it was like before. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of Kafka and maybe more of Huxley's brave new world, especially in that part where sex was really available to everyone, since it was considered a right to pleasure. It lacked a plot, but I think it was better that way, since you noticed and felt the strange behavior of everyone, the absurdity and the lack of real sensations in this "happy" world. <br /> <br /> I think. Also that the end was brilliant. The real world is, in fact, a homo homini lupus, it eats if you're not strong enough.
