"The Thing" is the best film by John Carpenter. Combining his talent to create tensions and clashes with decent production values, it turned out to be a perfectly crafted science fiction / horror film. <br /> <br /> When filming in really difficult conditions, it creates a very credible isolated research base that establishes tension. before something has happened. The ensemble cast works well together with Kurt Russell, proving to be a charismatic leader even under all that beard. <br /> <br /> By slowly increasing tension with moments of bloody horror (courtesy of the effects of Mr. Rob Bottin, currently directing Freddy vs. Jason) Carpenter creates a film that has rarely been paired. Considering that this occurred the same year as ET, it could not be more different! <br /> <br /> It's worth a watch / rewatch. 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> p.s. The DVD is excellent. Many extras plus the best commentary on DVD (with Carpenter and Russell). Also, remixed in Dolby Digital for even more frightening sound effects.
