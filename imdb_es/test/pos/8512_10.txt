People criticize NSNA because it is a low point in the career of the Bond god Sean Connery, and because it is not official. *** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * First of all, this movie is better than any other bonus movie that shows any other actor other than Connery, all the would-be peers in my book. Sean Connery is the only real Bond, no one even comes close to his endurance, good looks and sex appeal. Yes, this movie is a low point in Connery's career in Bond, but it's still the best Bond movie of the '80s. Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good at an older age. It did not become a loose disaster like Moore, but it maintained its good looks and endurance, but it gained some gray hair. And that? He's still the only real 007, and he's as great and strong as ever. Sean Connery is the only 007. And this movie is definitely worth watching, no matter what others say. No cannon opening, but you can not have everything, right? great musical theme, however.
