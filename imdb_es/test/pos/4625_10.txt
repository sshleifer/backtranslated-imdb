I had the pleasure of witnessing this brilliant film in a preview screening in Sydney. Although it was a pleasure to see it. Pleasure is not the emotion that remains as credits accumulate. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a film that addresses not only a stigma felt by young individuals, but all of them. The main one of which is isolation. It is not only to place the final galvanizing scene of the films on a pedestal above the others, but it is important to see it as the culmination. And from that, it is important to realize what it represents for you as a spectator and for the people directly affected by it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is not a soft image but the way in which Mr. Thalluri handles his subject with a deep dignity and his unrestricted approach acts as a merit to his message. <br /> <br /> I do not think movies like 2:37 should be scaled with favor votes. Rather, it should be recommended to those who seek a purpose in their visualization. <br /> <br /> A portrait of brilliantly designed, lost innocence. And a master stroke for a talent still untapped. <br /> <br /> You can not miss it.
