The best movie so bad that it's good never made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether to deal with everyday life or with the pimping of the apple, I can always turn to him for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy is the man. Nobody is more bad. Watch Dolemite as he and his army of all-female Kung Fu assassins take down Mr. Big and Willie Green. Awesome plot, huh? There are so many lines of a single line that multiple visualizations are needed to improve your vocabulary. If you say a couple of Dolemite lines, you're instantly great. If you're in the mood for a riot of laughter, rent this movie. You can also watch The Human Tornado, Disco Godfather, and Petey Wheat to draw the son-in-law of the devil. Now, can you dig that? <br /> <br /> "Do not limit yourself to anything, insecure, to eat rat, motha!"
