The last movie that provided a vivid and disturbing look at what is probably madness was In Dreams. In that movie, you did not see the madness, you were THERE. Now The Cell comes with an updated and much more disturbing description of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer. The opening scene takes you to the seemingly innocent mind of a small child in a coma, and the things Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are, first of all, fascinating and then terrifying. The things he later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are incredibly imaginative and fascinating, most of these things have never been seen in the film. <br /> <br /> The history of The Cell is Not exactly something that is truly innovative. In fact, it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs. You have a murderer in custody and these people have to enter your mind to find a victim who is currently in danger of losing his life. The only real difference between the fundamentals of the plots is that in The Silence of the Lambs, you have to enter the mind of a murderer to find a different murderer, as well as his current victim, while in The cell, you must enter the Mind of a murderer to find his own victim. However, despite the unfortunate story, The Cell completely revolutionized the psychological thriller genre. None that has been made has even approached it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film had a good direction and was extremely well acted. Vince Vaughn offers another of his characteristically excellent performances (he was even as good as Norman Bates in the pathetic remodeling of Psycho in 1998), and even Jennifer Lopez makes the second good effort of his career (the other is the great Out of sight) . Nothing can be said about the cinematography in The Cell to give it enough credit, it was imaginative and fascinating, and it has no parallel with anything that has been seen in the history of cinema. The Cell is an incredibly well made film, and deserves to be recognized.
