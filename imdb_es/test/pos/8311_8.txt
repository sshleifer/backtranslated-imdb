His fantasy adventures John Dark-Kevin Connor were a mainstay of summer holiday movies in the days leading up to Star Wars: they were not masterpieces, they did not have the most modern special effects, but they were exactly what an audience of children who wanted a movie in the mid-70s. <br /> <br /> At the core of the Earth, the right tone is captured for the appropriately named Burroughs adventure about the Victorian inventor Peter Cushing and the inevitable Doug McClure that ends in The Underworld of Pelucidar and fighting against his evil telepathic fighting against dinosaurs. This time, the puppets have gone in favor of the men in monster costumes, which is much more fun if you're willing to suspend your disbelief, and if you're not, there's always Caroline Munro's cleavage. Aside from what might well be Peter Cushing's worst performance, an irritating but bolder reprise of his film Dr Who ("You can not hypnotize me, I'm British!"), It's easily the best of John Dark -Kinkin Connor- Doug McClure fantasy adventures, surprisingly well directed and with an atmospheric use of color. He was never particularly good at exterior scenes, Alan Hume's photography greatly benefits from the control that a studio gives him (the film was filmed entirely in sound scenarios) to paint a vividly world worthy of a pulp novel cover. It is not high art, but it is definitely great the morning fun on Saturdays.
