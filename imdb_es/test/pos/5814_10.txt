I would recommend this to anyone who is an admirer of the late John Cassavetes. And for those who have never heard of Cassavetes. It is an excellent movie. I really do not have time to go into detail about why this is my opinion, but if you are looking for something courageous, with many scenes to ponder, then this is for you. Cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film, as well as the story itself. This "review" does not do justice to the movie. It is an experience that one must see for themselves. LOTS OF CHARACTER. VERY GENUINE
