Pink Flamingos is a movie that no word can explain. It was just as good, I thought. Expand the movies Starting with a "multiple" start and ending with a shocking but intelligent ending, Pink Flamingos is one of the best movies of the year. Do not miss this opportunity to see a great movie. Rent it on video or watch it at midnight, like I did. But just look at it.
