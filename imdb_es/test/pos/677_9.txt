The first time I saw this movie was around 1956 and although I saw it again recently, I have not changed my mind about it. I think it was Robert Ryans' best film, because he represented someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life (my father), although he never murdered anyone, but he was more affected during World War II, which it got worse. Having to please him just to survive and spend the day was very appropriate. (My mother and my brother had to do this) When I saw Robert Ryan portray this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this kind of person, and it impressed me.
