Stop the belief for a moment and stop pretending that we can, could or should know "what it is" or "should" in space. Human knowledge in that area is probably primitive, since maps of the Middle Ages are compared with current satellite maps, so we really have no idea. 2 Considering that this is "just" a documentary simulation of BBC TV, it gets much better than many big-budget Hollywood blockbusters, and that's just amazing. 3 in general, a show that is worth seeing, since it portrays CGI's improved and fictitious account of what we know of the solar system so far. Probably, the fictional and CGI of all this is the only way to make it acceptable to a large audience. Have you ever seen clips of real space missions and real space probes? The quality is generally from average to poor and the comparison would be between looking at a chest x-ray (and what it says about the human body) and comparing it with a cyborg CGI-ed movie ... which one would be the most entertaining? However, the chest X-ray is real, while the cyborg film is simply a fictional SFX. 5 actors do a good job. None, I will tell my grandchildren, but very fair because it is a documentary simulation of the BBC.
