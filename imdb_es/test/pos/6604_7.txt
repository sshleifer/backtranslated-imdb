Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about the Zephyr Skateboarding Team, and its influence on skateboarding. It also focuses on the history of skateboarding. It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, another member of the team. The documentary stars the members of Team Zephyr and is narrated by Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> The documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding and how it evolved from surfing. Discusses the popularity of skateboarding in the late 60s and 70s, its decline in the 80s and its "rebirth" in the 90s. Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica, California. Zephyr's team originated in Zephyr Surf Shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards. The documentary consists mainly of the original Zephyr Team members talking about the past in Team Zephyr, the competitions they won and their popularity and prestige. It focuses on three particular members of the team; Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the three best members of the team. <br /> <br /> The interviews in the documentary were usually voices about archival images of Dogtown in the late 60s and 70s. It is very rare that you actually see the people interviewed, but when you do, they show up in black and white, while the file images are in color. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (that is, the Days of Glory of the Zephyr Team) and not the present. The documentary has a very fast pace, as we often see impressive skateboard clips about the music of the time (such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and interviews tend to be quick and to the point. Not knowing anything about skateboarding (that is, not knowing how to mount one directly on the ground) I was very surprised that this documentary seemed so interesting to me. The reason is that this doco had more to do with the team of Zephyr than with the real sport of skateboarding, so, although I could not relate to skateboarding, I could relate to the guys on the team. Because it was made by real team members, it gives a little more depth and authenticity. <br /> <br /> In general, I must say that this is one of the best documentaries I've seen. It gave me a new perspective, not only on the Zephyr team, but on skateboarding in general. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it should be even more interesting. Seven and a half stars in ten.
