If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber, just take a look at his new movie, "Everything is Illuminated," which clearly shows a man who is not only one of the best actors in the United States, but a new director whose first effort is undoubtedly. An inspiration and a foreshadowing of what follows. Schreiber has adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer to a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material. The film clearly exceeded our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas. <br /> <br /> For those who have not seen the movie, maybe you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Jonathan is a collector. His love for his grandparents is unlimited. Watch as her grandfather dies and her grandmother is on what appears to be her deathbed. In a clear moment, this dying woman gives Jonathan a picture and an amber ornament for his collection. Looking at the photograph, taken a long time ago, you see a young couple together. Seeing him makes Jonathan think he shows Grandpa and his girlfriend, facing happier times. Seeing the snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to look for the past of his ancestors in Ukraine. <br /> <br /> Jonathan has made arrangements with a travel agency, Heritage Tours, of Odessa for his trip. to Trochenbrod, the mythical place where his grandfather came from. The agency is run by an older man, who claims to be blind, and his grandson, Alex, a man who loves American pop culture that has captured his imagination, as well as his contemporaries in the country. Alex speaks a kind of English, nobody speaks and their conversation and translation, for the benefit of Jonathan, are very funny to our ears for the use of terms in English that sometimes are not heard. The old man insists on taking his dog, Sammy Davis Jr., against the wishes of Jonathan, who does not want to sit next to the animal that growls and barks during the trip. <br /> <br /> As they embark In search of Trochenbrod, it is clear that his companions, especially the old man, have no idea where he is going. At this point, the film becomes a road movie, since the three characters who travel the secondary roads of the country know each other more. When the trio arrives at the field of sunflowers with the house at the end, this indicates that they have indeed arrived at the right place. Some places are a clear reminder of the conflicts of the past. <br /> <br /> The older woman, who lives in the isolated place, is the missing link in the story. She is able to put things in the right perspective. But this is where the story changes its emphasis from Jonathan, who has clearly come to the land of his ancestors, to the old. We observe how this older man begins to remember things about himself. This, in turn, changes the dynamics of the film as we discover how connected Jonathan and his guides are all the time. <br /> <br /> Some criticisms in these pages have expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story, which after all, is a work of fiction and freedoms have been taken. It would have been impossible to make another film that includes so much content in the book. The great way in which the film is divided into different chapters is an intelligent way for the viewer to know what is going to be seen. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, a magnificent film actor, does an excellent job of underestimating Jonathan. Mr. Wood makes one of his best appearances in any movie with his interpretation of the main character. The happy cast of Eugene Hutz as Alex, the Ukrainian assistant and translator of the tour, seems to be an idea made in heaven. Mr. Hutz is the best of the movie. Its arcane use of English gives the film a fun angle that delights the viewer. Boris Leskin as Alex's grandfather and the driver of the touring car makes a valuable contribution to the film, as well as Laryssa Lauret, who is seen in the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> The excellent picture by Matthew Libatique Brings the splendor of the countryside of the Czech Republic in all its magnificence. The musical score of Paul Cantelon is heard in the background that adorns the film in a way that adds richness to the film. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a triumph for Liev Schreiber, the first director who will do it. Surely it will go far in what you decide to do next.
