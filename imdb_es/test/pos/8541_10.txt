Do you know those movies that are blatantly horrible but you can not help but love them? Well, that's what Evil Ed is, possibly the best horrible movie in the world. The sound is garbage, the dubbing is crap, the script does not make sense and the special effects are pap. However, I can not help but love this movie and I have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. Sam Campbell (or the guy who plays it) must appear in the Actor's Studio series, as it is memorable. Possibly the best villain in the movie is not called Tony Montana. Seriously, if you do not expect much, then you will not be disappointed. Keep a cheerful approach to watching this movie and soon you will qualify it as ten.
