Good music, great dance, a sexy star (Swayze) and a real sexual desire shown by a female character (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters who are motivated mainly by lust and it's a nice change. I also believe that the film captures very well what it is to be a teenager who faces class problems and that ideals suddenly face reality. Of course, it is sad at the moment, it is, after all, a musical film, but in general it is a real pleasure, a fun romance and also politically enlightened. This movie also has one of my favorite movie lines of all time: "I took the watermelon".
