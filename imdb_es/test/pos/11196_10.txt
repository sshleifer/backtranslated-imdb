ý thýnk uzak ýs is one of the best movies of all time and everyone should make this movie. I am a Turkish boy and a great funny cinema. and these days our film industry is on the rise. And UZAK is the best Turkish film of the last ten years. And maybe one of the best movies of all time. The director Nuri bilge Ceylan is amazing. They tell stories, characters, the atmosphere is wonderful. He is a minimalist director and talks about family routine events, dreams, hopes, life. He talks about you, he talks about me, he talks about us. I promise you'll find a piece of your body in this movie. The life of cinema welcomes a new Director. He is waiting to realize. I promise you will love this movie, please see it.
