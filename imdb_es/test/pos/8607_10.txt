I am not infuriated by the fact that, now and always, I will have to identify this film (which I consider a masterpiece, and I do not use that word lightly) with the adjective "Not the Michael Douglas movie!" Not only are the titles the same, but they refer to the same thing: the radioactive consequences that rained down on the survivors of the first nuclear bombings. In the Imamura movie, this is not a cheap metaphor; The whole film is about the physical and emotional consequences of Hiroshima and the war itself. As the deterioration of a couple and their adult niece becomes more and more clear, the ironic images become more powerful, from the old clock that reboots every night to the stone gods that gradually accumulate outside the door. the heroin (These, in turn, are recorded by a bombed veteran who is forced, in a series of tragicomic episodes, to attack anything with an engine that approaches the city). The day of the bombing is shown in flashbacks in parts that are horribly horrible. However, "Black Rain" ("NtMDm!") Can be seen, even repeatedly, due to Imamura's compassion for his characters. I repeat: a masterpiece.
