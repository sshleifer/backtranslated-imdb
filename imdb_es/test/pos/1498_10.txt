Remembering the "good old days" of 1971, we can remember vividly when we were treated to a full season of Charles Chaplin at the movies. That's what the promotion guy called him when we saw him on someone's old talk show. (We can not remember who it was, MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest spoke about Sir Charles' career and how his films had been out of circulation since the exclusion of the old one in 1952 "Little Tramp 'The United States for being an' undesirable foreigner '(No Schultz, it's NOT from another planet!) <br /> <br /> CHARLIE had been considered a' subversive 'because of his interest and his open investigation on various political and economic systems From the anarchist movement of the 1920s (and before), the fashion of technocracy to socialism in its various forms was a fair game for debate at Chaplin's Hollywood parties; Inclusion of style Soviet, which we commonly call communism. <br /> <br /> COMPOSITE Mr. Chaplin's problem was confused with one small detail: He had never become a US citizen. <br /> <br /> ANYWAY, enough of this background! <br /> <br /> SUFFICE to say that he had become 'Non-Free Person' in the United States of America. . It was time to take the old movies out of the naphthalene balls and return to the movie houses. Surely it would be a great gesture for us to easily forgive and quickly forget Americans. <br /> <br /> It would be a good gesture for the great cinematographic artist; In addition, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences planned to honor Chaplin with a special tribute at the 1972 Oscar Show. This would surely be a tearful but joyful bundle of pathos from the fact that the United States invites Charlie to return and award him a Lifetime Achievement Award from the special Academy in front of a television audience from around the world in the millions. <br /> <br /> ALSO, that would be a natural thing to promote the Chaplin Season at the Theater! (Remember, the little vagabond was as cunning as a businessman like the filmmaker!) The program consisted of exhibitions of MODERN TIMES, CITY LIGHTS, THE GREAT DICTATOR, MONSEUR VERDOUX, A KING IN NEW YORK and finally the CHAPLIN REVUE. We remember being very enthusiastic about the anticipation of the multi-date film festival. <br /> <br /> At our Chicago city fair, it was reserved for the Carnegie Theater on Rush Street. The festivities began with MODERN TIMES and all the others would be shown one at a time, each of which will remain for as long as necessary to satisfy the public's desire to see each image. As we remember, the last one in the calendar was THE CHAPLIN REVUE. <br /> <br /> IN RETROSPECT, we look back and wish we had started the race with REVUE; as undoubtedly there were legions of spectators (very similar to ourselves) who knew very little about their achievements in films, except for the Shorts Silent Shorts of Keystone, Essanay and Mutual that were shown as a regular feature in so many, many children's shows in all the country. Oh, well, once again, nobody consulted me! <br /> <br /> CONCENTRATING on today's guest movie, THE CHAPLIN REVUE, we found that they were actually three separate images; carefully united by the use of the narrative by Chaplin (himself), some animated themes and incidental music (once again written by Chaplin) and some happy and serious talk (Ditto, by Chaplin). He opens the procedure by making use of some home-made film-type films that represent the construction of the Chaplin Studio in Hollywood, as well as some films taken from some time of rehearsal, which show Director Chaplin demonstrating what he wants to a group of actors. <br /> <br /> THIS segment was well done and well received by the audience. Both the construction humor and the trial were amplified making them seem accelerated. (The essay naturally, the building by using the acceleration of the photographic process of the camera.) The old trick makes it seem that the buildings almost build themselves. <br /> <br /> THIS amalgam of shorts incorporated three of Chaplin's short comedies from his time in First National Pictures, approximately 1917 to 1923. The choice was well thought out and gave us a variety of themes and moods. <br /> <br /> FIRST WAS SHOULDER ARMS ( Charles Chaplin Productions / First National Pictures, 1918) As the title suggests, it is a story from World War I. Launched in October 1918, with about a month to go until Armistice Day on November 11, it was a comedy of comic gags of the Army and a romance between Private Chaplin and a French girl (Miss Edna Purviance) .The lightness is fast, physical and in the great tradition of ridiculing the enemy, the German army. <br /> <br /> DISPLAYING a excellent example d In the old adage about children and dogs that bring people together, the following movie THE LIFE OF A DOG (Chaplin Productions / First National, 1918) traces the parallel lives of Chaplin's vagabond and a newly adopted street alley, Clipping. The story of the film involves families, two of them. A Homo Sapiens, a Canino and both gave us great surprises. <br /> <br /> As a final, we have THE PILGRIM (Chaplin / First National, 1923) was a good option to have as final. It was bright, light and tight. It was an excursion to the Western Spoof area, since all the comedies and teams have made comedies of this type. The "Pilgrim" in the story is not of its standard variety of Thanksgiving; but rather a "friend" or "Tenderfoot," who has ventured westward. The vagabond is not just that guy; But his character is an escaped convict who mistakenly thinks he is the new clergyman of the Church of a western city! <br /> <br /> OUR rating (ie, Schultz and me) is ****. (That's Four Derbies) <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
