I have seen several Hamlets, and I have taught the play. While watching Jacobi, I am tempted to think that he is as intelligent as Hamlet himself, so he is alive in all the nuances of this character's wit. Deepen, instead of solving, all the enigmas related to the character of Hamlet. He illuminates line after line, word after word, shining light in this brilliant mind. At the same time, however, we are ashamed of the horror that Hamlet feels at his betrayal, much more than with any other actor, because Jacobi feels pain more deeply than anyone else. And we shudder at Hamlet's own betrayals, because Jacobi does not fear the tenderness to which Hamlet can descend. In short, Jacobi gives us Hamlet in its entirety, and Hamlet in its entirety is the best character in literature. That's why I'm convinced that Jacobi's Hamlet is the best performance I've seen in an actor.
