In this romantic tragicomedy tense and driven by the character, we are given an idea of ​​the interrelated lives of four Parisians in their thirties. In the center is the representation of Max by Vinz Cassell. A Romeo with starry eyes, falls head on by the beautiful unknown Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his best friend Lucien (Écoffey, in a discreet but effective performance), he wins his heart and live happily ever after ... that is, even the intriguing, neurotic and obsessive Alicia (the versatile Romane Bohringer) gets very involved in the lives and the loves of the other three. <br /> <br /> The rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological imbroglio, and the film emerges as an intricate puzzle, the sweet eyes of a postcard of Paris. in the heart of everything. The use of color does not go unnoticed, especially in Lisa's spectacular apartment (which presumably represents the title of the film), where reds and yellows ignite the fires of passion and lust. <br /> <br /> The public can relate to Max: he really has his heart in his sleeve and is constantly punished for the irony and the circumstances for it. In a memorable scene, our beloved lovers (separated agonizingly by a 'choreographed' misunderstanding) almost miss the opportunity of a meeting that would surely reunite them. Independently of each other, they travel to the same destination: she in the Metro, he in a taxi, practically tête-à-tête. However, fate seems to have it for them, and the public is captivatingly joked. <br /> <br /> The performances in this film are really what makes L'Appartement stand out. I still can not understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside of France. It has presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassell's real-life wife at the time of writing) has recently become famous in the English-language film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons: it is a divine beauty, but behind it there is a talented actress who can dominate a scene. in the classic style of 'main lady', which many British and American actresses discard in favor of the 'subtle' approach too easy. <br /> <br /> With everything, watch this movie! I doubt you're disappointed. It is exciting, satisfying, fun, sad, luxurious and a lesson in artistic film creation.
