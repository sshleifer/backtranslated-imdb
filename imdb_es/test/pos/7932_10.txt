I learned a lot from the previous reactions of the viewer. Is there anyone who does not mention the 'propaganda'? Too simplistic. 'Perception depends on the concept'. I love the Fred Astaire musicals, the great great songs and the incomparable grace of Fred. But, comrades, if you see sleepy and inert parasites dancing on the pious and unemployed, that is a valid critique of "capitalist propaganda." Any film is impregnated with the values ​​of its time and place, without mentioning those who finance it? The pipers that call the melody. The great art transcends everything, just like 'Nevsky', as well as 'All quiet on the western front'. I confess. I saw it more than 40 years ago. But the images are burned in my brain. It is the best battle scene that has ever been filmed. And you're horrified to be excited. 'Plastic ice' someone said? That is the true death you are seeing. Real extras died doing this. "Real look" is now defined special effects as it seems. In the same way, 'too long', for a time of reduced attenuation? Mozart had 'too many notes'? Propaganda, defamed the Catholic Church? The Vatican STILL did it when they asked for old favors for the German Christian Democratic government. Recognize Croatia in the 1990s? Do you remember the chaos and the genocides? Forget about the props, did Nevsky's lighting paint the medieval world? like a breughel. There is one in the palace of Hampton Court that shows a massacre. Maybe the Dutch nationalist propaganda, but it tears the heart. Stylized performance? So, what is Henry V (Olivier's movie)? Naturalism? Does anyone believe that medieval English knights murderers spoke like that? As has been said, the music of Prokofiev is magnificent. Only Ken Russell and Eisenstein had the balls and the genius to match the sound and the image at this 100-octane level. OK, you want the snaffle & bit. I will risk nervous torture every time. Eisenstein did not copy the Wehrmacht helmets, rather, his model seems to have been the cubes used by the "Teutonic knights" in the Nazi contests of the 1930s. Eisenstein was a genius, but unlike Hollywood directors, he had almost unlimited time and funds (non-commercial). Modern Russian directors are free of political ties, but they have no money. Even Kurasawa had to make a late (big) movie in Communist Russia. He was revered but not funded in his own country (like Russell). How much propaganda is there in the eye of the beholder? Imagine healthy people from another world who love peace. How would they react to Nevsky? Will the battle, or the affliction for the dead, dominate their cognitions? If we did not know about the gas chambers and the SS, what about the 'Triumph of Will'? Where can I get a Nevsky DVD, cheap?
