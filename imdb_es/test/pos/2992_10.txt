I really liked that movie! OH MY GOD! This movie was so strong! I found it among some old tapes and did not know what it was and, after having read the back of the cover, to see what the summer had to say about it (which by the way, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack of the film more times than he mentioned what the movie was really about), I found it interesting and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older movie. <br /> <br /> "What controversy?" I thought to myself when I put the tape in the player, I was curious to know. And my expectations were certainly fulfilled. I loved! I guess it's a very feminine movie, but it was so sweet and adorable! It was a beautiful romance, although sometimes the address reminded me of the camera work in 'The Graduate', that when I saw it I thought the director should have been in acid with some of the close-ups they did. <Br /> <br /> Well, then it was not entirely conceivable that these two children would flee and live alone ... but it could happen ... in a fantasy ... <br /> <br /> But, the final simply marked me sincerely! I was so angry with the way they finished it ... somehow it leaves you hanging, and I guess you can address what really happens to them in the sequel ... but at the same time, I almost hesitate to see that, since the Sequelae are almost never as good as the first. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie to anyone of sixteen or more! It's an awesome movie ... Awesome!
