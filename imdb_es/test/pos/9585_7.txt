'All Abir-r-r-d' by Friz Freleng is one of the best cartoons of Sylvester and Tweety. Unlike the many repetitive cartoons in the series that simply transplant the same tired gags into a new environment, 'All Abir-r-r-d' makes the most of its concept. Tweety and Sylvester are domestic pets that are shipped unattended across the country by train. With a vigilante officer and a vicious bulldog to deal with, Sylvester has his job ahead of him. The caricatures of Sylvester and Tweety always benefited from some additional participants and 'All Abir-r-r-d' is a good example of how much these additional characters help. Although they are not especially memorable creations, they throw some more obstacles in Sylvester's path and make a battle more interesting. This early Sylvester and Tweety briefly press many of the correct buttons and, while Tweety is often particularly annoying with his forced tenderness, there are some delightfully violent antics between Sylvester and the dog, which culminate in a surprisingly brutal climax that unfortunately is clouded by a final impune No quip by Tweety.
