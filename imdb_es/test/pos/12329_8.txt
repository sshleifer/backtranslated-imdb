I have great memories of this movie ... <br /> <br /> I was only 12 years old when it was released and it scared me a lot. I really miss my bejesus ... <br /> <br /> Zombies, cemeteries, mausoleums, how can you be wrong? It's like Phantasm's retarded cousin. <br /> <br /> This film premiered 1 year before the PG-13 classification was instituted. <br /> <br /> I present that One Dark Night is the movie GORIEST PG (no more terrifying, of course) that has ever been released. <br /> <br /> Can someone propose a bigger selection? <br /> <br /> (FYI: I do not think Poltergeist is fatter ... scarier, yes, but not fatter ...)
