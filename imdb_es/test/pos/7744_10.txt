"Tempest" is a discursive film, something indulgent and self-indulgent. But as Lord Byron, another visitor from Greece, protested to his friend John Murray about his "Don Juan", equally self-indulgent and discursive. "It may be disheveled but it's not life, is not it?" <Br /> <br /> The connections to Shakespeare's "Tempest" may seem, as another commentator here says, a bit tenuous. But watch the movie again after rereading "The Tempest" and they will look much closer. What makes this film flawed is its awkward mix of direct normal narrative and sudden apparent improvisation, particularly between Cassavetes and Rowland. But to be honest, these scenes are the most remarkable and exciting of the movie, if it is the hardest to watch. <br /> <br /> The music of this film, composed by Stomu Yamashta, is also overlooked. Particularly fine is the perfect little piece that is played to accompany the afternoon nap, since the people, the animals and apparently the entire island collapse to sleep the hottest part of the afternoon. It's a sublime moment, and it represents the best aspect of this movie and the one thing that keeps it unified, the fact that (apart from the extensive flashbacks and the end) is the story of a day on an island, from the moment of awakening. tonight. <br /> <br /> In general, I'd rather watch this movie hundreds of times than see a piece of bombastic Hollywood bullshit once. And in fact, I've probably seen it several dozens of times. Most of the time, I see something that I missed before. <br /> <br /> (Confession: I am partial This was the second movie I took to see my Greek-American goddess). <br /> <br /> Trivia notes about this film: <br /> <br /> - It was Molly Ringwald's first film, as well as that of Sam Robards; <br /> <br /> - It was not actually filmed on an island, but in Gytheion, the southern tip of the remote Mani peninsula in the Peloponnese of Greece; <br /> <br /> - The primitive effects (primitive today) were made by Bran Ferren, who later became the head of Disney's Imagineering, and still later, he was an advisor to the intelligence community of the U.S. <br /> <br /> - Paul Mazursky, the director, chose the title of his recent autobiography, "Show Me the Magic", from the script of "Tempest".
