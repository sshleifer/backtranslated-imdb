To be totally honest, I did not expect much to enter 9 Souls, even after reading a lot about a lot of praise, but to say that I was surprised would be a great understatement, in short, I was totally impressed. <Br /> <br /> The basic plot is as simple as they come, nine inmates ranging from a drug dealer to the escape of several murderers and go in search of a secret hiding place that allegedly falsifies money hidden by a tenth A prisoner who split and was dragged by the guards shortly before his escape, but it is the direction in which the director Toshiaki Toyoda takes this simple story that is so brilliant and original that it perfectly combines drama, comedy and violence, creating a truly unique film that deserves to be seen not only the fans of Asian cinema, but the cinema in general. <br /> <br /> Superbly acted, emotional, funny, violent and, at times, very surreal, this is a movie that has it all.
