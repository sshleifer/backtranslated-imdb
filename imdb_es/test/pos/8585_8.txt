Being Belgian, I'm interested in the history of the Congo. It has been our only colony for many years (Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate, but not a colony), and it is part of the history of our country. Today it seems to be very popular to say that everything the Belgians did in the Congo was a mistake, especially in the 19th century. I'm not saying that bad things did not happen. Of course I did, but back then this was not abnormal. Do you really think that the French or the British were much nicer in their colonies? No, they were not. At that time, it was "normal" for our King Leopold II to use the Congo as a way to gain personal wealth. It was his private property (he did not belong to the state at that time) and he tried to make the most of it. Of course, horrible things happened, like the hands that were cut and yes, according to the current rules, that is inadmissible, but in those days it was a common practice. And it must be said, all this has not happened in recent decades ... I know several people who have lived and worked in the Congo for many years before the declaration of Congolese independence. It is true that they had several black servants, but they are very nice people and I really can not imagine that they have ever been treated badly. As far as I know, they have always been treated with great respect (However, I am not saying that all Belgians have done so). In fact, if they were not so old now (almost almost 80 years old now) they would love to go back to the Congo. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this film is that it provides a historically accurate view of what happened during the last years of the Belgian government and the first years of Congolese independence. The story is not so white and black (maybe not the best words in this context, but how else to explain what I mean) as I feared it would be. It does not say that everything the Belgians did was wrong and everything the Congolese did was good. It shows perfectly well that the Congolese, in their haste to gain independence from the Belgians, did not mind accepting the help of the Russians and the Americans, who took more account of raw materials such as copper, diamonds, bauxite and rubber. . , ... and get the Congolese in their political "field" and they were not so interested in their independence. Not only does it give a good idea of ​​how Lumumba became more powerful, but also how Mobutu played a double role. It shows the Belgian reaction to some of our compatriots who were raped, threatened and even killed (My father was one of the paratroopers who were sent to the Congo to rescue the Belgians). It gives a good idea of ​​the political problems that Lumumba found, since the province of Katanga did not want to be part of the Congolese Republic, the role that the Belgians had in the murder of Lumumba ... everything is part of this film. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be very accurate and the characters really look and act like the real ones. This film has been able to give a very good idea of ​​what life was like in the Congo in the late fifties and early sixties, and should be seen by everyone interested in the country's history. But it should also be shown in history classes, especially in Belgium, because it is a part of our history that should never be forgotten. I give it a 7.5 / 10, maybe even an 8/10.
