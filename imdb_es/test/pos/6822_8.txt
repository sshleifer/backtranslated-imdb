There have been many people who have tried to make a film that was identical to the story, Heart of Darkness. Some movies have been based on Heart of Darkness, like Apocalypse Now. In 1993, Nicholas Roeg directed a film that was exactly like the book. Heart of darkness the film is almost exactly identical to the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. Heart of Darkness is about the journey of a sailor named Marlow who sails along the Congo River to meet the super powerful ivory merchant, Mr. Kurz. <br /> <br /> Heart of Darkness, the movie, has exactly the same beginning and setting as the book. It takes place in a boat on the River Thames, and Marlow tells the story to four other men in a boat named Nellie. The whole movie is a reminder of Marlow's trip to see Mr. Kurtz on the Congo River. Marlow works for the Belgian company, which markets ivory along the Congo River. He counts his account in the Company's office, and on all the maps he saw in the office. <br /> <br /> Marlow embarks on a steam to Africa. He arrives at the Central Station, where he receives orders from the general manager. The general manager tells Marlow about Mr. Kurtz and the ivory trade that Marlow would be doing. Marlow soon discovers that the general manager does not like Kurtz because he is afraid that Kurtz will replace him. Marlow waits at the Central Station for months because his ship has been destroyed and is being repaired. Marlow sees the harsh treatment and slavery in Africa while in Central Station. When the ship was finally repaired, Marlow, another African character named Mfumu and other crew members set sail in the Marlow steamer for Mr. Kurtz. <br /> <br /> Along the Congo River, they are attacked by African natives in the wild. When the crew of Marlow is attacked by the African natives, they end up shooting and killing Mfumu. When Marlow finally arrives at the Kurtz station, he meets a Russian who explains the power and glory of Kurtz. Marlow is driven to Kurtz station. There, he sees many maps and images that Kurtz has painted. Finally, Kurtz enters the room and begins to tell Marlow everything he has done in Africa and talks about his lover. Marlow soon discovers that Kurtz is insane with power because the Africans consider him a god. Marlow gets angry with the hardness and slavery he sees in Africa. After Marlow finally meets Kurtz, Kurtz begins to die. While Kurtz was on his deathbed, he called Marlow to his room. Kurtz's life begins to appear before his eyes, and his last words were "Horror, horror". When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's boyfriend, Marlow tells him that Kurtz's last words were his name to hide the darkness in Kurtz's life. <br /> <br /> Heart of Darkness went well and became an adventure movie. I recommend to anyone who sees this movie because it is full of action and mystery. The movie is slow at times, but in general, it's really interesting. Heart of Darkness will really expand your mind and teach you a lot about how to interpret different scenes.
