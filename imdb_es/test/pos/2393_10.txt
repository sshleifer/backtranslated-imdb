I was invited to the Sept. 30 performance of Eddie Monroe and I was pleasantly surprised by the story, the great acting and the talented management. I found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. Powerful performances by Vario, (Uncle Benny), Sara, (Jessica Tsunis) and Morris, (Eddie Monroe). The supporting cast was full of colorful and funny characters. This movie reminds me of one of those movies you'll remember in 20 years and you'll discover that it has cast many actors to stardom. Like "The Outsiders", where you can find Tom Cruise, Emilio Estavez, Patrick Swazey, Ralph Macchio and others. Look at Hollywood, there are new stars on the horizon and you can discover them in a small independent film from Long Island called "Eddie Monroe". Great job!
