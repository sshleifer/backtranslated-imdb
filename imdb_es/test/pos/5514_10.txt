Strangeland seems to have a love / hate relationship with many of its viewers. Personally, I loved the movie and everything related to it. <br /> <br /> The performance in some places could be improved, but the filming adds to the atmosphere in which acting can not. In some areas, the dialogue is a bit corny and too dramatic, but really, what do you expect from the late 1990s? In general, Dee did an incredible job writing what I think is one of the most terrifying thrillers I've seen. Play with the fears of many age groups: adults, parents and children. All parents fear that their children get too involved in chat rooms and encounter strangers on the Internet. And * it happens * in the real world. And every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will; That also happens in the real world. What makes this film so sensitive to many. <br /> <br /> My only warning is that if you * know * that you are sensitive to things like strong violence, visible torture and gore, then you do it * I do not * want to see this movie. If you are not sure if this film will entertain you, read all the reviews you can, ask the people you know who have seen this movie and be prepared to turn off the movie at any time in case they bother you.
