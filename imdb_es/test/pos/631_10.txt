One of my favorite movies of all time. Nothing can beat seeing this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia, I would like to be able to enjoy this movie as much as the first time I did it. It is still nice the second and third time, but I found myself appreciating more the humor, since the commotions and the emotions were not unexpected. If you want to see a movie that you really can not predict the end of this movie, I recommend this movie. It is chilling, shocking, full of suspense and there is also a lot of humor to help you overcome it. If you see this movie and do not love it, I really question your sanity!
