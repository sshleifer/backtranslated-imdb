I saw it on DVD with subtitles, which made it a little frustrating to get through, due to the length of the movie. But I was fascinated throughout that. That the characters fascinated me and that I was always absorbed in the story, despite the subtitles, is a testament to the power of the film. It is an incredible job. I have it on my list of ten favorite movies of all time. It is easily the best foreign film I have seen in the last twenty years. I would like to know the full story behind the making of this movie. It must have taken a long time and required the use of hundreds of locations. The use of some unconditional scenes (on television in the motel room) unfortunately can make some people choose not to see them, but if you do not mind, all these stories will move you deeply!
