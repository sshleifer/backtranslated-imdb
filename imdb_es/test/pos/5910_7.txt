Everyone knows that Lindburgh succeeded in the first transatlantic flight. So, how can there be suspense or intrigue in this movie? Well, there is. Do not ask me how, but there is. Partly because of the storytelling expert account, but for the most part to Jimmy Stewart's totally attractive interpretation, we are drawn into the story as if it were unfolding before our eyes for the first time. Despite the fact that half of the film is filmed in a small cabin, it is as dynamic as any action that occurs. So, if you're afraid to see this movie because you think you already know the story, give it a try. I think you will be impressed.
