IN AGREEMENT. Finally, a horror movie that is well made. As soon as I heard the music, I knew that a great effort had been made to create what I consider to be a masterpiece almost of good ol'horror. Zombies, whores, liquor, grave robbers and much more. A great cast, well acted, well directed, well written ... there was hardly a defect. Even American actors with an Irish / English accent really did it. I thought actor Larry Fessenden seemed familiar to me. It was that missing tooth. Finally, I realized that this guy was the star of "Habit", a vampire movie in New York. I thought he was excellent in that role. Now I wonder if he is an American or not. His accent was so convincing in "Vendo," that I thought he had to have grown up on the emerald island, not the United States. Well, apparently he's a New Yorker born and raised. A great actor: he really played his part in this movie. Nothing surpasses a horror film set in Europe in the early nineteenth century (like the old films of Hammer). I encourage anyone who wants to have a good time to see this film well done.
