Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines, Iowa. Nine members of the band wear custom boiler suits and custom homemade masks (eg, The Clown Mask # 6, several # 0 gas masks, the dummy mask torn + torn # 8 with dreadlocks). Music itself seems to cross the boundaries between healthy and others, but it is interpreted in a brilliant and psychotic way. <br /> <br /> "Welcome To Our Neighborhood" sounds more like a generic title, but the images themselves are something else. Interviews with the band, sound fragments from their last album, with their own title, 2 live performances and a forbidden music video by MTV (a brilliant tribute to the classic Kubrick film "The Shining"), the film does not even reach half. One hour, but definitely worth it. It's perfect for introducing any metal / hardcore fan to Slipknot.
