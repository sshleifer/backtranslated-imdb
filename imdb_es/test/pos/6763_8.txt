It's a wonderful movie about people. Weird people. All the characters in the film have a very tragic past, so everyone has their problems. Their problems evolve in a way that makes the plot of the film very absurd; but that does not make the movie worse, only better, since it is filmed in a way similar to fantasy, so nothing is real. This review may sound a little weird, but, again, the movie is not very normal ... It's also a hilarious movie on many occasions. If you have not seen it, veil it. Enjoy!
