Tiny Toons is the first caricature that I remember seeing as a child and I loved every minute of it. When I was four or five years old, my parents bought the video How I Spent My Vacation. I saw it again and again until I got to every word. Well, a few days ago my three-year-old cousin came and I had to entertain him. I decided to show him this old relic of my childhood. <br /> <br /> I knew he would laugh, but I was surprised at how much I laughed. As in every movie and episode of Tiny Toons, the humor is based more on madness and slapstick humor and has tremendous success. The bugs, Babs, Plucky Duck, Maton Pig and Fifi support incredible adventures of Bugs and Babs in rafting with a little help from Superman. continues a strange search to find cute kittens in a safari land. <br /> <br /> Part of the classic humor is in this Tiny Toon adventure and it's one of the best crazy comedies I've seen in my life. My favorite gag had to be the monorail thing when Hamton and Plucky arrive, ride the monorail and leave (much to Plucky's dismay). No matter how old you are, you will laugh to tears without having to deal with language or nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiny Toons Adventures: How I spent my vacations. Starring the voices of: Charles Adler, Tress MacNeille, Joe Alaskey and Don Messick. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 stars.
