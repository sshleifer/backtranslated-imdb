I saw this series on PBS in the eighties and I still watch old tapes every two or more years. Very atmospheric and chilling at times. This is a very good show since all the characters are well defined and acted. You are attracted to the plot and you come to take care of these people. The villains are almost ridiculously evil, especially the Sheriff of Nottingham. Man, I would love to beat the s - t of that little brat bastard. Nicholas Grace does an excellent job and he must have had a great time being the Sheriff. His whip boy, Sir Guy, is equally whispering but also pathetic. Many murders and chaos in this series, along with tons of black magic and Devil worship and things of that nature. I realized that it has a prize for children's television that is surprising. If I had children, I would not let them see this. Excellent use of places in this show too. Now it's on DVD, so go out and buy it.
