The reviews for the SURRENDER generally have not been favorable, so I waited until he moved to the local discount theater to see it. The film tells the story of Anwar El-Ibrahimi, an American-Egyptian scientist who is plucked from his international flight and interrogated after a strange coincidence that links him to a recent terrorist attack in an unidentified country in North Africa. It is not as bad as I had feared, it is an interesting and stimulating entry in the thriller genre "torn from the headlines". <br /> <br /> The film ultimately raises difficult questions regarding American methods of indiscretion. information of political prisoners: Is the crossing of the line without crossing (openly) the torture of suspected terrorists, something that our country should be doing? Do you produce useful information that helps save lives? If so, at what cost? What kind of monsters do we create when innocent people are taken prisoner and tortured? By sanctioning the use of torture, what kind of monster do we become as a country? It is always disappointing when a film with such provocative material is neglected with some of the details that make good movies great. For example, I would like to have empathy with Anwar's wife, who spends the entire movie trying to locate him, but the only identifiable personality trait she has received is an advanced stage of pregnancy. The SURRENDER also seems to imply that Arab women who disagree with their parents' arranged marriages are only asking for problems, and there is a poorly designed scrapbook by another of the film's main characters that explains all the details very well . The information that your love interest simply needs is urgent at that particular moment. I laughed out loud when the moment should have been filled with fear. <br /> <br /> The film features a good central performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and strong (but too brief) appearances by Hollywood veterans Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin. as well as the impressive turns of Omar Atwally as Anwar El-Ibrahimi and also the actors Moa Khouas, Zineb Oukach and Yigal Naor, whom I would love to see in future films that have nothing to do with terrorism. Good luck to them. The five or more stories that follow are intertwined very well, until the filmmakers insert a slight but effective turn that finally alludes to the endless cycle of killings that provoke violent terror attacks.
