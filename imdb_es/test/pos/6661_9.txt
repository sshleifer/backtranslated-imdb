In Cold Mountain, in northern Colorado, near the period of the American Civil War, Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), for health reasons. Ada meets the shy Inman (Jude Law), and they fall in love with each other. With the beginning of the war, Inman becomes a soldier, and his great support to stay alive is the desire to see Ada in Cold Mountain again. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Ren√©e Zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her on the farm and becomes her best friend. History alternates present and past situations, revealing a beautiful romance. I really liked this movie. With names like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the cast, a magnificent address by Anthony Minghella and seven indications to the Oscar, this film does not disappoint. My observation is that there are some very important scenes eliminated in the story and presented on the DVD. At least one of them, which shows what happens with Sara, her baby and the three corpses of her farm, should not be eliminated as it was. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Cold Mountain'
