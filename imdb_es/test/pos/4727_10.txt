Chris Noth plays a maniac who wrote a children's book when he was a young man, pretending to be a doctor who threatens a community to push his sister's son into the position of genius at his school. The only man who can stop him is a policeman who plays by his own rules, and is forced to go undercover with the help of his silent father who communicates through the oujii board. Will Rick Springfield find out what's new? Or someone will sabotage your recording studio! Does the child with mental retardation who operates the mobile book have clues? Look to discover it! I'm not inventing this!
