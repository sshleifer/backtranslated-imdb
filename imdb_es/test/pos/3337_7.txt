Excellent entry into the RKO Saint series with well written original script, good camera work and transitions, good direction to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant and good performance. George Sanders is gentle and witty. Jonathan Hale is simply Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he can not stand the pressure. It will return in a later entry of the series. The story begins on a transatlantic that goes to the USA. UU Where the Santa is, but can not connect with Wendie Barrie. She finally succumbs to the charms of the Saint, but in the end breaks her heart. The saint helps Inspector Fernack to clear his name from a frame. A few bodies fall down the road. Good entertainment and above average for these types of movies. Look at it.
