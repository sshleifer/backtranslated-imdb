This was a great movie. He had a "very good" outburst. In addition, there were some very intense (intense) scenes that could make them inappropriate for younger viewers, under 6 years old. <br /> <br /> For a movie under the radar, the performance was quite pleasant, and it landed in our family room. For an almost perfect landing. It captured the attention of our entire family and we regret that it was over. <br /> <br /> This movie had elements of spies with young people who saved the day, but it was given a somewhat more believable scenario. The dream scenes were a distraction at first, but they did a lot to establish the plot. The jokes and hi-jinx were also quite funny. <br /> <br /> We hope you like it as much as we do.
