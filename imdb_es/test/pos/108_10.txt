The movie is really about the options. In the oppressed state of affairs as seen in Fire, where good women had to be obedient and do the right thing in the eyes of tradition, there seemed to be few options for Radha and Sita. However, he acknowledged that it was not his only option. What is life without desire? Radha asks Ashok. Yes, it is true that life gives us a series of options, but the amount we can take depends on a series of external factors. When her world is confined to a small Indian family, to be an obedient daughter-in-law to a silent but observant matriarch still powerful, an obedient wife of 13 years to a man who has made a vow of celibacy because he can not. have a child, a man who just wants you to be lying next to him to demonstrate his strength in the elimination of his desires. I felt that the ladies had no choice but to find comfort in each other's company. I guess the fact that so many women applauded Ms. Mehta's work was because it gave them the option to think for themselves. An option to do what was perhaps unacceptable. The lesbian scenes that I felt were simply to convey that point. All the scenes of the film, from the first in the Taj Mahal to the last in the Mosque, are engraved in my mind. How frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. To feel that you had to give up the human touch to be an obedient wife just because it is expected of you. Have to suppress any desire you may have and long for the human touch. What, then, is the meaning of our existence? In the scene where Sita is crying alone in the room and Radha comes in to comfort her, their lips accidentally rub against each other and awaken a sensation in them. Something that both have been deprived of. <br /> <br /> I congratulate Mrs. Mehta on translating her vision so clearly. I especially like the flashbacks of the young Radha who tries to "see" the ocean. It is a metaphor for freedom. Freedom to choose, freedom to transport us to places we normally could not reach. In those scenes, they kindly tell us that their sense of duty has also been conveyed by their mother, who I assume lives within the rich Indian traditions of duty in marriage. The film is beautifully filmed and enhanced by A.R.'s musical score. Rahman Since the movie, I have become passionate fans of the two main actresses and the director. I look forward to more of Ms. Deepa's future productions.
