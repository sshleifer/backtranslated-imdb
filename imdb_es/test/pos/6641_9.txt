The apolitical musicians Eva (Liv Ullmann) and Jan Rosenberg (Max von Sydow) have been married for seven years and live in a small farm on a remote island to escape a civil war on the continent. They provide lingenberry to a couple of customers to raise some money and buy some supplies. They love each other and Eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby, but the reluctant Jan, who is a weak and sensitive man, does not want to have children. When the rebels arrive on the island, their peaceful and quiet lives turn to hell, and they find themselves in the middle of accusations from both sides. When Colonel Jacobi (Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand) stalks Eva, Jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man, and the love and affection they feel for each other turn into hatred and indifference. <br /> <br /> "Shame" is a fight against war. Film of the teacher Ingmar Bergman focused in the eyes of a couple of artists who are apolitical and do not listen to the news, but when the war comes to their lands, their senseless soldiers destroy their love, their friendship and their affection. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow have the best performances as usual and I do not remember seeing Liv Ullmann's chest in any other movie. The process of brutalization of the peaceful and sensitive Jan Rosenberg by the war is impressive and the open desolation is pessimistic and appropriate to the dramatic story. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vergonha" ("Shame")
