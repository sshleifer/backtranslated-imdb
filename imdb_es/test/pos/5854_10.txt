This is an excellent thriller, murder mystery. The plot was not only full of suspense and intrigue, but you can also see the great Ryan Gosling for a couple of hours, which is not to love! Also, Sandra Bullock is good at this movie. I've always been a fan of it, (I wish I had not decided to be in "The Lake House", which was horrible, but that's another story). Obviously, since there are thousands of other murder / horror movies out there, there are likely to be similarities between them, there is no need to hit this movie because it has some similarities to at least some that have already been made. Anyway, this is a great movie for those of you who really enjoy the "scary" movies, it's a bit dark and twisted, but overall it's a great movie.
