I loved the shots of the airports: Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., only buildings with the name in capital letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast forward 75 years ... <br /> <br /> But what really struck me was the emblem of the hammer and sickle and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent to the logo, behind the driver's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance of Neil and Jill says that Jim would become a general in a Chinese rebel army? That, based on the hammer and the sickle, could only have been the People's Revolutionary Army of Mao Tse Dung! It does not matter the intimate clothes and the unmarried couples in bed: would that logo and reference have survived during the Cold War? <br /> <br /> Additional observation 27/12: this 1930s film with the Soviet emblem must also / should reflect the influence and charm of communism in Hollywood and much of the United States during the Depression. Add to the historical value of this excellent movie. <br /> <br /> I also liked the aspects of the American Dream of two Winnemucca boys who took at least part of the world by assault, Red-Blooded (literally and copiously in Jim's case) American Boys. <br /> <br /> Others have commented more ably than I do on aerial acrobatics, etc. I love all. <br /> <br /> This gem deserved more than the simple 1.5 stars that Osborne and company rated it in TCM, if only to record Parts of American history of the early 30s.
