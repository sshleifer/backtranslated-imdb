OK, first, to all who hate: Get a life! I do not see why you bother to post on these boards, when obviously you do not know anything about movies, robots or people. <br /> <br /> This film has important lessons for all of us to learn about gender, stereotypes, relationships and DESTINY. Actually, we are all robots, programmed to respond in certain ways to certain stimuli without thinking. How many times have we seen a sunset and made some trite comments without even thinking about it? I say, THANK YOU, Aqua (interpreted brilliantly by Bernadette Peters) for making me stop and think about the amazing power of mother nature. <br /> <br /> It is only when Val and Aqua begin to reject their programming that they begin to understand their true desire: to find love and to flee the factory in search of a creative life. This film should be obligatory in prisons: just think about the dreams and hopes that you can inspire inmates. maybe even they could overcome their "bad" programming and join the rest of us in a crime-free world. <br /> <br /> We can all learn a lot from these robots. I am a better person for Heartbeeps.
