"Blind Spot" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of ​​three strangers looking for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the guy from Los Angeles with a broken heart. Your journal entries, which we hear in voice over narration, work well with the images and are quite intense. The movie has a powerful style. Push elements such as the road movie and the drama of revenge in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in a way that captures the frightening environment of lost love. There is a dream quality in several sequences and the images are saturated with a strange sensation of tension. Strange. Beautiful suspense in sight. Definitely worth seeing. I would really like to see him again. I periodically check if the Blind Spot has been distributed. I can not wait to see the movie again at the movies or on DVD. <br /> <br /> Davide Pepe 08/13/2005 Bologna - Italy
