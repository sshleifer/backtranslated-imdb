Good acting is best rewarded if combined with a melodramatic script that really elevates the human spirit. To all those minions who work every day, cheer up! Your patience is virtuous. Your tolerance and decency will be evident, in a way you will never anticipate. This is your great story. I do not think you can see to the end without a bit of moisture in that hardened eye. Or you can? For me, it would not be like that ... history is relentless! The idealist denied what belonged to him. Will someone speak? Ah! But you will need to see the show yourselves! Observe the school teacher at his best, without the notice and reputation that the observer would certainly expect. And why is it still like this? Yes! You must see O'Toole's performance for yourselves! I can only wish that it was still "printed" to buy, and then present it to my friends as my evidence of respect for their faithful lives.
