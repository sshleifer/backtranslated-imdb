Probably because this is Columbia's first color film, the colors look different, especially in interior scenes. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very nice. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy, but the real star of the film is a very young Glenn Ford, an outlaw who wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman who begins to fall in love with Ford and Claire Trevor is the countess who runs the salon. There is a funny character called Nitro who does not think twice before blowing it. I particularly enjoyed two moments of the film, one in which there is a tremendous stampede of horses and you see thousands of horses, there was no computer to help at that time, so I suppose you must have gathered all those horses, it is not an easy task. Another moment is the final shooting, technically very good. There is also quite a fist fight. Seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes, makes you reach a sad conclusion: they do not do them anymore. Would they be capable in case they wanted to? I have my doubts.
