'The Cell' is a trip to the mind of a serial killer and I mean it literally. The film is about the trip, about the world that shows during this trip, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion, this journey through the mind provides images so beautiful that other things really do not matter as long as they do not distract. In fact, the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic child. How this works does not exactly matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientists, including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe that this method could work. Catherine enters the child's mind and talks to him there, in a world completely created by the child. He hopes to let him do things that will eventually work. <br /> <br /> The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) has just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are in this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and at that moment, after a forensic investigation into the abandoned body, Carl can be tracked and captured. Two problems occur. 1. Carl has just gone into a coma; He has been ill for a long time. 2. Your house and the house with your last abducted victim are not in the same place. In a way, this part of the story is pretty standard. <br /> <br /> Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine has to go to Carl's mind. This is dangerous for many reasons. In short: Carl is an unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine begins to believe that Carl's mind is the real world, then his mind can convince his body; She could die in Carl's mind. A tape of how the last victim was killed, a fate that this girl will have in about twenty hours, makes sure that Catherine will try to take the location out of Carl's mind. <br /> <br /> It's the journey through this sick Mind that makes this movie worth seeing. The director Tarsem Singh, who made music videos before this, in a way goes back to these music videos. Each room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists from beautiful and sometimes disturbing images. For me, the visual style felt completely new, the way in which 'Three Kings' had a new visual style a year before. If something like that can make you like a movie, 'The Cell' will not disappoint you. But fans of the thriller and the horror genre may like this movie anyway. The story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for that. I think you have to be a bit open, of course, events are not (yet) possible in our real world. Still, a very entertaining movie with beautiful ideas that looks great.
