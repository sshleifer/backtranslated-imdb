"The Seven-Ups" looks like a repeat of "The French Connection," which was released two years earlier. Both the late Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco make appearances, as well as doubles pilot Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> But we are not dealing with French drug addicts; instead, we are facing a war against a variety of hoods and criminals after a policeman is brutally murdered by a bully. We can see unpleasant things and a New York City before the 1990s. <br /> <br /> I love watching this movie because it's exciting to watch the action, and it's a reminder of a cooler moment. That said, when one compares car chases, Mr. Hickman had participation in the three most compared: this movie, Bullitt and The French Connection. Each chase scene has its own qualities, and this is simply excellent. <br /> <br /> And I'm glad that this title has seen the light of day on DVD.
