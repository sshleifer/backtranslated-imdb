It's not a blockbuster; Actually, nobody knows why. It may have failed simply by its title. It seems you need a title of two rough men to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiotic crowd: "Die Hard", "Lethal Weapon", "Hard Weapon", "Die Lethal", etc. - Talking about "The long kiss of good night" will not get you anywhere. But for once Renny Harlin has made a GOOD action movie. A big part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, Samantha, wins our affection and interest from the beginning. When he becomes Charly again, we are torn: we certainly want Charly to frustrate the bad guys, and all that; but we do not want her to lose contact with Samantha to do it, although we also like Charly. Geena Davis gives all her considerable charm to both halves of the central character. Samuel L. Jackson plays the second violin for a change. It turns out that he is good at that. That was a compliment. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, far superior to anything in the "Die Hard" series. If I were more cynical, I would add, "it's not surprising that it has not worked," but I do not really feel that way; It's surprising that it has not gone well.
