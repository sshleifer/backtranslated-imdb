Well, I have read most of the criticisms of this film, as well as the comments left by visitors to this site, and I have the feeling that most people who wrote reviews did not like this movie. That's why I write now, I represent the minority because I did it. I admit that I went to see the film because I am very impressed with the convincing skills of Ryan Gosling, and the projects he has participated in lately have been nothing less than incredible. He is an incredible actor. Apart from that, I wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing ... why? Because it's a whodunit where you know "whodunit" from the beginning, and that's something unusual. <br /> <br /> In the plot, two teenagers try to commit the "perfect crime" because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only by committing acts of crime are human beings truly free, uninhibited, and remember, without blame, acting by own will. The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex, hinted at homosexuality, and was acted brilliantly by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Gosling was the manipulator, the one who controlled those who spoke softly, and Pitt was the socially awkward outcast, extremely intelligent with books. Enter the character of Sandra Bullock, which seems that most people did not particularly appreciate. I think that when people see that she was the executive producer, they automatically assume that whatever role the actor has in him is a matter of self-glorification. I did not see that as the case here. Without the personal history of "Cassie" about the ex-husband who almost killed her, who, logically, shared similar traits with Richard Hayward, she would never have followed her instincts about Justin and Richard. The case was seemingly hermetic against Ray, the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys. Even when the boys are questioned near the end of the film, neither Bullock nor his partner have solid evidence about them, other than the fact that they lied about meeting each other, and the vomit that Justin left in sight. There lies the genius of the film because the philosophy that the boys tried to demonstrate through the act of killing, the act of acting unintentionally as "true freedom" ended up working against Justin, who ended up having consciousness after all (and ended up leaving part of his conscience at the site of unloading corpses). Without that crucial piece of evidence, they almost had a "murder by numbers". And to the readers who have surprised me the title as much as I did, I looked for it and discovered that something made "by numbers" (like a painting) suggests careful and critical planning and rigor. There is also a song by Sting called "Murder By Numbers", but that is irrelevant. :) <br /> <br /> Many readers questioned the need for the relationship between Cassie and her partner, but I think it really meant showing how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her story. Whether we like it or not, your story plays an important role in this movie because without it, you probably would never have followed your instincts about Justin and Richard. Yes, it was a bit of the cliche of women scorned, the woman who acts as a vendetta in every facet of the plot of his life, but I think without the depth of the character of Cassie, you only have another movie about teenage killers, and it is possible that they have gotten away with that There is no movie there. <br /> <br /> And the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously did not commit the perfect crime because the police attacked them from the beginning, I can remind you that the reason was because of the shoe prints put intentionally, and totally traceable. The boys wanted to get involved, it was a game. They were so sure of having committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first-hand the difficulty that investigators would have in discovering what they believe is the truth. What they did not expect was that Cassie Mayweather had an overly active case of instinct working on her side. A little incredible? Perhaps. But many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts. However, this is a MOVIE! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in theaters about three times, and each time it revealed me a little more, and I liked it a little more. The more I looked at it, the more I was captivated and scared by the psychological depth of Richard Hayward: there are people really like that. My main complaint about the film would be that they should have had the interactions of Justin and Richard a little more central (because, let's face it, there is great intrigue throughout the film) and my main supports are characterized: each character was very different. and interesting in its own way. He was very well acted, although he would have given the character of Ben Chaplin a little more depth to work (he is a good actor) and maybe he has reduced Bullock's character to a little. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should keep up. Keep in mind that for a Hitchcock thriller like this that basically says the "whodunit" at the beginning, it represents a great challenge for writers to keep the audience's attention until the end. I think they did quite well by using some small twists of the plot, the slow revelation of the different dynamics of the characters and illuminate the screen with some very emotional performances of young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. I think that if we eliminate our innate cynicism and try to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are, we can look beyond any apparent hole in the plot and see the real texture and quality of this film, even if only in the characters which were brilliantly portrayed. Especially Richard Hayward. It's not that I'm biased. :)
