Robert Montgomery and Robert Young stand out as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in Italy during the First World War. The dialogue is very entertaining, and Jimmy Durante is hilarious as the ship's cook, "Ptomaine". The character of Walter Huston is inspiring as the captain of the submarine, a stellar example of an officer and a knight. One of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology shown in the battle scenes. I was surprised at how similar the technology of the First World War was to the technology shown 25 years later in World War II. The basic human nature was described as very similar to that of modern times, and far from the conservativism that he believed existed in the so-called "innocent" past. In general, I felt that the cast, the characters, the action scenes and the story shown in this movie were first class.
