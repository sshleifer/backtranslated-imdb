Pierre Jolivet plays a character of Don Quixote, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. Trust your homemade weaponry (helmet, sleeves and spear) made with wheel covers, seat cushions and discarded office furniture. Just when Don Quixote was riding in Rocicante, "Man" rides his contraption (literally) transcending lost lives, trapped the harsh and degrading modern world, flying over the earth, away from the difficult situation of modern man. Both characters travel in search of adventure in an effort to correct the evils of the world. Both characters are guardians of values ​​unknown to most other characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Unlike the story of Cervantes, in this film we identify more directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character. We can only compare this strange and forbidden landscape with the exuberant and beautiful world in which we live. Our frame of reference is the fantasy realm that the solitary knight may remember. Our vision would be one that expects the main character to triumph, defeat, change his world (for the better) back to a world of abundance that no longer exists. <br /> <br /> We watch this movie and see a true gentleman in a world of humans as animals. Don Quixote considered himself a true knight among the animals. <br /> <br /> With the story of Cervantes we can only see the dreamer, without really understanding the scope of his anachronistic displacement. In the story of Besson and Jolivet, we see the new world from the eyes of Don Quixote, because we value the same visions and ideals as the main character of the crusade.
