I would give this movie an 8.5 or a 9. I thought it was just very funny, I do not know how I could not think this movie was funny, but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was a bit of too much information. Because I personally think that when they fly off bicycles and things like that it's a lot more fun, but I'm sure there are people who think that other things are fun, so it's not my opinion, but anyway the big movie go and then you should definitely go buy it too if you do not like this movie that's fine because I'm sure there are a lot of people who think this movie shows how degraded our society or whatever, it's just my personal opinion and you have yours. Also the Jackass Box set is definitely something worth downloading or buying or whatever you do to get your videos.
