Like a very expensive episode of Buffy peppered with a lot of humor. Lots of wire and kung fu trick. The effect of the twins goes on the list of classics that HK movies should see. Vampires have a great mix of jumping ghosts and the European style of a pretty boy. If you have the opportunity to see this in the theater, it is worth a 30 minute drive; otherwise, buy the import DVD before someone ruins it by giving it a bad copy.
