For most of us, life is a process of unfolding love. For others like Soo-mi, however, it is dominated by darkness and fear. Based on the Korean folktale Jangha and Hongryun, Kim Ji-woon's brilliant tale of gothic horror, A Tale of Two Sisters revolves around two sisters, Soo-mi (Lim Su-jeong) and Soo-yeon (Mun Geon -yeong), who are part of a dysfunctional family that lives together in a spooky Victorian mansion. Feeling alienated from the world, they cling to each other to survive, while the older Soo-mi obsessively protects the younger Soo-yeon from danger. For Soo-mi, however, not accepting the circumstances surrounding the death of her mother means a mental illness and a mind at odds with reality. <br /> <br /> While we can recognize basic elements such as haunted houses with apparent sightings, doors that open and close themselves, a cruel and dominant stepmother, and other events of great strangeness, A tale of two sisters explores in a magnificent way, deeper psychological meanings, such as the inability to let go of the internal demons and the inopportune desire for revenge. Soo-mi says, "You know what is really scary, you want to forget something, totally erase it from your mind, but you can never, you can not disappear, you see, and ... and it follows you like a ghost." There is a timeline but the viewer is left unraveling. The plot can not be summarized, it is only suggested and the film makes us wonder if what is happening on the screen is objective or subjective. <br /> <br /> At the opening of the film, Soo-mi, an obviously disturbed young woman, is being challenged by a doctor in an environment that looks like a mental institution. When the doctor asks him to describe what happened "that day", the film reappears when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return to the home of their father Moo-hyeon (Kim Kap-su) and stepmother Eun-joo (Yum Jung-ah) The stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant, but it is obvious that it is Soo-mi who is really suffering. As the girls try to readjust, they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house, which can be a nightmare or a supernatural occurrence. <br /> <br /> Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hangs over her. and black blood oozes out, a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hidden under the sink and suffers convulsions, a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters, people mysteriously disappear from the photographs and many others schizophrenic devices maniacs to keep the viewer hanging on the verge of madness. While we feel that much of the story is the projection of someone's mind, we do not know who and the film are constantly challenging us, at least until an important clue is offered in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> Filmed in beautiful, dimly lit cinematography, A Tale of Two Sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all threats, and there are many. It is disturbing in more than one sense of the word and its images can stare at you when you least expect it or want it. While the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the way of light, it shows us where we can end if we opt for darkness. In the words of a wise observer, "Blaming is never the answer, whether it is blaming yourself or others, rather, the answer lies in leaving the judgment completely, both of you and of others." Forgiveness and understanding have a great healing power. "
