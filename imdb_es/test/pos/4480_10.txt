Honore De Balzac's short story, genuinely strange, on which he relied freely, receives a disturbing, albeit astonishingly filmed, treatment as a kind of forbidden love that blooms over a period of time between man and beast at the beginning of the century. XIX The English actor, thin and very blond, Ben Daniels plays a young soldier during the Napoleonic wars that is lost while escorting an exiled French painter (?) Through the rugged and dangerous landscapes of the Gobi Desert. After circling literally in circles, the two men give up on each other more and more to try to reach civilization, so each one decides (against a better judgment) to go their separate ways with the promise that both will return to the exact same place when a water source is actually found This is, of course, how the character of Daniels encounters the creature (a wild and untamed female leopard) and eventually forms a seemingly unbreakable bond, or rather love, with he who saves his life and almost destroys it at the end of the movie. The exquisite cinematography, the minimalist dialogue, a somewhat demented story that could suggest a possible bestiality in approximately three scenes, is what finally leads professional critics to criticize the film as pretentious and too extensive trash. While it is a film that is not exactly for all tastes, I think it is a subtle, although decidedly center-left, mix with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere, which is highlighted by the fact that for more than half of the film , the actor Ben Daniels is forced to act in front of a wild animal (actually four leopards were used as opposed to one), whose simple common sense and a slight knowledge of theatricality dictate that it must have been a maddening and very difficult job That he managed to get pretty bright if you ask me! In general, I think "Passion in the Desert" takes a little time to warm up, but if you are a patient person who is willing to spend some time, in fact, it is an original spell on you in spite of everything. ; and, unlike most stories of human relationships and platonic animals, it is not necessary that there be a pig, a monkey, or a hairy dog ​​that speaks to maintain its interest at all times.
