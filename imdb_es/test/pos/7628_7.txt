Stupidly beautiful This film summarizes the genre "so bad that it's good" from the movies. <br /> <br /> The only two talents are Richard Boone and Joan van Ark, and only Boone is good. It's a bit sad that the man who rose to fame as Paladin should end up in this ugly pile of celluloid. While delivering a fantastic performance, I could not help but feel that he outdid all his fellow actors in this piece that should not even have been there. <br /> <br /> The effects in this movie are laughable, but fun. The idea of ​​a dinosaur buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly come alive is a B movie of gold. When the 'triceratops' dies, look how it falls. It is clear that the specialist in doubles in the FRONT of the suit knows what is the best moment. It falls to the ground, long before the back half of the dinosaur does the same. <br /> <br /> Speaking of 'costumes', there's nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaurus, in this movie. It seems to have some kind of stealth technology, since Bunta (who is said to be the best tracker in the world) does not notice twice until it is within his reach. I do not know how all the impressions are, but in the version I have, the roar of Tyranno contains the following Godzilla seal. <br /> <br /> This is very fun to watch, if you like bad movies. I love them, and especially the bad monster movies, so I think this is the jewel in my collection. If bad movies are your thing, definitely get this one.
