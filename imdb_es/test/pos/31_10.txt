I just watched The Dresser tonight, I'd only seen it once before, a dozen years ago. <br /> <br /> It's not a "big" movie, and it does not try to make a big fuss, but my God, the brilliance of the two tracks leaves me speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are just amazing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The Dresser is the story of Sir, a Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dressing room Norman (Courtenay), a kind of valet, performing a King Lear production during the bombing of London In the Second World War. These are two men, each dependent on the other: Sir is almost helpless without Norman's help to coax him, trick him and harass him into going on stage for his performance as Lear. And Norman lives his life indirectly through Sir; without Sir needing it, it is nothing, or thinks it is, anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a movie based on the characters; The plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, requires actors of the highest caliber to give life. Finney, only 47, is completely credible as a very old theater actor, very sick, petulant, stalker, but brilliant. He hisses and humiliates his fellow actors even when they are bowing! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the feeder, who sometimes must act more as a mother than as a valet for his elderly employer. However, employer is really the wrong term to use. Although, technically, their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time Sir and Norman act as nothing more than as a married couple of age. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are others in the cast of this movie. , but there is no doubt that the real stars are Finney, Courtenay and the wonderful script by Ronald Harwood. That does not mean there are not other good performances, especially Eileen Atkins as the long-time theater manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene in which Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets and what could have been. <br /> <br /> Although these days are not talked about, it's worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Adapted Screenplay. <br /> <br /> I remembered it was a good movie, but I was not prepared to be as fascinated as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what the great performance is and be entertained all the time, I encourage you to watch The Dresser.
