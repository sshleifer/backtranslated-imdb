It was a great movie! I like to see it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I would like Lifetime to put this movie on DVD. I would definitely like to buy a copy. This movie only shows that you must be very careful with who you connect to. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter saw the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is that I will watch this movie every time Lifetime broadcasts it. It's the kind of movie that keeps you glued to the TV. I would like Lifetime to remake the film, but use the same actors and take it to the big screen.
