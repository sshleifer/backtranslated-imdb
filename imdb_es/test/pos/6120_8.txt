Out of any category, this is an insane and exaggerated movie, even by current standards. Shot entirely on crap-o-rama, this film will leave you breathless (and also something else!) <br /> <br /> The amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is amazing. The dialogue is incredibly fast and campy. You will love it or you will hate this movie, but give it to him. I've seen it 4 times and I love it. Divine is in the quest to be the dirtiest person in the world, but so are her rivals in this obscene and disgusting (but fun) and elegant little movie. <br /> <br /> The divine was phenomenal, and "she" will always be missed. Edith Massey makes the unforgettable performance as the "egg widow" and do not forget the energetic Mink Stole! <br /> <br /> Ãœber crazy s ** t! <br /> <br /> Recommended also for you sick puppies; <br /> <br /> Feminine problems <br /> <br /> Hopeless life <br /> <br /> Polyester
