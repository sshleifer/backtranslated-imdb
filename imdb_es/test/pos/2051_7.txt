Let me start by saying in general that I enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight. I would give it a 7/10. The good: 1. Act: Samuel L Jackson is entertained in almost any role. In this film, he does not play his usual character, the guy in control, instead, Geena Davis is in control and Sam is on the way. His times in his lines are excellent and he is the highest point of the film. Geena Davis also gives a great performance as Samantha Caine / Charlie Baltimore. She is a credible action heroine and I do not think many other actresses can achieve the performance that Geena Does. 2. The action: this is a very action-packed film. Things almost always crash or explode or someone is chasing someone else. The special effects are pretty good, especially for being almost 8 years old. I can see some things on the green screen, but this does not detract too much from the performance. <br /> <br /> The bad: 1. Why did you take half of the movie to set up the plot? This film needed to be edited in the script stage so it would not be executed as much as it did. Maybe a drama or something can last so long, but people really need to get into the movie all the time to maintain it. I think that if you can excel in the first half, you will be pleasantly surprised in the second half. 2. Geena Davis is a cold weather and a tank top, but she never seems to be cold. 3. Some things are unrealistic. Sam Jackson flies through a giant sign after being ejected from a room and then lands on a tree and gets up. When you see this part, you'll think it's a joke. general funny movie 7/10
