What a great movie this was. It's heaven, hell? or something in the middle? I do not agree with many critics of this movie who say that this is a representation of hell. It is not even clear if the opening scene starts the movie or is a flashback of the ending. Also, it is not clear that the main character is going to hell, but maybe somewhere in between. The review I read in IMDb says that this is hell, but I do not agree with all my heart. Keep in mind that maybe good people who commit suicide can not be condemned to hell ... this is just a religious belief. In fact, this is a thinker, and I will recommend it to anyone who likes that kind of movie. Definitely worth it!
