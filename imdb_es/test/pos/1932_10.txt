This is an account of the events that have been covered in print several times, and I had read two books: 'A trip for crazy' and 'The last weird trip of Donald Crowhurst' before watching the film in Sheffield just before Christmas . I must say that exceeded all expectations in his account of the 1968 Globe Golden Globe Sunday Globe. These men set out to do something that had never been done before without support boats, wooden boats, without satellite phones, without GPS , and only his wit and ability to circulate them around the world in one piece. Not to mention the months of solitude, the thunderous southern ocean, the little sleep and the boats that often literally collapsed around him. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very well organized in my opinion, very well edited, with good rhythm With magnificent narration. Archive images and interviews are fascinating and bring history to life. The images of Clare Crowhurst's interview are especially revealing and moving, as she recounts the events that led to her husband, the departure of Donald Crowhurst from Teignmouth, the doubts and fears in her mind and her reaction as the events unfold. later. <br /> <br /> I was moved and even shed a tear or two when the credits started rolling and I heard other people expressing similar feelings. <br /> <br /> The two books I mentioned earlier are useful for more details and a background story. which could not have been included in the 90 minutes and I would recommend them too. <br /> <br /> This is, ultimately, a true story of human courage and human frailty. A must for anyone interested in sailing, adventure, human endeavor and real life heroes.
