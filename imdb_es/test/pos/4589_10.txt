Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. Fox, who paid Judge to do it, kept it in the can for quite some time and then did not spend anything to promote it. I guess that made a lot of people think it was one of the junk movies that were emptying in late summer. Well, I am here to tell you that this is a fun and quite terrifying look of a future that is not so hard to believe. Basically, the judge raises the idea that the stupid are outnumbering the smart ones by a wide margin. Then these fools are getting stupider, basically spending all their time watching television and having sex, which produces more stupid people. By the year 2500, a person with average intelligence today, will appear to be a genius, who speaks "all dizzy." Seriously, this is really so hard to believe. Oh, sure, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as the army boy who travels through time, desperately trying to return to a more comfortable time. Where this story will earn its cult status is with the numerous and funny comments of a line, such as "can we make the family stylize it?" And "hey man, I'm about to give up here!" This is a funny movie and a very sharp social commentary in a US society that seems to be fatigued with pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee that I will buy this on a DVD the first day it comes out and see it. and more.
