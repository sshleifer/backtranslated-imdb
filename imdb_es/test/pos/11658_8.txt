I read the book before watching the movie, and the movie is one of the best adaptations there is. Very faithful and faithful to the book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are incredible. Robbins is a talented filmmaker and I would like him to add more to his repertoire. He made the film very disturbing and intentionally slow to add depth. An especially bright part of the filming was the reflection of the victims that appeared on the glass in the execution room at the end.
