This Metro movie is episodic, but almost a constant series of persecutions, mainly trying to escape from the police, whether real or imagined, since Buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal. He is always inventive and entertaining. Its greatest value is in documenting how Hollywood looked in the early 1920s, with 95% filmed outside the streets and exteriors of the buildings of the time. Here is a moment of gem and a sequence of gems. <br /> <br /> The big moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops right next to it, with Buster sadly sitting on the cowcatcher and therefore passing a General shot to a close-up in a matter of seconds. <br /> <br /> The great sequence is with the telephone booth next to the elevator, one that is constantly confused with the other with floor-to-floor racing, one of Keaton's big gags. <br /> <br /> Kino's print is crisp and clear, almost pristine. There is a violin / piano accompaniment. This is one to look for and enjoy.
