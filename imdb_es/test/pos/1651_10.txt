Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, is in line with the images of Melville's crime (particularly Bob le Flameur and to some extent Le Cercle Rouge) of being totally focused on the story and the character and making sure not to say a word that It is not necessary, And it was ahead of its time. Ionically, he still has a kind of professionalism among his characters, a kind of respect (if not for himself that for others, a kind of duty) that sounds good in post-World War II France. Their actors have faces for these characters that say 'we know what these guys are about', and that's where the story takes off. Maybe it's because I have a weak point for robbery images, especially when we only see the nuts and bolts (err, the actual physical side) of how a robbery is made. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with how The actual heist that is filmed in movies today is that everything is very fast (ie, Snatch), or done in a way that we have already seen many times. Dassin, like Melville years later, decided to create virtually a silent movie of a robbery, including sound effects. The tension that builds up in this scene may not surpass what Melville had in 'Rouge', but at his own level he achieves his own greatness and momentum, and a crucial originality of what has been done before. There are some saved close-ups, for example, since the safe is being cracked, which marks some of the best I've seen in France at that time. An additional advantage for the film, besides the touch of new wave in the larval stage of the film, which in the end makes it a little more modern, is that the story works so well and in a different way. It becomes completely on the character in the points, and then keeps the emotion. The last ten or fifteen minutes are miraculous; As with another classic image of Asphalt Jungle, it is not even the last stop that matters, but everything that is going to be done to overcome duty, to put humanism above greed. <br /> <br /> You almost ask. all the euphoria of the camera flying through the trees at a high speed with the car so that he can only achieve it. Dassin has here a very entertaining and intuitive film of its kind, with a small musical number as well.
