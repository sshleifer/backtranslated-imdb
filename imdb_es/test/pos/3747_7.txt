I recently saw this movie at a 3-D film festival in Hollywood. It was in polarized 3-D (gray glasses, not red and blue) It was very fun to see this movie with a public, the impression was excellent and the 3-D perfect. The performances were exaggerated and that added to the fun, the surprise ending (which we are not supposed to share with other movie buddies, at least according to the trailer and the movie poster) made people howl with laughter. By today's standards, this is probably more comedy than horror, but with the added dimension of 3-D (complete with cobwebs and bats coming off the screen), this movie was an entertaining challenge in the horror of the 50s.
