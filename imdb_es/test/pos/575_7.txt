This is a pretty dark and silly horror movie set in the Everglades of the 70s. It's really stupid and lame for the first half, then it really starts to be good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing, I do not know. It is fascinating. I was impressed by the night scenes, because it actually looked like the night, unlike most low-budget horror movies that still seem to be daytime. I feel that the director was very talented but he was working with a tiny budget and a difficult schedule. There are some scenes towards the end, the one mentioned above and also the final credits that are extremely cool. This movie could have been a true classic if it left behind its conventions of Scooby Doo and went straight to the throat. I was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be. I could not take my eyes off and had to ask myself "why?"
