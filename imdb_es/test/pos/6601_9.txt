Just there. Good, entertaining and accurate vintage feel for most scenes. Sufficient personality variations to cover real people in those days without distractions from the history of exceptions. The credits show Peralta de Mar Vista, California ... up the hill of Venice and south of Malibu. I lived there in the days of the Heartbreak Hotel, before the Beachboys, next to the surfer Bob Cooper in Wasatch Avenue, where the alley was used to burn surfboards that did not work. Old skate wheels were used in the plywood trimmings to roll the sidewalk waves. Things were different in each subsequent decade as the cold innocence of the fifties burst into the white-water freedom of the Heat of the Sun and the euphoria of the electric sixties and then into the assertively innovative playtime and evolutionary madness. inventiveness of the seventies. The movie gives you a piece of that kind of magical moment in time; in a place where the imaginary wave was real ... the source of culturally significant influences. And by the way, there is another movie that has an enthusiasm similar to that of the American street, and has the same genuinely unique kindness with a relaxed reality that helps to refine that eternally eternal sensation of freshness ... "Two Lane Blacktop" (with one of the best examples of free attitude in the history of the west coast of California .. Dennis Wilson). As Monte Hellman did with that, thanks, SP, for being there with this one. GWR
