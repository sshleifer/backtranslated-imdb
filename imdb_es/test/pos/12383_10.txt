This is better than the first. The movie begins with Sheriff Sam. Then, Sam and Anne collect their bags and go to the Tropicana while Jack accompanies them. <br /> <br /> People are shot, put a glass in their necks, crushed by anvils, get stabbed with icicles, eyes ripped out, explosions in the head, drownings, hangings, lobsters pushed on faces, throats cut, frozen to death, killed by snowballs, arms ripped out, melted by antifreeze, icicles on the neck, beaten on the face pots and pans, bitten fingers, icicles through the mouth, bitten on the neck, people who they explode, toasted and pushed snowballs in blenders. <br /> <br /> The snowballs are hilarious, put them in a blender and turn it on, then say "that was fun", put it in a waffle thing and it burned. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie. Then they begin to think of other ways to kill him, and the snowball responds: "that's not good". <br /> <br /> It was worth spending ten dollars to buy this. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars.
