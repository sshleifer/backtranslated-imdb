The idea of ​​a true diplomatic incident "The wind and the lion" is a very good adventure film set in the deserts of Africa. <br /> <br /> The head of an Arab tribe, El Raisuli (Sean Connery) kidnaps The American Woman (Candice Bergen) and his two sons won some concessions for his country from US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith). Out of this simple plot, John Milius gets a very complete and enjoyable movie in the genre. <br /> <br /> The outdoor dessert locations, an impressive color photograph, well-managed action sequences and perfect configurations make the image a kind of epic with an undeniable sense of grandeur. The musical score is also remarkable and adapts accordingly. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is very good as an Arab leader and shows that he can handle almost any kind of role. This is Candice Bergen as the woman who shows strength in dangerous circumstances, but deep down she is scared and has her weaknesses; he comes to admire Connery and even to understand his completely different approach to life that emerges from his completely different cultures as well. Brian Keith plays one of his best roles as US President Teddy Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining and very good cinematographic sample of the genre. Give it a chance, you will not regret it.
