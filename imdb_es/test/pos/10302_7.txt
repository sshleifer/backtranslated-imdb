This film is based on a play, and is the second adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino is the basketball coach of a team of players who, against all odds, took home the championship 20 years ago. Everyone has gathered for a meeting. Terry Kinney plays James, a high school principal, and he will quickly become nervous with all his complaints and feel sorry for my role. Vincent D'Onofrio, like Phil, plays a nasty businessman with just the right amount of "money" arrogance. Tony Shalhoub is George, the current mayor of the city, and he seems to be on the verge of some kind of crisis. Gary Sinise plays Tom, a writer, turned into an alcoholic, and in my opinion, he's excellent on paper. While everyone must be celebrating their championship, conflicts, jealousy and fights abound. When men come to an agreement with what was and is now, they are forced to look at their lives in an unpleasant way. It is unusual for a group of men to talk and cry about what could have been, and I found it interesting to see them relate to each other. It's not the best movie I've seen, but it's certainly good enough to see it.
