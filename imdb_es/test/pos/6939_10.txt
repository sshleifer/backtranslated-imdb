Governments are elected for periods of three years, as Reg Whithers said in 1973, the Liberals were determined to continue forcing Labor to the polls until they were defeated. If you ask me, this is described in the docudrama, but anyone who says that Kerr acted correctly does not recognize the costly and selfish strategy of the Liberal Party of Australia. In the series itself, I thought that Max Phipps was a poor Whitlam, his voice was too ghostly. In addition, more key political actors on both sides should have been used, although this may have been a reflection of budget constraints at that time. However, I recommend it, with caution.
