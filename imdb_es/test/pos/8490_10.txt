Jamie Foxx leads a brilliant cast on this powerful journey through the life of the blind and emotionally troubled African-American pop genius, Mr. Ray Charles. Although the entire cast has a wonderful performance, Mr. Foxx won more than just an Oscar. If it were possible to nominate an actor in consecutive years, I would consider doing so for Mr. Foxx. Foxx not only plays Charles, but recreates it. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother (the inspiration for his life) and young Ray. These two gave the strongest support in the film. <br /> <br /> The dramas of Charles's struggles with guilt, the death of his younger brother and his mother, blindness, discrimination, addiction and success, are perfectly woven into the tapestries of his music . The music is beautiful, the script is, as far as I can tell, perfect, and the performance is nothing short of legendary. <br /> <br /> The film's direction method justifies the discussion. Taylor Hackford, a director of whom I am generally ambivalent, had to choose which aspects of Mr. Charles's more complex and complex life story would tell his story in the most honest, dramatic and understandable way. Although some disagree (apparently wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic) I think he selected his subjects admirably. A big part of the success of this film is its constant focus on some lingering themes in Charles's life: his deep love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his addiction and his guilt complex, his musical genius . and his deep fear of responsibility for others. Charles is depicted as a man fighting valiantly against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined about one of the men I used to listen to on my old turntable with my dad in his living room on Sunday nights while soccer games were on TV. And nothing was covered in sugar in "Ray". The issues are carried forward with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama that encompasses the length of his long and enlightened life. The power of these themes, the strong script and the direction, the music and the performance make this one of the most pleasant and evocative biographical films I have seen. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
