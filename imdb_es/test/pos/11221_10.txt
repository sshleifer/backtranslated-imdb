After thinking more about this movie, I think it's too easy to dismiss it as Boy's dream. In fact, I received some spiritual strength from Northfork ....... Angels exist ... we are definitely entertained with them ... most of the time we do not even realize it ... At one point of spiritual and emotional turmoil in my life, I personally needed this movie. Yes, as I wrote before, talk to many ... I can not wait to get to Heaven ... <br /> <br /> "Being so fed up with everything related to FX and Formula, I discovered that this film is genuine. All I can say is that it moved me in many ways, that I'm still solving it, North Fork is a wonderful movie, one that takes the viewer out of the trash and puts it in the heart. "The spiritual aspect is very intriguing. Pay attention, since you will need to use the brain and the heart that God gave you to follow the story, I think it may be a little incomprehensible for some, but I feel that these are the people to whom I speak most important. I want to see it several times more, just to be able to assimilate everything! <br /> <br /> The industry needs to study this film to realize that we do exist. <Br /> <br /> My thanks to all those involved in the realization of this movie.
