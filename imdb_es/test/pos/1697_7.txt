Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager who spends his holidays in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy avoids that Serafine Pigot (the beautiful Julie Delpy) commits suicide in Eiffel Tour and is in love with her. He does not know that she is a werewolf. They go to a clandestine party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is injured and becomes a werewolf. He is warned that the only way to get back to normal is to kill the werewolf that attacked him and ate his heart. This movie is a violent movie with a black humor. The special effects and the soundtrack are excellent, highlighting the song of the band Bush. I do not know why some readers compare this film with the masterpiece 'An American Werewolf in London'. The stories have nothing in common (just an American teenager, werewolves and a city in Europe). Very indicated for the fanatics of the werewolf and the films of black humor. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomem Americano em Paris" ("An American werewolf in Paris")
