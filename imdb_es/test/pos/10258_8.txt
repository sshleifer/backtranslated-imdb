This was the first movie I saw in my life in 1974 or 1975. At that time I was 4 years old and I saw it in a theater drive-in. I did not understand that this would be a classic at that time (I went to sleep about twenty minutes after the movie). After watching it on TV, along with two of my other favorite movies, Car Wash (my favorite movie) and The Wiz, which seemed to appear every year almost at the same time all together, approximately 40, 50, 75 times, I knew it here. It was a movie that I would have as one of my favorites. Those three movies were the only live performances I could see as a child. <br /> <br /> I would not consider this as a blaxploitation movie but rather as a film of urban interest. Cochise and Preach reminded me of some of my uncles, especially the Wild Irish Rose who drank. My mother also told me about some of the parties she attended and that some of the things that happened in the movie were similar in nature to what happened in real life. If you are one of the two or three blacks over thirty who have not yet seen this movie, I recommend you buy the DVD right now. I'm glad I was there to witness some of the events of the era.
