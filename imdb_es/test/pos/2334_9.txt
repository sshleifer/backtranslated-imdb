I'm glad that they finally released it on DVD. I bought the videotape years ago and I watched it at least once or twice a year. <br /> <br /> Grammer has an ironic wit about him that really makes this movie a success. Its formula is certainly not original, but nevertheless it is very funny. I am very surprised that he has not been higher in the ratings. <br /> <br /> It is one of my favorite comedies of all time. It's just a fun little movie that makes you feel good. And sometimes, that's all a movie should be.
