"Bride of Chucky" is one of the best horror films of the last ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90s. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Chucky's girlfriend, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) manages to find her battered remains after being absorbed by the fan at the end of part 3 and brings it to life in her trailer park. Her neighbor, Jessie (Nick Stabile) and girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) are being tormented by her uncle. (John Ritter) Tiffany annoys Chucky when he refuses to marry her, so she buys him a doll to play with her. Chucky kills Tiffany, and then transfers his soul to the doll he gave her. To be placed back in human bodies, they have to travel to New Jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so. Jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from Ritter, and they embark on the journey, but not before Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany. On the way, several strange incidents force them to stop at a bed and breakfast. When several more people are killed, they call their best friend (Gordon Woolvett) to fix the situation. They convince him that none of them are murderers, since the police have begun to solve the crimes. Find Ritter's body in a trunk in the back of the truck. Thinking that he has been established, he confronts them about it. Chucky and Tiffany become real to show that they did it, which makes Woolvett kill. The group steals a motor home and arrives at the cemetery. Jessie and Jade make Chucky and Tiffany turn around, giving them enough to escape. Chucky recaptures Jade and forces her to get her amulet. Chucky and Tiffany reinitiate their enmity, which gives Jessie and Jade enough time to kill them both when the police arrive and free them from the crimes. <br /> <br /> The good news: I have to give as many accessories to the FX department as Chucky and Tiffany as dolls seem completely convincing. The scenes with them together are the highlights of the films, including a hilarious conversation where Tiffany advises Chucky on how serial killers work in the 90s. That said, the amount of phrases that are actually fun in this movie is incredible. Chucky gets most of them, but Tiffany also cracks some gems. Actually, it's more fun than what Hollywood calls comedies these days. The blood is abundant and surprisingly realistic. Several deaths in this film are actually original and creative. Converting Ritter into a new form of Pinhead was a totally brilliant scene. The honeymoon couple was also a good death scene. For teenage love, the couple of Stabile and Heigl works very well. They have great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple. I must also admit that the first time I saw this movie, I jumped into certain scenes, and that shows how amazing the work of director Yu was. He learned enough, apparently, to do the same with "Freddy vs. Jason". He knows how to organize settings and payments, and here he shows some great skills that have an aspect and style influenced in Hong Kong. He could be the next great horror director if he continues to fill his resume with films like those two. Good soundtrack, too, like "Freddy vs. Jason". <br /> <br /> The bad news: for the fans of the cheesy movies, this will be a great discovery. However, this film has a high cheese factor that can prevent the horror movie fan from enjoying this movie. The film knows that it is a corny movie and it delights with it, causing a serious fan to turn off due to things like those of a single line. It's not so bad of a movie, but you have to see it in the mental frame that it's a corny movie, and that the cheese of certain scenes adds to the movie, not to remove it. Withdraw from that mental state and you can enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: fans of the cheesy movies and the other "Child's Play" movies will find many things to like about this movie. For fans of serious terror, take a look, but keep in mind that it is not a serious movie and that the cheese is supposed to be there and that you might like it. <br /> <br /> Rated R Graphic violence, graphic language, brief nudity on a doll, a puppet sex scene, some drug uses and numerous references to drugs.
