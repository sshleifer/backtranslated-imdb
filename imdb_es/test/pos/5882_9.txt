Although the wonderful refreshment counter in the local pharmacy no longer exists, and the clothes are definitely l946 immediate <br /> <br /> post-war harvest, and good and evil are easy to understand, and <br /> < Those old planes are really outdated, this movie will never be dated. <br /> <br /> The adjustments and human problems of the postwar period, the beautiful <br /> <br /> love stories, the wonderful performance (especially Harold Russell and <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews) They are as moving today in 2002 as they were in 1946. <br /> <br /> I was one of the young women who welcomed our wonderful veterans <br /> <br /> home after the Second World War. Like many, my memories of <br /> <br /> the years of war and the holidays are as fresh today as if <br /> <br /> took place yesterday, this movie is very relevant for our times.
