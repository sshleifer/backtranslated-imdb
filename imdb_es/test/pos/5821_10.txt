Oz is, by far, the best TV show of grace. Better than The Sopranos, yes, ER, yes, CSI, absolutely. Intransigent, daring and completely disturbing but deeply moving. Oz took us beyond any prison image someone had conjured up on television. Tom Fontana really did a brilliant job with writing. No subject is taboo. Rape, drugs, murder. Oz is evidence of how good television can be. Follow characters from all backgrounds and different races, but always return to your common man Tobias Beecher, in prison for vehicular homicide. We see what we do not want to see, pain, death, chaos. Oz will bother you, it will make you tremble, it will make you look the other way, but above all it will make you think. Seeing Oz is watching a magnificent television production.
