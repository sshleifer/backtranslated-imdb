Many have underestimated Never say never again because it is not an official Bond film. However, it is clear that the producers adhered to Bond's fruitful formula. Although the film does not have a pre-credit sequence, it is clear that the training exercise at the beginning of the film is the introductory scene. It would have been impossible for EON to prevent producers from including a pre-credit and a sequence of titles, although without the introduction of the gun barrel. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is in good shape as the immortal secret agent and this film is certainly better than Dr No, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever. Although, NSNA is destined to be a new version of Thunderball, it is a great improvement. 007 spends more time on the mainland and a more diverse variety of exotic places is included in the film. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of resplendent acting in this movie. Barbara Carrera is impeccable as the strange flush of Fatima. One of the best scenes in the film is the coup de grace between Bond and Fatima in Nice, which is preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city. Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the psychotic Largo and Max Von Sydow is free of the melodrama that other actors portraying Blofeld have given themselves. <br /> <br /> NSNA tends to focus on Connery instead of Bond's character. At the beginning it is stated that Bond is aging and has been out of action. This seems to refer to the pause of 12 years in the Bond representation of Connery. Bond promises "never again" to work in the Secret Service; an allusion to Bond's representation of Bond. It seems that the producers were trying to damage the official Bonus franchise. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is definitely worth seeing. This is the last time that Sean Connery played with James Bond, but his performance convinced me that maybe he should never have said "never again".
