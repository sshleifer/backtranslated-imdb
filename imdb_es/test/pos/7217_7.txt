At first I was very surprised to see William Shakespeare's masterpiece of love reworked in a sensual, bloody, violent and perverse film adaptation. But after you've seen it once, it grows more or less in you when you see the second and third, as you overcome the impact and begin to appreciate the film on its own merits: solid performance, good dialogue, good sequencing and choreography. Soundtrack not very bad and some of the (special) effects that are activated. Oh, and also the end. What a disturbance!
