I loved that. It begins as a fairly normal and somewhat heavy French art film, and then, suddenly, halfway it turns on its head. This part is brilliant since you realize that you have been looking at 2 plots, not one. Unfortunately, the end does not make much sense, which is a shame. Oh, yes, and it's filmed brilliantly.
