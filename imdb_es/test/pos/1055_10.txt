I came across this movie in the mid-eighties when I was a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday movies and not festive ones. As you can see in the other reviews, this film has a very good story and great actors signed by it. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is great as a girlfriend who has doubts. The performance of Dennis Morgan is also strong. It goes unnoticed in most movies, but it was a very capable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film she plays the visiting sailor who took Stanwyck away from her husband. <br /> <br /> This is a Christmas classic. The setting and the history make for a great Christmas romance
