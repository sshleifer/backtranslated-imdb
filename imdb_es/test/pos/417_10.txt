He is not your conventional taxi driver. <br /> <br /> This guy has problems. With his wife, his son, a priest, all his fees, his former partner and, above all, himself. And the best thing is that they put us all in it. So we have to keep looking to discover more about his past. <br /> <br /> The idea may not be original, but David Morse does it that way. I think this is a great show, and I hope that people catch up before the end of the season. <br /> <br /> LOOK AT THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!!
