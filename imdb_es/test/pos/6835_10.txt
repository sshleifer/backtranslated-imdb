But not too hip. And not too loud. "Judas Kiss" nails the new fair noir. A good rhythm and a nuanced score complete a twisted story full of sex, betrayal and safe lineages. Inspiring work around him. Congratulations in particular to HalHolbrook (his best work), Gil Bellows (Ally Mc-what?) And Carla Gugino (the best famme fatale in years ... intelligent, fun and ultra HOT) ... I give him a 9 (out of 10 ) and that's because 10 should be reserved for movies like Humphrey Bogart and Coen Bros.
