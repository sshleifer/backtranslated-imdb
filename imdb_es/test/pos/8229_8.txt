I read ashew's comment and thought they should have been seeing a completely different picture! <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie this morning and I was quite surprised. <br /> <br /> To address Ashew's comments: <br /> <br /> Trail Street is a very well-done western. <br /> <br /> And Randolph Scott was in this quite! <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes was more fun than I've seen it! <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, the bad guys had very good results. <br /> <br /> Plus: <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see Robert Ryan as a straight line. - Good boy replaced - is usually very thin. <br /> <br /> In general, a good western, very well acted and written. <br /> <br /> I liked the background story of Kansas and the "winter wheat" that supposedly helped it to become a state, too. <br /> <br /> I thought the girl who played Susan was charming, I can not think why she did not become a bigger star!
