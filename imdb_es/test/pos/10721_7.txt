Beyond the words is this heartbreaking story of a divorce that translates into a tragic battle for the custody of a seven-year-old child. <br /> <br /> One of the strengths of "Kramer v. Kramer" is its screenwriter, director Robert Benton. who has beautifully adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. It keeps things beautifully simple and more realistic, while offering all the drama directly from the heart. His talent for telling emotional stories like this was to try again with "Places in the heart", where he showed, as in "Kramer v. Kramer", that he has a natural ability to work with children. <br /> <The other strong point of the film is the splendid performance that deservedly received four of the nine nominations for the Academy Awards, two of them winning. One of them was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor), who is excellent as the frustrated businessman Ted Kramer, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. As her wife Joanne said, Meryl Streep claimed the Oscar-winning actress for a strong and sensitive portrait of a woman who had been lost in eight years of marriage. Jane Alexander was also nominated for her fantastic turn as Kramer's good friend, Margaret. The last word in the acting bets should be for the young Justin Henry, whose incredibly moving performance will find him choking back tears again and again, and a deserved Oscar nomination came his way. <br /> <br /> Brilliant is also Nestor Almendros The cinematography and timely editing of Jerry Greenberg, while musically using the classic work of Henry Purcell. <br /> <br /> In truth, this is a moving story of how a father and son depend more and more when their wife and mother leaves. They grow together, they know each other and they form a completely new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new perspective on life, and little by little he realizes why Joanne had to go. <br /> <br /> Without doubt, "Kramer v. Kramer" shows that nobody wins when it arrives. to a custody battle for a small child, especially not for the child himself. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 10, 1995 - TV <br /> <br /> Strong drama from Avery Corman's novel about the anguish of a custody battle between separated parents who feel they have in mind the best interests of the child. Apart from a magnificent script and a surprisingly controlled direction, both by Robert Benton, it is the superlative cast that makes this picture a winner. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is brilliant as Ted Kramer, the man divided between his outstanding career and the son he desperately wants to keep. Excellent is also Streep, the woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to leave before she vanished as a person. In support of these two, there is a very strong Jane Alexander as mutual friend Margaret, a prominent Justin Henry as the child caught in the middle and a group of extras. <br /> <br /> This drama is so emotional and heartbreaking. More than he deserves are his 1979 Academy Awards for best film, best actor (Hoffman) and best supporting actress (Streep). <br /> <br /> Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - TV
