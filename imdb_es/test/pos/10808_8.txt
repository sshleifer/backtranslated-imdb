If there were two parts in which the physically great and ugly charismatic actor GÃ©rard Depardieu was born, as a Frenchman, to perform, surely he must have been Cyrano de Bergerac and the orator Georges Danton. Here he dominates the film through the breadth of his shoulders and the power of his voice; his charisma is important despite the fact that it is clear that the character has as much blood on his hands as any of the others. Danton delights while the people of Paris starve to death ... but he is the only one who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the feared Public Safety Committee in the name of "freedom", and is presented as the hero of the film . Despite the fact that the game of origin practically idolizes his opponent, Robespierre! <br /> <br /> For those who know the characters in the story, there is interest in identifying the minor parts: the frog-faced Tallien, Couthon the cripple, Fouquier-Tinville, the court prosecutor, the gallant St -Just, the epic painter David. But the script cuts a little slack in this regard; names are often slow to arrive if secondary characters are identified, and there is no 'information dump' Hollywood style to ensure that the audience can place the events in their historical context. The film takes for granted that you know what happened before and what will happen next, sometimes it is taken too much for granted, as when based on a close knowledge of dates to provide the final touch to reality. Robespierre followed Danton a short time to the scaffolding. <br /> <br /> Considered as a movie, it is not entirely satisfactory because it deviates towards the end. The structure of the story leads to a great confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or some dramatic climax of the trial, which, thanks to the story, never happens. Things simply disappear: there is no revolt, there is no overthrow of tyranny, there is no assumption of power by the victor, there is no triumph in either side. It may be historically accurate, but it is not entirely satisfactory as a result of a screen scenario; It seems like a strange place to stop. As others have commented, it could have been more logical to take the events to the end of the Terror and show, in attachment, the fall of Robespierre.
