I just watched The Big Trail at the Filmmuseum in Vienna for the first time. I was immediately amazed by the unusual and high-quality format of the optical images and by their beautiful detailed history. Who has seen such a Western documentary style with John Wayne? And there is so much time that you can look on the screen, there is so much to see! One is always grateful that the scenes are often static, because each shot is very well composed and you want to take it. Even the acting is good and it fits well. The long running time of the image is wonderful, you will not want to miss a minute!
