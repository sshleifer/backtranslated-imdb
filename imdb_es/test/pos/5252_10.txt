The lament and the almost unbearable melancholy of the music of Amalia Rodriques go to a place in the soul that only music can touch. In his voice and magical presence, is the exquisite agony of fado, an art form that I did not know until I saw this film. <br /> <br /> For me, the success of this beautifully designed documentary with love lies in The fact that the filmmaker resists the temptation to editorialize and simply allows us to share the magnetism and the elegant passion of this icon. It seems that there is an inevitable correlation between Portuguese fado and American blues. <br /> <br /> At its best, documentary film transports us to a previously unknown reality. and having allowed ourselves this vision, we transform ourselves. <br /> <br /> Sheltered, Mr.de Almeida
