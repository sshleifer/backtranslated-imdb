When I first saw the premiere episode of Farscape, I had no idea what to expect. He was immensely impressed and satisfied with "Premiere". However, the subsequent re-clocks have left me in evidence numerous flaws that I initially missed. "Premiere" is not a great episode of Farscape, but it deserves credit for having configured the plot successfully and efficiently and for having told the basic stories of many of the regular characters. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with John Crichton (Ben Browder), an astronaut and scientist, preparing to launch into space in the Farscape Module, a small spaceship perfected by Crichton and his friend DK. Crichton has an eye-opening conversation with his father, Jack Crichton, and then begins his test flight in space. Of course, everything goes wrong and Crichton receives a "shot through a wormhole" and ends up in "a distant part of the galaxy". <br /> <br /> After leaving the wormhole, the Crichton module is placed aboard a habitable space to send. From here, the characters and the storyline of the Farscape series are presented in an entertaining but hasty way. <br /> <br /> Normal characters are presented correctly during the first half of the episode. Of course, there is Crichton, well played by Ben Browder. He offers the audience a sympathetic character to identify himself. He is lost and has no idea how to make much of anything. In "Premiere," Crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the peacekeeping staff. He does not know anything about either side, but by helping Aeryn (a captured pilot of the Peacekeepers), it is clear that he intends to help the peacemakers. He probably would not have finished taking the side of the prisoners had it not been for Crais, a captain of the Peacekeepers, who declared Crichton as his brother's murderer. This puts Crichton in an interesting situation: he is trapped in strange and violent escaped prisoners in a distant galaxy of which he knows nothing. Crichton's total lack of knowledge about Farsape's world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during the first season of Farscape. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is just as compelling. There's Zhaan, a blue delvian and former prisoner. It is peaceful and reasonable, unlike its prey Ka D'Argo, a powerful and hard-headed warrior. Virginia Hey is totally covered in blue make-up, which allows her Zhaan character to look great and convincing. D'Argo's mega makeup, in contrast, is below average. He seems a little silly with his giant tentacles and his strange nose, and there is something peculiar in his eyes. They seem to have had some kind of allergic reaction to their makeup. Farscape would give some improvements to their makeup in season 1, but the general wardrobe, at least for me, will remain a problem until season 2. <br /> <br /> The digital characters / puppets of Rygel and Pilot are, In a few words, excellent. Rygel is a tiny Hynerian Dominar that floats on some kind of hovercraft. In "Premiere" is given a good dialogue, but not much more. Pilot almost steals the show as the link between the live ship, Moya and Moya's passengers. Even in the first episode, Pilot emits the appearance of being a real and alive extraterrestrial; never once in the program seems to be a giant and expensive machine. <br /> <br /> The Peacekeeper characters presented are also quite interesting. The peacemakers are made up of a race called sebacea, which resembles humans. The main antagonist appears in "Premiere" as Captian Crais, who believes that Crichton killed his brother. In fact, the death of Crais's brother was simply an accident as the result of an accidental collision with Crichton's ship. Aeryn Sun, a pilot who Crichton helps to escape, tries to explain that the death was an accident, but Crais simply states that it is "irreversibly contaminated" and refused to change his mind. Crais's obsession with revenge, justified or not (it should be clear to Crais that Crichton is not responsible), is mysterious in "Premiere", but will be explained later in the season. Aeryn provides an extremely interesting character. Being forced to leave the Peacekeeping Service, she changes her whole lifestyle and, in that sense, finds herself in a similar (though less serious) situation as Crichton. <br /> <br /> The actual episode, as mentioned above, feels a bit hasty and clumsy. So much happens that you do not spend enough time on anything. Also, D'Argo (for now) seems a bit silly running around with his mediocre suit trying to look menacing. Still, "Premiere" is a solid entertainment. The special effects (as in the Starburst sequences) are impressive. Most of the costumes and sets aboard Moya are original. Despite its shortcomings, "Premiere" is a must-see for fans of Farscape. 3/4
