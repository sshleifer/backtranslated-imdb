I've been waiting for the release of this DVD (and its follow-up {Female Prisoner Scorpion: # 701's Grudge Song}) for some time. I enjoyed the first two movies of this series very much. After watching this movie, I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. <br /> <br /> All three of these films were directed by Shunya Ito. However, the good thing about them is that, although they all have the same main character (played beautifully by Meiko Kaji), they are very different from the others. <br /> <br /> The first movie (Female Prisoner # 701: Scorpion) is more or less a typical Women In Prison movie. But the character of Scorpio is very intriguing, reminiscent of the antiheroes of many spaghetti westerns. And the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. <br /> <br /> The second film (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a true tour-de-force. Not so much a WIP movie as most of the film has Scorpion and six other prisoners escaped in jail. <br /> <br /> This movie (Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last one directed by Shunya Ito. This one plays a lot more crime drama. Once again, our heroine is running away. But this time, she has managed to maintain some normality in her life (relatively speaking anyway). Get a job, find a place to live, make a friend abroad. But, of course, everything has to be unraveled eventually. FPS: Beast Stable has a simpler story that is told at a more leisurely pace than its predecessors. But I found it interesting from start to finish. And do not worry: there's still a lot of depravity in this movie! But I believe that these films transcend most exploitation films because the most disturbing elements are reproduced in a more straight tone instead of being used exclusively for the shock value in your face. Yes, there were definitely moments in this movie where I shuddered with strength. But I did not feel that they detracted from the story (well, maybe once or twice). One thing I've really enjoyed about these films is the continued accumulation of Scorpion myths. With this entry, character development is used much more widely than in the previous two. We can see that she is much more than a vengeful asshole with a heart of stone! <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier in this review, a fourth movie followed. He also presents Meiko Kaji as Scorpion, but he had a different director. Without revealing anything, I want to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends in such a way that it makes a sequel completely unnecessary. The fourth movie is still pretty good, but it seems to be a footnote to an amazing trilogy. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in unusual films. FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed as an independent piece (like the first two films), but I would also recommend seeing the others first if you have not already done so.
