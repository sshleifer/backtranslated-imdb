This is undoubtedly one of the best works of Neil Simon turned into movies. It is full of great characters, and a memorable dialogue. Johnathan Silverman makes a big screen version of young Eugene (he was played by Matthew Broderick on stage). This is Simon's first autobiographical trilogy, followed by the wonderful "Biloxi Blues," and closes with the television movie "Broadway Bound." If I had to say that the movie has flaws, it may be that the characters sometimes speak in an obvious dialogue, but that's fine because it's a great dialogue. Rent this little gem, you will not regret!
