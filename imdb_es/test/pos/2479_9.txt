As for the fake documentaries (do you fakumentaries someone?), This is one of the best! It looks very real and that is what it claims. In the light of recent events (Guantanamo), this film is even more terrifying, so it could be said that it was ahead of its time, when it was released in the 70s! <br /> <br /> One can only hope that such a government does not exist! Looking for terrorists and interviewing people like that? Of course, all the interviewees seemed to have the same (mentality of the 70s): to screw politicians and politics in general. Maybe that was not as smart as you might think ... but hey, do not forget: it's just a movie! ; or)
