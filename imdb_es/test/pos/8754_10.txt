The best that can be said about the movie "Traffic" is that it drew attention to the British miniseries "Traffik". As many people have noticed, the current film suffers from truncation of the story to adapt to the short attention span of film attendees and the response time of the owners of the theaters, who measure the success of a movie by sales of too expensive food. <br /> <br /> The first series that I recorded for the first time in 1990 was shown on Public TV and I have seen it many times. The entire series of documentary style has a strong element of tragedy and fatality, since the characters are moving towards their final destination. The strongest of the three stories is that of the Pakistani family forced to enter the city to find a way to keep body and soul together after the army burns the poppy crop in a demonstration of organized strength for the benefit of Western politicians. The difficulties of the family are similar to those of the family of rickshaw drivers in "City of Joy". Finally, the farmer finds work, but compromises his pride and honesty. <br /> <br /> The Pakistani segment of the film has a particular relevance today, in the fight against the supporters of Al Quaeda, and gives some understanding of the support for such movements among the disadvantaged poor of Pakistan and Afghanistan They rarely receive part of the money that goes to those countries. The film notes that farmers see only 25% of the aid that is supposed to encourage them to grow other crops. <br /> <br /> With the inability of the United States to see anything other than in terms of black and white - good guys v. bad boys - it is interesting to see another view where there is no black and white, only shades of gray. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler ahead. The only problem I had with the story was that, instead of things continuing as they did before, as they would in real life, being a work of fiction, they had to wrap it up with the "bad guys" to get it. what awaited them Apart from that, this was a good job of the kind we see very rarely. The cast was outstanding and the locations of Germany and Pakistan helped give the film a "different" feel (what a change it made to see the Germans as more than the villains in a World War II film).
