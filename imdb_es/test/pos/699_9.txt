Glenn Ford is hired by the owner of a corrupt bank and the owner of a cunning barn Edger Buchanan to organize a fake robbery while the banker hides the real loot. With Ford as a no-show, the two instead go with a second-choice trigger, leaving Ford on the hook for the murders he did not commit. <br /> <br /> The first color feature of Columbia Pictures, The Desperadoes looks fantastic with games and costumes made to take full advantage of the Technicolor process that accents tons of well-organized western shows. <br /> <br /> This has the irresistible team of a young Glenn Ford (the third, but essentially the star) and a The first Randolph Scott is the leader of an incredible cast of actors from great characters in colorful roles, including scene crook Edger Buchanan as a kind but slightly evil yokel who is not as stupid as he looks and who has a few memorable phrases. <br /> <br /> A fairly complex script effectively combines action sequences, melodrama and incredible comedy, well directed by Charles Vidor. This is one of the great Westerners of the forties and highly recommended.
