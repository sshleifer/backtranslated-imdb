If you keep a rigid historical perspective out of it, this movie is quite entertaining. It has action, adventure and romance, and one of the best confrontations in the casting of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the main roles. As it is evident in this board, the image does not pass the examination with the purists that look for a precision one hundred percent in their narration. To go beyond that, you just have to put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, that's hard to do if you consider Custer's Last Support in Little Big Horn and its prominence in the history of post-Civil War America. So I guess there is an unresolved dilemma with the image, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to take here, although for the runtime two more hours of the image. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scraper, going up as it does with all military attire. Sharp's practical joke (Arthur Kennedy) in placing him at the commander's headquarters probably should have gotten both of them in trouble. <br /> <br /> Ironically, many scenes in this military film are for comedy, as in Custer's first encounter with Libby Bacon and later encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I had not noticed it before in other movies, but McDaniel reminded me a lot of another of my favorite Forties actors, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it seemed that it was Moreland who had put it on a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was also a scream. <br /> <br /> As for Flynn, it is interesting to note that a year earlier, he played J.E.B. Stuart opposed Ronald Reagan's performance of General Custer on "Santa Fe Trail," both competing for the attention of Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan did not put any of the arrogance and extravagances in the character of Custer that history remembers, while in the portrait of Flynn here it is more than evident. But it does not come close to Richard Mulligan's on the military hero in "Little Big Man" in 1970. Let's say you were a little exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The best thing that took my picture away was the way Custer persevered to keep his good name and not betting on a risky business. to venture. That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed throughout history. Most poignant was the final confrontation with archrival Sharp, just before entering Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory depended entirely on one's point of view. Previously, a similar comment could have given us the best perspective of everyone on the character of Custer, when he said: "You take the glory when it's your time to go."
