"Müllers Büro" is a film that many will see and enjoy until the end, while others will not see it in five minutes. It's a parody of detective movies with all the twists and turns; the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city that resembles the Batman Gothic City (look carefully at the streets, the buildings, the police car chasing the criminals, etc.). It is also a parody of musicals with really funny characters like the secretary of Müller and the lover of Vitasek (the actor who plays the assistant of Müller) who do everything possible to sing, although not with much success. <br /> <br /> The spaces it occupies The characters have their own presence in the film, like the decadent Blue Box (there is a real club with this name in Vienna) where you can see a sailor beating a girl in the bottom, Müller's apartment with black paint smeared in the background. The walls and dirty kitchen, Müller's office with the sweet image of his assistant, etc. <br /> <br /> The moments of humor in the film are many and include the kind of humor "flat on the face", like that of Müller on the floor the face of his assistant, the prostitute who charges Müller for the orgasm, the ridiculous costumes of Montana bullies, etc. <br /> <br /> A legendary film from the 80s, especially for those interested in Austrian or German-speaking films.
