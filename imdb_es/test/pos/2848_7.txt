* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the movie fun. It was strange and I enjoy it, I laughed a lot, so I definitely recommend the movie. However, I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say. The plot is very simple. Betty (Renee Zellweger), a wife of the hard life, sees how her husband is murdered and, while she forgets everything she had seen, follows her "true love" for a character from the series of telenovelas, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear) Simple enough but not enough to contain a 95 minute movie. And here comes the big question. What is the movie about? The reference to "The Wizard of Oz" is obvious. Betty and Dorothy are both from Kansas; However, while Dorothy arrives at the end of the film and concludes that "there is no place like home", Betty does not come to any conclusion. And at the end of the movie, we wonder what you have learned from your experience and the answer is simply nothing. It seems that it does not affect her at all. <br /> <br /> That's the movie about the differences between reality and fantasy? It could be, but the scenes that deal with this theme are short and are nothing more than a joke and not a serious plot that can take the film to other places (and by the way, "The Truman Show" treated this theme in a way better). <br /> <br /> The movie could be about obsession. Betty is obsessed with the soap series and Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty. LaBute shows two sides of the obsession and seems to forget that obsession, in any form, is dangerous, and must be condemned. It seems that he sympathizes with Betty's obsession because he sees her as harmless. <br /> <br /> Although the film is very long, we have scenes that in itself could have been a theme for a whole movie, but we can let them think about it without having an impact on the characters. <br /> <br /> The ending is simply a makeup that has nothing to do. do it with what we saw before. It's a shame because the film could have been sharper if it had concentrated one or two subjects. Actually, it is a lot, but in reality we do not say anything. <br /> <br /> What we have left is the feeling of having seen a little movie, funny and strange that could have been much more.
