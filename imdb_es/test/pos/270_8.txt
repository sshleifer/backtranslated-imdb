As the excellent series' Prime Suspect 'reaches a quarter, there is no loss of momentum at all, this in itself is a considerable achievement'. Prime Suspect IV: The Lost Child 'has the strong cast of support that we take for granted in these British dramas but, of course, the beautiful Helen Mirren easily dominates; our eyes never leave it while it is on the screen. <br /> <br /> The search for the lost son of the title leads Superintendent Jane Tennison's CID team to a main suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile who now lives with a single mother and two daughters. The information that is given to us in the functioning of your mind is one of the emotional highlights of this miniseries, but it can be too strong for many stomachs. <br /> <br /> Action sequences are handled brilliantly by hand. A sustained camera pushed us right in the middle of the emotion and there is a grip tension during the climatic siege. <br /> <br /> Together, this is another great procedural police drama.
