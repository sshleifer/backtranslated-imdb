The mere fact of reading the reviews of this wonderful BBC mini series reminded me how much I enjoyed this when it first aired many years ago. At that moment I remember waiting in advance for the next installment and I fell in love with John Bowe and Janet McTeer, two talented actors we do not see enough of on television or in movies these days. <br /> <br /> I have tried unsuccessfully to obtain several of the fantastic BBC dramas of the past, including the 1973 version of Jane Eyre and the 1972 version of Anne of Green Gables, all wonderful and timeless stories, which unfortunately The BBC seems to have no intention of releasing on video or DVD. If someone learns otherwise, I'd love to hear from them. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, we will have to content ourselves with our memories of how wonderful they were.
