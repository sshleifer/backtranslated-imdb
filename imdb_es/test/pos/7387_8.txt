If the ending had not been so unexpectedly unexpected, I do not think I could rate this movie so well. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of character interaction, uncomfortable, anguished, of "marriage disintegration". That kind of thing is not my kind of drama, so the rhythm seemed to drag me away. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main characters are difficult to relate and, therefore, worry a lot about the husband (Alan Rickman) is rather bitter and in a bad mood and the wife (Polly Walker) is distant and a little haughty. The performance was good (Norman Reedus was very attractive), but the characters themselves were maybe a little FULLY imperfect (for me). <br /> <br /> The environment was nice and it was quite isolated and a bit creepy. The cinematography had something that seemed a bit old-fashioned to me in some way. <br /> <br /> But the last 5 to 15 minutes of this movie are so ingenious that all uncomfortable scene, uncomfortable conversation and unexplained character behavior. Absolutely worth it. I guessed every typical turn of the plot, except the one that occurred. <br /> <br /> The ending definitely makes it worthwhile to watch this movie. The intrigue and the drama, not so much.
