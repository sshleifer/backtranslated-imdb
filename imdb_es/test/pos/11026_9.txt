There are many things to admire about this movie, but what surpassed me all was the part of an eccentric inmate, the kind of role that Hollywood loves and romanticizes but which is absolutely compelling here and unlike any character I have encountered. In the movies or in life. Also a very convincing and disturbing description of Tourete syndrome.
