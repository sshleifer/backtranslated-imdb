I saw this work on Showtime a few years ago in the comfort of my home and when the final note was played, I wanted to jump off the couch and give a standing ovation to the production. As it was, I shed a tear that was a lot of fantastic performances and songs. For my birthday, my children bought me the VHS version as well as the CD of the play with Len Cariou in the Sweeny Todd Role. <br /> <br /> I have shared the work with many ... some find the subject a little sick, but none have anything but praise for the songs. <br /> <br /> I have always loved the interaction in the songs with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn, as well as Hearn and Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin. <br /> <br /> I must own the DVD.
