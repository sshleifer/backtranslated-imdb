<br /> <br /> As a fan of Harold Lloyd, I agree with the other critic's comments, EXCEPT that I feel that "Movie Crazy" was his best sound movie; "The leg of the cat" is very close. (But, this is just MY opinion). <br /> <br /> This movie is a "scream" from start to finish and, in many scenes, George Barbier (the thief who leads him to be elected mayor) almost steals the show. ! (Especially at the end of the movie). <br /> <br /> One wants the character of Una Merkel to be a little more sympathetic to Harold, especially as the film progresses. Only in the last minutes of the film do we discover his true feelings for him. (And, even so, there is no "romance": kisses, etc.). <br /> <br /> This is a must-see movie!
