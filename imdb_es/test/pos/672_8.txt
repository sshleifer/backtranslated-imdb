An excellent B characteristic. A virtual game of two hands over a day (you can see its origins on stage and even how it must have worked as a radio show), and although it only lasted 77 minutes, it developed in sequences similar to something similar to what real. hour. Robert Ryan is the psychopath who keeps Ida Lupino trapped in his own home. Both are excellent, especially the underestimated Lupino, whose initial independence and self-control soon crumble before Ryan's deranged intruder. Today, of course, would be all guts and gore, but the moderation shown by director Harry Horner, (much better known as Art Director), only adds to the suspense that is sometimes worthy of Hitchcock.
