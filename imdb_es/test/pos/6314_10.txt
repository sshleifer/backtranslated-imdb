I saw this film at the Rotterdam Film Festival and I was pleasantly surprised. Photography is so elegant and beautiful, and the story is not your average mafia movie, in fact that story is pretty deep down. It is more the personal journey of a middle-aged man who is trapped in an existence that he was forced to live. The actor, Toni Servillo, is excellent, this "quiet man" stands out. The girl, Olivia Magnani, is the granddaughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnani and lives up to the family name. <br /> <br /> If you are waiting for your typical Italian film in which everyone screams big. Families, this is NOT your movie. There are no normal cliches and it's definitely worth seeing.
