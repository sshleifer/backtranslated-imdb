This movie is a variation of a theme that we have all seen again and again: the adventure of Posiedan in space. All the characters are common characters: heroine fighter, Judas, coward, etc. The only question really is who is next to kill it. Sometimes, this proven formula works, as in this case, but more often not, as the "Red Planet", which really leaves hallucinating. <br /> <br /> So, why does this one work? Because it is elegant. The performance is above average. And above all it is not foreseeable. The conclusion is not signed. I really had no idea how it would all end and I was surprised how it ended. That's why he deserves the best grades in my book. <br /> <br /> It's an intriguing and entertaining movie. And although it was never likely to change the appearance of the cinema as we know it, it does not disappoint.
