There was a lot about Little Vera that was strange to me. In general I enjoyed this movie, but a lot of the way the characters behaved was not what I was used to. For example, the environment in which Vera's family lived was very tense. Almost every time the family was together, they drank, fought or shouted and it was often a combination of the three. After having seen the movie, I felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place during it. However, I was very interested in seeing the history of this middle class Russian family. Throughout the film we remember the industrialized state of Russia due to the repeated shots of a train passing through the screen. It gave the viewer the sensation of a mechanically lived life. The characters seemed to be focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work. There was no feeling of happiness throughout the movie. The only time a character did not scream was when Vera fell in love with her boyfriend Sergei. This lasted very little because the viewer later discovers (after Sergei locks Vera's father in a bathroom and Vera lets him out, after which the father proceeds to stab Sergei) that he is abusive. Again Vera is told that the only reason she was born was so that the family could get a bigger apartment. It is very interesting to observe how Vera and the family could face the behavior of others. The film was definitely worth seeing because of its description of how life could be in areas of Russia.
