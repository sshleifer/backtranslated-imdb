This concert is the kind of concert that is held every about twenty years, Madonna's Confessions in an era of the dance floor will be remembered as one of the highlights of his career. She is 48 years old and looks simply divine, she keeps up with the dancers who are almost twenty years younger than her. I am also pleased to report that all the songs were sung live, which is good because it actually sounds better live. Each song was so unique, the images were impressive. The performance of 'Live To Tell' was fantastic and I was surprised, 'Isaac' was exotic and beautiful, and full of political symbolism, the Arab American eagle horn and released. I especially liked the rockin 'performance of' I Love New York ', I almost stood up in my living room and I was glad when she told her critics to suck George Bushes ****. And again I was impressed by the music inspired by the 70s (inferno remix). This spectacular concert deceased made me a fan. <br /> <br /> Verdict: Highly recommended with a Capital H.
