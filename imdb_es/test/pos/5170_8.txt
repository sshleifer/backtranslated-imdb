I just saw it on the Hallmark channel. I was surprised by John Denver! This movie was full of clichés, but that's what is expected (a Christmas movie made for TV! Come on!) The performance is as good as any other 80's TV movie. The story is, as I said before, predictable and cliché, but it's still good. If you are looking for a Christmas movie, it will surely hurt you. <br /> <br /> I was also glad when I found out that it took place in Georgetown, Colorado. It is a true mountain town west of Denver. Very good, since this is my region of origin. <br /> <br /> I was never a big fan of John Denver (I always found him quite silly) but he was a decent actor. He is very good like the good guy who played in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see it, do it. I am sure that it will be activated again in 2007.
