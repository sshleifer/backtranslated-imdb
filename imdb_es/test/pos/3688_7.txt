I'm a big fan of Rupert Everett. I love Kathy Bates, so when I saw her available I decided to take a look. The synopsis did not tell you much. In some parts it was silly, moving and in others, some parts were completely hysterical. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is a fan of a personality of any kind will find some small identifying traits with the main character. (Of course, there are many who will not, but that's the point). <br /> <br /> If you like any of the actors, give them a watch but do not look for anything too dramatic, it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I could also mention that you can see how tall Rupert is. I mean, I knew he was 6'4 ", but he looks even more in this movie, he even seemed to be leaning a bit because of the height of the other characters in this, he's tall, I mean tall, and for you Rupert Fans there is a bare-chested scene ... WONDERFUL!
