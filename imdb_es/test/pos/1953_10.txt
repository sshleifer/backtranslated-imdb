Apparently this movie was based on a true story. However, I'm not sure how accurate it is. But it really reminded me that when I see that someone has been killed in the news, it's amazing how much it does not affect me. Sure, I think it's terrible, but honestly I do not care. I keep going It seems that murder is trivial now. This is what River's Edge shows. Nobody seems to really care about this girl and her death, not even the murderer. So what is the point? <br /> <br /> The killer in this story is John, and because of the large amount of the film he hides with another killer named Feck, played by Dennis Hopper. Feck is bigger, and you can see the generation gap. He says he loved the girl he killed. When he asks John if he loved the girl he killed, he simply replies, "She was fine." The film only seems to offer a solution: life is more important than death. The life of a character is saved, people have second chances and a lost case is killed. <br /> <br /> The acting is really good. After watching this movie, I could only come to the conclusion that Crispin Glover is a brilliant actor or a terrible actor. I still have no idea Although it was my main reason to see this movie. But Dennis Hopper clearly offers the best performance. <br /> <br /> Although fashion is really from the 80s and the characters sometimes mention current problems, I still think that River's Edge is as relevant today as ever. <Br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
