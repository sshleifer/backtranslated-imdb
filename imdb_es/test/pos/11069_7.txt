This movie is pretty good, it's really like a good wine, it improves the more you look at it. The rhythm is quite slow for such a high octane theme, but the cinematography is beautiful and surreal. There is a cool blue tint that "mounts" the entire movie. There is also a great performance in the interpretation of Gabriel Casseus of the character "Midget". He is phenomenal. Why does not this guy work anymore? If the movie had better support, it probably would have.
