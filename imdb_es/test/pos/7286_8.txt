It has become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie, I thought this movie was a good thriller. <br /> <br /> I could have had better production values, but what kept me going was the suspense and the turns. I had real reservations before watching this movie (due to the cover). I was afraid it was too bloody and bloody. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Although there are many parts of fear, there is also a lot of suspense and drama. <br /> <br /> The performance on Dead Line was better than what you would expect from a micro budget horror movie. The characters were believable <br /> <br /> The movie is really exciting and quite scary at times, so it makes you take a seat until you roll the final credits <br /> <br /> Because of its values ​​of production (the sound is not very good for example) 8/10.
