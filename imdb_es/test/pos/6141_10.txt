Although several Wirey Spindell scenes can be described as "on top". I thought it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of almost taboo twisted comedy. <br /> <br /> Wirey Spindell is a great movie with a great dialogue. I would not say that this movie is for everyone, but it's on my top 10 list. <br /> <br /> If you can see beyond your occasional offensive and see it for the movie that it is, I would. I hope you can see it in the same light as me.
