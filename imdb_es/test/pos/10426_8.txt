I LOVED THIS VIDEO, so I loved the romantic part with Colby and the girl ... Rachel (?) I asked her name ... honestly, I was only interested in them. I loved them in the movie. I want to see more movies like that. But please, there are no sadder endings where they can not be together! = (It made me cry!) But the romance between them The plot, the trauma, everything was great =) I liked Colby and Rachel the best. ha ha =) all about this movie was exciting to keep you glued to your seat. Because it sure was Honestly, my only personal need would be more focused between the couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent ending. I hated the end, a better one could have been more thought out, not the fact of forcing Coby to his death and Rachel to have a child. The ending would have killed the movie.
