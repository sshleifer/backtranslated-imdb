Wow, I loved this movie, this movie was full of plot twists, good acting, a great story and a surprising ending. To be completely honest, this movie was not too bloody, it contains some blood, but it was more psychological. I read it on the Internet: the movie cost $ 3000 and it was filmed in 8 days. Amazing!!! This is for someone who wants to think and loves to make great movies. What begins as a terrifying thriller slowly transforms into something a little more twisted, even a little more sinister. I can not say much without revealing plot points that this film exceeded my expectations
