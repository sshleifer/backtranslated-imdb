It seems that everyone wants to get in the car and say "Maha Go Go Go" ... The word is MACHA ........ I like "Mach" ..... It is pronounced maa - ka "... < br /> <br /> I grew up with this series in the early 70's here in Los Angeles on the last and VERY lamented channel 56 ... Before that, I was Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy), dating from 1963 in Ol ' KHJ TV Astro Boy was the first example of anime that we got here in the United States ... I liked anime as a child and I followed it until the end of the 80s, when by then it would become a series of very speaking heads animated. ", a phenomenon that has only gotten worse." Nuff said. <br /> <br /> As for "Speed ​​Racer", I really enjoyed the basics there, the POV shots, the cinematographic aspects of the live action skillfully adopted for animation ... That was pretty typical of most Japanese anime back then ... Graphic graphics, graphics, take note at some point of the for In that obviously the series was inspired by the film "Grand Prix" by Stanley Kramer (1966), especially in the new American credits ... <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, I have the original comics in which The series is based, so I know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> What were we doing about the animation besides the shit like Johnny Quest? ..... Th 'same ol' things that we had been doing since the 20's ... Ho-hum! <br /> <br /> I guess the real problem I had / I have with the way anime was shown / shown on American television is the ax work done in scripts, credits, etc. to "clean up" for the American audiences ... I will not go into other programs because we are talking about "Speed ​​here. <br /> <br /> Look at clowns like Peter Fernandez as one of the culprits here, since was 99% responsible for the rewrites of the series ... Not to mention the voice of Speed, Racer X and others ... Between him and the fools in Trans / Lux (Think Felix the Cat and the Powerful Hercules - hey! ) They took a very sophisticated show and dropped it at the level of Sesame Street, think of "Cruncher Bloch", "Forthebird Company", "Skull Duggery" ... If I continue, I will puke. <br /> <br /> This series dates from 40 or more years ago, but I, in it was sharp enough to feel insulted by the hindrance of this and other Japanese programs ... I mean it is obvious that someone is being killed, but either they eliminate it or overlook ....... Pleeeeeze! <br /> <br /> Good show - originally. Unfortunately, all the Most recent versions of the series have that aspect of CRAPPY "made in Korea", not to mention that they are nauseously "pc" in the content. Even the Japanese outsource their animations now ... <br /> <br /> Try to see the original Japanese opening on YouTube at some point ... It makes me shiver ... If only ... Oh well. Robert
