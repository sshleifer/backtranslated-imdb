I caught this for the first time a few nights ago on television. I expected to tune in only a few minutes, but I was intrigued by the movie. I ended up seeing everything and found it surprisingly compelling. The performance of the three American leaders was quite good, especially that of Alex Cord. He plays a gunman with a degree of vulnerability. Very different from how most of them are portrayed in westerns. He ended up in several situations where he was at the mercy of the bounty hunters. The final shooting between the three main and bad drivers was very good, as was the scene in which the doctor extracts a bullet from Clay McCord. Something frightening, but realistic. I must admit that, despite my initial doubts about seeing a "spaghetti western", I ended up enjoying this movie a lot. I would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.
