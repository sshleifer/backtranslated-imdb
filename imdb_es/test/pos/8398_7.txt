I see this movie without great expectations, I think everyone should do it. It's a great television series and, of course, we could not compare it with Gone with the Wind, but it's still nice to watch. It's also weird to see a different Scarlett. Joanne Whalley does not play Scarlett with passion and fire like Vivien Leigh, but I think Scarlett changes when she grows up. Do not expect much of this, just look, but do not look like: I think this would be horrible.
