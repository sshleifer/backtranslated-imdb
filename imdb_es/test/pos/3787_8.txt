SPOILERS DOWN <br /> <br /> `A Dog's Life 'was most notable for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other film from 1918, 'Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on a completely different brand of humor. His comedy of war specializes in surreal and exaggerated pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates creativity and an unprecedented mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker is flooded, the water level reaches the correct height so Chaplin can run his arcade with more success. In a later scene, the soldier dresses like a tree, a disguise that belies the ingenuity and stupidity of Chaplin. Naturally, when the enemy discovers his ruse, the soldier goes directly to the forest. The resulting chase is a visual marvel: Chaplin not only hides the soldier from the Germans, but also uses the forest to mask the soldier from the audience, so that the camouflaged soldier remains standing unlocked in the center of the picture, but somehow it remains invisible. All the time we thought that our little hero was pulling a fast one at the German army; To our delight, the joke is also in us. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
