I read the book before seeing the film and it left me emotionally exhausted, but I felt that it really transported me to Afghanistan, a culture I know very little about. I had high hopes for this movie and I was not disappointed. I saw him with someone who did not read the book and he also enjoyed it. They had to shorten some things in the movie, but it was a well-acted and well-filmed movie. It leaves you thinking about the movie long after it ends. He feels for the characters and their difficulties. I recommend this movie to those who like emotionally exhausting drama and want to experience Afghan culture. There are some disturbing scenes that are not suitable for children to see. It is a heavy drama that represents the horrors of life under a restrictive regime.
