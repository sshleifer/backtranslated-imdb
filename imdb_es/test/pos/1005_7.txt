In this TV special, Jon is the one who needs a life. The highlight of your day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging your sock drawer. Not content with this forever, Jon takes Garfield to a self-help group to meet people. How many people will be interested in a loner in his twenties, whose best friend is a cat? <br /> <br /> After several unsuccessful attempts to get a girl, including a dance scene that rivals David Brents' Flashdance merger MC Hammer in The Office (Disc is dead? says Jon), is more than surprised to find a beautiful girl who is as imbecile as himself. <br /> <br /> Naturally, they get on, but Garfield is worried that John will forget about him and would rather have children than a cat. Fortunately, Jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats. <br /> <br /> With a more sophisticated animation than the previous TV specials, this feels like a longer episode of Garfield and Friends.
