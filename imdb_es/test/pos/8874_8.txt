You will not see the meaning of the title until much later, but you will get the point in the first few minutes. This nominated directorial debut of Golden Globe (for actor) Danny DeVito, also playing Owen / Ned 'Little Ned' Lift, is an excellent film similar to Hitchcock about a man's hatred for his wife's book (she stole) and a man's hatred for his mother. Basically, Owen wants to be a good writer, like his teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), and was inspired by the stories of murders. Larry suggests that he watch a rather ironic film by Hitchcock, and that's when Owen has the idea of ​​killing Larry's ex-wife, Margaret (Kate Mulgrew of Star Trek Voyager). Owen is inspired by 'Strangers on a Train', exchanging murders, so Larry must kill Owen's horrible Momma (Oscar-nominated and Golden Globe Anne Ramsey). Larry was convinced that Owen killed Margaret, and also that he had to want to kill Owen's mom, but there is a happy ending when months later, both Larry and Owen take out books, mom died naturally and went on vacation with Beth Ryan . (Kim Greist) Also starring Rob Reiner as Joel and Oprah Winfrey. With funny moments, a great director / actor and his support, this is a comedy that must be seen. Very very good!
