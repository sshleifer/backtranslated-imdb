I found this movie in one of my old videos, after "Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster" (which should give you an idea of ​​its tone instantly) and I had not seen it in a long time, so I decided to watch it. I did not remember much about Rainbow Brite, except that I used to like caricature and it was cute. Most people feel the same for her. You probably do it for. <br /> <br /> Well, when the movie started, I was wondering if it was the right one! It did not fit in the mold of Rainbow Brite as he remembered it. But it turns out that she kicks her ass! This has to be the strangest animated movie of all! I can not believe that these characters were so popular (the series is not very different) while they are so bizzare. As soon as I saw this movie again, it became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to reveal too much. You just need to know that if you watch the movie in the video store, change it and watch it. No questions asked. You will receive a kick from it. Especially the character of the outrageous princess. And the robotic horse. And hypnotized sprites. <br /> <br /> If you can not tell, this is an 80s caricature that is really an undiscovered "head" movie, in disguise. Have fun!
