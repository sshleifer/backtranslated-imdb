I went to see this movie without expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised by the team of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. It was a fast-paced movie and the hour and a half passed fast. This certainly will not win any Academy Award, but it was a change of pace for Mr. De Niro. He is good at comedy. In general I enjoyed it.
