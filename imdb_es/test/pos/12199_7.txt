Once again, there are unpleasant government agencies that do not stop at anything to prevent the public from knowing some momentous events. In this case, the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the ecology of the planet. Although the creature is not E.T. It seems that he befriends a young man, who protects him at all costs, without realizing that he is only a baby of the species and that he will grow much more. and more bad This series 2005 had much in its favor. It's family drama, science fiction, thriller with more than a few funny moments. The characters are credible, well acted and well photographed. The show has the attention. Of course, as with any science fiction program, the suspension of disbelief must be achieved. And I think it is here. Unfortunately, the series crashed after season one, so we never got a resolution. Enraged. There is a general comment that I feel is worth doing here. Many television networks and / or movie distribution companies cancel, quite arbitrarily, apparently excellent television series. The sci-fi particularly smart. Now there may be some very good reasons for this, although audiences are treated with the greatest disdain and are rarely explained. This in itself is annoying. What really gets my goat is that, once the series is canceled, they broadcast everything they have, on a DVD, in an obvious attempt to milk the dairy cow as much as possible. For the previous viewers of the series that is fine, do you know what they are in, but? Many of these unfinished series end up in a cliffhanger. Two that come to mind immediately are "Surface" and "Odyssey 5". If you've heard good things about the series and you have not seen it, are you going to buy the damn DVD and end up with an unsolved plot problem? It makes me angry a lot !! I enjoyed immensely with "Surface" and I did not realize that the poor characters would end up in a situation that seemed totally untenable. and we will never know what happened next. I think there should be a prominent announcement on all these DVD topics, in the sense that the story is not finished. Today I check the purchases of television series (IMDB is an excellent starting point) to find out if a "complete" series is really complete or not. The buyer be careful.
