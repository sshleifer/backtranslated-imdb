I enjoyed this movie a lot when it first premiered, and every time I've seen it since then. Political drama is effective, if not especially new or inspired. The decades since the release of the film have shown that the willingness to reduce costs at the expense of public safety is definitely not something imagined by a screenwriter. <br /> <br /> However, I think the most impressive element of this movie is the performance of Jack Lemmon. It is absolutely amazing to see him work. He has the gift of being able to communicate so much, sometimes without saying a word. The next time you see this movie, check Jack's face when he does not say anything. He does not need to talk (or, what is worse, to dock) to let him know what is going through his mind. <br /> <br /> I call this a spoiler, because of the impression it made on me the first time. saw the film: in the last scene of Lemmon in the film, while lying on the floor, feels a slight vibration. The terror in his eyes is one of the most terrifying images I've seen in any movie. It is a perfect performance, because it instantly transmits the threat that is about to happen: if the character of Jack is so terrified, there is certainly something terrible that is about to happen. And he does it
