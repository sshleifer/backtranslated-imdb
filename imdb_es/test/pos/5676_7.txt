When I read the synopsis, 3 people lost in the wild battle against a huge crocodile, did not exactly attract me. It seemed like the typical horror formula of a yawning movie about a group of people stalked by a monster, except in this case there are only three of them, so we would not even get the macabre 'joy' of seeing them be eliminated one by one. <br /> <br /> However, I saw it (I could not sleep, nothing else to do) and it turned out to be much better than expected. The performance is excellent, the atmosphere tense and really gives you the rare feeling of a low budget winner. <br /> <br /> The horror as it should be done. First quality cinema. It's not perfect but it's worth seeing. I give him a 7.
