An impressive work of art. You can see each image of the movie and see its beauty. First of all I would like to say that "when I saw the helmets of the German soldiers I understood that from here" Star Wars have been inspired. The scene where they kill the baby is terrifying and when I saw it I did not like it. But when the movie was over, I thought about that scene and changed my mind and thought that in World War II that was exactly what the Germans did. <br /> <br /> The scene of the ice battle is one of the best scenes of war I've seen (if not the BEST). In this way, this film combines music and is incredibly impressive. the visual images are really excellent. Then, Prokofiev's score is one of the most famous sound tracks in history and I thought it was one of the best. <br /> <br /> What else can you say then a work by art.Eisenstein has created an impressive masterpiece, a propaganda film and a beautiful work of art. I am very happy because I have just received the criteria established by Eisenstein.
