Every time I hear the voice of Karen Carpenter, there is an old familiar feeling of the 70's blues. What a beautiful and mature voice he had. The role of Cynthia Gibb in the lead role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better option. This is a tear-jerking movie that does a good job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard, but also the personal struggles Karen faced and her illness with. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very well done. However, it turned out that Karen Carpenter, there was a time when she was very special and brought great joy to her fans and music lovers. Even if you were not a fan of Carpenter, this is a good story that shows how great talent can be a victim of societal pressures.
