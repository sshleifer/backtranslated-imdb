There are so many '10 Best' lists that could easily fit in "The Dead": Better drunk screen, Better literary adaptation, Better use of music not written specifically for the movie, Better use of poetry, Better screen discourse, Better cast of assemble and Finally, maybe, Best movie ever made. This was John Huston's last and best film, adapted by his son Tony from the James Joyce story and set on the night of the Feast of the Epiphany in Dublin in 1904. It is limited, to a large extent, to a stage, home of the Sisters of Morkan, and not much happens in conventional 'dramatic' terms. They entertain their guests; There is singing, dancing, recitations and a lot of talk, but when you watch this movie you can not imagine any other place where you would prefer to be than in this company. <br /> <br /> Finally, of course, it's about much, much more. It's about love, loss and repentance, those stable pillars of great drama. In the final scenes of the film, the tenor Bartell D'Arcy, (Frank Patterson), sings a song, "The girl of Aughrim" that evokes in the mind of Gretta, (Anjelica Huston), Gabriel's wife, (Donal McCann ), the ghost of his first and probably the greatest love, a boy who died with all the certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen, and suddenly Gabriel realizes that he has never met his wife and that It has been the great love of his life, after all. Emotionally, these scenes are incredibly powerful, first as Gretta recounts the circumstances of her lover's death and then how the voice in Gabriel's head sums up her own feelings. This is a great cinema, the monologues superbly delivered by Huston and McCann. <br /> <br /> But all the performances are extraordinary. This is a set game of the highest level and while it would be ridiculous to select one artist over another, the screen has always given us a drunk more pleasant, great or convincing than Donal Donnelly or poetry has been delivered with such passion Sean Sean McClory, (the IRA man in "The Quiet Man"), brings his reading of Lady Gregory's translation of 'Donal Og' here? Of course, a greater emotion must be added to the knowledge that Huston was near death when he made this film that seems to me the culmination of his life's work. Death may be its central theme, but watching this movie is a life-enhancing experience.
