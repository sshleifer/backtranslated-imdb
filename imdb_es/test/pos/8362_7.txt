The journey back in time to the past is, at best, tenuous as a subject. In this episode, a man who has been thinking about the possibility, is at the date and place of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He tries everything he can think of in the short time available to him with predictable results. Of course, he thinks he's crazy enough. He is arrested and eventually remanded to the same man he is trying to stop. Serling was bright enough to allow him to return to the present, but is the present the same? This is a kind of precursor to "The Tunnel of Time," where weekly time travelers had the same task, surpassing what had already happened. Unfortunately, the implications of the distortion of time and future always deny the result. Unless you have something like "The sound of thunder" by Ray Bradbury.
