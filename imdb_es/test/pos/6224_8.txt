I guess it depends on when you actually see the film for the first time that your impression is shaped as it is. <br /> <br /> I saw him as a kid on TV in 1973, when he was "The Stranger" and I loved it. That was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality, when programs like "Search", "UFO" and "6M $ Man" showed a 12-year-old child what the world could have in his future. Adventure and technology. <br /> <br /> You have to watch shows only once and that's when the network issued them. The only way people could cut out your shows was by making their own parody; They could not take their program and add their own comments about it. <br /> <br /> I did not know what this concept of "pilot" was. I watched the movie and expected Stryker to come home; I did not know there was a possibility that it would continue for more than two hours. <br /> <br /> Back then, would you understand what so many people hate about the movie now? I doubt it because I do not remember it as such. Now I understand? Not really to understand the story, one should not see it from his perspective, but from that of the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> If one is looking like an American, it may be funny the lack of security in a police state ... but if one is a subject in that state, then compliance could be expected and security may be less. When things are supposed to be perfect, perfect to an extreme degree, the perfect thing is that you should not hesitate, then you probably do not question yourself so quickly when things are out of order. <br /> <br /> The subplots of the films are interesting, like the old man who remembers the previous moment but observes his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere. Or that the police state values ​​knowledge to some extent because they are careful how they control or damage their mental capacity. <br /> <br /> These days, you probably know exactly what the movie is about before you see it. Much of the suspense, the surprise is lost. But the duo between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the film is a perfect exchange if one considers that this film was made during the Cold War and the greatest fear of astronauts is that it has crashed in the USSR. You get away from the movie a lot before it becomes clear that that possibility is the least of your worries. <br /> <br /> This is the main difference between "The Stranger" and "Doppelganger". The latter can be considered timeless, since any comment he has about the USSR is comparatively minor and is lost at the beginning of the film. In the first, those links are through the film, supposedly directly at the beginning and then as one variation of theme after another. <br /> <br /> Everything said, despite my good memory for the movie, it's pretty easy to see that I would not have done it in series. Every week, Stryker made friends, Benedict chased them, Stryker ran away. Eventually, Benedict's society would get rid of him. Someone else would pick up the chase. A routine would be developed. There could be a knock on something new, maybe another member of the Stryker mission crew would show up, but it probably would not be enough to keep the show. <br /> <br /> If one comes in with the knives that others have used to trim the film, they will most likely also cut it out. But if one remembers that this was done during the Cold War and the fears and estimates of the other side during that time, of what the popular environment contained for the viewer, then they can find some entertaining and intellectual topics.
