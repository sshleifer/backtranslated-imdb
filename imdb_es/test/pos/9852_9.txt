I've heard about this documentary for so long that I knew I needed to take the time to see it. As a documentary it is very well done, since it has a neutral observing vision of its experience. There are no voices in off, nor interviews. It's honest. It's true. It is also humiliating. Two comments really stayed with me after the movie. One was how children are told not to become American children who wear baggy pants, and how in Africa there is time but not money, but in the United States there is money but there is no time. The biggest impact was how the children were hungry for education and how one of the children was totally relocated to go to school. I saw this movie with a high school sophomore who said he was annoyed to see how the kids were taken to their new life without any real guidance to the United States. He also said that he knew so many American teenagers who simply can not appreciate how blessed their lives are in the United States. I would agree with him on both accounts. A strong movie that will leave a person thinking about many things.
