Maybe I'm predisposed because the F-16 is my favorite fighter plane, although the F-14 is probably the second or third, but I liked this movie. The sequels (Iron Eagle II and III) are not up to the performance and the plot, but the first, together with Top Gun, has excellent flight and music, along with reasonable arguments and acting. II and III clearly have much less of a "flight budget", but their main drawback is plot and performance. I suspect that the relative fame and popularity of Iron Eagle compared to Top Gun is almost entirely a reflection of the fame and popularity of Jason Gedrick compared to Tom Cruise. Another advantage (for me) is a very brief appearance by Shawnee Smith. 7/10
