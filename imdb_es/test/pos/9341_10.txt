Stars and planets must have all been in the correct alignment, the day THRILLER was conceived. The Michael Jackson album was killing the charts, John Landis still had a lot of goodwill built from his genre image "An American Werewolf in London," (not to mention his classic comedies ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS) and the choreographer Michael Peters creating some of the most innovative and influential pieces for the music videos of that period. <br /> <br /> Not before or since then a single film illuminated, exploited or underlined the incredible talent of MJ or the more "otherworldly" aspects of his person as THRILLER, the most successful long format video in the world (if not officially the first), and the most remembered with love. It is also the most expensive at that time, but every penny and every part of the talent behind its creation and execution is on the screen. And how would it not be complete without the "rap" of the original song, provided by the great Vincent Price, to add even more cachet to the chills that are already there? <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since the glory days of one of the best artists in the world, but no one can take away the outstanding achievements of man, of which this is probably the most memorable. If you do not believe it, remember: Halloween is coming. I will not be surprised at all when, like other Halloweens before several decades, it appears in some of the special functions of Saturday Night Creature. <br /> <br /> As it will happen next year, and a year after that ....
