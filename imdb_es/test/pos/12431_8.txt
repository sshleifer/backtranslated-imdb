A beautiful woman, a virgin forest, a consanguineous monster man, a super sweet monster truck, a zombie killer brother on the road and 2 friends ... an anal challenger, a very sensitive nerd and the other a teenage and evil fool. Throw them all together with a dash of Jeepers Creepers, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Road Trip and you'll have Monster Man. A hilarious horror / comedy comedy that never sets out to "say something". It is a party of simple and direct laughter. Unpretentious and well done, this horror comedy is in your heart, a movie of friends. This movie offered some hilarious and disgusting pieces. I highly recommend it to fear fans who are looking to entertain themselves.
