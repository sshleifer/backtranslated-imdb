It has been recorded that John Ford made the "blockbuster" movies so that he could afford to do the "little" movies he loved so much. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his little films. The shooting to the site, the cars, the intricate work with the horses and the inclusion of the Indian plains are trademarks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the influence of the great Russian director is seen in this film. The supporting cast, including Ward Bond, Russell Simpson and Jane Darwell, are excellent, as are the many supporting characters that Ford used, including his brother (the drummer). While Ben Johnson won a deserving Oscar for The Last Picture Show, his co-star, Harry Carey, Jr. did not reach that height. Despite the fact that his father, Carey, Sr. became an important man of the West in the first Ford films, Carey, Jr. spent most of his career in supporting roles. For fans of John Ford, and for fans of western movies, this is a must.
