I saw this movie tonight in a preview and it was fantastic. He does well to portray the problems that the average high school student is subject to. <br /> <br /> I left the film feeling dazed and sad, but grateful that this film has the opportunity to raise awareness in its hearings on these issues (intimidation, rape, suicide and depression). <br /> <Br /> It's a fantastic Australian movie. <br /> <br /> Go see it. <br /> <br /> Support it. <br /> <br /> Learn from her.
