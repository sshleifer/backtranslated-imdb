In 1982, a small film entitled MAKING LOVE surprised the audience with its frank and open description of a romantic love story that turned out to be about two men. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for years for a good old fashioned romance between two men; LAST DAYS is all that and more. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's soapy, melodramatic, full of clich√©s and pretty corny. That is what makes it so wonderful. There's nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word. <br /> <br /> Regarding the issue of religion, people feel it, but these things happen and they are happening to homosexuals. People even now. It is not just the Mormon church that rejects its gay members. Gay people in all religions have faced harsh judgment and rejection. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It has a perfect blend of a fantasy romance based on the reality of the characters' everyday lives. If I could give more than ten stars, I would. Good love stories never go out of style; The great love stories like the LAST DAYS are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It was time!
