My two daughters (ages 11 and 13) and I were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie last night. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and fun this movie was. David Duchovny was very attractive as a male leader and Minnie Driver gave him a generally competent performance. Some of the scenes laugh out loud, especially a scene that Minnie Driver has with a "transplant" partner. I liked the fact that it was a movie I could watch with my children and I was not ashamed of any scenes. Everyone in the cinema laughed and had fun. Thumbs up Bonnie Hunt!
