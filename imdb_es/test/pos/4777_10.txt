This 8-minute gem is not only timeless, it's a cartoon landmark. It's Mickey's third caricature, and one of the best too. It's a cartoon landmark because it was the first with sound. And, my God, even after more than 70 years is very good and gives a real additional weight to the narrative. The animation in black and white is excellent, and the characteristics of the characters are convincing enough. The music is wonderful, I love the soundtrack, it adds to the fun of the caricature, no matter how thin the story sometimes is. And the cartoon is fun! So many memorable moments, like cow teeth used as a xylophone and its udder like a bagpipe. The characters are also attractive, Mickey and Minnie, two emblematic Disney characters, are very well expressed by Walt Disney, and Pete plays well as "the villain of the piece". In short, "Steamboat Willie" is just an eternal gem that everyone should see at least once. 10/10 Bethany Cox
