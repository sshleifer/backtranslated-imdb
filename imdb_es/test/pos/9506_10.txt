As other reviews have pointed out, there are some videos missing from this collection, but what is on this record is overwhelming. There are two separate soundtracks, an original recording and a completely new performance version. Any new music from the residents is welcome, and I guess for a first time listener, the new version may be friendlier to the ears, but I prefer the original recordings (probably simply because they are "the originals"). It's amazing, all new and old videos are interesting, with live videos that are probably the least interesting of what is offered (although fragments of live recordings hidden as Easter eggs are extremely welcome.) This is not an option for tenants, it is an essential collection.
