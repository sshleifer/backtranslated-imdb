It's interesting that someone has made a comparison of "Fifth Missile" with the Star Trek episode. It should be noted that the original episode of Star Trek TV in which the crew of the Enterprise suffers a space madness while orbiting the planet Si 2000 is titled "The Naked Time", not the "Naked Now". "Naked Now" refers to the first regular episode of Star Trek The Next Generation in which Enterprise-D encounters a scientific ship. This episode, however, makes reference to the original series "Naked Time" and is based on it. <br /> <br /> Now, towards the Firth missile. While the reactions of the crew in the Star Trek episodes were based on those similar to alcohol intoxication, the condition of the crew aboard the Montana was caused by a much more serious situation, namely, the paint fumes emitted by the defective finish of the bulkhead. There are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than between a team that has responsibilities as serious as a team in a submarine ballistic missile, and of course this is what makes the film so exciting and so exciting. The plot is very credible. At the same time, this movie, along with "Crimson Tide", "The Day After", "By Dawn's Early Light", "The Hunt For Red October", "Ice Station Zebra" and many other similar movies give us a lot of information about the ease with which things can go wrong and how easy it might be for a nuclear holocaust to begin. Fortunately, such an event has not happened and (God willing) such an event will not happen.
