by the way it looks in the other comments made, it seems that many people did not understand the subject. It does not focus on zombies, in fact they are not zombies at all, they are a device regenerated by the magician to scare the girls, their main focus is Meg Tilly, who wants to help him finish the fight. work that died while doing it in the first place, and what you get is a great movie with an incredible ending, it's hard to find it in the video, but occasionally it appears on HBO or Cinamax, take a look, I gave it a 10 and I highly recommend it.
