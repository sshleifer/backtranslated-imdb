I can honestly tell you that this movie is the most incredible movie in history. If you fancy a comedy, I recommend this movie! So, here is the summary. There is this girl (Nikki) who is fourteen and a half years old and goes on vacation with her father (Andre) whom she has not seen in the last two years. She hopes that the holidays are totally boring, until she meets this boy (Ben), who is much older than her. Then, to try to impress him, she says that she is not on vacation with her father, but with her lover. This is a hysterical movie from beginning to end, and I strongly suggest it. So rent it and enjoy !!!
