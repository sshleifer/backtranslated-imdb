I have to admit that I liked this movie a lot more than I expected. Will Smith has that perfect amulet that you can not help but like. The plot was a small twist in the basic romantic comedy, something reminiscent of Jane Austen's "Emma". This guy, Kevin James, has a real talent for comics and physical comedy. I have never seen his television show, but he was very good in this movie. Amber Valletta was good enough. I can not remember why she was a rich celebrity in this movie, but if she was supposed to be an actress or model, then the casting might have left something to be desired. I enjoyed Julie Ann Emery and I wish I had a bigger part. But, saving the best for last, Eva Mendes more or less stole the show. Her beauty and charm, and just the right amount of distance had me stuck to the screen every time she was there. I hope to see more of her in the future. This movie is definitely worth checking out.
