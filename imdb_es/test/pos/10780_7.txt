Talk Radio sees a man accidentally trip through life, in fact the American Dream, of any daily work he has in a store; to the presenter of a local radio program before going directly to the same job and then syndicated throughout the country. It is a role that he adopts because of his own aggression and natural manners, a maddening approach to freedom of expression when he attacks almost everyone, including those who often call him to agree with him or congratulate him. His role as a man who complains about everything good, bad, right, wrong, political, religious, moral and immoral is something that people seem to assume in a way; that of 'is entertaining and worth tuning', but also on a plane of rejection and antagonism? two things born of the same things that apparently are encouraged in professional working life in the Western world. This, towards a man when he reaches the top of his game through the American Dream and deals with freedom of expression when people address a man, but do everything possible to do what he says. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio begins with a montage of tall, imposing buildings in a commercial area of ​​Dallas, Texas. The skyscrapers are photographed from an angle, and rise above the viewer, in addition to everything else in the general vicinity, as this one-man voice travels through the images, issuing statements and information about elements as these monolithic buildings dominate the screen. They are the physical representation of capitalism, while the voice of what we learn to be a radio DJ is the oral representation of the free west; Personal discourse and opinions on everything and especially. Stone will end his film in exactly the same way he started it, although the film is nothing more than a circular trip of any kind, since the characters experience monumental changes both in what they see and in their general way of life. Rather, the intakes of the buildings act as an anchor around which the study is observed. There are the ideologies and ideas of a way of life; people subscribe to them, but they do more harm than good; before re-establishing that this proud way of life still exists and will continue to exist to produce the kind of people on display in the film until someone or something drastically changes things. <br /> <br /> The DJ is Barry Champlain, a man with a radio program at a local Texas station that deals with almost anything. Champlain's somewhat carefree attitude towards a fairly explosive content is set when he flies from a call with an intolerant man who recently visited the Holocaust museum to a young drug addict whose girlfriend allegedly overdosed and mocked a pizzeria. For us, the content is quite impressive; for these people, everything seems to be as always, which generates some serious seeds of both doubt and horror in our minds, the newcomers to all this. <br /> <br /> What the Barry show is about, nobody ever seems to really set: everything and nothing. In fact, time is taken in the form of jingles or dialogues in which the programs immediately before and after the Champlain program are on specific topics; Gardening, for example, and is organized by people who speak quietly and methodically, who, I'm sure, do not change in a random or extreme way to another all the time, increasing the stakes. One wonders what Barry's clink is, the kind that is played at lunchtime during someone else's show: "Coming soon, the Barry Champlain show! With the village moron and the psychotic junkies!" In fact, the introductory piece of his program has a tone of fact, a shout to the audience, as it is accompanied by a noisy rock song. <br /> <br /> The success of Barry comes to the proposal of national syndication. It is born of confrontation and a relationship based on the contempt it has for its listeners and that they have for him. The promotion of the material and the increase of the bets should question how far they think they can take this, and if this progress on a track by entertainment is really worth it. It is when the program reaches this level of transmission when Barry seems to take off for the first time in his life of transmission, when an alleged serial rapist calls and leaves almost everyone stunned. At this point, the camera stops at Barry and, as a depth of focus, encompasses those same imposing and lofty buildings with which the film began, which are outside the window, directly behind Barry. They remain tall and proud. Specifically, of the ideologies in which they have been built and this advancement of freedom of expression in the extension of Barry's program nationwide as a man climbs the ladder of his profession, he suddenly collides with the kind of content that is offered. Everything reaches a point too far, and that with freedom, at least it should have a sense of clarity instead of mere pleasure. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone made Talk Radio in the midst of a fascinating and explosive shooting period he had in the late eighties. At this time, he produced a series of very well received films in a fairly short space of time; Starting with one of my favorite war movies in Platoon, before continuing with the great Wall Street and finally ending with the 1991 JFK. You could even say that this career continued until the mid-nineties with Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio is like its main character in the sense that it is loud, rumbling, austere and confrontational. It is not anti-capitalism, but focuses on drawing a line between what is perceived as entertainment and what is going too far for the sake of popularity and wealth. Talk Radio is undoubtedly a movie that sticks in your memory.
