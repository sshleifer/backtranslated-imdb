I really love this movie, I saw it for the first time when I was working in a video store. When I went to buy it, they told me I was exhausted and I could not ask for it, so today I thought I would look for it. and then I found it, they put it in Spain on DVD with the name "Something More Than Friends" and can buy it in English and Spanish on the DVD ... I hope this helps ... I know how hard it is to find movies that we They love that they have not been launched in the US market. the best of luck ... oh For more information here is a place to search ... HTTP://www.zonadvd.com, I think it goes for 10 usd dollars on eBay too.
