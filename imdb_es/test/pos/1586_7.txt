A nut, but fun little fun. You have to see it from the beginning to follow what is happening, but every report to the earth has its own joke. Pretty good special effects for a very low budget science fiction t.v. show. It's fun to see it. More or less in the vein of Red Dwarf, but even more low budget. For someone who has just arrived in the middle of one of the episodes, we must realize that these guys are all incompetent, because they have climbed the scale of command, because the other officers died. Also, the main types are from the laundry body, so they have clothes on everything. If you like Red Dwarf, you probably like this. Tv slightly different concept, in the sense that everything you see is the Commander's report every day. <br /> <br /> It would be better if this were explained more, not only at the beginning of the first episode, but then it was quite difficult. Find out what had happened in Red Dwarf as well, if you had not been told.
