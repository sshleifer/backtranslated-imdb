The story involves an ancient demon being thrown over a small town on Halloween night. In all my life I have never seen such a cheesy movie, but it is so entertaining that you can forgive its bad acting, effects, direction and script. This is the best movie created for the Halloween season since the original Halloween. And when they present the character of Linnea Quigley for the first time, she remains naked in the shower for about 5 minutes. My God, there is simply nothing better than this. Hurry and buy this tape immediately. 5/10
