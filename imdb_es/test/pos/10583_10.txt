I just bought this movie last night and I love it. Everyone did a great performance on it, especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Margera. The whole plot was great, and as Dunn said in the DVD extras, it seemed like he was reliving it all over again. This movie has made my first place in my favorite movies! I can not stop playing the scenes again and again, just to see them again. I've never done that with any other movie. I would definitely recommend it to other people to see it, because it's a great movie, and if you like Bam Margera, it's a perfect movie for you! The small montages that show between each scene are simply great. I think those have to be my favorite parts of the movie. They are very sad, with music mostly from the band "HIM", which of course is my favorite band.
