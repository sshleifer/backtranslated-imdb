My God, this is kind of funny. Yes, it is childish in the extreme, but also quite ingenious ("Here's the page with all the wines." "I'm afraid it's a little early." "Well, what are you doing so far?") And the fighting sequences They are insurmountable. Despite what I've heard, the laughter * do * continue to come, and at a surprisingly generous pace. The mere comic abilities of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson help keep it incredibly fun. pulling out every drop of comedy from the script. I can only compare it to "Fear and disgust in Las Vegas": either you think the movie is hysterical or you do not find it at all; the same applies here. It's probably the funniest British movie since "Withnail and I", but to say it's an acquired taste is something like a gross underestimate (sic).
