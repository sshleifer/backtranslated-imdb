County Kingdom, Vermont, 1927. Noel Lord (Rip Torn) lives with his Indian companion, Bangor (Tantoo Cardinal) in the area where a large dam will be built; Noel, however, is not willing to give up his land, and will have to fight against the company of dams to prevent the County from being destroyed. <br /> <br /> "Where the rivers flow to the north" is an exciting contemplative story driven by the memorable performances of Rip Torn (recently seen in the small but juicy role of Louis XV in "Marie Antoinette" by Sofia Coppola ) and Tantoo Cardinal ("Dances With Wolves", "Smoke Signals"). Director Jay Craven (who also co-wrote the screenplay with Don Bredes, based on Howard Frank Mosher's novel) and cinematographer Paul Ryan created this powerful story with unique and contemplative rhythms / visuals, which remind me of Terrence's best moments Malick and John Huston. It is an underestimated piece of the independent period of the first half (electric) of the 90s, generally considered as the burlesque emergence of Quentin Tarantino ("Pulp Fiction" is a masterpiece, but man suffers from Orson Welles syndrome), the disturber of Todd Solondz. suburbs, the dark vision of Danny Boyle from the United Kingdom (not to mention the movie "Beach" with DiCaprio) ... Jay Craven should also be more considered in the lists of the great indie filmmakers. He has been leading a respectful and discreet career and it is always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his. <br /> <br /> My vote: 8/10.
