I enjoyed this movie very much. It effectively combines humor, fantasy and some moments of horror with a solid cinematic effort by Higuchinsky. Bright images and a very original story about spirals. My only complaint is that he had his boring moments and was not as daring as he could have been. Still, I give this a solid 8 out of 10. The USA. UU They should take note of this and other excellent Japanese horror / fantasy films that have recently appeared and have them available on the Region 1 DVD. Actually, Asian cinema in general has some of the best movies that have gone unnoticed by the public American because they are hard to find. I recommend people who look for these treasures, they are hard to find, but once you find them, you will be glad you found them.
