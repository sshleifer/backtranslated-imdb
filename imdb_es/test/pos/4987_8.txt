"The Violent Men" marked the best collaboration of Rudolph Maté with Glenn Ford in an intensely satisfying drama of primitive resistant justice. <br /> <br /> Ford is John Parrish, a former cavalry captain who is eager to get married and start a new life. His girlfriend Caroline Vail (May Wynn) is desperate to move east, and watch him sell his spread to Lee Wilkison (Edward G. Robinson). <br /> <br /> Is Parrish not a farmer? But do you understand that there is something big building in the valley? In the army, they used to call it 'enemy pressure'. First, does Cole Wilkison (Brian Keith) come back from Texas to help his brother run Anchor? So, a strong kid with a smart gun (Richard Jaeckel) appears on Wilkison's payroll? So, all the small ranchers are forced to retire, obtaining the same type of offers? Parrish saw himself running as they did, or he stood up and fought. <br /> <br /> But can you easily deal with a man who sends six assassins to shoot an old man in the back? Can you easily argue with a man who started with a few acres of land and now owns virtually the entire valley? <br /> <br /> Everything that the grass and sand meant for the former Confederate Army officer in the last three years? Was it a place to regain your health? By habit of following a council, Parrish says: "What happens in this valley is not my business." And to the great disappointment of the remaining ranchers and farmers, who press him to stay, he decides to accept Wilkison's offer to fulfill the promise he made to his fiancée. <br /> <br /> When Lee's younger brother, Cole, made the wrong move, trying to push Parrish to make a decision by lynching one of his ranch hands, Parrish became angry and warned the two brothers that Will he stay and fight against them for the privilege of leaving them alone? <br /> <br /> Brian Keith plays the traitorous brother behind the murder ... Does he dream of having a position and respect when running an Anchor day? <br /> <br /> Does Lee's ambitious wife, Martha (Barbara Stanwyck), hate herself and her husband? Stanwyck plays the role of a loving wife who can not stand the touch of her husband's hands. <br /> <br /> Edward G. Robinson is good enough as the invalid Anchor owner who promised the whole valley to his wife, not knowing that she is having an affair with her younger brother ?? <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is too sensitive as the unsociable adult daughter, aware of her mother's burdens. <br /> <br /> "The Violent Men" uses widescreen technology to emphasize the reach and power of this heartbreaking action drama, is it a perfect example of the most enduring classics of the genre?
