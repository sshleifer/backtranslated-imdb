I had never heard of Silverwing, then I saw it in Toon Disney and I instantly loved it! I also believe that it is not just for children, and that people of all ages would enjoy it. It has a great plot, great effect and great characters. I will always love the program, and I heard that it will soon be released on DVD all over the world, and I will get it! I have not read any of the books, but I intend to do so. The show deserves a 10 out of 10, and I hope the books are just as good. Well, that's all I have to say. But I still have 2 lines that I have to fill, so ... who do you think is the best character? Mine is Shade, and my second favorite is Marina.
