Focus is another great movie starring William H. Macy. The first time I discovered Macy was in Fargo, I've seen some of his films and he has not cheated me yet. Macy is the archetype of "good boy with something to hide". In Focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a hardworking loyal worker, who shelters his disabled mother at home. The scene develops after the Second World War, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company that is basically anti-Semitic. After you accidentally hire a woman of Jewish descent, you are asked to buy a pair of glasses to improve your poor vision. <br /> <br /> Incredibly, the simple fact of buying glasses has great repercussions in his life and that of Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by a great Laura Dern). As the film unravels, Newman will begin to see a completely different world, where being Jewish is similar to being an animal. <br /> <br /> The film is disturbing because of the way it shows that being a racist was quite normal. The chilling thought is that in some places, it probably still is.
