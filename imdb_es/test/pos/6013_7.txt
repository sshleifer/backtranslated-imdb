* Al Capone's whereabouts <br /> <br /> * Who shot JFK? <br /> <br /> * Cynthia Gibb gets the "Gypsy" part in the TV remake <br /> <br /> These are some of the great unsolved mysteries of the twentieth century. How else can I say it, except that I thought she was incredibly horrible? Mannequins way, reactionary bad acting (that is, that blank and stoic look while he co-stars in the scene speaks) and a singing voice that most voice coaches would describe as "mediocre". But she is incredibly beautiful and, after all, was not that what the Gypsy character is about? Taking advantage of your appearance, have not you cut the mustard in the talent department? <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... Bette is fantastic. Whether I'm playing or playing Mama Rose, it works anyway, and I thought Rosalind Russell was as exciting as the drywall in the original. Peter Riegart as "Herbie" is the perfect complement to Bette's mom, and it's the mid-temperature porridge between Midler's hot plate and Gibb's cold porridge. Riegart is right. <br /> <br /> A final shout for the man responsible for Cher's next decades of jokes: Bob Mackie. The drag queens would kill for the glitz and glamor shown here. Everything comes with sequins and beads! <br /> <br />
