When I was a child I remembered this program, but I thought that now as an adult, the program could be a little outdated. Well, yes, but for me that makes the show more retro (and the music very funky). <br /> <br /> This show is mainly well written. I think it's a farce that this program was canceled after a season, especially when this program was more popular than the Incredible Hulk. <br /> <br /> I think fans should ignore the poor special effects and enjoy the stories. <br /> <br /> The following sentence contains spoilers: my favorite episode as a child was when there were two spiderman who fought with each other in an interesting way. A similar idea was invented in Spiderman 3, the movie. I liked the ideas in this television show, some will hate it. I think Stan Lee was not a fan.
