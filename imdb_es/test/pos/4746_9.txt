Roy Scheider is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood, but who is he? The Seven-Ups is one of the best police movies, even today, and is surpassed only by the series of McQueen's Bullitt and Dirty Harry, which is not bad company. There are three things that seem to be a good cop movie: credible script with excellent acting, big car chase scenes and some heavy action. This movie has all three and the scene of the car chase is better than Harry the Dirty. Scheider plays the head of a group of policemen so that the bad guys in NY are sentenced to seven years or more; Hence the name Seven-Ups. In general, it does not depend on Dirty Harry or Bullitt, but it is much better than all the police movies made since the Dirty Harry series. 9/10.
