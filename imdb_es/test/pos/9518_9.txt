This is another jewel of Daniele Thompson's pen: in fact, that same year (1999) he wrote and directed La Buche, the first of the three writer / director credits so far. Belle Maman is, above all, "French", whatever it means that is, of course, different things for different people. The premise is simple: at the altar where she marries Mathilde Seigner, the groom, Vincent Lindon, sees for the first time his mother, Catherine Deneuve, and suffers what the French call a coup known as love at first sight . . In theory, the story is 1) too much at that time and there, assuming he canceled the wedding or 2) just the beginning, as it continues with the wedding and, therefore, lives a lie until it is resolved in a way or other. Thompson veers off to # 2, but not without hitting us with the strange plot on the road like, for example, the lesbian mother who smokes Deneuve Line Renaud's cigars (in real life, if someone cares, Renaud has a relationship long-term with Stephane Audran, who co-stars here) and throws a brilliant set in a luxurious room for men at the wedding reception, which takes the form of a hilarious song and dance. The consummate writer who is Thompson also likes comedy with dramas like the brilliant climactic scene in which Vincent finally expresses his feelings for Deneuve in a family reunion while simultaneously destroying the joint. This is one to savor. And again.
