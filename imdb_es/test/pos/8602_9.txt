I did not really focus on the larger genocidal aspects of the story (although the horrible images at the beginning are very powerful). I was really captivated by the human story of the girl and her family. Imagine living your life without knowing if you have a time bomb inside you. It really hurt to see Yasuko being rejected as "contaminated" by the bomb. The image that I have left is when Yasuko stands before the mirror, combing her hair, observing him in silence and leaving in groups.
