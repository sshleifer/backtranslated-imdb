It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and cheerful mood of this year's best family movie ... the Grand Champion. The story of a 12-year-old boy (Buddy) who, with the help of his sister, his mother and his best friend, is determined to raise a great champion. It is a whimsical trip to the great competition. After Hokey Pokey is crowned, Grand Champion, he is auctioned for $ 775,000. To pay for the university education of children. Buddy discovers that the next time he sees Hokey ... he would be in a bun! The children conspire to steal the award-winning steer, vowing to save it from the barbecue. This is where the fun begins ... Julia Roberts, Larry Mahan, George Strait, Natalie Maines, Steven Bland, Tommy Guy, Tuff Hedeman and many more stars create the backdrop for all the antics. You will not believe who won the bull in the auction !!! (looks good on a mustache) The soundtrack is full of melodies by George Strait, Natalie Maines, Willie Nelson and more. Where else can you experience movie stars, Country and Western stars and Rodeo stars ... only in Texas ... only in Grand Champion? <br /> <br /> It's a small "simple" movie crafted with mastery that may be the best movie you see this year. The film premieres in selected cities on Friday, August 27. 2004. <br /> <br /> Another great movie by Rope the Moon and Michaelson Productions is IN A SUSURSO. Watch for cable networks for this one!
