First they came for the communists, and I did not say anything because I was not a communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not say anything because I was not Jewish. Then they came for the Catholics, and I did not say anything because I was Protestant. Then they came for me, and at that moment there was no one left to speak for me. <br /> <br /> Attributed to Reverend Martin Niemoller, 1945 <br /> <br /> When confronted with intolerance or Injustice, the easiest thing is to do nothing. Speak and run the risk of becoming an object of contempt. But when does it become too much? Global anti-Semitic sentiments allowed Hitler's genocidal policies to flourish, and equal doses of fear and ignorance made it possible for the anticommunist purges of McCarthyism to destroy the lives of thousands of people. Inaction does not make him less guilty. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman is a man chameleon: quiet and bland, blends in perfectly with his surroundings. Lawrence does not like to get involved: when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he does not tell anyone and takes care of his affairs. His world is transformed into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses and gets confused with one of "them". Lawrence's vision of the world and his vision of him are forever altered. <br /> <br /> While the theme of this film is not new, its presentation is definitely unique. It is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudices, when placed within a certain context: Lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions that he is Jewish, than with the opinions of his attackers. He believes that if he corrects this "carelessness" that everything will be fine, without realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand. <br /> <br /> Whether interpreting an intriguer (the only thing I liked about "Fargo") or the sheriff of a nice guy at home, the roles of William H. Macy are linked by a common thread: his characters share a subtle and deliberate Countenance that gives them substance. Macy pinpoints Lawrence to the smallest detail, and says more with a furtive or trembling look in his voice than with a page of dialogue. By showing, instead of saying it, Lawrence can share his fear and bewilderment with the viewer. The cast of support brings the story together. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern is convincing as Gerty, Lawrence's wife with a past. The trailer park is in disrepair, but along with other mundanes, it has also felt the wrath of prejudice as a result of "a mistake" and, unknowingly, exacerbates Lawrence's situation. Michael Lee Aday (also known as "Meatloaf") frightens Fred, the prototype of a redneck next door, equal parts of ignorance and poison, gathering the neighbors of his virulent cause. In the midst of chaos is Finklestein (David Paymer), the focus of aggression and the voice of reason that raises important questions. The uniform representation of Paymer prevents Finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to generate sympathy, making this one of the most solid performances of the film. <br /> <br /> The compact edition and the cut-out cinematography make of Clean the image with few distractions and mix an air of claustrophobia with the sensation of the small city of EE. UU., Is at the same time comforting and disturbing. The deliberate use of harsh two tone lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the carefully annotated soundtrack is powerful without being overpowering. Finally, the set and costume designs recreate the sensation of the era, an essential component in the message of the film. <br /> <br /> The unconventional approach of "approach" in the treatment of prejudice is sufficient reason to recommend this film. Just consider the excellent story, the solid acting and the look of the film as additional bonuses.
