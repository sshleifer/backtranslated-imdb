I must admit that I am prejudiced about my vote in this film, but I have strong reasons, since I know something of the true story that the Hollywood treatment received here. The novel by Edna Ferber on which it is based is from a time when real names can not be used. In a way, this movie is all smoke and mirrors. Although it was released in 1946, it was filmed shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is more radiant in this movie as a brunette. <br /> <br /> She plays a beautiful woman who is trying to change her beauty to get a rich husband. Nowadays she is a gold prospector, but in this social age, she is desirable and the kind of woman who makes all men want her, and all the old types of society talk about her and avoid her, as long as they want be them. Ingrid is at her best and plays this role well. <br /> <br /> Some sympathies for the character of Ingrids arise in the New Orleans section of this film when she manages to get a decent late grave for her scandalized mother as part of her relatives' agreement to leave. . Orleans The presumed family of relatives there is so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks her to leave the city. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper is good at this movie, although he seems to be aging a bit to play a handsome Texan Bachelor / Gambler. He does it well considering the disadvantage that he seemed to be older than he had because of his chain of smokers in real life. Flora Robison as Ingrid's Maid was nominated for an Oscar as a supporting actress in this film. Jerry Austin as Cupidor was overlooked in many ways for his role, but it's the only comic relief in the movie and he does it well. <br /> <br /> When the film moves to Saratoga, it shows with precision the importance of Saratoga. in that era. I like the sequence when Bergman walks into the spring of Saratoge to get a bit of the "sulfur" of the water that everyone considered so healthy. When he drinks a little, he forces himself not to grimace and comments on how good he is and what he should have more. <br /> <br /> The real story is the rail battle that really happened on the railway line in Tunnel, New York, which is the real Trunk of Saratoga from which the title of the film is derived. This battle really happened in 1869 between the agents of Andrew Carnagie and J. P. Morgan. The line was the economic key of the country in 1869, connecting the coal country and the east coast. The references that are made throughout the film are very real. There is even a dialogue that describes Carnagie as a "Scot," although the reference is vague and unknown to anyone who does not know the history of the battle. <br /> <br /> The railroad line and the railroad tunnel in Tunnel, New York (zip code 13848) still exists although the film was shot in California. The actual tunnel is approximately 1 mile long. It is still part of a key cargo line today, years after this happened. I grew up there. The line of Gary Cooper in the film while he is traveling on the train to the tunnel is correct, it is still "a very beautiful country".
