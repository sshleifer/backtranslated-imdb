I went to see "I Sell The Dead" by Glenn McQuaid at its North American premiere at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Since this is the second world show, I did not know what to expect from this film, especially for not having seen the short film that inspired this adaptation to the big screen. <br /> <br /> I'll start with a slightly more elaborate plot synopsis, without revealing the spoilers. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Arthur Blake, how he became a grave robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries he and his mentor discovered. <br /> <br /> The costumes and set design of this movie were excellent. I was surprised to hear that the whole film was shot in New York and its surroundings. The costumes were very precise at the time, which really took him as a spectator to the mentality of the moment. This movie works as well as a vintage piece like a horror comedy. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the two protagonists was very fluid. They played others acting with ease. The dialogue between the two was very well written, with Glenn adding his comedic touch even in tense situations. <br /> <br /> The story is very comprehensive and the ball starts rolling from the beginning. I would compare it to a visual page turner, always asking me what will happen next. All the characters are very vivid and unique, and they add different emotional layers to the film. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants black humor, with a bit of mixed horror. in. <br /> <br /> 9/10
