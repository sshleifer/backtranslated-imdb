The movie is a start to what really happened in Phenix City. I am the grandson of the people who really lived the story. The truth has never come to my knowledge. I have tried to discover the whole story, but the people who lived it are still afraid to tell it. Phenix City is still run by crooked people. Albert Patterson was not the saint that history wants you to believe. The story was filmed in Phenix City. It still has some of the famous sites you see in the movie. The Colonal Funeral Home still looks exactly the same. But if you want to know the true history of Sin City, you have to visit us and find people willing to tell you about Ma Beachies and his kindness. She did not receive the name of ma at all.
