As I said earlier this year, in my review of Swordfish (which was scripted by this writer / director / film producer, Skip Woods) this is a good movie. It's very high on my list of crime movies between Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Pulp Fiction and Snatch. Basically, I think that this film is for me what Reservoir Dogs was for many people, a cult classic, although I prefer to compare it with Pulp Fiction. I mean, I never really liked Tarantino's first effort, but I'm sure I liked this one as well as Pulp Fiction, because it has everything a classic needs. A great story and good actors. OK, the budget might not be as big as in, for example, Godzilla, The Avengers of Mission to Mars, but it sure surpasses the shit in those movies (and many others). <br /> <br /> The story of this movie is about a man named Casey (Thomas Jane), who has settled down with his wife in Houston. Unexpectedly, an old friend interrupts his life, reveals his secrets and basically makes his day a hell (and also a bloody one). <br /> <br /> The film is very original and quite bloody / dyed sexually. . So, based on that first and last quality, I can assure you that if you like this movie, you will also like swordfish, which of course has a much bigger budget and more famous faces than this one, but it's just as good ( although not so bloody and not so sexually tinted). Last night I saw this movie for the second time and I enjoyed it a lot (again). I want to say that all the characters and actors are good, although I must give very good credits to Thomas Jane and Paulina Porizkova, who were the best actors (and had the best characters) in the film. I would also have to thank Skip Woods for being so imaginative and original. Brutal, sexual, offensive ??? Maybe, but it sure is nice and an exciting journey to the end. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
