This show is without Stop hilarity. The first joke will make you wet your pants. And that's probably the weakest joke of all. I started watching it when the second half of season 2 began to air. And then. I am hooked. Only 2 weeks later I began to look. I downloaded episodes and bought the DVDs. Recurring clips, such as "Ad Road Test" and "Actuality" are pretty fun. Then there are the ads that take out "Use Emo, use your own tears for more effective use" It's also fun on the political side of things. Nothing is wrong with them doing this. it is funny. Any Australians who do not find this fun. Do not complain and do not look at it. ALL TUNA in Australia on Wednesday at 9 on ABC
