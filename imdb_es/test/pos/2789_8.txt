L'Auberge Espagnole is full of energy, honest, realistic and refreshing. It is not a comedy or a drama, but rather a film of life about this group in particular of very interesting but still normal young people who share an apartment in Barcelona for a year. Beautifully photographed with a beautiful soundtrack. If you are older, this movie should bring a lot of good memories. If you are young, learn with this example.
