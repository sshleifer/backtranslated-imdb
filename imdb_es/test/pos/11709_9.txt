Sharky's Machine is easily one of the best efforts of Burt Reynolds. It also stands as one of the best dramas of contemporary crime. Erotic and violent, the film distinguishes itself by setting the story in Atlanta and delivering a case of chaotic detective to you (the viewer), on a silver platter. Dedicated and determined, Sharky must stop the murder of Dominoe, a charming lady of the night, whose clientele is anything but ordinary. In a short time, Sharky's crimefighting Machine discovers a conspiracy of the highest level, which threatens to corrupt the inner body of Atlanta. As a resident of Metro Atlanta, I remember the excitement in the city during the production of the film. Sharky's machine goes out of its way to give an accurate picture of Atlanta. Twenty years later and 2,000,000 more people later, the film stands the test of time. Trust me, Atlanta has not changed. One of the highlights of the image is the daring trick of Dar Robinson (a classic and symbolic ending). He even appeared on That's Incredible, the ABC reality show of the period. It's a shame that Hollywood does not make enough movies like this one. Relax, each of your popcorn and watch the action of the sterling silver cinema.
