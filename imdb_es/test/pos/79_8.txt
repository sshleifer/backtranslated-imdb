Once again, the sacred home of Bugs Bunny is raped by careless people. This time, the traveling circus put a cage of lions right over the rabbit hole. So Bug's has to get out of the hole and face Nero (that's the name of the lion), which he does in his usual hilarious style. After a slow and rocky start in the car, it continues to improve and ends up being quite hilarious. Nero the lion turns out to be a very good film for Bugs and that turns this short into a very memorable one, although it is still a classic. This animated short can be found on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 3. <br /> <br /> My rating: A-
