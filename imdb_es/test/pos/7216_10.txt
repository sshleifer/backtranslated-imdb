This movie is amazing. It's fun, sexy, violent and sick, but everything stays together for a brilliant interpretation of Romeo and Juliet by Troma. If you do not mind being disgusted (it's worth a lot, but it's funny), watch this movie. Worth it! There is no level at which it is not met. I've seen it three times now, and it's still amazing. I recommend it. To go! Get it!
