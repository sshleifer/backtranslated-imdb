Two things can happen when a joint cast is assembled. Or you stay out of the theater asking: "Why?" or you get MANNA DEL CIELO, a charming comedy from the Burton Sisters, whose mother not only provided inspiration but also the script itself. Ursula Burton, plays Theresa, a nun whose friends and family had always believed that God touched her. From heaven, the clan uses young Theresa's faith that money was a gift from heaven for all her dreams to come true. Years pass and we find that Theresa returned to her home in her natal buffalo. He realizes that the gift must be reimbursed and summons his friends and family (Academy Award winners Shirley Jones, Louise Fletcher and Cloris Leachman) to repay the debt before Easter Sunday. The money has already been spent and all the characters are in financial difficulties. Shirley Jones and Frank Gorshin, is a husband and wife team that teaches the most important lesson of life, how to dress for the winter in Buffalo and my personal favorite, "expect you to make the decision." Verware, "visiting a restaurant. The public can only hope that if Theresa reaches her goal, that person will not run away with the money. The film teaches us that it is not money, but ourselves that make our dreams and those of others come true. Each action has a result not only for you, but also for the community that surrounds it. When we look in the mirror we see ourselves as we would like to be, MANNA DEL CIELO, answers the question of how others can see the image that we would most like to reflect. The Burton have done an excellent job of directing the cast to come out of their shells and create new and inventive characters. On the day of multi-million dollar budgets, this low Indy budget shows that it is not cash money, but real talent that will cause the biggest laughs. Wendie Malick (US President, Just Shoot Me) adds a special flavor to this already talented cast.
