This is a fascinating documentary about a 15-year-old black boy who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the subsequent court trial that follows. What this movie shows is how corrupt the US police system is and how easy it can really be to condemn an ​​innocent man and how an old senile fool thinks that a black man looks a lot like another and attacks him if he rots in the jail because he said he was the man who murdered my wife. The star is the defense attorney who is brilliant in his work in court, but he also did what the police should have done all the time. Fascinating things 7 out of 10
