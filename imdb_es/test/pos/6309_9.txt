I was a bit worried about the actors and acting in Italy, then "Le conseguenze dell'amore" and Toni Servillo arrived. It's been a long time since I saw such a charismatic actor on the screen. Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has created one of the most unforgettable characters of the movies in recent years. The film is not completely perfect, but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the film. Toni, please, continue acting in the movies, you are the best actor today (and not only in Italy, his performance deserves international acclaim). I rate this movie 9/10.
