Considering that this movie was released 8 years before I was born, I do not feel so bad for having seen it for so long. However, in January of 1998, I attended the second Quentin Tarantino annual film festival held in Austin, Texas. The particular theme of the films tonight was "Neglected 70's Crime Films" and the boy was on his right. "The Gravy Train (or The Dion Brothers, as this impression appeared)" was a real gem. Wonderful performances, extravagant characters, intelligent plot, hilarious comedy, and a great moment. You rarely see a movie about crime that is so entertaining and fresh. Margot Kidder in one of her first film appearances is also extremely sexy. I hope that some cable network takes over this movie and allows many more to see it. Meanwhile, go to an indie video store and hope they have it.
