This movie is a dream because Rod Steiger is the only big name in the credits. However, all the secondary actors fit well with their character. It was fitting that in his latest film, Rod Steiger reminded us once again of his inventive power as an actor. He presented the impulsivity, stubbornness and acceptance of the end of a grandfather's life in a characteristically individual and convincing performance. Because his character was close to death, history brings us closer to the most precious things that are given to us: the privilege of life, relationships with family members and the empathy of those who care for us. His search together with his granddaughter for one of his sons gave me enough suspense to make me wait, waiting for a very heavy climax, as the reunion of two separate old-age lovers who were also on the cusp of death in "Forever Young." "I wondered how the meeting would be organized and how strong my emotions would be when he and his granddaughter had reached the end of their search." I was delighted to discover that the story brought more than I expected, the delightfully satisfying climax a greater appreciation of the value of the precious gifts of life, love and family that we enjoy today and of all of us.
