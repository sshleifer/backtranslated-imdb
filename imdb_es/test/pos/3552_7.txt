A new version of the silent film of 1916, based on the 1909 novel by Maurice Leblanc. The series of detectives would become numerous plays, movies and television series in the United Kingdom, the United States and France over the years. This 1932 version was starring the crushing brothers Barrymore, John (as Duke) and Lionel (as Detective Guerchard). They would also star together the Grand Hotel, Dinner at Eight and several more during the next two years. Sonia (Karen Morley) appears in the Duke's bed during a party in this pre-Hayes code movie; first the lights in the bedroom are turned off, then they are turned off in the main dance hall, then the thief and the missing jewels are searched, as well as other lost valuables ... It can be said that the fans of the conversation had not been close to long, since they still use caption cards several times. Also pay attention to a new type of safe that does not need a combination. A well thought out plot, without big holes, but no big surprises here. Not bad for a talkative old movie. Intelligent end
