I am a fan of Zhang Yimou and finally I found this DVD title on the shelves of a bookstore in Shenzhen after a long search in many places. <br /> <br /> This is a big departure from Zhang Yimou's previous work, especially in terms of style and regional configuration. The director himself has said that this is the first and only time he will try to make a black comedy in contemporary China. You can even say that this work is experimental in nature, compared to its other large budget and well-known formal pieces. <br /> <br /> Filmed with a handheld camera and wide-angle lenses throughout the film. Fast-paced editing and high-energy performance and naturalistic tone will never let you go once you catch it from the start. It presents a very realistic description of modern Chinese urban sensibilities, which in this case is set in Beijing. If you appreciate and love this kind of black humor, you will totally love this movie. Also consider the funny cameos of Zhao Benshan (Happy Times) and the director Zhang Yimou himself. <br /> <br /> One last important point: I find the characters in this movie, as in all the other Zhang Yimou movies, Show similar personality traits: stubbornness, always trying to beat the odds and up the ante. Let me know your thoughts on this. <br /> <br /> David Lee
