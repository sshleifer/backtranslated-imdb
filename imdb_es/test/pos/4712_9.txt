I always wanted to see this movie and when I finally arrived I knew that I was expecting a pleasant surprise when the name of John Boorman appeared on the screen. Known mainly for his epic films (he directed the first Conan and wrote Apocalypse Now) together in the classic Hollywood structure, it fits perfectly with his catalog. <br /> <br /> Nor can I express how perfect the moment was that Myanmar (Burma) is once again experiencing an uprising by monks and students against the government led by a military "junta" that is the same (There has been a change of leadership since then but it is essentially the same) described in the 1988 film. Now more than ever, this film needs to be broadcast on television (captured in IFC) due to recent events.
