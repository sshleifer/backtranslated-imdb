Although I am not a golf fan, I attended a preview of this movie and I loved it. The historical configuration, the flagrant distinctions of class, and seeing the good and the bad on both sides of the dividing line struck me. The actors and their characterizations were fascinating. And I was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting, but also easy to follow. Towards the end of this film, "Seabiscuit" came to mind strongly, although "The Greatest Game Ever Played" is a much less complex story than that movie. In both cases, the fact that the events occurred really deepened my interest.
