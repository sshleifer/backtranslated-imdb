The giant robot was the most popular Japanese television series ever seen on Indian television. It was aimed at children and we saw a robot for the first time in our lives. <br /> <br /> Many Indian children must have seen a machine for the first time outside of school textbooks. <br /> <br /> The series also showed a child in an adult organization fighting against evil. Undoubtedly, many of us who have seen Giant Robot in our childhood for a long time by our own robots and as an interim arrangement look at our computers in the same way. <br /> <br /> This show also portrayed the ideal adults (referring to Jerry, Johnny's friend and Unicorn's boss, Azuma). We grew up to respect Japanese progress and we still see Japan as the ideal Asian nation. <br /> <br /> By the way, at the time, there were no satellite TV channels in India and the government-owned station did not show much of the Disney cartoons. . I guess that's how the children's series like giant robot were appreciated. Today there are Pok√©mon, etc., but they are not as fascinating or attractive as the giant robot.
