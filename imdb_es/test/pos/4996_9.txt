What has hurt this movie is that everyone and his aunt Matilda are comparing her with her illustrious predecessor, which will always harm any program. If you take it as a western, it's a good show. We discover how our characters in 'Lonesome Dove' end up in the situations in which they start (such as: Why do two Texas Rangers, who live on the adventure, end up in a dead city? And how did Gus manage to lose the love? life?) The performances are very good, and we see exactly the same gestures that the characters will have on the way. The actors did a very good job. The cinematography was excellent, and although the music was not up to the legendary score of almost two decades ago, it was an impossible task, and even so it was fine. <br /> <br /> It also helped that we had three episodes, which you just do not see in a miniseries anymore. Hell, it's absolutely impossible to watch a two-part telefilm these days. <br /> <br /> West fans rejoice!
