After watching Tipping the Velvet by Sarah Waters, I decided to see Fingersmith, the characters were equally good in both performances, although she missed Rachael Stirling in the Fingersmith adaptation. <br /> <br /> The choice, twisting and unraveling of the characters were incredible! Excellent watch, only missing Rachael Stirling! <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the romance of two girls, this is not one of the best movies to watch. <br /> <br /> Take a different turn of Tipping The Velvet but just as good. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to everyone!
