What a great show! A dramatic spectacle very underestimated. It's great that there are no main characters and in each episode the main character (s). I think the best character on the show is Vern Schillinger. He's a tough guy, a bad guy and an Aryan besides that, which makes him a real bad prisoner, and there are many who are known to be. This program has many murders, I think it is a little exaggerated by the murder in the program, but I must admit that is one of the reasons why I think the program is so good. I think some characters were killed a little early, but some sure still left their mark. You can not compare things like Prison Break with this program, they are totally different. I think some of the actors in the program are also very good and underestimated, and if they are due to them. A great show, my favorite. A show that should be considered the greatest in the coming years.
