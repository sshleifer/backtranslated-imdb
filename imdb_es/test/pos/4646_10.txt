This movie typifies the principles of the eighties, as well as fun! I remember seeing this movie on HBO when I was little, and it was my favorite movie. As it was a while ago, no one I had met knew what it was. Then, almost when the roommate told me that she had also seen it, and that it was her favorite, they started printing it again! Luckily, I have a copy now !! If someone ever wants to see the best treasure hunt (with cheese) that was probably the beginning of hazing for friends, this movie is this one! (Vigilante - you have to have a great love for cheesy 80s movies!)
