This is a wonderful movie, about an Ale soul. This is a trip to the heart of Ale. I found it fascinating. The director did a great job. He makes the scenes speak. Especially in silent scenes. Ale's window is a great one. And the scenes in which he lies on the bed are one of the best directed scenes I've seen. <br /> <br /> Apart from directing. It's been a while since I've seen a movie about a soul. As a philosopher I can say that this movie shows that age does not matter about your soul. As well as the soul of Ale. <br /> <br /> How to live in Turkey I do not care about the other part of NY. This is a universal scene that can be seen all over the world. As for my opinion more universal than anything else. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie. Otherwise you will miss a great thing about a soul. If you have one. <br /> <br /> Baris.Sentuna
