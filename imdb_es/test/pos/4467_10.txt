This is Lucio Fulci at his best. If only all the movies he made later were like that. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary film is as intriguing as "The bird with crystal plumage" by Dario Argento ... <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Argento, but you do not like the movies of Lucio Fulci, as <br /> <br /> "The Beyond", "Manhattan Baby", "The House by the Cemetery", etc. This has nothing for. do with others ... this is what the Italians call "giallo" ... that would be something like a "who did it" movie in a few words. <br /> <br /> You will not know who the killer is until the last moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, there is the plot: a maniac who lives in a small town begins to kill young children ... A journalist (Tomas Milian), a young and sexy woman (Barbara Bouchet), a priest (Marc Porel), his mother (Irene Papas) and a witch (Florinda Bolkan) are the main characters of this tangled and bloody story. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the actors, I mean that Tomas Milian is excellent (as always), and Florinda Bolkan is an excellent s the witch of the town ... <br /> <br /> Want to know who is the murderer? ... <br /> <br /> I can not tell you ... but I can tell you that I should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> (10 of 10) ... of course!
