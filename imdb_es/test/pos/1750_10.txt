When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN discovers only bad news for its small insects in the Lowlands. Can this honest and kind grasshopper save his girlfriend, Miss Honey Bee, from the machinations of the evil C. Bagley Beetle, and also take his friends to a safe new home, before it's too late? <br /> <br /> While it is not one of the great animated features (a very new art at the time this movie was created) HOPPITY is a nice movie that should give pleasure to viewers who are not. Technically it is well done, with animation of a generally high quality. The main drawback of the film is that none of the characters really has any "heart"; they do not appear "alive" on the screen as Jiminy Cricket did a year earlier at PINOCCHIO. <br /> <br /> However, it is ultimately unfair to compare the departure of Fleischer Studio with that of Disney. Max and Dave Fleischer had their own star to follow; his contribution, and it would be considerable, would be in the scope of the cartoon of a scroll. With their series POPEYE and BETTY BOOP they created alternative realities as viable as any other produced by other cartoon studios. HOPPITY was his second experiment with feature film animation (after GULLIVER'S TRAVELS in 1939), and from then on he would spend his energies again on the short subject of cartoons. In fact, the first series of the acclaimed SUPERMAN series has already been published. <br /> <br /> The history of HOPPITY is largely due to Frank Capra. With your energy, make the hero face the powerful social forces. In fact, the original title of the film was MR. BUG GOES TO TOWN, which immediately recalls Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and his adventures in Capraesque. <br /> <br /> Jack Mercer, famous as Popeye's voice, speaks here of two very different characters, the old Mr Bumble & Swat the Fly. Film experts should be able to capture veteran voice actors Pinto Colvig and Mae Questel, both in uncredited roles. <br /> <br /> The movie has some nice songs provided by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, of which `Be My Little Baby Bumble Bee 'is the most familiar. `We are the couple in the castle 'is a good romantic melody that deserves to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the initial animation of the film, with its sweeping out of the heavens and beyond the interiors. The depth of the New York skyline is hidden behind the opening credits.
