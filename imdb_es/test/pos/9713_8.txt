This movie left me speechless: I've only seen two episodes of the show, I never saw the first movie, but I went to a shortlist in which Johnny Knoxville himself presented the film, telling us to "deactivate our sense of moral judgment for one hour and half.' He was right, as a movie, this probably qualifies as a 2, since it has a zero plot, no structure other than randomness and very little production value, but that is not the point. laughing and panting all the way, not just some of the creative acrobatics (watch the trailer if you need to know, but they hid some of the best ones (or the worst, depending on how you look at it)), but some of the things they did took us These guys do some things that will not appear in the reviews of their newspapers (and that probably can not even be published here), which involve many things below the belt, however, almost 3/4 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical (even if they are morally reprehensible, but remember the Knoxville statement), and if you have the right mindset, this movie is hysterical, only about 20 minutes of this El√≠cula could have been shown on television, so be warned of what you're getting into: some things are disgusting, but instead of being rejected by them, you end up laughing at the stupidity of all this. . As a person who thought that the Jackass TV show was a much-hyped fashion with only some funny sketches and a lot of unnecessary pain, the amount of fun I had in this movie made me realize that having no limits is the best environment for these . guys to work. It's a lot of fun and it should be a great comedy solution until the Borat movie comes out. With this movie, you may think you know what you are getting, but these guys are a few steps ahead. I guarantee you will be surprised by the third sketch. So enjoy, and do not worry: you will not want to do almost any of your things at home.
