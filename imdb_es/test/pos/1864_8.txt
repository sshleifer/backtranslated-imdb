Woohoo! Fantastic movie in my opinion, I did not expect it to be so good! I was captivated from beginning to end: it is a very well done and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the tests that Darwin had to go through to transmit his ideas to the world, telling his life while writing "Origin of the species" ; fighting both against personal demons and with the ignorant society of the time to do so. He fights hard with his mind, body and soul as personal matters come to a breaking point and even his family seems to slip away ... while the rest of the world opposes him because he knows that his findings shake literally the foundations of his life. Lives, culture and sense of existence. It is a subtle film (not exaggerated in any way in the typical Hollywood way, it is a British film produced by the BBC), but fortunately it has great meaning and this is thanks to the incredible well-directed scenes, as well as the excellent performance of Bettany. . Connelly acts as a light support role, but I enjoyed it a lot and she is as good as expected as usual, her chemistry together with her husband was definitely strong and endearing, you could feel the connection and her husband in real life. The wife's bond definitely shines through his performances. But the star of the show is definitely Bettany and he does a brilliant job, a very moving performance. I understood and sympathized with him as he struggled against his own degrading health and his impending "madness" to try to understand what he had discovered and what he had discovered. to understand what it really is and means when he discovered that his thinking contradicted his feelings, and he found himself losing everything, including his wife, who of course was a firm believer in religion and a strict Christian while in the realm of science, two worlds that could not see eye to eye, so their relationship was also at stake. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a very good emotional drama, well acted, and I daresay I did shed a tear during the tragic climax that was truly heartbreaking, as well as beautifully touching and moving. The film is symbolic and also very intellectually artistic, in fact, I can not wait to see it again, since there was a lot to take in the first round that I missed. Easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.
