In my opinion, Flatley ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego. He was disrespectful to his dance partner, tried to eclipse everyone and was not aware of the spirit of Riverdance. It's okay that he left the show. Colin Dunne, the new male lead, is excellent, and when he and Jean Butler dance together, magic happens! The violin of Eileen Ivers is amazing (as is the percussion of Noel Eccles) and the "dance of fire" of Maria Pages is worth the price of admission. When Pages and Ivers come together, near the end of the show for a musical duo, well, it's a real treasure. I agree, the edition is not complementary, but no technical deficiency can stifle this extraordinary tour de force. This is the one that must be achieved. There has never been anything like Riverdance! This is the real one!
