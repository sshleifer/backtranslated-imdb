"Who Will Love My Children" The saddest movie I've seen in my life. Definitely 10/10. Released on TV in 1983. The movie has been released on VHS. DVD release is a must, sooner rather than later. The mother who is dying of cancer must find a home for all her children before dying, because she thinks that her husband and father of the children are not able to take care of them once she dies. She manages to find homes for children, except one, a child who is not wanted because she suffers from epilepsy. Very sad when you do not want to. In a real tearful tear, put your hands in this movie. I'm a man, I even cried when I saw this movie. Do not be surprised
