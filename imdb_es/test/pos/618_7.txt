The first half of the movie scared me a lot and I'm usually not easy to scare, but the second half of this thriller did not work very well, but it's still very scary! A good thriller, which uses simple ways to make good horror. Low budget, set in Russia, cast unknown and made in Europe. But it's still very funny, and yes, there are some laughs for good business too!
