Klatret © ªsen (Catch That Girl) is a really great movie. It's a 'happy' movie. I saw this film at the 'Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan)' on July 12, 2003. There's Action + Adventure + Comedy + Thrill + Happy + Romance (Cute children's love triangle!). You must see this movie. :)
