The role of the economy in the industrialized market of North America must have always been theorized in the countries of origin of the creation of engines. People and industrialists such as Mercedes Benz and Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) surely realized the opportunity of the North Ameircan market with the purchase of fuel and the amount of cars purchased per home. This type of economic phenomena provoked the concept of Speed ​​Racer. <br /> <br /> After Japan's new constitution, the industrialization of the isolated island island of Japan must seek opportunities once again through economic partnerships with its global neighbors. This also helped boost economic opportunities in the European and North American markets, if not in the global market. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is a young and avid driver who, unknowingly better, is driven by his demanding father Pops Racer, who has challenged. He himself all his life to make a better machine better in winning races. In fact, it was Pops Racer who brought his first son Rex Racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy of how to better use the technology he developed. As a mature Racer, Rex finally realizes his own inherent values ​​and becomes independent, but still feels obligated to his young and annoying Speed. <br /> <br /> The exact relationship of Rex Racer with people like the Inspector is never really clear, but put into dramatization. Rex is finally accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization because of his ability to be in places where there is no other explanation of how he would have known that Speed ​​was in trouble. Or the fact that the situations involved some types of illegal activity where their secret knowledge is used against an evil plot. This brings a layer and dagger romance level to Speed ​​Racer. <br /> <br /> The mix of Speed's innocence with Trixy, Sprital and Chim Chim brings a level of comedic human nature. This concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance themes and plots, as they are reproduced from one episode to another. So, instead of a dry detective story, the excitement of international racecar driving, the romance of the cloak and the dagger and the comedy of human nature are set in a story, Speed ​​Racer.
