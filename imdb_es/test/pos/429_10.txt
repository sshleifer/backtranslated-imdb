It seems that Hack has been described as unrealistic ... but that's what TV is. Television is designed to provide an escape from everyday life and I think Hack does a great job in that regard. Add to this the slow process of revealing your past and its interesting / interesting plots; It seems you can not have enough. Also, with great actors like David Morse, Andre Braugher and even little Mathew Borish, what more could you ask for? So if you're looking for an immersive experience and you like the "non-favorite" characters, I suggest you give Hack a chance, especially now that he's finally recovering.
