Seeing this movie brought me memories of 9/11. The first thing I remember that morning was watching television images of an airplane flying in a large building, and my immediate thoughts "They must be a preview for a new Tom Clancy movie". <br /> <br /> This was not a Tom Clancy movie. This certainly was not a British version of "The sum of all fears". The typical Tom Clancy movie or novel has a relatively small cast, a linear plot and, usually, some kind of resolution. This movie had neither one nor the other. Of course, what I saw directly on the screen was a small cast, a plot and a vague resolution, but, as on September 11, the point was that reality was much bigger and more complex. <br /> <br /> I the work in systems planning, and the reality of the disaster preparedness exercise, and the disaster itself, is painfully obvious. It is impossible to prepare for a disaster like this, nor will it be more possible to deal with this when it happens. <br /> <br /> From the discussion between the police (Not enough is being done to prepare) and the politicians (giving everyone in the tube a gas mask would cause panic), to the constant announcements of speakers (you he does not run any danger to his health, but he does not go home before we decontaminate it), and (do not eat, drink, or smoke before we decontaminate you, I was nervous throughout the movie.) There is no need to navigate This movie lasted 90 minutes, it could have been twice that, and all the details have not yet been shown, instead, he left enough without saying to allow each one of us imagining the details, each one of us in our own way, that made it much more real to me, than any Tom Clancy film. <br /> <br /> I once lived in London, and right next to Edgeware Road and I took the train from Waterloo station many times, while watching Dirty War , I repeated to myself that this is just fiction. At this time. <br /> <br /> If Allah and Jehovah wish, this film will remain fiction, and sometime in 20 or 30 years, my nephews will be able to see this film and remember the beginning of the 21st century, and the panic that We feel for a lot. Let's hope it's the same as what I feel today, seeing the memories of the Cold War with the evil communist regime of the mid-twentieth century, and remembering the "Drop and cover" exercises at school.
