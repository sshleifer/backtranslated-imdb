Even the technological ornaments of Maria Montez / Jon Hall from the 1940s are overshadowed by the "Princess of the Nile", Fox's entry into Hollywood obsession in the mid-50s with Egyptian things (see "Earth of the pharaohs, "" Valley of the Kings, "etc.) Pure Hokum, unadulterated, meaningless, generously produced (low budget, actually, but using sets and costumes of" The Robe ", this Technicolored show seems like it cost millions). 71 minutes of treats (the plot, which has something to do with disastrous defeats in ancient Egypt, is irrelevant) offers the filmmaker and the public the pleasant view of Debra Paget with a variety of sailboats, most of them. which fell to the ground when she trembles and shudders through a number of slave production unparalleled in the history of cinema. The spectators did not suffer any kind of change: Jeffrey Hunter, the most handsome player on Fox's contract, is as photogenic as Mrs. Paget, while Michael Rennie hides in the background, provoking evil acts in the land of the pyramids. For those who might think that Paget & Hunter can not act and were only hired for their physical attributes, review their subtle work, overlooked and heartbreaking together a few years later in "White Feather" (another Fox production that unfortunately has disappeared in the realm of "lost movies"). The "Princess of the Nile" still stands in a class by herself as a joyful, carefree, breathless testament, dazzling to the glories of the 3-band Technicolor - and the seductive charms of Mrs. Paget (all 20 in that moment ). Put this unique classic kitsch on your list of "guilty pleasures" and enjoy. Satisfaction guaranteed!
