It started strange, the medium was strange, and the ending was strange, but I really liked it. A modern version of Homer's Odyessy, but that's really irrelevant. Interesting story and casting. Clooney was great and I applaud him for having taken on such an inverse role, so different from everything he has done or will do again. Many surprise stars, why is not Holly Hunter in more? Do something different tonight and watch this movie really different and unexpected.
