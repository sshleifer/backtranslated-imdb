Mani, as usual, brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such an amazing relationship between parents and children manifests itself in a beautiful way. Mani Sir, as usual, without many special effects or few outdoor shots. (In fact, this was the only film in which he left India ... also for Sri Lanka). Mani's class is written throughout the film ... and to add to ARR's music ... which is simply amazing ... Vellai Pookal is one of my favorite songs ... Maddy, who is what she is in the film industry, has also impressed a lot. From alaipayuthey, from kannathil to ayutha ezuthu to guru ... Mani ratnam has shown the world what a versatile actor is, Maddy. Simran has also been very good. She has shown that she can also act in non-glamorous and character roles. In all an incredible movie. Sad that the Tamil public could not appreciate this gr8 movie and bombed at the box office ...
