This movie offers many treats and surprises. When Achille and Philippa sing beautifully a duet of "Don Giovanni" that perfectly describes his situation in the film, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film. The story takes place in the 18th century in Jutland and the use of period music played on vintage instruments is just another fine touch. You share the exquisite joy of General Loewenhielm in his participation of Cailles in Sarcophage even if he is only watching a movie, but he wants only a small sample to be enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist whose medium is food. Perhaps no other form of art allows the artist to share her creations so directly. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this film, the potential of sharing food to transform the way people see themselves and how they look. world, is very similar to the theme of "Chololat", but "Fiesta de Babette" does not hit you in the head with your message. The inhabitants of the city are conservative Puritans, but not exaggeratedly oppressive. You come to understand and respect them and, ultimately, to appreciate their humanity. <br /> <br /> Many subjects are proposed for you to reflect on: the nature of art, the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the effect of the environment on the behavior, the taking of life to give life, among others. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment for me was General Loewenhielm's speech delivered at the climax of the meal. I expected deep observations, but I got some vague mystical digressions. The speech had such a minimal impact that I hardly remember it. <br /> <br /> But this discreet film leaves a lasting impression. The warmth that it generates contrasts with the austere backdrop. You will leave the theater wanting to go dancing under the stars.
