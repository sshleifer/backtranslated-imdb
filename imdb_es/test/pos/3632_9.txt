A very moving film, a great surprise of Brazil, a country that normally exports characteristics on social issues, violence, sex ... Magical realism is a very difficult task, and I think João Falcão has done it wonderfully. It seems he really did not intend to make a realistic movie, much less. Although many people think that the film was adapted from the work, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series "Hoje é Dia De Maria". The television series produced by Globo was made after the movie, but it was aired before ... Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> The negative point is photography, by Walter Carvalho. It seems that he did not grasp or understand the concept that Falcão has created. The story is captivating and universal, despite taking place in a small city in Brazil. That could happen anywhere in the world. A great movie, I highly recommend it.
