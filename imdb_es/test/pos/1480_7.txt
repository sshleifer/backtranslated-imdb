All the critics are making a big mistake. This movie should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It was made for children and teenagers from the late 80s or early 90s and, as such, was really a movie of its time. If you hated that period, or you like the first movie so much that you can not even make a joke about it, then this is crap, but only because it was not for you. The low budget here and the failure of Beastmaster 1 at the box office (raised in less than four billion with a budget of nine thousand) were, obviously, the reasons to abandon the seriousness of the original and put it in the present. You can complain about history, dialogue or logic, but once again, this was done to run, not to win races. If the film had tried to be taken seriously, it would be a total failure, but it does not do it for a second (in "our" world, Dar sees a movie theater that announces The Beastmaster 2, as already said). To paraphrase Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry's films: this film knows its limitations. It is more a comedy / parody of the usual adventure. The soundtrack (for the moment) was also great. The actors do not take it so seriously either, so even the irritating "spoiled rich spoiled" role (very well played here by the young Kari Wuhrer) turns out to be good. <br /> <br /> So, if you feel nostalgic for the culture of the 80s and 90s (cheese), or if you liked the first part, and do not mind going out on a cheese branch, you'll have a lot of fun with this attempt to revive Dar in the 90s (literally). This is not really the sequel to the first one, and do not see it if that is what you want. It's more like a fantasy sequel "what if". <br /> <br /> As for the question "why different dimensions and not just different times": when in history we had those tall winged humanoid creatures that suck the flash of bones (since the end of part 1) ? By the way, the film ends up at the zoo due to an attempt at a cheap final (in regards to money). It is supposed to be the best place for Dar to show all his movements (he is the manipulator of the animals).
