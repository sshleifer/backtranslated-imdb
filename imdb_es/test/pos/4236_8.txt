I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a "return to greatness" but the series was never really great. Very good was # 1, # 2-3 was disposable, and I think this fourth installment is the same or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle / slogan: "Chucky Gets Lucky". She does so, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who completely rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager'. Tilly not only created a presence; She added much needed humor, background story, drama, tension and a great little companion / game for Chucky. And as much as I liked the show, you can not get all the credit: the accessories (see the first 1-2 minutes looking for horror tributes), the writing, the internal jokes (again, the opening + Pinhead) and Chucky's lines were great ("In fact, if (this) were a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels just to do it justice", among others). Fortunately, Chucky and the series have renounced Andy "Hide The Search for the Soul, and settled for a new way to get out of his body." He joins his ex (Tilly) whom he transfers to a "Bride" doll and a pair of Bonnie and Clyde teenagers (Really, Heigl?) to retrieve this pendant buried with the human corpse of Chucky, this is for any fan of Chucky, a terror fan of the 80s or even for those who have never I've seen none of the previous 'Child's Play' movies, it's funny, dark, harmless, bloody - but not over and, despite Tilly's 20 minutes screen, it's always good to see her. you see her playing poker. (Side note: of course, I took the reference from Superman ?? Hackensack, NJ).
