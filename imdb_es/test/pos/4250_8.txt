"Putney Swope" is a unique gem, low and low budget, of the late 1960s that probably would have been forgotten in time if it had not been for two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (who named the character of Don Cheadle in " Boogie Nights ", Buck Swope, after the homonymous hero of this movie) and limited release on DVD. Seeing "Putney Swope" is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it may not make much sense (at least for me it was not when you first saw it), but you have to respect the film for its passion and blatantly rebellious message. I did not understand many things about "Putney Swope", but for the most part, I liked it. The more I think about the movie, the more it grows in me. <br /> <br /> The film is advertised as a parody of Madison Avenue in New York, best known in the 1960s as the world's advertising capital. It is possible that the members of Generation X and Y are lost with this concept, but fortunately "Mad Men" is on television to give us this piece of the history of the USA. UU What you need to know before watching this movie is that these advertising agencies were mostly male, and even more so in large part of white establishments. With this premise in mind, the film opens with a meeting of the board of the advertising agency. The members are predominantly white except for Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson, who has a strange resemblance to Dick Gregory in this film), the African-American token on the board. The board members are so absorbing and heartless that when their president dies in front of them, their only concern is who will be the next president. Without even removing the body from the meeting room, they begin a paper ballot to choose the next president. <br /> <br /> Putney Swope is chosen for a landslide, but not because the other members think Swope is qualified. Voting for Swope was an unfortunate attempt for these board members to sabotage the possibility of any other member being elected president. With their counterproductive plans, Swope takes charge and "sinks the boat", dismisses all but one of the original members and hires all the people of color in his place. <br /> <br /> After this point, the film became (for me) very rare and difficult to follow in the plot. There may not even have been a plot, really. The general idea of ​​the film seems to be a "what if" scenario, with the result that the new "Truth and Soul Inc." The signature would be unconventional, but nevertheless successful. The company ends up earning so much money that the members build a huge showcase to keep the money in cash for inexplicable purposes. It could be because Swope does not trust the banks, although that point is not mentioned or explained in the film. It could also be metaphorical in some way, but who knows. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place within the advertising agency, with occasional scenes in the White House with a president who, for some unknown reason, is a dwarf. I guess there was a political joke, but I can not understand what. Did the filmmakers say that the president is a small and insignificant part of American life? Were they saying that the last elected officials (Nixon at that time) were insignificant candidates? I do not know. However, it seemed a little strange to me that the man who represented the president looked a lot like the future President Ronald Reagan. It's funny to make that connection 40 years after the movie was filmed. <br /> <br /> What this film may have benefited is how consumers outside the advertising agency reacted to the new ads. Of course, the images in the ad possessed a strange and amusing appeal for their unconventional creativity, but did these ads convince people to buy the product? If so, how? The film hinted at the idea that the new advertising campaign was successful through interaction with the client and calls from the White House. However, it would have been revealing to see average people, since demographics have always been more profitable for advertisers. <br /> <br /> Although the parodies and political messages that this film may have made probably did not stand the test. Time, this movie still had many unique qualities. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X factor that greatly benefited him in this movie. Swope's harsh voice was actually director Robert Downey, Mr. Dub's voice dubbed, sometimes bad, but it fit the character very well for being an outsider with authority. He hires and dismisses workers at random, but earns the respect of all but one of the employees by revolutionizing the advertising agency and seeking new ideas. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film was, and remains, incredibly risky, especially since the film was written and directed by a white man (Robert Downey, Sr.). However, this film declines to be a victim of the negative black stereotypes that would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre years later. While some of the sex scenes may be a bit unpleasant for some viewers, the main message is that a black owned and operated business can thrive through innovation and risk taking. It is possible that many people do not take a positive message from this movie, but I just did it. <br /> <br /> "Putney Swope" is still an overlooked movie in a strange time, and Downey, Sr. (even in spite of the recent publication of his comeback son) never got recognition as a director who I deserved. However, if you find a DVD of this movie, buy it and watch it. If you are on Netflix, ditto. It's a movie that can be confusing at times, but it's worth watching for its enthusiasm, ambition and non-conformist stature, even by today's movie standards.
