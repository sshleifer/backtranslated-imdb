Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote to Mishima, and in doing so, they clearly drew parallels between the life of Yukio Mishima and his work. The film is divided into four sections: beauty, art, action and the fateful day when Mishima took an army general hostage and spoke to the garrison, only to ridicule him and his Bushido ideals of the samurai code. Mishima performed the ritual seppuku on November 25, 1970, and planned it as a mixture of beauty, art and action. Schrader edits scenes that recreate that day with three different scenarios from Mishima's novels: the Golden Pavilion Temple, the Kyoko House and the Fugitive Horses. The moment of seppuku is perfectly performed in relation to its shocking climax when removing the camera at the same time it approaches. <br /> <br /> The black and white sequences intermingle with the colorful moments that appear in Mishima's novels. The black and white scenes represent memories of Mishima's childhood and youth. Schrader relates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from the novels that are often parallel to Mishima's real life, such as his stuttering, the development of his obsession with bodybuilding and his promotion of the samurai code. Each of the three themes of beauty, art and action is exemplified in the chosen representations of the respective novels. The color sequences are reminiscent of the early Technicolor theatrical films, which give the film, perhaps, a surreal quality planned with the theme in mind. <br /> <br /> Ken Ogata plays the real Mishima with an unwavering determination, and went to the general's office. on that fateful day and it looks like the real Mishima. Schrader risked tremendously with this film by focusing on the novels he made and linking them thematically with Mishima's personal life and his literary ambitions. The edition of the film between the three main sections of November 25, 1970, the segments of growth in black and white and the scenes of colorful novels point clearly to the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art and action in the life of Mishima Sometimes, it is difficult to follow, and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated viewer. *** of 4 stars.
