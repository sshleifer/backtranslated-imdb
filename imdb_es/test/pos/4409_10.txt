Just to correct something in a previous review here, I do not think that this film is only for people who know London, it is a very specific situation that is used to make universal comments. Jack Rosenthal says in an introduction to the script published that these were characters who, through this test of strenuous knowledge, obtain a certain degree of self-knowledge. <br /> <br /> I think it's one of the most perfectly written dramas I've seen: technically he's an expert at conveying quite complex details, but he's also happy with the way he involves you. At first, you do not know more about this test of knowledge of London than the main characters, but you acquire them together with them until it is of vital importance to you. You become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed, and you are crushed by those who do not. Especially one whose fall, without giving anything anyway, will make his hands fly to his face. <br /> <br /> Also as a fact, the character of Nigel Hawthorne, Mr. Burgess, is called Vampire, not Dracula. You do not need to know this, I am not saying it is crucial, but it is a measure of the drama: once you have seen this, you will want everyone to do it and evangelize about every detail. <br /> <br /> I hope you can see it. <br /> <br /> William
