The cinema, at its best, is entertainment. If all the aspects in which there is room for disagreement are questioned, and much of the recorded history is based on contemporary opinions, often biased, then one should leave the cinema, because their prejudices will always ruin their enjoyment. When I saw a plane flying over my head in a movie dated 33 BC, I had fun. The background landscape in "Casablanca" is absurdly false. So, do I set up a moan and say that the movie could not convince? Fiona, relax and enjoy an excellent performance. Wajda's decision to choose the protagonists as French and Poles was inspired. one was immediately aware of which side represented each of the main characters. No need to insist on the authenticity of the wigs. This is the powerful cinema. If there is a political message that is still relevant today, make a dinner, a Château d'Yquem with foie gras; a Puligny Montrachet with the entree; some Polish vodka sorbets and perhaps a 1961 Château Lafite-Rothschild with beef, and discuss the political aspects of Danton until he falls with fatigue. Danton surely would have accepted?
