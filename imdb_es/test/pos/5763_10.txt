I have not written a review here in a long time, but I went back to see all the TV shows below, live shows, and I felt I had to share my opinion about this movie! It's, I think, the perfect comedy movie. It lacks the story lines of Lovey Dovey (I really would not call addiction to the rich with Gina Carbonara, right? Or he and Eddie would go nude ... not like love) that make the rest of the comedians go the good to the bad? he lacks the usual dilemmas that one must overcome in most other comedy movies ... unless he recounts the fact that he poisoned the guests and must escape the green vomit of the guests as a dilemma that is similar to other comedy movies ... No, this movie just starts and manages to do one thing AND ONE thing: make one laugh. What does one of the comedy films require? Laughter. This movie just laughs after laughing without filling in the laughter with serious shit like other comedy movies! That's why I call it, until now, the only perfect comedy film ever made, and I'll never stop seeing this beautiful movie! I applied Rick and Ade on such a fantastic genius!
