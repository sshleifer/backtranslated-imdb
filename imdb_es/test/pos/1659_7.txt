This 1955 film follows Tony le Stephanois, recently released from prison for robbery, while he undertakes the theft of his life. He joins his old friends from the group and they bring in an expert, cracker from Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directed.) He only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the United States and could not work in Hollywood.) The brightness of this movie is half an hour during the robbery. During all this time, there is no dialogue or music, only the dull sounds of digging into the floor or piercing the safe. This increases the suspense and attracts you. They escape with hundreds of millions of francs of jewels, but a jewel offered to a dancer by CÃ©sar attracts the attention of a trio of brutal brothers. They set out to get the stash for themselves and bring misfortune to their path. Great movie of theft / gangster, but I prefer J.-P. Melville's films in this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is like the lemonade I took last night. He had gone to a Caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugarcane juice instead of sugar. It also had a lot of ice and it weighed a lot on the lemons, leaving it quite bitter (what I like). The sugarcane juice imparted a subtle flavor and slightly softer than real sugar, and the ice made sure it was cold and refreshing while sucking it. 7.5 / 10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
