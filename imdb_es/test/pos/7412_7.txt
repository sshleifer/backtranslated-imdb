I just saw this movie in advance and, before reading my comment, you should know that it is very subjective because I love Techno, Trance, Club, home and music as well. <br /> <br /> The film is about Carl, whose brother Jason (or whatever his name was) died in an accident: he fell off a roof, "drunk." Carl meets his brother's girlfriend, Sunny, and the two are unmotivated by some kind of private investigation into Jason's death and Carl gets involved in Jason's previous life, which was full of clubs and drugs. The film itself, viewed from an artistic point of view, is nothing more than a large pile of s ** t. The plot is predictable, all the characters are extremely cliched and two-dimensional (stupid boy from a small town, innocent and pretty girl, great king of evil drugs ... the list is endless) and most actors, like The Plot It simply is not credible. The performance of Matthew Rhys of the stupid child who comes to Greater London and the sudden use of drugs by people he does not even know does not seem very credible, unlike his female counterpart Sunny, played by Sienna Guillory, whose behavior seems more realistic to him. viewer. Nothing more than a joke was the performance of Tim Curry of the king of drugs Damian: a fake caricature, too "eeeevil" and too ridiculous to be true. <br /> <br /> BUT: If you like club music (club scenes like the selected tracks are just brilliant), if you enjoy a simple love story with a sweet girl like Sunny (yes, I confess , I lost my heart;) ... that makes my comment even more subjective, I suppose) with some twists and turns (predictable) that you will definitely enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Any other person: FORGET IT .... IT! <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 (objective view) <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 (my personal opinion and also my final vote)
