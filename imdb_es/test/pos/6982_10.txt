(VERY moderately rowdy) <br /> <br /> I have to start by saying that I'm not normally impressed by science fiction, which is why Pitch Black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. I was hooked from the beginning with the rhythm, the intensity and the visual outburst that left me fascinated and stuck to my seat. I am very happy to say that this movie was the best piece of science fiction (well, at least * one * of the best) I've seen in a long, long time. <br /> <br /> The plot In short, it may seem simple: a (space) ship crashes on a supposedly desert planet and the captain, Caroline Fry (the impressive Radha Mitchell), must guide survivors to safety . At first, a cold-blooded killer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays the role with a very credible spare style), may seem like the group's biggest problem, but as the twilight begins to creep in, the creatures of the night They begin to awaken ... This leads to a desperate attempt to escape from bloodthirsty predators, which, as we can all guess, does not lead to a happy family picnic. <br /> <br /> It is not the plot itself that makes it worthwhile to watch the movie. - After all, let's be honest, if you decipher it to the basics, it is not * the * original, but the skill with which it is counted. The story flowed forward, it did not leave me yawning (at least not much) at any point. The management was a fabulous job. This was a very visual film, even beautiful; The purple view of the night was a real pleasure. Although, 'beautiful' might not be the right word to use; Yes, the images shown were sweet to the eye, but they also added a touch of unspecified grotesqueness, restlessness, as if something were about to explode from below the fixed surface. (Not to mention that the monsters were really well made, they seemed realistic, which seems to be weird nowadays [maybe people do not mind that they look real ...]) <br /> <br /> I No he only enjoyed the visual side of the film, but also the psychological aspect of the story. During the movie, we can see how the characters unravel, some of them fall, others rise, but what fascinated me the most was the development of Riddick's character. I enjoyed watching the change in him throughout the movie. To go even further, the other thing that I enjoyed a lot with Riddick was the incredibly good and originally executed UST (Sexual Stress Without Resolving) between Fry and him that "no" (you'll get what I want to say once you see it). [One can not deny that they had chemistry. I do not even try it or I'll look for it and I'll listen to it by playing Chopsticks until I scream * smile *] I was cool. As Radha Mitchell said (a modified quote), "Pitch Black is a really sexy movie without sex", which is what makes it even more interesting. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize, I recommend this movie, even if you really are not a fan of "space stories". The suspense was maintained until the end and, importantly, they left us (or at least me) we were left wanting more. If you can not bother thinking about psychology, subtext and so on (as is my bad habit), you will still find Pitch Black very entertaining. Just take off your shoes and enjoy.
