After seeing the 'oh so acclaimed' Fargo and thinking it was nothing more than the average, I was rambling on whether it would be a good idea to rent another 'masterpiece' from the Coens. This time it disappointed me much less than with Fargo and I must say that most of the credit is due to good jokes and the good performance of George Clooney. Well done, Mr. Clooney, do more of these and less 'Perfect Stormish' movies. You can act and you showed it here. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
