I saw this performance on television and I recorded it. My daughter played again and again. I went to work and everyone loved it. It's just brilliant physical comedy. Bill made an appearance here in California (he was working and living in New York) and did the Regard of Flight on stage. I was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> Bill received a federal donation, and my daughter wrote a congratulatory letter, and Bill was kind enough to write a note and attach a photograph. <br /> <br /> People ask me, and I can not decide if it's a comedian, an actor or a clown. Actually he is the three. I really wish this was on DVD, my tape is lost.
