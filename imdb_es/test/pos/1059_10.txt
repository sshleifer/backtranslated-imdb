Barbara Stanwyck is a delight in this war comedy, about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a family of writers of popular magazines, on his farm in Connecticut. The problem is that she does not have a husband, baby or farm, as she writes in her column, and she can not even cook; his wonderful recipes were provided by his good friend "Uncle" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City. <br /> <br /> Things get even more complicated when your boss of strict editors is invited to Christmas. A plan is planned hastily, with his cranky fianc√© providing a real Connecticut farm, neighbors who provide a borrowed baby and a quick wedding planned when the publisher is not looking. But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve, romantic complications occur, since the author, supposedly married, falls like a ton of bricks to the kind man of the Navy and vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is a charming and warm film that skillfully balances humor with feeling and is a wonderful showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to show her considerable comedic talent, aided by such wonderful actors as Sydney Greenstreet, Una O ' Connor, SZSakall and many others. A Christmas night dance at the town hall is a delight to watch, and the surprisingly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise to viewers who have seen her mostly as tough and malicious women in roles of a femme fatale. Truly a wonderful movie that has withstood the test of time.
