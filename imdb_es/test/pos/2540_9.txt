in his descriptions of CAA, platinum cards in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, a Provincetown vacation he never took, and free travel to Nicaragua funded by Columbia photographs. <br /> <br /> It sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (possibly due to his unusual personality) attacks the audience, laughs at himself (maybe because he did not take the Hollywood thing so seriously) and worries us. <br /> <br /> This monologue is not just a theme "The extermination camps" or "Swim to Cambodia"; It is more a pastiche of events, as he sees them. Some of the lines are classic, such as when Gray meets with talent agents estimated at CAA. The conference table is ... "full of them, tanned, healthy, fresh from drinking blue-green algae from an Oregon lake ... now there are no drugs in Hollywood". <br /> <br /> This was before The tragedy happened. Many of us will miss your unbalanced mood. 9/10.
