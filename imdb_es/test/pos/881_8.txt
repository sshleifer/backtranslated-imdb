Unlike Bond and other detective films, the hero of Alfred Hitchcock used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his insight and courage (and luck) would come out of it. Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and, in a way, is the tribute of Vijay Anand to the master of suspense. The homage as it may be, but it has its own foundations and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a common man Vinay who one day realizes he has a double named Amar. who is really a jewel thief. Suddenly, Vinay finds herself in the middle of a hatching plan and, to save herself, she goes hunting for a wild goose to find this Amar who stays a step ahead of him. The suspense is almost killing throughout the film and, as the plot unravels, is impacted by the brilliance of the scheme. Like the Hitchcock films, Jewel Thief can boast a great climax filmed inside the great palace of Sikkim. <br /> <br /> Everyone and I refer to everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyanti Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri, etc. They are in their best forms. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.
