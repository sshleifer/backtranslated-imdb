Most of the silent films I've seen have been serious by nature, so it was fun to see one with a comical touch. The stage and some of the scenes of "The Beloved Rogue" are reminiscent of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" of 1923 in relation to the street scenes of Paris and the celebration of the "King of the crazy people". John Barrymore plays the greatest poet of France, Fran√ßois Villon, in a characterization that covers quite widely, from the virtual slapstick to the romantic tender; that bit of 'water in wine' at the beginning of the image was quite fun. <br /> <br /> It seems that times never change, and it's interesting to see that the film makes a convincing observation nearly a century ago: Paris has it all. reign for one night, while everywhere there is one all the time. How true <br /> <br /> The appearance of Conrad Veidt in the film was a little surprising for this viewer, I have only seen him as Major Strasser in "Casablanca", one of his last films. As King Louis XI, he is a monarch obsessed with astrology, cunning but suspicious, and it was a little disconcerting to see how he looked very much like Brad Dourif's Wormtounge character from the final chapter of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Not exactly exuding the confidence that a King of France could hope to have. That is why the dominance of the Duke of Burgundy (Lawson Butt) seemed all the more plausible, until Villon was up to the occasion to put one over the two rulers. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that the use of title cards was extremely leftover, they were used only when it was absolutely necessary to advance the story. Without them, however, one would have lost a curious nugget. It seems that Villon carried out his exile from Paris in the hostel of Lame Flea! <br /> <br /> The impression I saw was of exceptional quality, the first film to be featured in a set of one hundred action films and a DVD thriller by Mill Creek Entertainment, which says something for a movie that is now eighty years old . It's great that the films of the silent era now find a wider distribution in this type of commercial format, making them accessible to a whole new generation of movie lovers. <br /> <br /> One question: is it similar to Conrad Veidt? Did King Louis bit his nose on purpose, or as an involuntary gesture that simply remained safe from the cutting room?
