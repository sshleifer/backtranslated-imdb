My wife and I loved this movie. Intelligent dialogue, great characters, intelligent construction of the plot. The rhythm in this movie is non-stop. I could not even get to the kitchen for some sandwiches. We have never seen Corey Feldman so funny. Taylor Nichols plays a good Fed ... my wife loves him on the HBO show "Married Man". The cast of the set was all strong. The turn at the end encouraged us. That's why we give this movie a "Standing O".
