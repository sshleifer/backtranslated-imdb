Pink Flamingos: a representation of the society's past <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos, a film directed by John Waters in 1972, is a very disturbing portrait of the negative impact that a traumatized childhood can have on the future life. Babs Johnson grew up in a very unusual house. Apparently, you can see the impact that this had on society through their actions until the end where it envelops the dogs' feces. Was this movie just a sickly twisted perversion of endless heartbreaking events, or was it symbolic of something much deeper? Next to the first would be the easy exit and next door with the latter may seem crazy, but possibly true. The film has some credible resemblance to the real events of our social past. Every leader that we, as people, see as 'horrible' shows characteristics similar to those of Babs Johnson. Ivan the Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolph Hitler and Joseph Staling had a 'worrying' childhood. Babs Johnson had a problematic childhood and, therefore, is associated in the same class as all the rulers mentioned above. That's why a lot of your actions throughout the movie can be seen as disturbing. However, her actions were her fault or that of society for letting her grow as she did. In addition, each character in this movie represents a past leader or an event. Another coincidence is Edith's obsession with eggs. With an open mind, this can be linked to the genocide and Hitler's attempt to annihilate the Jews. Some see Hitler as a genius, others as a madman. John Waters must have seen him as a crazy man because his Edith representation was mentally ill. Edith's son, Crackers, and his traveling companion, Cotton, symbolize what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery. Both names are slang terms that represent a period of time that most of us would prefer to forget. These characters are crucial in that they point out that, on some occasions, our society in the United States was no better than what we often consider horrendous acts of social attack in other cultures. The f ** king chicken scene is the epitome of what was wrong with our society in this period of time and it is still wrong. Chicken, is a slang term of the 70s for women. Therefore, it is possible that John Waters is trying to bring to light the issue of rape through the actions of Cotton and Crackers. The antagonist family, if a single antagonist can be determined in this film, was Marble's. Marble is often mentioned in association with wealth. Therefore, this can be a symbol of the struggle between the poor and the rich, a struggle that continues today and will probably continue forever. Pink Flamingos is a monumental film because of its disturbing scenes, but it must also be noted for its camouflaged political agenda that Waters exhibited so fluidly in its entirety.
