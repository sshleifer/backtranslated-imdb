This has to be one of the best movies we've seen and we highly recommend it for its exposure to the injustices of fanaticism. Billy Wirth is an incomparable and truly amazing actor like Corby / White Wolf. However, he felt that the story would have been improved if his character had more scenes. This is a movie that can be seen again and again without getting tired.
