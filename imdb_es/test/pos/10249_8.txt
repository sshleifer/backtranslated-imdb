On the surface, COOLEY HIGH is an agile ensemble comedy disguised as a period piece (set in the early 60s, complete with an impeccable Motown soundtrack). But there is much more in this movie: it improves every time I see it. The cast of unknowns (at that time) is excellent, and it is remarkable as a totally black film that does not fit into any clich√©s of the blaxite. On occasion, COOLEY HIGH almost looks like an updated urban New York movie. with a lot of nervous humor added. Sometimes, the fairly tight budget is shown, but the limitations actually serve the film well; Here is a sharpness and honesty of emotion that gives the film an immediacy that is lacking in most similar-minded movies (like Later, Schultz 'CAR WASH, which was more popular, but largely meaningless.) good heart, but also real, this could be one of the sleepers of the 70s: held at that time, it seems that few movie fans know this today. Your loss: this is a thin and thin film. <br /> <br /> The scanning and scanning DVD (without widescreen !?) is a test of how poorly maintained this excellent movie is.
