"The Desperadoes" (1943) is a genuine classic, not because of its history (which is quite routine), but because of its technical production elements. This was a western landmark, the biggest one at the time of its launch and even more unique because it was a Columbia production, a light studio with a background reputation. Only Fox's "Jesse James" (also starring Randolph Scott) a few years earlier treated the genre. Although it would be eclipsed in a few years by "The Searchers" and "High Noon", "The Desperadoes" was an innovative effort and a historical treasure. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the economy of the city of Red Valley, Utah, is based on rounding and selling wild horses to the Union Army. The script got a little dirty here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in the future of Utah) and the Last Battle of Custer (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important elements Of the plot. <br /> <br /> Red Valley has an honest sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; stealing his own bank every time the government pays for a herd of horses. The city is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a famous outlaw who is an old friend of Steve's. He wants to keep going, especially after falling in love with the beautiful owner of the barn, Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes). Cheyenne's partner "Nitro" Rankin (Guinn "Big Boy" Williams) is there mainly to provide comic relief, as are Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and city judge (Raymond Walburn, who models his character in the crystal ball "Wizard of Oz" by Frank Morgan faker). <br /> <br /> Do not risk your big budget, Columbia filled this action with tons of action and all the elements of the western movies, except the Indians and the covered cars. There is the best stampede of wild horses ever filmed, a spectacular fight at the bar, an explosive climax, romance and technicolor of three bands. All this does not necessarily fit, but who would care in 1943. Unity is a problem, as it tries to be a Western action and a comedy. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was probably the best of all times at the time of filming. The interior scenes are solid, but it is the outdoor naturalist photography that is really impressive; Both the static lyrical shots and the shooting of the moving camera of the action sequences. <br /> <br /> Scott and Claire Trevor were the best, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, who would soon be its biggest star. And director Charles Vidor used the film to show his new wife Keyes (whose portrayal of Scarlett's sister in "Gone With the Wind" had connected with the audience more than any small part in the history of the films). <br /> <br /> The dynamics of Ford-Keyes is the most unique and important feature of "The Desperadoes". Instead of opting for the clich√© "love triangle" with Scott and / or Trevor (which seems to happen for the first time), the whole romantic focus is on the two younger actors. Probably this was the best role Keyes got and she makes the most of it. She plays a scruffy but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both pants and leather dresses, and who rides and fights like Kiera Knightley's character in "Pirates of the Caribbean." This was revolutionary at that time and coincided with the formation in 1942 of WAAC for the military service of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> "The Desperadoes" is a film that has been well taken care of and the impression seems to be completely new. Unfortunately there are no special features on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
