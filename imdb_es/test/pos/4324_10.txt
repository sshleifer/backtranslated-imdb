First of all, I just have to say that I am a big fan of LOST. Everyone who makes the show, I love them. It has everything in it, really. <br /> <br /> I'm glad you have excellent people who do it, for example, Jack Bender is the best director, well, maybe after J.J. Abrams. And, of course, all the credit for Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse. They are geniuses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the end of season 2 is definitely one of the best episodes of LOST ever !!! Live Together, Die Alone focuses on the story of Desmond David Hume on how to get to the island, and Henry Ian Cusick is a great character of that character. The creators of the show would have been very stupid if they had allowed the old Desires to die. <br /> <br /> Then, at LOST, the survivors of the plane crash have been there for 65 days ... 65 days man While Rousseau has been there for 16 years, and the Others have been there by God knows how long. Referring to Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof & Abrams. Anyway, I hope we get the answers we need, in season 3. I can not wait! My vote is nine.
