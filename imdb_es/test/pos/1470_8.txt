Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park, finally come out of their exhausting program to talk to the cameras while drinking champagne in their Jacuzzi. At first, seeing this, I did not feel as much sarcasm as in this. I knew they were joking when they complained about the different actors in the show and when Trey said he was not going to give his mother any of his money, but there is so much sarcasm in this documentary, which is more of a mockumentary. Full of jokes <br /> <br /> This "documentary" shows everything about South Park (until the second season). It shows what happens behind the scenes with animation and recording. He has interviews, many of which are false interviews, but some, among all the fabrications, give an idea of ​​the show. The clips of the two Trey Parker Spirit of Christmas shorts are shown, as well as many good clips from the show. If you were a South Park fan, then this should have quenched your thirst for knowledge by the end of 1998 when this was done. Now, obviously, the program has changed, but this is still interesting. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a funny documentary where Trey Parker (especially) and Matt Stone appear as arrogant imbeciles, and that's exactly what I wanted to come out like they can be like that in real life, but here it was a joke, a revealing 51-minute joke. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** of ****. 51 minutes Not qualified, it contains language and sexual content.
