Once again, Elmer faces the dilemma of who to shoot. Daffy bugs. He is not sure what season it is and Bunny and Duck argue that the help does not matter. Although Bugs proves that he is the smartest one again using Daffy's inverse psychology in increasingly subtle ways. And when that is over, he makes his clothing mark. Daffy is scared and demands that the bunny be shot. Although Elmer is too stupid, he is hopelessly in love with the bunny girl. Elmer is really to blame for all this. If he was not so stupid, he would REALLY know it's the season of the ducks and just lash out at Daffy. But poor old Daff can not believe the absurdity of the situation. His cruel plans of bad direction have been frustrated by Elmer's stupidity. Daffy is so surprised that he even goes home with Elmer to be mistreated in his living room. <br /> <br /> Poor Daff. He rules!
