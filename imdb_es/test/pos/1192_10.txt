I will not say anything about music, because this subject can be so deep that it can become a great separate review, so let's focus on a brilliant movie ... Without a doubt, one of Forman's best works. <Br /> <br /> The simple story about love, friendship, freedom and ideals ... oh, yes, the ideals by which even pacifists are ready to go to war ... <br /> <br /> There is not only one. false word, only false character, only false feeling in history, because love, freedom and friendship is not something complicated for the characters in the film. These things are not something that "everyone can see from a different angle" These are not things that need much reflection to understand ... their love is simple, their friendship is simple, their ideals are as simple as the word "simple" in himself and that's why these characters are so profound. <br /> <br /> Berger, the leader of a hippie played by Treat Williams is a guy who lives to live and that is the greatest happiness for him ... he has his ass - (as he sings in one of the scenes of the film) and that's enough to make him happy with his property ... <br /> <br /> Berger never accepts that something can not be done ... and his right ... If he wants to go to the banquet of some rich men with their dirty old clothes and their long and huge hair, they will ... if they want to go to another state to see their friend, they will ... It's ... they never think twice ... they just do it . <br /> <br /> How? Why is it so powerful? The answer is simple: because it is FREE. <br /> <br /> Just watch how the wind makes the hair curl in this movie and you'll understand everything, maybe you'll even free yourself.
