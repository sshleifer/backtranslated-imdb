Ed (coincidentally an editor) is hired to reduce the horror films to be favorable in Europe (where the standards are much more rigorous). But he finds that the movies are very destructive and he starts to get a little crazy. Okay, "a little" could be a euphemism. <br /> <br /> Let me say this first of all: better. opening. scene. forever. A man in an office popping his head with a grenade. Your boss then says - with a serious face - "you're fired." The whole movie does not maintain this level of intensity, but it certainly tries. <br /> <br /> Take the shotgun scenes, the beheading, the "Lost Limbs" clips (which my friend Jason wanted to be a true movie). ). The writer of this film thought of the idea of ​​a woman who was raped by a beaver and immediately afterwards shot in the face with a bazooka. That is something that you will not find in any other movie (at least, I have doubts that you will). <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in this movie is the quality. The image is not as sharp as a 1997 movie should be, and the sound could be retouched (although not bad). I thought I was watching a movie from the eighties. Although that gave me a little momentum in my mind, the film also had the style of writing and direction of the 1980s: a sense of fun and a little more for the audience. I miss those days. <br /> <br /> I wish I had more to say, although at this moment I can not think of anything strong enough to praise this movie. I think you should see this. You have seen the box in your video store with the ax dividing its head ... perhaps you have passed it several times. Maybe you thought it would be corny. Collect it. Savor it.
