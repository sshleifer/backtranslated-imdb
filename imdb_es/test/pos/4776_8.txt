Created in 1928, and originally called Mortimer before Walt Disney changed his name (because his wife convinced him), Mickey Mouse has become the staple of the Disney brand. I always thought that this caricature was the first caricature of Mickey, in fact it is the third one, but it does not matter, for a short animated six minutes it's nice. The story sees Mickey piloting a steamboat until Captain Pete pulls him off the bridge, stops to pick up the cargo and Minnie Mouse loses the boat. Lifting it, he drops his scores and a goat eats them. Mickey helps her spin the tail and plays the melody, and gets other animals to be percussed, until Pete stops again, causing Mickey to peel the potatoes. Mickey Mouse was number 53 in The 100 best icons of pop culture, and number 31 in The 100 best cartoons. Very well!
