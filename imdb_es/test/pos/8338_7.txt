Charles "Chic" Sales is absolutely fantastic as the only member of the Leeds family who is willing to testify against a gangster who saw a policeman and an informant murdered. He fought in Bull Run in the Civil War and his patriotism is high, even after his son-in-law is beaten and one of his grandchildren is kidnapped by the gang, intimidating all the other members. The fear of his grandchild's death is not an excuse, he says. Anyway, he would not want his grandson to live in a country run by gang members. The conflict between civic duty and personal security is clearly affected in this Oscar nominated story. Walter Huston is also a standout as the district attorney for tough driving who threatens the family with perjury if they do not support his identification of the killer in court. The rest of the cast, including the shoddy assassin, Ralph Ince, are excellent, and the film is impeccably directed by William A. Wellman. There is also good suspense, since the sales disappear just when the trial is about to begin.
