The self-awakening of humanity is the theme of "2001: a space odyssey", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. "We see" our primordial past, and "infer" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our collective journey in progress. <br /> <br /> From this transcendental perspective, a conventional egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frantic conflicts and our self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is beyond comprehension. It is a hard lesson for a vain and aggressive species. It's no wonder then that some of us resplendent about the film's slow and minimal history. For perceptive viewers, compensation is an inspiring sense of wonder and admiration. <br /> <br /> In this film, which is mainly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think that the black and elegant monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Perhaps. Undoubtedly, the monolith is a visual metaphor of an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. The mystery is deeper than the explanation. <br /> <br /> "2001 ..." is unique among the films in content and scope. The cinematography is out of this world, the visual and special effects are impressive, and the classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe a movie. But "2001: A Space Odyssey" by Stanley Kubrick is art in the highest sense, such as "Mona Lisa" by Leonardo da Vinci, or "Starry Night" by Vincent van Gogh.
