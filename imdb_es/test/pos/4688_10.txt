Hello, I must say that you have incorrect information about the series here. The main author was Richard Carpenter, he created the series. Later there were other authors, but they only made some episodes. <br /> <br /> The first director who made most of the series (I think in the complete series 1) was Ian Sharp, who created the distinctive look of Sherwood's Robin. <br /> <br /> Clannad did see some of the material and read the scrips. I know for sure because Richard Carpenter said it in a scam in England last year. <br /> <br /> I think this is a masterpiece of Television-Entertainment, because it has great characters and cast, good costumes and a great story. lines. For me it is still one of the best television series!
