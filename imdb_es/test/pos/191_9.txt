The film by director Mikhail Kalatozov The Cranes are Flying (Letyat zhuravli) is a work of glorious cinema. From the script of Viktor Rozov, based on his own work, Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering of those who stay at home. Flooded with innumerable war films that show us the fronts and the carnage, the subject itself becomes tedious and avoidable. However, this Russian gem shows how the history of difficulties can be told in a different way; By telling us, directly from the mouth of a soldier how everyone hates war, that they hope that those who died have done so for a cause that allows peace and an end to the struggle, we see a new vision of World War II. We have young men who volunteer to wage war for peace, to keep their families and loved ones safe at home, instead of recruits fighting in a battle they do not believe in. With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East and how people die for no reason, against their will, it is good to see a movie that shows how selfless and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those waiting for their return . <br /> <br /> Communist Russia shows how involved everyone was in the war. While Boris volunteered to go to the front line, his father is the head doctor of a hospital that helps heal the wounded soldiers and his sister is helping him there, like his girl Veronika, doing everything possible to keep your mind out of the ordinary. fact that no letter of his love has arrived. A whole city goes out to dismiss the children in celebration. Even the factory where they work Boris and his friend Stepan send representatives with gifts of gratitude. If all this is a glorified look at Russia at the beginning of World War II or not, I do not know. There are no protests or bad words from these guys who risk their lives for a country, everything is a compliment and gratitude. Some in the United States could learn a lesson from this, whether they agree with the war in question or not, protesting and wreaking havoc on their behalf only tarnishes what these men and women are sacrificing each day. <br /> <br /> The performance is top notch in everything, but some deserve to be singled out. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris's grandmother. She is the only member of the family she can trust and her sadness at leaving is very evident in her face and in her body language. Vasili Merkuryev, like patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings what may be the best performance. As it was said at the end, about the parents who need to contain the hidden tears, Merkuryev summarizes those feelings. He has a tough exterior, especially joking and riding his son hard when he learns of his volunteering just a few hours before he has to leave. But when Boris leaves to go to the meeting place, we see the true pain of the man, sitting at the table with sorrow. He loves his son very much and, although he can not show it, his actions throughout the film are expressed to the public. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris, a carefree and idealistic young man, who does what he thinks is right, and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villain Mark, who stays at home because of his talent for the piano, or maybe just for stealing his cousin's love That love, played by Tatyana Samojlova, really draws the audience to its pain, dejection and a slight glimmer of hope. The true star of the film, must go through many emotions in a trip in which he loses the course, needing to return to the course, hoping that he did it soon enough for the return of Boris. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realism of the story, in addition to not being afraid to use the tragedy to convey the theme, I also loved the visual style of the film. The cinematography of Sergei Urusevsky is incredible, especially when one considers that the film was filmed in full screen. It's one thing to create impressive compositions in a widescreen panorama; It is completely different to do it in a square frame. From the beginning, we received a beautiful static photo of a winding road along the water, a bridge in the background at the top, while our two lovers jump across the screen to the distance. There are multiple instances in which the camera is behind the barriers and still allows the action to be seen, creating a unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are used, as well as a careful block to allow over head shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of the characters in a painting. <br /> <br /> The real feats, however, are the instances of the long take. Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers, it is magnificent before as she visits those who bid farewell to their loved ones while looking for Boris, so it is necessary to say goodbye to her. The planning of this shot must have been extensive, as while she weaves in and out of people, the camera focuses on couples kissing, people shouting at each other, and more, all purposefully in the frame at specific times while the camera get moving. All of them needed to hit their mark with precision and that leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. It's just part of a global masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows the success of the placement and the staging in showing the public what you need in the simplest way possible. The composition and professionalism of the actors and the team can do wonders, adding something that can never make huge pieces and special effects.
