Only the British could make a movie like this and make it so lovely! Betty (Brenda Blethyn) wants something more from life, but she does not know what, when she realizes that she is in love with her childhood friend, Boris (Alfred Molina), who is the owner of the local funeral home. Meanwhile, an American mortician (Christopher Walken) who "wants to return the 'fun' to funerals" moves into this small Welsh community with his assistant (Lee Evans) and wants to give Boris a run for his money with flashy funerals and thematic . (The Star Trek funeral, anyone?) Brenda and Boris decide to arrange Brenda's death and funeral, with hilarious results. A very funny movie: if you're a fan of British comedies like "Waking Ned Devine", you'll love it.
