BLACK WATER has to be one of the best Australian films I've seen in many years. My girlfriend and I sat down grabbing each other's hands, jumping in all the right places. This is as much a crocodile movie as OPEN WATER was a shark movie. In other words, creatures are simply part of the dilemma, the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances. It is amazing to see how the directors Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich, the director, develop, which generate so much suspense and terror in such a modest situation. And when I say terror, it is not exaggerated, the moments of twisting built artificially, but smaller touches than when you ask yourself "how I would feel in that situation" lead you to conclude "scared without meaning". The performances were great, the rhythm and the magnificent cuts of other forms of life in the mangroves were excellent and the final moments of the film felt very good. This is an appropriate debut for two directors who, rightly, should feel very proud. Go and see this suspense film very beautifully filmed and performed.
