After seeing Oldboy, I was a little disappointed with the rest of Park's work, some of it is good, but it never gets close to the level of humor and originality that Oldboy had. This one is not like Oldboy in the plot or style, but the same level of quality is there. <br /> <br /> The acting is good with Kang-ho Song, OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin delivering excellent performances. Kim, in particular, manages to go from the horrifying scenes of horror to the surrealist comedy without the slightest mistake. <br /> <br /> The plot is strange with many twists and turns and it gives a big blow to vampire clich√©s. <Br /> <br /> The direction is perfect with tons of rhythm and humor throughout and some of the most memorable scenes I've seen. It boasts of what is probably the rarest love scene you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie.
