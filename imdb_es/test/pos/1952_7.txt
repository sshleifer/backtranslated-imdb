The preteen looking for pot Joshua Miller (as Tim) pulls his sister's doll to the river while Daniel Roebuck (as Samson) howls and smokes a cigarette, after killing Danyi Deats (as Jamie). The doll is washed, but the naked young woman stays next to the "Edge of the river", so that any passer-by can see it. Looking at the corpse there is a group of twenty-teen teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. Stoners Keanu Reeves (as Matt) and Crispin Glover (as Layne) are the most worthy of the camera. Friends wonder what to do with their guilty killer friend and beer drinker. <br /> <br /> The veteran in the cast Dennis Hopper (as Feck) keeps the heads of the young people fed. Mr. Hopper once killed a woman. Live with one of those life-size sex dolls, with a mouth apparently ready for action. Ione Skye Leitch (as Clarissa) is a livelier doll, and is waiting for Reeves to kiss her. Its copula is remarkably transverse with a retraction to the opening strangulation. A real teenager, in her first lead role, Mrs. Leitch is the daughter of the singer Donovan of the sixties. Make other extravagant connections on your own. <br /> <br /> You can read a lot about the movie, or not, depending on your mood. Some of the backgrounds of the characters may be a little too subtle. Obviously, the murderous teenager was teased; note your weight, attitude and nickname connected to the "toilet". Some of the relationships and motivations of the characters are too vaguely defined, but the cast certainly keeps the material interesting; and director Tim Hunter, photographer Frederick Elmes and writer Neal Jim√©nez are obviously experts. <br /> <br /> ******* River's Edge (08/27/86) Tim Hunter ~ Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Dennis Hopper, Joshua Miller
