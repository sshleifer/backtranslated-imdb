OK, why complain about this movie? It's fiction to deal with it. If you want to see the biography, go see it. This is an original and fictional version of what happened in Wisconsin. People who are obsessed will complain about this, since they make any other deviation from the facts. Sad but true. I think making Kane Hodder the man for whom the movie bears his name was a great idea. I thought it was not so good at first, I'll be honest. But that made it even more terrifying. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein or movies based on real events, I think this is a good movie. But if you're obsessed (like other people), get away from this movie and all the others.
