This documentary about the life and comedy of Bill Hicks presents fragments of Hicks' "Revelations" and other standing concerts. It also includes interviews with fellow comedians and people from the industry who knew him, as well as reporters and journalists who talk about how his political comment was crude and brutal. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it a lot. I had already seen "Revelations" but the comedy clips were still refreshing. It is a good balance of comedy and documentary that will explain the popularity of Hicks to non-fans and will please those who are already familiar with him. <br /> <br /> I rated it with ten.
