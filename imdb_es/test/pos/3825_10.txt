What can I say about the series known as the NEW EXTERNAL LIMITS ... Mmm ... just that this was one of the best television series ever assembled? You have actors of all ages, actors who are known and that time forgot. Everyone doing their part to exact perfection! These programs always have some kind of moral history that most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice doubles in the credits and at the beginning and at the end believes what he is saying with all his heart! These programs not only have a great history, they also throw you towards you, speed up your mind and pump your blood. The original outer limits were a black and white right of the 60's. These programs made a triumphant comeback like never before seen! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun to watch, but the NEW EXTERNAL LIMITS are where they are! If you have not seen it: I beg you to review these episodes and you will see exactly what I want to say. LIVE THE NEW EXTERNAL LIMITS !!!!!!!!!!!!
