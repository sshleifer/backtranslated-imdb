I admit that I almost gave up watching TV shows. Why? Because most of them are doctors, forensics or some girl or boy, who can predict a murder by sitting on the toilet. But I must say that I was wrong when I saw the first episode of Oz, one of the most brilliant television programs to date. Oz is a program about maximum security prison and shows episodes in the life of each cellmate inside the prison and their frustrations. What I like about this show is the fact that it has the courage to show real life in prison without any annoying characters, stereotypes and unrealistic dialogues. Even though the characters in the show are not heroes, you quickly became attached to them and their life. Of course, there is a lot of violence in this program and some disturbing images of rape and drug use, but that is the point of this program; to present how brutal and frustrating life can be in prison ... hell, you can not show life in prison as a "clean environment" with "nice characters", right? Oz is perfect in every way, the actors are doing an excellent job and all the time of this show was launched very fast. The only thing I did not like in this program was the last season of the program, I think it became too strange and brutal and the ending was not satisfactory. But in general, Oz is still my favorite show on television so far, surpassing Sopranos and millions of CSI and Dr. House with only one main title. Bright show that has the balls to show what other shows are taking away from us; realism.
