It would seem that some previous critics have had their expectations too high when entering this film. I found it looking for something on the satellite channels (without knowing what) and I found it. I thought that for the title it could be one of the thousands of soft core porn movies that appeared regularly on movie channels, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although there was some male frontal nudity (in fact, more than your typical soft-core title: imagine!), This was not the focus of the film. It was just fun. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by my tastes: my recent projections included Before Night Falls and Europe, Europe (both excellent, IMHO). But I also enjoy the total mental closure when I watch a movie. Virtual Sexuality did this for me and that's not a bad thing!
