One has to be careful, who is told to watch 12-hour movies. It might be easy for people to assume that this is a kind of regular occurrence; in fact, even in the world of 'arthouse' cinema, such mammoth execution times are extremely rare, for obvious reasons. This is something that Hollywood and art film share in common: the generally accepted career time of 90 to 120 minutes, with a minority of films that dare to approach, but rarely exceed, the three-hour mark. <br /> <br /> For this reason, a movie like Out 1 (run time: 729 minutes) is a challenge for even the most hardened cinephile, and somehow explains why it has only been screened in a handful of and it is still extremely difficult. to find it. <br /> <br /> Originally designed as a television series by Nouvelle Vague's maverick director Jacques Rivette, he aroused little interest in French networks, and ended up receiving a brief theatrical career (Peter Watkins was forced to do the same with its brilliant pseudocumentary of nuclear war The War Game, although that had more to do with the censorship of the state that with the problems of the time of execution). Shown a couple of times in 1971, Out 1 has resurfaced in a handful of Rivette's retrospectives over the past two decades, and many of those who have seen it, including esteemed American critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, have considered it one of the best All the time movies. <br /> <br /> Is it? Well, yes, if you like Rivette. That alone is a great 'yes', since Jacques Rivette has never been a successful commercial director. Only two of his films were hits (Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), both excellent), and many are still hard to find on DVD today (Out 1 was only available on the Internet after a rare videotape was uploaded). However, he is highly respected within the film community and, with good reason, his playfully surrealist narratives, his sense of rhythm and the use of improvisation distinguish him as one of the most singular and satisfying filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Out 1 deals with a theme that is repeated throughout Rivette's work: the nature of acting, particularly in the context of theater and improvisation. His fascination with acting makes Rivette's films a much more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, as aspects of improvisation allow actors to play a much more active role in determining how the film is put together. Out 1 is broadly divided into four main narratives, which gradually intertwine and blur as the film unfolds: two composed by acting companies, each trying to devise postmodern theatrical adaptations of works by Aeschylus; the other two small individual thieves (played by Nouvelle Vague icons Jean-Pierre Léaud and Juliet Berto) pursue eccentric methods of making money; and a general plot that involves a mysterious conspiracy inspired by Balzac centered around an organization known as 'the thirteen'. <br /> <br /> As with any Rivette movie that presents a 'conspiracy' narrative, mysteries and secret organizations are little more than red herring. As the characters slowly explore and reveal themselves and their interpersonal plans and connections break down, the film becomes increasingly symbolic of the post-1968 boredom and decline of the ideals of that era. For a movie made in 1971, these were notoriously notable themes; another French director in Jean Eustache would approach this subject in an equally satisfactory way in his 1973 masterpiece, The Mother and the Whore. But this is not the limit of the scope of Out 1. <br /> <br /> It consists of eight episodes of approximately 90 minutes each (the beginning of each episode has a brief and abstract montage in black and white of the events of the previous chapter), Out 1 is no less visible than any quality television series, and you can even experience it better in one episode at a time. This does not mean that it does not remain a challenge, even when viewed in segments. Like most of Rivette's films, he uses the early hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot, and some of those early scenes (particularly the sequences that represent the actors' very abstract "exercises") seem endlessly long. However, these scenes are important, not only as an exploration of the improvisational acting methods that play a literal and metaphorical role in the film, but also as a method to adjust the viewer to the somewhat languid rhythm of the film. Paradoxically, long shots make long films much more tolerable for an audience, and this understanding of rhythm has led Rivette, along with more modern directors such as Michael Haneke and Béla Tarr, to create films with less commercial times than without However, they retain the ability to leave viewers captivated. <br /> <br /> In a movie that tries to act in many ways, the acting is fantastic. Many famous faces of Nouvelle Vague appear, among them the mentioned Léaud and Berto, the prominent Michel Lonsdale and regular Rivette Bulle Ogier. Even another legendary director in Eric Rohmer has a great cameo as Balzac's teacher who appears in a pivotal scene. The people and architecture of Paris c. 1971, however, seems to have an equally important role: the landscapes of the city, the crowd scenes and the interested spectators are paralyzed 1 on time, a document of a place at a point in history. <br /> <br /> After a little more than 720 minutes, the film ends with an incredibly brief enigmatic note; However, the exhausting journey that the viewer has undertaken is so full of possibilities, complexity and spontaneity, that he will be forgiven for wanting to start over from the beginning, or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters. For those who have seen many types of movies and think they have seen everything that the art form has to offer, Out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be many more things and diverge in many more directions than that allow the current conventions. For filmmakers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, this is something that should be appreciated.
