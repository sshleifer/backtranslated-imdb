I managed to see the premiere of this movie on MTV last night and I had to tell everyone that this movie brought thunder. Obviously, this movie will be more enjoyed by fans of the D, as it has a lot of jokes for those who have seen the HBO series and has more than enough D for the newest fans and the large number of future converts. The music really shines with the new songs "Kickapoo" (which is much better than it seems), "Master Exploder" (possibly the third best song in the world) and "Dude (I miss you totally)". There are a lot of great scenes (the chase of a car, the rock-off, the reunion) and the cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I could really go on for hours but I do not want to give away the movie. Go see it. You will not be disappointed.
