A caricature of SUPERMAN <br /> <br /> A huge shipment of gold is being sent across the country by train. Using ultramodern techniques, a sophisticated gang of hooded robbers try to attack gold. With the intrepid journalist Lois Lane as the only passenger on board, it is Superman to the rescue. But now that it has become a runaway train, can it even stop BILLION DOLLAR LIMITED? <br /> <br /> This was another in the series of excellent cartoons that Max Fleischer produced for Paramount Studio. They have great animation and fast and tense diagrams. Presented to be shown in cinemas, they are far ahead of their Saturday morning counterparts.
