The first time I saw this movie was in the early 80's on cable. It was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race and a lot of things that I'm sure I missed. However, about a year ago it came back to my life when I started enjoying it with my son. He is a bit young (9) for many of the topics it contains, but understands that hippy dancing is fun to watch, and has the idea that the ending is ironic. While I can not think of other films of this genre, he has an independent genius that I love. It also does a unique justice to Central Park. Most musicals get lost in me, one way or another. "Tommy" was above and with a heavy hand in the direction, "Oliver" seemed to be controlling the crowd on the silver screen, "The Wall" was a very important and very abstract selfish dribble, but upon hearing "Failure of The Flesh "by Hair Sounds good for our times today, as it did in the Eighties, as it must have been in the sixties ... truly timeless.
