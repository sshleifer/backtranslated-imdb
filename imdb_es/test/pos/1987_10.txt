The producers of this painting are the Hungarians. It is not because of a crazy artistic impulse that X and Z are capitalized in the titles, considering that the word 'isten' means 'god' in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian ... - Hum ... Is that so? <br /> <br /> Consider this movie as a sci-fi sibling 'A History of Violence'. Both films have in common the force of flying respective genres; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and 'none FX-ed as hell of hell' science fiction in which we are seeing at this moment. Everything he has has a meaning and is surrounded by details: the nod to Phil K. Dick (who wrote "In The Days of Perky Pat") when creating a fast food restaurant "Perky Pat". The nod to Stanley Kubrick using the 2001 denomination pattern; as IBM became HAL (a letter below in the alphabet) in the 1968 film, in eXistenZ 'classic lubricant spray' WD-40 becomes XE-60 (a letter above) when Allegra cleans the port of Pikul. The nod to David Cronenberg using the kind of witty formula of Videodrome ('Death to ...' & 'Long Live' ..) and taking another medium for the central theme of an image (TV in Videodrome, Videogames and virtual reality in eXistenZ In 1983, you entered a television set, you received a game in 1999. Welcome to Canada! <br /> <br /> The nod to good taste in obtaining the cinematography of Peter Suschitzky, the music of Howard Shore and Ronald The edition of Sanders (a winning team). For all those born in the early 80's with a super famicom, a genesis or an arcade stick in their hands, this movie sounds like a bell. Enough with the assent. The plot? "Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual reality game that takes advantage of the minds of the players", as we can see in the main details page of the film. That is the story in the story. For me, this image is about the presentation session of a "completely new virtual game" of a couple of "reality demonstrators" to destroy their programmer. I guess what we see in the last five minutes is reality, if reality exists. Jennifer Jason Leigh is always playing as a game designer in the game they are in and the end of the movie is reality, with video games like giggles, big furry dogs, plastic textures 'realistic Cronenbergy' (helmets and others) and the 9 mm pistols. . What you see is true. They play transcendent for about an hour (in this game, there is a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays the genius programmer of eXistenZ and Jude -Pikul - Law a marketing apprentice associated with the game of Allegra), play eXistenZ because Allegra He is very worried. the health of your pod (what you connect your nervous system, to play), she has to connect herself and Pikul to then win the game (Transcendenz) and return to the reality in which they kill Yevgeny Nourish, programmer of TranscendenZ. <br /> <br /> Playing eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is about facing your essence, facing your subconscious and at the same time creating a virtual reality that you will have to overcome in an unexpected way to win the game (playing the game, the girl who plays to Allegra, the 'reality demonstrator' becomes Allegra, a 'goddess of virtuality'. <br /> <br /> What game would Heidegger have played to feel his abstract term from Se-Sein? truly committed to the world? <br /> <br /> And what about Nietschze (yes, Friedrich, God is dead and you know what? Willem Dafoe represents him! God, the Mechanic -)? <br / > <br /> Yes, we build a narrative for ourselves, and losing this thread we continue from one day to the next, we disintegrate people as personalities; eXistenZ analyzes the fact that reality is the total perception of itself by part of anyone who really involved her, and sometimes we could get some beautiful things; A perception of virtuality in virtual reality.
