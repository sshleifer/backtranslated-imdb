Friend, I thought that this movie shook. Perfect to just sit alone and watch at 3 in the morning just with you and with a bottle. Are you thinking about WTF all the time you're watching? What's going to happen next ... uncle, you go with the girl? Well ... they are picking mushrooms ... this is strange ... but a bit creepy. Damn, this whole movie has an erotic, evil, evil, evil background, it's a subtle dance that keeps you attracted ... you're waiting for someone to be hit. But damn it ... WTF !? You get that and something else. For the morally infuriated stomach it is excellent to run to the toilet to vomit material. Any movie that can get that kind of reaction from you deserves a prize.
