The funniest movie in Britain I've ever seen, "The Supergrass" is a story of sex, drugs, cream teas and coast killings. Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmonson), average imbecile, wants to impress his supposed girlfriend, Andrea (Dawn French), because he thinks he is too respectful of the law. Therefore, to make her come with him to a romantic getaway, she comes up with a plan that might impress her and encourage her to spend some time with him. The problem is that Dennis' lie is that, somehow, he became involved in an international network of drug traffickers and, while he was telling him, a couple of policemen heard his boast and mistreated him. And so begins this ingenious movie, full of comedy and crude jokes. Dennis is hit in the local nick and, to the delight of the officers who arrested him, there seems to be no way out (Andrea's previous attempts to explain that everything was a lie were discarded by a hilarious "Stand by Your Man" tune by the two officers'). Next comes Commander Robertson (Ronald Allen), chief of intelligence, Scotland Yard. He makes a deal with Dennis, that if he helps him catch the drug dealers, then he will be released and allowed whatever he wants. Dennis agrees, and teamed up with Harvey Duncan (Peter Richardson), and Lesley Reynolds (Jennifer Saunders). The rest is an unforgettable experience that tickles the ribs, with Robbie Coltrane as Sarge Troy who adds a funny color to the film. His walk along the dry dock against "Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Two Tribes" is excellent, and probably the best scene in film history. Michael Elphick and Patrick Durkin wonderfully interpret the two officers who make out with Nick Dennis, and Alexei Sayle as a motorcycle cop is a laugh. If you want to see something good on Saturday nights, I suggest you rent it. You will not forget it!
