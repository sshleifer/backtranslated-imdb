My reaction to this remake of "The Italian Job" is probably irremediably mixed with the events that occur in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after I finished getting a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school to retrain. The money was still limited, but I no longer had to choose between watching a movie in theaters and paying bills (or having lunch), and the feeling of relief and gratitude I felt at that moment was enormous. Consequently, my enjoyment of "Italian work" was probably out of proportion to its real value. <br /> <br /> Still, I picked it up used on a DVD a few weeks ago and I saw it again, and I still enjoyed it immensely. I have never seen the original (although I have heard it is an absolute classic), but its modern-day counterpart is fully visible if you like the modern production values ​​applied to the plots and themes of old movies. <br /> <br /> What initially convinced me about this movie was the soundtrack: IMO, Don Davis, writes some of the most flexible soundtracks, with textures and with a nice aesthetic. IJ opens with an astute, ingenious and throbbing arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brushwork and quiet moments; He convinced me completely from the first seconds. And the whole movie is like that: I have not heard this type of music from soundtracks and pulsing since Stewart Copeland left the Police and started making soundtracks for films like "Rumble Fish". There are at least a dozen irresistibly marked motifs here, along with some remakes of pop songs that range from "good" to "inspired." For the people for whom the soundtrack is important, this movie is a delight. <br /> <br /> To the film: I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg, but he is well here as the protagonist, and the film does not ask him to do anything that he can not do well. He is the weakest "main" actor in the film, but that is because the rest of the cast is very strong, especially Donald Sutherland in a small part. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron result in solid, fat-free performances. Norton seems to be called by the majority (it is rumored that he really did not want to be in the movie), but he is still a natural even with 1/2 power. My only complaint with the casting and acting is with the character "Wrench", who seems to be a male model who pretends to be an actor. It seems that his part has been reduced to the film, and has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (although you can blame part of that for the size of the part and the "late" nature of the character). If I were a cynical guy, I would wonder who the actor went to get into this movie in such a supernumerary role. No, it will never happen ... <br /> <br /> Production values, camera work, acrobatics, the plot ... everything is cooked very well and Gray and his production team come together perfectly (with the exception of "Key" character, see above). <br /> <br /> The dialogue has a nice, light touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several rewards of satisfying major and minor plots along the way. (My favorite moment: when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he has just lost the element of surprise.) Wahlberg proceeds to Norton's cold cock with a right cross, and then asks, "Did it surprise you?" Hmmm, maybe you had to be there ...) <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie requires a certain level of "suspension of disbelief" to work, but if you just relax and keep going (and do not think too much about the topic). The mechanics of deciphering underwater insurance, or the possibility that someone can hack and successfully manipulate LA traffic through a laptop, etc., will have a fun trip. <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job": it is a light fluff of summer, but it is very good for what it is and does not try to be anything else. It is not good enough for an "8", but I would give it a "7.5".
