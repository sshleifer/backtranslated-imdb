I enjoyed this movie immensely. I really like movies where females kick a lot, so this movie already had my hopes for decent entertainment. My hopes were met and exceeded less than 20 minutes in the movie. The action, the humor and the ingenuity that this film contained made it easily one of my favorite movies of all time. I had Sam Jackson and his undeniable presence on the screen, Geena Davis, like I've never seen her before, demanding your respect and taking her flat even if you do not want to give it to her. <br /> <br /> Geena plays Samantha Caine, an amnesiac desperate to remember something about her past, but when she realizes quickly, the more she discovers, the more she wants to forget and eventually consumes herself until finally Samantha is much more and Charly is all that remains. But now, can Charly and Sam, two completely different women, possibly exist in the same body? We have characters that appear and disappear from the film that nurture each side of Sam / Charly, such as Sam Jackson and Craig Bierko. Craig is also irresistible like Timothy, the bad and sexy boy who has no conscience. <br /> <br /> This film was perfectly projected and acted perfectly, above and wonderfully entertaining. You look at the impossible and applaud when it does. So it's worth your time. Look at it, you will not regret it.
