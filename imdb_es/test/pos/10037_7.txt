This movie is good for entertainment purposes, but it is not historically reliable. If you are looking for a movie and think for yourself 'Oh, I want to learn more about Custer's life and his latest version', do not rent 'They died with their boots'. But, if you would like to see a movie to enjoy an older film from the west, with a bit of romance and just for a good story, this is a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the first day of Custer (Errol Flynn) at West Point. Everyone loves his charming personality that allows him to get away with most things. The film follows his career from West Point and his many battles, including his battle in the Civil War. The film ends with his last stand at Little Big Horn. Between the battle scenes, he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland). <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant, but gentle George Armstrong Custer. Olivia De Havilland plays cute and sweet Libby very well, especially in the flirt scene that Custer and Libby meet for the first time. His chemistry on the screen made you believe in his romance. The acting in general was impressive, especially the comic (although stereotyped) role of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel. Your character will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The heroic war music brought out the emotion of the battle scenes. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. The script, sometimes, was corny, although the movie was still nice to watch. The director's performance of Custer was like a hero and history shows that this is debatable. Some will see this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will see this movie and learn to hate it. <br /> <br /> I give my approval to this western film of 1942.
