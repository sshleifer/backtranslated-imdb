This was an interesting movie ... half comedy, half political thriller. It had many good elements, although it was a bit predictable. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays Tom Dobbs, a popular comedian with a successful program in which he makes political comments. Think about the daily program with John Stuart. During the recording of one of his shows, a woman in the audience tells him that he should run for president. That, followed by some jokes taken seriously, was all it took to get the ball rolling and start Dobbs' political career. <br /> <br /> Run independently, and oppose equally the Democrats and Republicans. It is direct and honest, and it becomes increasingly popular, but maybe not popular enough to win. He is clearly the weakest in this election. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a corrupt software company has created a program to make voting much quicker and easier for ordinary people, but there is a technical problem. The flaw was discovered by a young woman named Elanor (Linnley) who was appeased by the software developer with a lie that she fixed the flaw before the next election. <br /> <br /> Election day is approaching, and behold, Dobbs is declared the winner. (Great surprise!) Elanor knows that he is not really the president, he did not win legitimately, she decides to tell the president ... but complications arise. His company even poisoned her to silence her. On top of that, he quickly likes Dobbs. <br /> <br /> The plot takes a few twists and turns, before arriving at a slightly predictable conclusion. But, he never got bored. Robin was great as always, and Christopher Walken stole the show as Dobbs' best adviser and best friend. <br /> <br /> It's an entertaining movie, and it has a good message. I recommend it if you're in the mood for a dark satire, or something that makes you think. In general I give it a 7/10.
