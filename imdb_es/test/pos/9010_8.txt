I love this program. It's so fun and great. Kuzco is such a funny and interesting character, I love him. It's what makes this show what it is, although Kronk and Yzma are very funny and charming too. All about this The show is great for me, because it always manages to make me laugh, it does not matter if it's only once per episode. It is very funny and all the characters are so kind and great, that make the show worthwhile to see, unlike some. Shit on the Disney channel. Try this program the next time it's on, if you've seen the movie, and even if you have not seen it, you'll find this very nice anyway, so go ahead.
