Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa was actually stolen once, and it was missing for almost two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a small thief (and former employee of the Louvre) who allegedly tried to return the most famous work of art in the world to his native Italy. Your actions after the theft make it seem more likely that you would try to sell the painting for your personal benefit. (Of course, I had no hope of finding a buyer). The Mona Lisa was quietly returned to the Louvre on the last day of 1913, remaining there ever since, except for occasional loans. When "Arsène Lupine" was released in 1932 (twenty years after the theft), most of the spectators remembered the crime of 1911 and their knowledge would have given a certain plausibility to this film. "Arsène Lupine" is quite pleasant, with the usual high production standards of MGM and the energetically efficient direction of Jack Conway. This film does not lack pleasure; What he lacks is plausibility. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is the main criminal of the title: he specializes in perpetrating "impossible" crimes, which makes it even more difficult to announce them in advance ... but of course He always commits the crime and deceives the gendarmes. Tully Marshall has a good scene as one of the victims of Barrymore. Lupine has a predilection for elaborate costumes, which allows Barrymore (a 'Grade A' American ham) to indulge his own penchant for nonsense. John's older brother, Lionel Barrymore, is Guerchard, the Javert-looking Surete detective who swore to catch Lupine. <br /> <br /> Karen Morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was full of populist political activities; on the screen, it was more impressive in the roles of the working class that fit their own political beliefs (such as their excellent performance in 'Our Daily Bread'). In "Arséne Lupine", Morley's naturally dark hair is bleached and has a horrible blonde tone, and is completely trimmed with elegant outfits that make her look uncomfortable rather than sexy. <br /> <br /> COME TO SPEAK SPOILERS. Finally, Lupine decides to steal the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. He cuts the paint off his frame, rolls up the canvas and then smuggles it out of a basket of flowers. We see John Barrymore swinging a piece of coiled cloth that is supposedly the best work of art in all of human history. I had to laugh at the filmmakers' mistake. In real life (but not in this movie), da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa on a poplar wood plank, so a thief would have a hard time rolling it up! <br /> <br /> Eventually, Guerchard captures Lupine and drags him to Le Calaboose. The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in the police car is a delight, since his genuine affection for others is poured into the dialogue of his characters. I would have found this unlikely scene with two other actors. As it is, I can not imagine anyone other than the Barrymore brothers playing these roles. Well, maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid, but barely. <br /> <br /> Do not look for a good plot here, but "Arsène Lupine" is a lovely example of old movies. I will rate this movie with 8 points out of 10.
