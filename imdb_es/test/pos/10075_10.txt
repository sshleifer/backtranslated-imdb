Watching this little movie is a real pleasure from start to finish. The story is always entertaining, the tension is never lost. The whole cast is wonderful. The teamwork of Walken and Bracco works perfectly, it's almost like the echo of a classic ball romance. Bracco is very sexy and very funny as the scam that fights for its independence. For some reason they gave Walken a very strange makeup and the weirdest haircut I can imagine? It's a kind of parody that Burt Lancaster had in Elmer Gantry. For me it adds to the pleasure. It is the first film in which I saw Miguel Ferrer, probably one of the most underrated film actors of his generation. He is very good in a small role as Bracco's pimp. Even the Jamaican thugs are a sight to behold. I can highly recommend this movie.
