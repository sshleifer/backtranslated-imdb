I have always been a fan of this almost invisible filming of Gershwin's opera, since the last time I saw it in 1959. As many of you know, it has not been available on video or DVD; in fact, the Gershwin family tried to destroy all existing impressions. <br /> <br /> However, for some reason, in the hope that their opposition will end, the Gershwin family recently approved the exhibition of a collector's print at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens. . <br /> <br /> Well, the Technicolor widescreen printing was excellent! (It's not perfect, but it's excellent.) The sound was exceptional, in road show quality stereo. People who saw this in its original version would not have seen a much better copy. (Program notes include the original Variety review, which warns that people could reject the high price of limited release tickets of $ 3.50!) <br /> <br /> And, as much as I loved it originally , PORGY AND BESS was Better than I remembered. It is simply wonderful. Sidney Poitier as Porgy was at the point where his career was starting to catch fire, and his charisma shines. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is spectacularly beautiful. Brock Peters as Crown is aggressively masculine. Pearl Bailey as Maria offers some comical moments, although her role is small. And Sammy Davis, Jr., like Sporting Life, steals all the scenes in which he finds himself; It's especially fascinating in its two big numbers: "It's not necessarily so" and "There's a ship that's soon to New York." (The latter won applause in the screening I saw). <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS is limited, but it really does not matter when the set is as beautiful as this one. The costumes are also outstanding. <br /> <br /> The singing voices of Sidney and Dorothy are doubled, but they bend extremely well. The exquisite "Summertime" is sung by Clara, played by a young Diahann Carroll; His singing is also doubled. (Actually, only Pearl and Sammy make their own vocalization). <br /> <br /> The music is sublime, of course, but what really struck me was the emotion that caused Preminger of the story. People actually sobbed in the audience several times, once when Bess sings that beautiful "I Loves You Porgy". And the audience freaked me out, actually laughing loudly at the lines in "It's not necessarily like that." Could it be that they had never heard this song before ... or never really heard it? I think a lot of the emotional impact of this film is due to the interpretations of Poiter and Dandridge: you encourage their love to win. <br /> <br /> A small dispute with the execution time of 136 minutes: one or two slow places and a stereotypical scene of Amos-n-Andy about how Bess sees a shy lawyer to divorce Crown, despite that she is not even married to him. (I would have cut it). And the beginning is a bit confusing, both characters of the title are presented uncomfortably, are part of the film before they realize who they are. <br /> <br /> And I do not. I do not think Preminger used a close-up on the whole movie. Everything seems to have been filmed in 3/4, which I suppose was his way of working with the wide screen. <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS has always been a cult movie for those of us who have seen it, for those of us who love the soundtrack, and for some of us who have only heard about it. Hopefully, they will find a way to re-launch this and publish it on DVD. It deserves the largest possible audience.
