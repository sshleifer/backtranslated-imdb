Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films The Beyond and Zombie, was a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Do not Torture a duckling This movie has all the elements of the Italian mystery / thriller genre known as the giallo, but it really attracts the viewers by having each key character with a skeleton in their own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the movie itself. Who is killing young people in the city? The rich young woman who is so bored that she sexually mocks the possible victims, the reporter who likes to manipulate the crime scene to get a better picture, the village woman with a mentally retarded daughter, the local witch, the idiot of the city .. ..the list goes on, and you have to keep mental notes like a real game to play and solve. The themes of this film are very bold and are made with that perfect Italian style at the beginning of the seventies. It's true that no American studio would have even considered making a movie with such a strong content, and that's precisely why this is such a satisfying movie (despite some unusual accent choices for dubbing) and there will definitely be people discussing their meanings much later. Seeing it As the saying goes, they do not do it that way, so get a copy and appreciate an important movie like this.
