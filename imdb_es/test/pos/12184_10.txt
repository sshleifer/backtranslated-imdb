I have to say that this movie is absolutely amazing. I do not understand why he has such a low rating. It has romance, music, darkness and vampires. Stuart Townsend also did a great job being Lestat, the performance was excellent. Also, I do not usually like that music, well, sometimes. But I have to say that in this movie the music fits perfectly. If you like dark movies about vampires, this is definitely for you or even if not, there is a love story for this. But, all I can say is one word: Incredible! My rating is challenging: 10 out of 10. Anyway, I strongly suggest you look at it. I remember that I had not seen this for years, I saw it again about a year ago and I was addicted to it again. hahaha Great movie !!!
