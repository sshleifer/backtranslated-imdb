I have been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004, when I came across "Cidade de Deus / City of God". Let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or BETTER than "City of God." <br /> <br /> Supervision of acting, cinematography and music make this film a unique experience. I have not been to Brazil yet, but this film presents the harsh reality that exists before the citizens of SÃ£o Paulo. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if you enjoy good movies. This movie is disturbing and you may feel a little dejected after seeing it. <br /> <br /> Something you want to see, but nothing you want to sleep on.
