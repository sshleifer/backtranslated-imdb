Mel Brooks really surpassed himself with this fun version of Robin Hood's story. The cast is perfect, and Cary Elwes does a good job in his role. In my personal opinion (in addition to the fact that I'm a fan of Cary Elwes) this movie is the best and funniest I've seen in my life. It will make you laugh every time you see it!
