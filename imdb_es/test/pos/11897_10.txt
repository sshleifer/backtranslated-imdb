This movie was a modern face. He had me on my feet. This movie is one of those rare epic movies that make you want a sequel. I especially liked Damian Chapa. His performance earned an Academy Award, which he deserved for his performance in Blood in Blood. The only thing I did not like was the behind the scenes because it did not show the intensity that the film had, and I would have liked to see less narrated scenes. But the movie was great and it's on my list of the ten best movies of all time. Also, the performance was excellent, there was not a bad scene in the movie, I loved it, Jennifer Tilly was perfect and the whole cast. I can not see how someone would do it. I do not like this movie, it was great. You definitely have to see it.
