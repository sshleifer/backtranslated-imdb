The movie seemed a bit slow at first. But it accelerated and came straight to the point. It showed exactly how the government and the scientist defended humanity and the reasons for the "contraption". I loved it. It is very close to reality like any film about the atomic bombs that would be launched on Japan. I have recommended it to my friends. He was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.
