This is a good movie, without a doubt, but with some strange aspects. Without spoiling anything, it only takes place in 3 places: a Sicilian farm, the ship and Ellis Island New York. All the shots are close, so we never see a sweeping sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? There are no street scenes anywhere, and we do not even see the ship, except in close-ups. And the music ... what the hell was it like playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they came out? I could have done it without the milk river business too ... But, hey, before you consider me a pure misanthrope, let me repeat, this is a very good movie, with moving moments, wonderful photographs, great characters and more precision than the usual (American) efforts in the immigration experience.
