I own this movie on DVD and I've seen it about 10 times and it's still funny. The jokes will never be boring and I often laugh at inappropriate times just thinking about them. The premise is that Richard and Eddie of Bottom Fame own the cheapest hotel in Britain next to a nuclear power plant. They desperately need money and when a movie star in hiding stays to keep his luck, he could be present. <br /> <br /> To see this movie and not get bored or upset, you should first like humor. . Some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it. But overall it's a great movie.
