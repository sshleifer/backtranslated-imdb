Because it's better? Because it is true to the dark vision of the comic. Because the images are inventive and, unlike the first, in this there are real moments of fear and pathos. The first had too much of Jack Nicholson's tricks, too much Prince music and an uncomfortable "romance". Here, instead of a villain, there are three. Not Robert Wuhl, and the protagonist is more than a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the number one attraction of this movie. Its transformation is what drives the theme of the race, on the verge of sanity and madness, good and evil. She becomes truly fearsome. The costumes and makeup are excellent. Danny DeVito's penguin is inspired and anguished, not just a nut. Your circus gang is the element of comic relief (in addition to that giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character that would have toned me down, Walken is a pretty bad man like the ruthless businessman. Danny Elfman's score fits perfectly as usual, and the song Siouxie and the Banshees ("Face to Face") is easily the best of any of the songs in any of the films, a perfect combination between musical artist and soundtrack of films. The least insinuating of the films, is macabre, does not please, and demands a second and third visits like a ride in an amusement park. Bravo Tim Burton and the cast!
