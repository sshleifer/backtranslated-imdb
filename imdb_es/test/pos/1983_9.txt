eXistenZ combines the traditional love of director David Cronenberg for blood, blood and explosive heads with the most confusing aspects of a reality that distorts David Lynch's film. And it really works effectively. I will not bother trying to give even the bones of a synopsis of the plot here because it will only cause more confusion. All you need to know is that the movie is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly real that it's hard to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. The film almost seems to abandon its technological thematic endpoint, but then throws the final turn in the last line of dialogue. <br /> <br /> There are also some very crude sexual images based on the 'biography -ports' on the backs of the protagonists, as well as some very rude performances by Jude Law. He manages to leave as naive and stupid and bored and any other annoying habit you can imagine. Jason Jennifer Leigh comes out much better, and everyone else can be called supporting characters, including Willem Dafoe in a functional, though not spectacular, role as a crazed mechanic for money. In general, eXistenZ is a very effective science fiction film about the possibilities that technology can present and the possible consequences that it will receive.
