"... the rhythm is too strong ... now we are deaf mutants, like them", Rex Voorhas Ormine <br /> <br /> I am surprised that this film has been beaten evenly. Let me be the first to discuss the virtues of "The Beat" and why you MUST SEE THIS MOVIE NOW. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this movie is corny and "bad" in the conventional sense: History is absurd, poetry is nonsense and acting is inconsistent. <br /> <br /> But these are the characters in the film, all these ingredients form the recipe for one of the MOST DISAPPEARED CHEEZY MOVIES of the 80s. <br /> <br /> If the reference to "mutants" deaf "did not arouse his interest, then perhaps this will do it: What kind of name is" Rex Voorhas Ormine ", anyway? It's such an unusual name (for American audiences) that I said to myself, "Even the names of the characters in this damn movie are very silly." <br /> <br /> Well, "The Beat" is so fabulously cheerful that the "meaning" and the "symbolism" behind "Rex Voorhas Ormine" are revealed not very subtly by Bart Waxman (the misguided counselor who teaches you love to hate). I will not ruin the revelation behind Rex's name, but please do not get excited, okay? <br /> <br /> In general, the performance is inconsistent (John Savage, who plays the "master in question" Mr. Ellsworth is quite good, as is the fellow who plays Bart Waxman, but the rest of the cast It is not convincing, that said, the performance does NOT detract from the film, why, there is a SINCERITY in each of the actors' performances that makes the characters they play attractive. To stink, you still have the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best.As a result, the sincerity of the actors succeeds where their performance fails (which is quite frequent). <br /> <br /> The Homage to "beat poetry" in this film is bad, bad, bad, but this is a good thing, well, good when it comes to entertainment, would you really enjoy a "better quality" or "more respectable" poetry, especially in a movie like this? <br / > <br /> Friends, that would be BORING (think of the imbecile we were made to read in high school) -sanitized to avoid "corrupting youth", politically conservative and without any critical analysis, etc.) Even if you do not they like poetry or "artistic" films (with all the "intellectual" postures that implies), which most certainly can (and should) appreciate the POOR LUDICROA in a WANNABE ART MOVIE !! How is it possible that you do not enjoy the following? <br /> <br /> "Do you remember the roar of the dinosaur?" A woman's dice on the ground are very bad, oh, the woman is so sad that she washes her hands and then waits for the door today, yes, Today! "<br /> <br /> Yes, that is an example of the extraordinary poetry sprinkled generously on" The Beat ". But what about the story, questions? <br /> <br /> Well, the story is absurd. But, again, that's the beauty of this movie. In addition to some clich√©s, stereotypes and predictable plot points, there are enough really unique elements in the plot / story to keep things interesting. Who is Rex? Where did he come from? What the hell are you talking about? Deaf mutants? Illiterate angels? Billy and Kate really understand what Rex says? Is the audience supposed to understand Rex and his poetry gang? (I've seen the movie several times and I still have not solved everything). <br /> <br /> Will bad poetry and high school talent really end with gang violence? <br /> <br /> I guarantee that you have never seen anything like "The Beat": a perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry, a mediocre but sincere performance and a history of "mitopoietic conquers gang violence" that STILL IT MUST RIVALIZE FOR ANY MOVIE MADE MORE. <br /> <br /> Bonus for the fans of the classic hardcore of the City of New York: the Cro-Mags make a rare cinematic appearance as the "Iron Skulls" and it is a great success to see them perform several songs. I'd like them to include more concert recordings, but maybe that's an "extra" included in the "collector's edition" DVD I fantasized about. <br /> <br />
