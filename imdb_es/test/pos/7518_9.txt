Anyone who goes to Manhattan Hospital Center is taking their life in their hands. That includes The Hospital staff. <br /> <br /> I had never seen The Hospital before and was intrigued by how similar the characters and plot situations were to that other masterpiece by Paddy Chayefsky, Network. There are elements in the character of George C. Scott that have both Al Schumacher and Howard Beale. <br /> <br /> He is the administrator of The Hospital and he is angry like hell and he will not take it anymore. He is completely estranged from his wife and children. You need a Faye Dunaway type character in the person of Diana Rigg to get him out of it. A roll in the hay with her and he is in shock back to reality and the fact that he can still contribute to the world. <br /> <br /> But first you have a real problem. Someone is killing the hospital staff, four of them in a period of 48 hours. And the good news is that their deaths can be attributed in large part to the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy. That's where comedy comes in. <br /> <br /> There is a real character of the Howard Beale type in the person of Barnard Hughes, the father of Diana Rigg. However, its ending is not as dramatic as Beale's. <br /> <br /> In my work days, it was part of my job to pay medical providers. Some of them could be as big as those you'll find in the Hospital. The satire of the black comedy gave me a real bite. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott was nominated for Best Actor, but after having won and refused to accept last year's Oscar for Patton, it was not for a second chance He lost to Gene Hackman for The French Connection. Even so, his role management is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try seeing The Hospital consecutively with Network and see how many similarities you see.
