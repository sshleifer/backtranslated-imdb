One of the most entertaining silent comedies is Pudovkin's brief "Chess Rush," a crazy story of how a rigorously intellectual board game could affect even the most carefully planned core economies. A comic theme as unpromising as chess found a previous exit in this charming short. Two young people play the game seriously against an artificial background, a painted set. This contrasts with Lumiere's previous shorts, such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', in which human activity is deliberately framed in a natural environment. The difference in activities (natural = baby feeding, garden watering, artificial = chess) is possibly significant. <br /> <br /> The main contrast in this film is between this motionless background and the calm and serene game of chess, and The wild passions that cause the latter, as accusations of deception, lead to a more unworthy melee . The intellectual game becomes a great physical waste, just as the pretensions of the artistic filmmakers are deflated forever by the "crudest" demands of the audiences. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing in the movie is not necessarily this descent into slapstick, but the way it was filmed goes on long after the initial joke has been made; the way in which the camera refuses to dignify the fight with something similar to attention, focusing instead on the stage, while we glimpse the thrown feet and the dislodged clothes. The refusal of the film to be edited is audacious, so the humor seems to arise from something other than the fight, which reflects our need for physical contact over intellectual stimulation, our unwillingness to let go. <br /> <br /> What is especially brilliant is the outcome, since these upper class fops are caught by the valet, who lifts them up like two errant schoolchildren, as if they were about to buckle their ears. If teachers can not be expected to maintain their place with decorum, then someone will have to do it for them.
