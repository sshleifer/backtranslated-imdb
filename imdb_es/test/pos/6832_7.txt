I got this eBay movie mainly because I'm gay and I love Til Schweiger. However, it's one of those movies that, when you look at it for the second time, you never say to yourself: "Hmm, I forgot this boring part, I'll go pop corn." It does not have that part. It is a very fluid and constantly interesting film. And, yes, Til Schweiger is worth it, if nothing else. But, it's a great movie even for heterosexuals.
