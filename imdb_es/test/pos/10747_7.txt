Project A II is a classic Jackie Chan movie with all the kung fu, crazy acrobatics and slapstick humor that you expect. It's not as good as the prequel, but it's still a great movie if you just want to see something fun. The story is simple, Jackie Chan against evil men. So if you want a movie that you do not have to be a braniaco to understand, I suggest this.
