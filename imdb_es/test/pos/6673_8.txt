If you like movies that will make you think, this is one of the good ones. I always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg. They have always made high quality movies. <br /> <br /> Iain Softley has directed K-PAX brilliantly. The film tears feelings and philosophy of the mind and the world. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges offer excellent acting skills. I got caught, I did not look away from the screen during the movie. On the other hand, if you're expecting a science fiction movie with special effects, this is not for you. The story is creeping a bit, which can be a bit boring, but it also works as a way to build the theme of the movie. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, I did it ...
