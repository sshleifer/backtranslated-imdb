The saving grace of this movie is its humor. Facing the strengths of his star, Warner Brothers chose his version of General Custer as an irreverent, arrogant and irreverent joker, with a romantic streak and an unexpected tension of idealism; It was Robin Hood again, and Flynn flourished in the role. All his best action images made use of his talent for mischief and comics, and this was no exception. <br /> <br /> It also benefits from the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite an earlier agreement. break society; The role of Libby Custer is stronger than the types of sweet love interest that she had grown tired of interpreting for the studio in Flynn's latest films, and after seeing the script, she specifically asked that de Havilland be chosen to be able to do justice to the part. In this final collaboration, she accumulates all of her considerable acting skill in what is, in the end, basically an adventure movie, and the chemistry of the screen is rekindled: for once, she and Flynn have the opportunity to develop their characters more beyond the initial romance in a married couple of age, with an equally winning effect. <br /> <br /> The pairing of Flynn / de Havilland and the comedy streak are what have provided the durability of this film, when most of Flynn's other westerns, with such affection for the contemporary American public, although supposedly not for its star, they have long been forgotten. The action scenes are pretty superficial (although, ironically, the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges) and the villains of the piece turn out to be, like the schoolboys, the same people who were horrible to Our heroe. on his first day at West Point, and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career. It reduces the list of actors, but it is a bit too morally convenient. <br /> <br /> However, these are largely irrelevant to a movie that never pretended to be more than entertaining entertainment. Enabled and supported by an excellent group of supporting players (including memorably Anthony Quinn in an almost wordless role as the Sioux leader), Errol Flynn works his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal: charmingly shy appearance, sweetness unexpected, malicious flashes, indignation of flash point, cheerful companionship and pure charisma of high octane. He's a reckless braggart, but you can not help but like him. And it's hard to leave without the tune of "Garryowen" going many days through the days. <br /> <br /> This is one of Flynn's lasting hits; It also contains a surprising amount of good acting among the fun, and it is a movie worth remembering.
