Francis Ford Coppola's first "personal" film, completed and released in 1969, was the last film he made as a mostly unknown director before The Godfather, and is in stark contrast to that film and the rest of his ragged career . Apparently, it's a road movie involving a disconnected young woman, bored with domestic life and pregnant with a child she is not sure she loves, fleeing the traps of her boring marriage and finding her way in search of freedom. On the way, she befriends a good man, a former football player who suffered brain damage due to a traumatic head injury, played unexpectedly subtle for a young James Caan, and decides to "help" him, despite being frustrated with its simple ways. . His efforts to get rid of him always fail, either by fault or by chance, and eventually lead directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded cop (Robert Duvall), who has his own ideas. The plot is threadbare, but Coppola does a great job of detailing the emotional life of these characters and uses editing techniques to convey stories that were not at all common in American films of the time. The shots are simple, but extraordinarily effective, and convey both the desolation of the open road and the mood of suburban life in the United States, infused with a mild melancholy provided by the film. Coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic discontent from the point of view of a woman in the culturally turbulent 60s. In general, it is a low profile film that is not what the public expects from Coppola, but rather it is a minor triumph in its own quiet and unpretentious way. 7.5 / 10.
