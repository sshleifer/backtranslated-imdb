I think this movie was made for a not-so-big sum of 8,000 pounds, but that really did not show. There was nothing amateur about the production or the acting, the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach north of Aberdeen. The actors were easily acceptable as a group of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, deserted and unexplored planet, none of them seemed particularly friendly to each other, but they were willing to fight to support themselves and their companions. There were no great explanations of what was happening, which can be really devised, so much of the plot was left to your imagination as the great vacation that was a movie that I also enjoyed. I discovered that I was enthusiastic about most of the characters, there were some unintentionally funny moments, the men were so common that you felt that you could empathize with them and the climax and the end of the movie were quite moving. I think Mr. Stirton and his team should be very proud of themselves. I've seen worse movies with a budget of millions.
