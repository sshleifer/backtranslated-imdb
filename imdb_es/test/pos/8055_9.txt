"The Phenix City Story" is a brutal and forceful docudrama about what was once called the "most perverse city in the United States." The film documents the events that led to the murder by the Phenix City crime syndicate of Albert Patterson, an Alabama attorney who made an offer to the state attorney general's office as a way to clean up the vice and corruption that plague your natal city. His son, John Patterson, took the mantle of his father after his death and won the post, making Phenix City a top priority on his agenda. <br /> <br /> Director Phil Karlson created a movie that has the ability to scandalize even today. Gravity is so relentless that the movie is really hard to see. We see how the crime syndicate is beaten and killed to get what it wants: beatings and murders include women and children, and a particular scene, which revolves around the death of a black girl, is especially worrisome. It's not exactly a pleasant movie, because in the end there are very few rewards to reward the viewer for sitting in the exasperating events that lead her, but it's a well-made movie, full of intense and angry energy. <br /> <A 15-minute prologue includes a series of interviews with the real inhabitants of Phenix City, some of whom are portrayed by actors in the fictional part of the film. It gives the movie a quality of urgency that moves into the narrative, so we feel as if we are watching a documentary all the time, a feeling that has been helped by Karlson's choice to film in real places. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie, but it's one of those movies that fills you with indignation and makes you feel helpless because you can not do anything about it. <br /> <br /> Grade: ONE
