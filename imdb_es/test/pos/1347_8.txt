My friends and I watched the movie last night in Austin on an exhibition for AGLIFF (a film festival). This movie was one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy, very original and sincere, and FUNNY LIKE HELL! Everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the movie. Texas is a big state, with MANY small cities and, of course, many teenagers who grew up as "fat girls". I know that many people will relate to this film on a personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were great, they were great in these scrolls, it was as if the script was written with them in mind. And speaking of the script, it was very well written (very credible), and Ash is a great actor (only his facial expressions made me laugh). It's an independent film, but do not let that fool you ... it's a good movie! Seeing this caliber of work from someone so young is really inspiring.
