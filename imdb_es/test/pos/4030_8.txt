This is a whodunnit in the Hitchcock tradition. They keep you in the dark while the suspects come and go. Dennis Quaid is as good as Dexter, a man condemned to die and Meg Ryan excellent as his baby. There is not much that I do not like in this little suspense and all the pieces fit perfectly as they should. You will not regret having seen this one if you like suspense.
