Labeling this film as a "lesbian love story" is as accurate as calling Pride & Prejudice a "direct love story". There is much more than that. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is a lesbian, but her story is classic bildungsroman, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence to maturity, from personal blindness. to self-discovery. There is a stylistic element of camp in the direction of the film, but it is not an obstacle; on the contrary, it serves to underline the dramatic and staged parts of the main character's life. <br /> <br /> Those who know Anna Chancellor of the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice will surely be surprised with her here. Rachael Stirling is stellar as Nan's main character, and Keeley Hawes is all her eye kindness as her lover Kitty Butler. The chancellor could have a prominent role, apart from Sally Hawkins, who plays Zena Butler. This movie is not for the faint of heart, but neither is it a piece of pro gay advertising. It's a true story, with real comedy and drama, a captivating story with engaging characters that are worth seeing.
