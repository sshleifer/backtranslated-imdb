I grew up with the films of Abbott and Costello, A. because my dad grew up with them and our last names are abbott, so we owe a bit of respect to the deo, I did not realize how difficult this film is and that of others . It was really a classic, it was fun because abbott and costello were always the same characters, but it was really fun, now what I like about Jack and the beanstalk is that even though the love story is totally boring and that song is the the prince sings, omg, impressive, but I like the angle with which they took love, the story, the couple has to get married because a kingdom is running out of money, they are in jail cell and fall in love because both pretend not to be real and end up being the couple, so happy ending, I do not think it's the original version, if they should have eliminated it from this movie, but I think it was original and I love it. but see it suck, laugh, also when the movie really starts with the giant + abbott and costello, it's incredibly fun. When the giant hits Jack at the door and Jack shouts "OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR", that's really fun. And this time he jokes where Jack starts screaming that the prince, the prince and all those dogs jump on him. A little cheezy but really original. I wish they had at least tried to remaster it, although I got that Africa screams \ jack and the beanstalk, and I do not care about the quality because when I had it on the tape it was of poor quality, so I guess. the beginning is slightly fun, the medium is really fun, and the end is not fun in the least, but I'm 19 years old and when a movie made in '52 makes me laugh so much, it seems incredible, this movie is really fun. I love his style. Chapters also suck. Also the part where Jack is going up the bean and everyone is singing a song about what a rod connector is and they're going to kill him, that's pretty funny.
