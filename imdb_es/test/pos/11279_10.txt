What this movie is not: great, entertaining <br /> <br /> What this movie is: visually interesting, hard to understand, intentional <br /> <br /> I feel that this movie puts the viewer (if he or she is willing) through a time clip where they experience a world without language. Much like animals must experience the world. You do not really see this movie as much as you witness a terrible series of events in what you "feel" like in real time. <br /> <br /> Consistently, it continues much longer than it is comfortable. This film could be edited in a short 20 minutes and it would be a totally different movie. It would be great and entertaining, but the experience would be lost. I've seen a lot of great movies, but I've never experienced one like this. If you can put your head in the right place for this, you should really appreciate (but probably not "enjoy") what you achieved here. 10 out of 10
