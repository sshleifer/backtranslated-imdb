Well, I do not know much about anything, but I sure liked this movie. In summary, it was creative, humorous, simple and comforting. In other words, it was everything that was proposed. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds around a girl's first love, (as the title suggests) and I must certainly warn you: do not expect anything challenging or provocative in terms of the theme here. I mean, it's a childish caricature. Actually, it's just a simple story, but it's well told and it catches your attention. <br /> <br /> In the end: it's short, it's fun, it's cute, it's simple, it's good.
