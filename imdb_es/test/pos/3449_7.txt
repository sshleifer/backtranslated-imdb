This movie has a lot to recommend. David Hewlett's paintings, music and nude back are wonderful! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and moving, and it is not predictable, which says a lot about a movie these days. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing and the script is strange. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never realized what it was like to try to be a parody * of *. And if it's not a parody, well, it's still a movie with a great potential that did not come true.
