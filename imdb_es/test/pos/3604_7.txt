A beautiful and pleasant film full of Mediterranean landscapes (Cephallonia is a very beautiful Greek island) that preserves many of the characteristics of the novel. I think Greek landscapes add something special and magical to a movie. However, one thing I did not like at all is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father were not Greek actors but foreigners. I want to say that the actors tried to express the Greek way of life, but for me they were not successful and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they tried to use Greek words was terrible and that was bad for the plot of the movie. Irene Papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother, who lives on an island during the 40s, who lost her husband and tries to live a child alone. John Hurt, Pelagia's father, also acted very well. It reminded me of a Greek in many of his reactions.
