Channel zapping one night I just saw the beginning of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning. It tells the sad story of an adopted child, Adam, whose mother left him after birth. The film takes us through his childhood and makes us discover a very disturbing fact of Adam's past. I will not reveal more, but it is a very deep film and it will intrigue you for sure. This was one of the best roles of Jimmy Smits in my opinion.
