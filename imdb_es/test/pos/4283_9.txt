How can people give this movie a low rating? Amazing. The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so full of merit that I can only imagine that these detractors were weaned into blockbusters and pornography. (If this sounds grumpy, it's because I just deleted my original word of 400 words) I was very impressed by Tom Wilkinson. Everyone greet the boy. This is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive skill. His development as an actor of The Full Monty to this masterpiece of a performance is amazing; One of the best things that happened in the making of films in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson is a little less dominant, because of that glint in her eyes that says' Can you see me? this brazen woman, here? You can not guess what I'm going to do next because I do not know either! It seems to be something that can not fail to show us in each role, but still, is an actress of great skill and presence. She is very sexy here, as she should be, and it is a fair game for her: this is a screen quality that normally, for me, she does not have in previous movies. <br /> <br /> As you might expect Rupert Everett, who must play something high class at the end of his 30s, to be able to teach doctoral-level tutorials on How not to give a pull on the march to hell at cause of total selfishness, offers. He is so thin here, throughout the movie, however, I'm worried about him. The housekeeper of Linda Bassett is also excellent: it is a small role but with an important twist in the plot, she makes you reflect on the amount of talent we have in Britain in terms of acting characters. I want to see more of her. <br /> <br /> The narrative arc is fine; It's a pretty interesting argument, given that no one in the cinema seems to be trying to convince Joe Public that there is nothing new under the sun, even if it drifts towards the melodrama of the 40s on the last 'reel'. But it does not matter, this is an incredible value of 80 minutes for anyone who has half brain money. Congratulations to Julian Fellowes for his first effort as a director: or how we need more films with content like this. It shows a lot of ability to adapt the original novel, telling a story with great efficiency and subtlety. And congratulations also for conjuring an immense sample of the art of the film actor of Mr. Tom Wilkinson. What geezer <br /> <br /> T.
