Still funny after all these years. Midnight Madness is good entertainment for all ages. Presents Michael J Fox as a typical problem creator of 15 years. Melio and Blaylak are by far the funniest characters, and Leon is perfectly chosen as a master of the Wierdo game. The budding romance between Adam and the girl could not have been more corny. Fagabeefe !!!!
