Not being a fan of the Coen brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism I had in the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. This time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens doing "his" to one of the great works of literary history. Who would have thought that Homer had this in mind? I do not know where this film will fit in the Hollywood history books, but it will be in the DVD or VHS library of mine as well as many others. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and entertaining, with a pair of brushes Gumpesque with fame, excellent performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson and a brief but fun Holly Hunter. Born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the South, I wish more people would make fun of us in this way. They even invoke a soundtrack suitable for the rural south. You are NOT doing anything better this weekend, go see this movie! <br /> <br />
