Browsing the channels I was lucky to stumble upon the beginning of this movie. I must admit that it caught my attention almost immediately. I love old movies and this is or should be considered a classic! One of the most wonderful oddities of this movie is that the main character was not only female, but also a bad girl. I recommend this movie!
