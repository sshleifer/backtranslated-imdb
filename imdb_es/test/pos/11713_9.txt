In short, if you want to see the best Burt Reynolds movies, you must include this one. If you do not like Burt, you may still like this. If you love Burt, this can become one of your favorite movies of all time! Being from Atlanta, it does come home, but it is also good to see a police / action / drama that takes place somewhere other than New York City, Chicago, Miami or Los Angeles. The film is fun in points with and good plot and good performances by a great cast (all the characters are real and the bad ones are not so trustworthy that they are really well thought out) A nice romance out of the ordinary in the second half and has some old-fashioned shootouts and fist fights (no CGI thank God REAL ACTION!) <br /> <br /> if Clint Eastwood made his best impression of a Burt Reynolds movie with "Every Which Way But Loose Way" "and" Any Which Way Way "Can" then Burt responded with his best Clint type movie with this, and it came out great!
