Do not let the different reviews of the film dissuade you. You will love it or hate it according to your own tastes. However, if for no other reason, see "Greystoke" to experience the emotion of a great actor who takes over his heart while giving life to his role. Ralph Richardson was not a great actor because he could handle Shakespeare perfectly; rather, he must be remembered for his sensitive treatment of each character he portrayed. He was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. His reading of the part of the Sixth Lord of Greystoke, his last performance, should be appreciated by all who love the theater.
