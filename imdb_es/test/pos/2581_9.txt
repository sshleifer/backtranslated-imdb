Craig Brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom I will watch any movie, no matter how bad it looks. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites that year, with a story full of emotions and realistic and fallible characters. I was not quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this second year effort. The cast looked great, the trailer used the music effectively, however, there seemed to be a good chance it would become absurd and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its brands. The performance is amazing, the writing excellent and the style of editing, as well as the juxtaposed music, which rivets all the way. Brewer seems to be a master in getting his characters to have the right combination of compassion and malice as they move on their path to redemption. <br /> <br /> The first moment I knew that I was expecting a gift was During the sequence of credits abbreviated at the beginning. As he did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer places the music in widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts that appear in a static way. The aesthetics of the 70s was welcome and helped to show that this would be another piece of great character in the vain of those of that decade of some of the best in cinema. From here we continue with the brief fragments of the lives of Lazaro and Rae, and each vignette reflects the other as they travel towards the fateful moment when their paths finally cross. The editing between them was fluid and relevant, instead of cutting abruptly before the scene felt finished with its purpose. Rae's boyfriend goes to the service in the service and the wife of Laz leaves him for his brother. Each feels loneliness and returns to what he knows in that situation: Rae to sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rae is left dead on the side of the road and her savior comes from her farm to carry her, the reasoning of her actions finally begins to clear up. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the greatest bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and the flesh and pain that has brought him. There are moments of stoic severity and kindness with your captive / patient. You never consider the configuration as comical or unrealistic because it sells what it is doing so well. In addition, the character of Rae is not chained for a long time, despite what the trailers make you believe. The situation starts a little uncomfortable until we see that the chaining was for their own good and actually used only for a day or two. As for that chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I never really saw her as something special, but this role is a real breakthrough for her. This girl is so worried that her past sexual abuse has marked her deeply. Each time he moves away from his love, he begins to see the flashes of the man who took away the innocence of his childhood and it stings him to be touched by any available man to let the image disappear. Your nymphomania is not for pleasure, but for the survival of the disturbing nightmares that are always hidden behind your eyelids. Ricci completely inhabits the role and shows all the emotional traumas with great effect and realism. You should also mention Justin Timberlake, who again shows real talent to act. Where this boy came from I have no idea, but I hope he continues to take more movies and stay away from the music for the most part that he produces. <br /> <br /> Although it is not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan In my opinion, it is still in the same position, because when it is on, it is spectacular. Towards the end, we have a truly fascinating sequence with the singing of "This Little Light of Mine", and before, the interaction between captive and captor, when the chain is introduced for the first time, shows a first class work. The truly magical moment, however, is when Jackson sings (yes, that's him at all times, as was Terrence Howard in Hustle) the titular song as a thunderstorm rages and the lights flicker. If I do not see a more beautiful sequence all year, I would not be surprised. What these two people do to each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of doing. One thing that I think I really enjoy with Brewer's work is the fact that it does not show sinners becoming redeemed heroes. Instead, it shows that no matter how bad you have been, or how bad life has been, everyone can strive for redemption and be better people. Here we do not have saints, but there are fallible people who seek to straighten their ship. If the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness, nobody knows, but at least they can say that they did everything possible.
