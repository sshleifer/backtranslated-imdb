"Nuovomondo" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a large extent through dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film in a very visual way. For all you want to say, find powerful images that are able to stand on their own. Therefore, he understands the film as a medium that mainly tells his stories about the images on the screen. In particular, European cinema is often very much driven by dialogue (and many of the young American directors are strongly influenced by that). The opposite attitude of Crialese was really the point, which made this movie special for me. It also has a very interesting theme that is wrapped in a rather unusual story and told with humor. Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as the head of the Salvatore family, as well as the incredible Charlotte Gainsbourg, whom I enjoy watching in each of his films. There are many great sequences in this movie. Only to choose one: when the ship leaves Italy and people simply stare at it. This scene is great, especially if you consider the pop cultural references that accompany it (Titanic!).
