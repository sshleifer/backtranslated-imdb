Whether one sees him as a gallant knight of the plains or an egomaniac who hunts for glory, the debates about George Armstrong Custer's life and military career continue to the present. They die with their boots. It presents certain facts of Custer's history and has taken liberty with others. <br /> <br /> In fact, he graduated at the end of his class at West Point and got this promotion overnight on the battlefield. to the brigadier general. His record under the command of the Michigan Regiment under his command was brilliant. <br /> <br /> It was also true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the great love parties of the 19th century. Libby and George were married for 12 years until The Little Big Horn. What is not known about today's audience is that Libby survived until 1933. During that time he was the custodian of the Custer legend. By her own will of iron and strength of personality, her late husband became a hero because he would not allow them to remember him in any other way. <br /> <br /> I think Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity to have Custer's career told in flashback. Olivia DeHavilland should have trained as Jeanette MacDonald in Maytime and tell the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance. Even then cracks were appearing in the Custer legend, but if they were made from Libby's point of view, they could be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> Sydney Greenstreet had an excellent performance as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing to do with Custer, was removed and replaced by George B. McClellan in late 1861 while Custer was still at West Point. I'm not sure they met. But Greenstreet makes a good characterization of the heavy and powerful Winfield Scott. A nice story about the Mexican War should have been what they gave Greenstreet instead of their very accurate portrayal of the old Fuss and Feathers. <br /> <br /> The film is taken by one of the great romantic teams of cinema, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. This was the last of the eight films they made together. The last scene they did for the cameras was the farewell of Libby to George when he leaves to join his regiment in what will be his last campaign. Both performances, especially Olivia, were a highlight in their careers at Warner Brothers. We know throughout history that Custer is about to reach his doom, that and the fact that this was his last team screen gives this scene a special commotion. If your eyes do not moisten you, you are made of marble. <br /> <br /> As history died with their boots on, it leaves a lot to be desired. As a western adventure that successfully combines romance with action, you can not beat this movie.
