I just rented this movie from the video store last night. Being new and not published long ago here, the rent was only from one day to the next. Me, my little sister and my older brother, who usually hates to see this kind of movies, we sit and watch. Once the film started and after sitting there looking at it for a while, we all laughed historically. Even my brother. This movie is hilarious, I actually laughed. No matter how funny some movies are ... even if I think it's funny, sometimes I can not seem to laugh. But this movie ... I laughed. My brother ended up thinking it was the best "that kind of movie" he had seen. I ended up watching the movie again 2 or 3 hours later.
