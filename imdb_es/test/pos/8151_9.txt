I love a beautiful and sincere movie with a happy ending. This movie could be considered a drama, about two characters that realize true love, but the story is so moving and so sweet that, in my opinion, it's a romance. Of course, the performance is not so good (that did not give me a 10), but they do the work, and they do not exaggerate (thank God), besides they are cute, but the story is powerful and simply adorable (some of you thoughts will drown)! It's a great watch for a love story, but if you're homophobic, stay away! For everyone else, I loved the movie, it's very sweet! I felt that it is a brokeback on a smaller scale ... but with a happy ending ... so enjoy!
