I really liked that movie! Kicking the old school! I love the idea. I love the script. I love the characters. I really loved the Geeks! I was excited to see the silly slapstick horror movies still being honored. This was right with my favorites like Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium. If you are a big fan of fear and foolishness, this is your movie! I only removed one star because I would love to have had better sound. It's not bad sound but I would have liked to have more. Great splashes of blood. Big murder weapons. Great costumes! I really love the nod to the great stereotype of an 80's teenager at the breakfast club. And I can appreciate the non-CGI suspense. Very good camera action and lightweight suspense instead of cutting to CGI. I'd rather have a good fake than a false fake. <br /> <br /> Kisses to the cast and the creators! Oh, I loved the "making-of" too!
