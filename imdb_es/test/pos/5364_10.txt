An excellent movie for those who simply need to disconnect and enjoy the beautiful landscape of Scotland. Based on a fact, the film takes you on a journey of love amid spectacular landscapes. The cast is 'dressed' for the parts they play, so there are no glamorous costumes or hair combed in this film where the acting is excellent, rough and realistic. Each character is credible and offers a compelling portrait of the life, beliefs and culture of the island. the moment Definitely for those who have the slightest drop of Scottish blood ... as it will pull the strings of the heart and stir the soul. Something that can be shared with the family and see again and again .................. a true classic, one that I'm sure will accompany some of the great films that never die .
