This movie was very interesting for me, virtually a film in a movie, about a very capricious director who cleverly persuades an actress and an actor (who does not like it) in the production of sexual chemistry in a movie. The director faces an avalanche of obstacles when she tries that the two people perform perfectly in the film. Sex is Comedy is much more than a comedy, full of uncomfortable strange moments. The film also addresses the psychological and innate instinctive behavior of men and women with respect to the sometimes controversial sexual act. I loved this movie, the character played by Jeanne played by the beautiful Anne Parillaud on a wonderful screen while you share her struggle to produce a work of cinematographic art.
