There are so many positive comments in Return to Me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie. However, I feel the need to express my admiration for this unique film. Bonnie Hunt has shown that she is not only an exceptional actress, but also a wonderful director and screenwriter. This movie has everything and is full of humanity, tenderness, sense of humor ... Do not miss it, do not wait any longer. And, as for the bad comments do not pay attention. Some viewers forget that this type of movie should be seen with their heart, not just their eyes. If some viewers prefer Notting Hill or You Have Got Mail, that is their mistake. For me, Return to Me is a real gem, an unforgettable movie.
