A legend on the screen informs us that it is 'the Caribbean Sea, May 1891'. A small lifeboat drifts aimlessly into the sea and contains six convicts from a wrecked prison ship, and Doctor to Lieutenant Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli) of the ship. It is night, a strange current takes the ship to a strange island, without a name and without cartography. The boat hits some rocks and breaks. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a mutant and viscous man-fish creature. The next morning, Claude wakes up and finds himself washed on a beach. Find a puddle of white water and one of the dead prisoners next to him. Claude warns another surviving prisoner, José (Franco Iavarone) not to drink the water since he will kill him. Both eventually meet the other surviving prisoners, Peter (Roberto Posse), Francois (Francesco Mazzeri) and Skip (Giuseppe Castellano). Francois goes alone to try to catch an animal as food, finds and kills a large water bird. But in turn he is killed by one of the fishermen. Claude, Jose, Peter and Skip continue to explore the island while attributing the death of Francois to an animal attack of some kind. Shortly after, Skip is killed when he is impaled on a peak at the bottom of a well. Now there are only Claude, Jose and Peter. They come across a cemetery with many empty tombs and signs of recent rituals of black magic. Claude sees a snake on a nearby rock, suddenly a shot is heard and the head of the snake explodes. A woman on horseback called Amanda Marvin (Barbara Bach) is revealed as the savior of Claudes. She tells them to leave the island immediately, since it is owned by Edmund Rackham (Richard Johnson) and does not like visitors. Claude, Jose and Peter decide to go ahead in spite of everything, finally finding the great house of Rackham in which they are invited to stay. That night, Peter chases Amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp. Peter quickly becomes food for fishermen. And a voodoo priestess named Shakira (Beryl Cunningham), who lives with Rackham, performs a ritual of black magic that consists of cutting the throat of a chicken in the cemetery. The next day, Claude and José decide that they should leave the island since they feel very uncomfortable with Rackham and think that he is lying to them. José goes away on horseback and loses himself. Claude is saved from one of the fishermen by Amanda and is told to leave. Claude wants to face Rackham again. Rackham reveals that he has a scientist, and Amanda's father, named Professor Ernest Marvin (Joseph Cotten), whom he needs to keep alive. Rackham says that the longer Ernest remains alive, the chances of his own survival will increase dramatically. Rackham tells Claude his plan. Rackham has found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of more than 2,000 feet. He is using men-fish as a means to reach the lost treasures of Atlantis, and he needs Amanda and his father to control them. He affirms that the fishermen are descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis. Rackham offers Claude a part of the treasure if it helps him keep Ernest alive. Later, Claude remembers the name of Ernest Marvin as a scientist who was condemned by animal organ transplant experiments on humans. Finding Ernest's secret laboratory, he discovers that Rackham lied to him and that the fishermen are not descendants, his really genetically altered people become amphibious creatures by the grotesque experiments of Ernest! Rackham has finally gotten tired of Claude and decides to end his meddling by putting him in a large tank and filling it slowly with water, as the islands' volcano begins to explode and sends lava everywhere. Rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and Amanda. Will Claude escape almost certain death to save Amanda and leave the island before the erupting volcano destroys her? Directed by Sergio Martino, I really liked this movie that mixes several genres. Sergio Donati's script is fast, interesting and entertaining. The plot is revealed little by little, which kept me interested in seeing it all the time. I must say at this point that I have seen the original version and not the one that has scenes added for its launch in the United States by Roger Corman. Barbara Bach becomes an extremely attractive protagonist, but I hated the way they introduced her by shooting at a snake, I thought it was more than a little unpleasant. Richard Johnson is a great villain and Claudio Cassinelli a pleasant hero. The fishermen look a little fake when the camera stays too long in them, but they look cold and I've seen them worse. Some of the miniature effects also look a bit bad, but overall I've seen a lot worse. There is no real gore, violence or nudity, but that really did not bother me. The photography of Giancarlo Ferrando and the production design of Massimo Antonello Geleng combine to create a very beautiful film. Costumes, accessories and sets like Rackham's house and Ernest's laboratory with his old scientific team. The exuberant configuration of the green jungle also adds to the visual splendor of the show. I really liked this movie and I entertained myself during all its execution time. I'm not sure who I would recommend, since it mixes several genres, I guess someone who might want something a little different and generally well done. If you can find a copy, give it a try, I'm glad I did.
