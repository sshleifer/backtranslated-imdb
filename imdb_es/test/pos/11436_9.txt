This is a wonderful new movie that is still showing in theaters in my country. Its director, the Calabrian Gianni Amelio, is from my humble point of view, perhaps the only contemporary Italian director, together with Nanni Moretti, who deserve to be called great (that is, apart from the old masters who are still present and occasionally continue to produce films ). It is one of my biggest regrets that contemporary Italian cinema has been suffering since the mid-70s, mainly due to a lack of funding and raising new talent, something that can be transferred to most fields and that makes Italy one of the most static. the industrialized countries of our time in terms of production (both in the industrial and cultural sense) ... unlike, for example, China. And this, among other things, is precisely the theme of Amelio's latest film. Few directors can tell me about the real and present state of my country and the world like Amelio, but his paintings also have a valuable timelessness and universality. And for those who are already worried that they may be slow, heavy and dignified, you can rest assured: of those who have seen that they are not, at least not if you are used to quality European cinema. <br /> <br /> The basic scheme of the plot: Vincenzo Buonavolontà is a technician in an obsolete steel factory somewhere in Italy, probably in the North. He is played by Sergio Castellitto, one of the most versatile and talented actors in contemporary Italy. When a major Chinese steel company buys part of the industrial machinery of the Italian steel plant, Vincenzo, who is struggling to get along with the Chinese director who does not speak Italian, tries to tell him that the machine is defective and that his converter must be replaced, a Element He is working on custom building himself. He warns them that not doing this could have very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile, a young Chinese girl named Liu Hua acts as an interpreter between the two men, but seems to have trouble finding suitable translations for some of Vincenzo's technical terms. The Italian finally loses patience with her, practically turns her aside and asks him to hand over the Chinese-Italian dictionary so that he can do the translation for himself. <br /> <br /> Despite Vincenzo's warnings, the next morning he finds that the director of the Chinese factory and his employees have returned to their own country without paying attention to their advice on the proper use of the machine industrial. Thus, Vincenzo, equipped with his great integrity, leaves for China. And here begins an infinitely fascinating road movie through China, a very current Odyssey of the 21st century through the Asian giant. The search for the last secrets of the mysterious nation of Marco Polo? Not quite. As in all of Amelio's films, the journey itself becomes much more important than whether or not its final "mission" is carried out. In fact, the way the point is literally taken home, not without a touch of humor, is a lovely, moving paradox and irony, which filled my eyes while smiling at the same time. The spectator is told the secret that Vincenzo's trip was, in the last analysis, completely useless, but he himself does not know it, and returns to his home as a satisfied man, a deceitful innocent. At least, you think, he is happy. More or less. <br /> <br /> The trips in which the characters of Amelio embark on uproots and deprive them of their essential human. They are momentarily without a name, status or someone to say a word to them. These themes similar to Theo Angelopoulos are also explored in Lamerica, actually my favorite film by Amelio, followed closely by La stella che non c'è in order of personal preference. In the 1994 film Lamerica, two Italian swindlers travel to Albania to "do business". Like Vincenzo, they intend to go there, do what they have to do and then go back home. Instead, one of these two Italians accidentally ends up on an almost Homeric journey through this devastated land just after the fall of communism. <br /> <br /> But let's go back to La stella che non c'è: once Vincenzo is in China, he predictably discovers that the seemingly "simple" task of delivering the converter to its new owner is not at all simple. The new location of the machinery is almost impossible to determine, unless you embark on an arduous journey through China. When she meets Liu Hua, the young interpreter she had abused now working as a librarian, tries to talk to her, but she reacts in a hostile way, informing him that because of her she had lost her job as an interpreter. in Italy. Performed by the relatively new Ling Tai, Liu Hua soon becomes a Virgil for Vincenzo's Dante when he reluctantly realizes that he could do more than act as a guide and interpreter for the Italian on his trip (obviously for an amount constant cash). It is possible that this young Chinese actress does not have the beauty of Ziyi Zhang, nor the glamor of Gong Li's movie star, but her charming, expressive and pretty face oozes a combination of defiant strength, intelligence, dignity and ironic humor that will make it difficult his features. To forget once you've seen the movie. In addition, she and Castellitto have wonderful emotional chemistry as co-stars. <br /> <br /> Amelio weaves dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realistic and humorous at the same time, while maintaining a moving heart. ability to explore the fleeting essence of humanity in everyday and common circumstances. A documentary naturalness hides what is really a tapestry of faces and places meticulously conceived, a view that also manages to incorporate a cinematography of impressive beauty. The photography here is functional but beautiful, as befits a film about the displaced in an industrial and emotional desert. <br /> <br /> Amelio's observant eye is a disillusioned adult, but he is never cynical or misanthrope. The masterly angles of the camera often also give a sense of Vincenzo's alienation to the eyes of the Chinese, bringing home a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality that is very rare in films about a "familiar" Westerner who explores a non-Western "non-family" country. I can not recommend this movie enough.
