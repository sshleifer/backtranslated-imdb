The Priest, in deep love and suffering, did not show the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has great human beauty (or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/ <br /> <br /> And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious, but charming when taking responsible death like a vampire. She did not keep falling deeply into the lost paradise, but decided to leave humans alone. Fragile, but lovely, fatal woman! This movie made me think about the suffering between humans and vampires, far beyond the priest and salvation. I also thought about love. Adam was not so responsible for Eva, but this Adam (priest), sacrificed and responsible for picking up Eva from Paradise Lost, the world of vampires. Another symphonic poem by Adam and Eve, Paradise Lost.
