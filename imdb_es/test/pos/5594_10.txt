Oh! and we all thought that Joan Crawford was THE horror Mama Dear ... well, Laura Hope Crewes as mom in this 4 character movie offers (and cops) the goods in this cracker of a mangy Mommy marital ... THE SILVER CORD is a RKO's genuinely sensational pre-encoded drama made in 1932 and released in '33 from a 1929 play. So amazing, frank and honest is every surprising verbal exchange between the wife of one son (Irene Dunne) and the other's fianc√© when these two girls together go to war - joyfully unfold the anxious and clearly incestuous grandparents of mom towards her Hungarian virgin son Joel MacCrea and his young 'beau' / son paid by the delicate and beautiful actor of 25 years Eric Linden. I think this film was for many grateful audiences in large theaters in 1933 and offers viewers even in 2005 a very fruity melodrama animated by a crackling dialogue that is not afraid to call the Mother as she is. This movie would have been impossible to do after the censorship code arrived after 1934. Other comments from the viewer on the IMDb back up my reaction and you will find almost everyone who is lucky enough to see (and the tape) THE SILVER CORD will be Agree that it is an unforgettable experience. Spicy script in a superbly produced film. I would have played as VIRGINIA WOLF from 1932. Laura Hope Crewes should have kissed the sound stage in RKO for this role of a lifetime ... even more than her smooth twist in GWTW. Irene Dunne is as beautiful, casual and believable as ever, fighting for her husband once more, and it's worth seeing The Divorce made in 1929 as a complementary piece of THE SILVER CORD. Joel MaCrea is certainly in the same league as Cary Grant and Randolph Scott in beautiful and adorable bets. I had never seen Eric Linden in a role of real actor (he played the amputee in the horror scene of the hospital in GWTW) and here he is surprising and youthful with an excellent role as Robert, the youngest and most sensitive son. Some verbal quills directed at him again will not pass the Code office if they are made later. This is a really good movie, and if the viewer forgives part of the cruelty of his time and is satisfied with an unparalleled pungency bout for a 1932 movie, he will be well rewarded. At first, I thought that part of Mother's melodrama was hanging in her throat until I realized that it was a configuration of the excellent script to make the spectator laugh at her as if she were a small and weak old woman ... NO. ... but neither are the other two women in this powerful film work, hence the fantastic response dialogue. That transatlantic seen in the first reel is THE LEVIATHAN, the monstrous ship that the United States won against the Germans in World War I, which was so huge and difficult to handle that the crews were nervous and tried to fight against the Atlantic. It is infamous for plowing a colossal wave in a storm and shooting the crest at such an angle that the spine along the bottom cracked and the ship split vertically between the funnels. It hobbled to port with noisy steel panels and winking rivet holes ... and mentally shattered passengers and crew. He was sunk in 1935 after being cursed and plagued by mechanical problems of horror his entire existence. It is not a war prize after all. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue in THE SILVER CORD is enough emotion for one night: for example: "Mother! The doctor said there was nothing wrong with you, in fact she said she would take a dynamite stick to kill you. " Whammo!
