ONE NIGHT AT McCOOL'S / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> According to Harald Zwart, the director of "One Night at McCool's," The film is "a dark comedy about the power of women over men, and how a group of people can perceive different realities." It is the same story told from three different points of view, and each time we tell the story, we try to reveal a little more about what really happened, what nobody really knows. " <br /> <br /> "One Night at McCool's" marks the debut feature-film director of Zwart, an award-winning commercial and music video director who started making short films when he was eight years old. I always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos becomes the cinema. We have seen many examples of how these guys think they are making another ad or music video for TV with their productions. Zwart resists that tendency. Capture a specific humorous truth in "Una noche en McCool", based on an inventive and complex script by the late Stan Seidel, although it is often disconcerting. <br /> <br /> "One Night At McCool's" presents three men who share their separate experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman. Somehow, this movie is the comic version of "American Beauty", but in others, it's a world apart. <br /> <br /> "It all started one night at McCool's" explains each of the three men to their various listeners. There's Randy (Matt Dillon), a tender at the local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser), who stays until the place closes. Detective Dehling (John Goodman) arrives when the room becomes the crime scene of the dead boyfriend of a fatal woman named Joya (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her, since an individual treats her in an unpleasant way. He defends her, and before you can say SEXY, they are having vigorous sex and she moves in with him. At first, Randy is reluctant: "Sex and violence, all in one night, is a bit too much." But who could reject a jewel like Jewel. <br /> <br /> Jewel changes the life of each of the three men. For Detective Dehling, she takes him out of a hole of pain since his wife died. For Carl, she makes him forget his beloved family and his beautiful little suburban house. For Randy, she lights a few fires, both positive and negative, which later persuades him to contact a bingo player named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to end his deceptive ways. <br /> <br /> It's interesting how the film perceives the three different chronicles, even Jewel's wardrobe is relative to the man who tells the story. Dehling sees Jewel as a beautiful and fascinating gift from God. Carl sees Jewel as two sexy legs and a lot of cleavage. Randy is not sure what to do with it, an awakening to his otherwise boring path, to life nowhere. The most intriguing element of this film is Jewel, however, deliciously played by the ever charming Liv Tyler ("Armageddon"). She is not really interested in men, but in what they can offer her. Their motives are too simple, not truly diabolical or evil; She is simply a young woman who has learned from an early age that she can get what she wants out of life through her beauty. <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of fun with its material. From the entertaining and entertaining cast, to his violent and fun fight, "One Night at McCool's" takes advantage of most of his humorous ideas. What makes the movie even more fun is how the three men's views differ. The actors also have a lot of fun with their characters. Goodman is curiously capricious; Reiser fits well into his perverted and twisted part; Douglas is cunning and mysterious in one of the funniest performances in the film; Dillon gives his character an arrogant personality, even though Randy is a mediocre person; Liv Tyler is dazzling. She injects Jewel with the perfect amount of boastful charisma and tormenting wit. It reminds us of the intimate presentation of Mena Suvari in "American Beauty". <br /> <br /> "One Night at McCool's" is the first film that comes from the new production company of Michael Douglas, Furthur Films. It is a creative, genuine and sexy production. On the way we are often caught in the twisted structure, but that is a natural response to a film that intentionally intertwines several angles in a single story. The film ends with a note that is both black and comic. This is another of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way; that is, the black comedy. Many films of this genre seem to be too black or too insensitive. "One Night at McCool's" is one of the few that really work. <br /> <br />
