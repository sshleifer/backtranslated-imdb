I've been a fan of Heaven's Gate since its first release. I've seen it at least half a dozen times and I've always thought of it as a masterpiece. So, with enthusiasm and a feeling of anticipation, I went to see the cut of the restored director. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I was disappointed to see it again and since then I have reviewed my estimate of the film. Heaven's Gate touches greatness in some places, but in general, it lacks the thematic and narrative coherence and the passionate urgency characteristic of a really great movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, two technical problems: the quality of the sound is diffuse throughout the film. , bordering on inaudibility sometimes. Some of this, perhaps, is intentional, a way to imitate the chaos and confusion of the story as it unfolds. But at key points, one can not record what the characters say. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is equally diffuse. The images lack sharpness and particularity of detail. The result is a certain grain and lack of pictorial acuity that manages to blur the foreground and background. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the narrative is out of tune, as if Cimino could not make up his mind. the effect you are looking for. I wanted an epic, sure. But a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film feels uncomfortable and unconvincing between styles, and maybe even genres. Sometimes it reminded me of Terrence Malick's "Days of Heaven" or even "Elvira Madigan" in its languorous rhythm and elegant scene painting. At other times, threatens to become a robust 'western' more like 'The Wild Bunch'. In fact, this latest film offers an instructive reference point for an evaluation of 'Heaven's Gate', as it shares the same concern for the period and employs a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker and even more heroic America. <br /> <br /> This structural and thematic uncertainty is not helped by the low quality script that often sounds forced and discordant to the ear. The result is an inauthentic sense of period discourse. <br /> <br /> The almost greatness of the Gate of Heaven resides in its pieces. The skating sequence on wheels, in particular, is amazingly beautiful, one of the most evocative scenes ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Another piece of set that works very well in terms of theme, mood and ambience unification occurs when Kristofferson and Huppert go on the new platform to the lake and she washes herself while he sleeps in the shade . The languid rhythm, the evocative music and the monumental landscape combine in this scene to portray convincingly the love story that could be at the heart of the film, and that could have been their salvation if pursued more convincingly. <br /> <br /> Some critics have complained about the length of the film. This in itself does not bother me. A good movie can not be long enough. The restored minutes are fundamental to restore the motivation and characterization absent in the cut-out version, and are full of pictorial interest. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main glory of Heaven's Gate lies in the soundtrack that is so evocative. The repeated motif of the waltz and its different punctuations throughout (complete band, guitar, solo violin, etc.) lend a disturbing quality to the foreground action and establish a thematic consistency that lacks the narrative itself. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, especially the absence of a compelling narrative, there is a sense of greatness about the film. One leaves the cinema with an unfortunate feeling of lost greatness and a desire that Cimino can return to see the film, with the wisdom of time and hindsight, to correct what is so bad.
