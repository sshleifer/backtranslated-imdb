Although it may not be as entertaining as Herzog's work, Little Dieter is another good movie by one of the best film artists in the world. Starting from the usual themes of Herzog, Little Dieter is a fascinating and inspiring study of characters about a brave man and his efforts to continue living after a traumatic experience that changes his life. <br /> <br /> Dieter Dengler wanted to fly from a very early age, and the Vietnam War gave him that opportunity, but instead of spending the war flying in a cabin, he spent most of it as a POW . Dieter tells most of his story eloquently and passionately, with the occasional help of Herzog. Herzog makes very little voice throughout this time, but it brings a lot of images and subtly powerful visual effects, which should not surprise those who are familiar with it. <br /> <br /> Dengler is a fascinating and extremely nice person. As human and alive as they come, I found that the story of her life and her incorrigibly optimistic personality are inspiring. Thanks to Herzog for (re) introducing us. <br /> <br /> The scale of the film is not so extensive, and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made Herzog a force to be reckoned with. However, I highly recommend it to your fans and those who enjoy documentaries. It is a very interesting and well executed film.
