Okay, yes, it's bad, yes, it's a complete fluff, yes, it makes the mule dobbin look like an Oscar winner, but look at it as if it were 13 years old, special effects were practically nonexistent in 90% of the movies, back in the good. Great days when the movies needed a story line ... OK, so even the story is a bit iffy ... but wow, I got into this movie when I was a kid in the 80s cheesy rock, bad special effects, but airplanes, air fights and queens a vision in the soundtrack ... look even the worst things have a positive side ... everything if you want a bad movie to show a 12 year old boy Hates the effects of the computer (if a movie of this type exists), this is the ideal option.
