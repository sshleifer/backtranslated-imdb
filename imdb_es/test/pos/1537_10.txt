This movie gave me recurring nightmares, with the voice of Alan Rickman representing an omnipotent, insidious and fascist ruler. The most terrifying movie I've ever seen: the psychological terror more powerful than any other "horror" movie I've ever made. The voice of Alan Rickman will always represent for me the power and terror of a totalitarian state, reminiscent of Orwell's 1984. This film describes those who do not care about the reality of a large part of the current world governments. This film is disturbing, but in a way that everyone should see it, it is a description of a reality that nobody should have to experience, but many do.
