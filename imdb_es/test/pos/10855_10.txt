"Tipping The Velvet" is one of the modern television productions that shows that some televisions can be as good or even better (as this is) than you see in your local theater. <br /> <br /> If you want to read the plot, read this and if you want other details, go to the next paragraph. This is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional girl named Nan who works as a naive oyster girl, until she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty who dresses as a man for her theatrical profession. The young woman soon joins the act as another male imitator and they are a great success. Soon the two embark on a tender affair. Kitty eventually becomes involved in a marriage of convenience and ravages the young Nan's heart. From that moment, Nan works as a male prostitute supplanted men who seek to have sex with children, then becomes the private sex slave of the evil and sadomasochistic Diana, where Nan experiences a serious emotional abuse. When that ends badly, Nan is back on the streets where she remembers a young girl named Florence; A good-hearted socialist who had the true potential of being a wonderful partner. That's where Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to return to fame. <br /> <br /> The transfer of region 1 is of exceptional image quality, there is a very good selection of scenes, an eloquent photo gallery and a funny interview between the novelist Sara Waters and the writer of the film Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> The stages, the costumes, the cinematography and the music are precious. The acting, writing and directing are extremely strong and full of realism, class and originality. I loved the movie and the novel. Section III of the film is very different in the film than in the novel, because section III of the novel is very well written, but it is not screen material. I will be brave and I will say that I love the interpretation of the movies much more. <br /> <br /> This stunning historical artfully combines Drama, Comedy, Erotic and Romance to achieve vibrant perfection in a deeply moving and spiritually uplifting way. For every mature and open-minded adult who has felt the pleasures, the pains and the power to fall in love and live life to the fullest. A revolutionary production; An absolute must!
