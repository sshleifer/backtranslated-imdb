On one level, Hari Om is a film that uses a familiar genre, the road movie, to tell a family story: the curious Westerner explores the mysterious East. But deep down, the film is about two people, a young French beauty (Isa) bent on experiencing life to the fullest and a motorized rickshaw driver (Hari Om) with Bollywood aspirations, from very different cultures, her attraction every time greater for each one. Another, and the beautiful crazy chaos that is India today. The gap between them can never be saved, but the director manages to bring the two as close as possible to an adventure without damaging the plausibility of the story. India and its people are essential ingredients of the narrative, and except for the main characters, the locals are very beautiful and persuasive on the part of the locals recruited during the production of the film while traveling between the Indian villages and villages that make up the scenario of the movie. An important negative aspect for this viewer: a chase of the Keystone Kops near the conclusion of the film while Hari flees from the gangsters willing to collect a gambling debt. But the final scenes in which Isa and Hari say goodbye are touching and unforgettable.
