This is one of the best movies made about the punk scene 80. I saw this a few years ago in a "pirate" copy and I was surprised. Very few of today's children know the true roots of punk and this film shows some of the punk legends of the 80s like The Germs and shows what it was like then. Nowadays, both punk has become a main part of MTV and radio, and it's nice to see the true underground rebel movement of the original scene. Darby Crash (from The Germs) is one of my heroes and this movie shows why. A must see for all the "punks" and anyone who is curious about the punk scene of the 80s
