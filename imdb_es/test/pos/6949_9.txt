This is one of my favorite movies. The performances of Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with the music, the stage and the reality of the film are quite convincing. A look at a true one, say it as it is, a logger, a mountain man who refuses to renounce his way of life in the name of progress and development. The music of the Horseflies is very unique and adds a strange quality to some of the scenes. After seeing this movie for the first time, I had to go out and buy the video and the soundtrack. In general, a kind of quiet movie with bursts of panic. Both Torn and Cardinal are very credible in their roles. I put this movie in the same category as Winter People with Kurt Russell and Kelly McGillis, another favorite.
