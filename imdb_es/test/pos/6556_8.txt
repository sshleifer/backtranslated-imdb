Uzumaki is a visually stunning film, however, I felt as if part of the story could have been sacrificed. There is almost no character development that makes me feel that I have personally separated from the film, which is ironic because, apart from the word games, this movie really attracts you with its many spiral effects and transitions of impressive scenes. At first, general cinematography kicked me out, but as you get used to the overall look, you start to see the beauty of this twisted movie. This is a great movie if you are looking for a viewer without too much substance or a deeper meaning. It's a great horror movie that is not really terrifying or suspenseful, but somehow ... strange.
