Our family and friends really enjoyed this movie. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances by Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and with the support of good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well, but by the end, it was far from being called "Good". We are still trying to understand what the Director was trying to convey. Did they lack ideas or was it the end beyond the understanding of ordinary film lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer's ship. However, this should not take away the credit that is due to Konkana and Shabana Azmi for relating so well to the characters!
