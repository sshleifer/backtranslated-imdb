Based on the book "Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson. This is (in my humble opinion) one of the best pieces of Sci-Fi Horror of the eighties. The effects (performed by ILM) are still maintained in the current standards. Most of the actors are British and, being British, they seem to give this film more realism. <br /> <br /> The film was criticized by critics and, unfortunately, it did not do well at the box office on both sides of the Atlantic. . Tobe Hooper blamed the promotional work that was done before its launch as the main cause of its low profits. But for whatever reason, it still does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent film with a great cast and a plot of good rhythm. <br /> <br /> It should not be overlooked.
