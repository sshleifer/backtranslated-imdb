I love this movie as much as anyone loves to see whatever they saw when they were young. It was one of those movies that Home Box Office showed every day during my youth. This movie is always housed in my brain. For someone who did not grow up around this movie, it is possible that it was spoiled by the ADD cycle in which we have been since the mid-90s and that it is more difficult to appreciate this jewel. This is great, since my sister was doped to "better dead" before she saw this (of what I raped and loved), and nobody, NO ONE can deny the uncomfortable adolescent mood in the American cinema in the 80's. origin to everything we have found boring in teen comedies ... because with all the excessive use of slow motion, the current soundtrack, the new technology. I wonder if the cinema will return to these roots ... THIS IS THE COMEDY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ... YES!
