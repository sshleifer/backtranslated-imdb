Homegrown is one of those movies that more or less failed, but deserves better. When I saw it for the first time, I had a tepid reaction. But, over time, it has grown a lot in me, without a word game ;-). The more I see it, the more I appreciate it. Writing is first class, as is acting. Launch a few amazing cameos and a good direction, and you'll end up with a great little movie. <br /> <br /> It is also good to finally see Hank Azaria have the opportunity to shine in a leading role. And Thornton offers its usual performance quality. Even the relatively new Ryan Phillippe offers an innocent friendly wit and subtlety. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Homegrown is simply a "must see" if you're a Billy Bob Thornton fan. It seems that Stephen Gyllenhaal was influenced by previous Thornton projects such as One False Move and Sling Blade (although Homegrown is certainly much more ironic than either). And Thornton's role as a character that is sophisticated and realistic is a perfect match for the actor.
