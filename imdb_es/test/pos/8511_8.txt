Although Never Say Never Again (NSNA) has a weak sound track, it is far superior to its competition at that time, "Octopussy". Never Say Never Again is an updated and improved version of Thunderball (Connery's less popular bonus movie). NSNA is rich in intelligent dialogues, wit, intelligence, sex appeal and one of the best and most compelling bad guys in the entire Bond series. In addition, NSNA has a young and beautiful Kim Basinger very talented. Fans of British comedy will also recognize the actor (Attwood), known as "Mr. Bean". I would not change any of Moore's photos for this one. However, previous Connery / Bond efforts (with the exception of "Thunderball") are superior. <br /> <br />
