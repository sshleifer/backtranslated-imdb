I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Based on the Jonathan Safran Foer novel, Everything Is Illuminated is the directorial debut of actor Liev Schreiber. Schreiber also wrote the script. In the film, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) obsessively collects items from his family, from toothbrushes to retainers and pieces of paper which he then stamps in ziploc bags and pins on a wall of his house to record his family history. But the space for his grandfather is clearly naked. All Jonathan really has of him is a jewel and an old picture of him with a woman who hid him from the Nazis during World War II. Jonathan decides to undertake a search in Ukraine to find the woman, thank her and learn more about her grandfather. <br /> <br /> A couple of characters who run a tourist company for Jewish people help in their search. including a young man obsessed with Western culture (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Leskin), who believes he is blind and can have his own memories and demons of war, and the temperament of his grandfather who watches the dog eye . <br /> <br /> The script effectively combines humor and drama when the three characters travel through the countryside in search of the people of Jonathan's grandfather, deepening more and more in the memories of the past. The best performance probably comes from Eugene Hutz, who plays Alex Jr., who starts the film as a break dance saleswoman who wears a tracksuit, just for fun, but evolves into something more like not just Jonathan, but all the characters they get their own illumination. . <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood and Eugene Hutz attended the screening and made a very funny question and answer session after the film: <br /> <br /> - Schreiber was very close to his Grandfather, who was a Ukrainian immigrant, and who died in 1993. This made him start writing to write his memories on paper. Meanwhile, he was asked to read Foer's story, The Very Rigid Search, which was an excerpt from the novel not yet published. Schreiber was impressed by the quality of the writing, saying that Foer had done in 15 pages what Schreiber tried to do in 107. Schreiber approached Foer and talked about his grandparents, culture, movies and the nature of short-term memory. America; In the end, Foer accepted that Schreiber adapted the book. <br /> <br /> - Schreiber's own project was intended to be a road movie, but the book has a parallel narrative that is an imagined chronological story of the city of Trochenbrod. covering 500 years; Given his budget and his limitations as a filmmaker, he said he would leave that to Milos Forman and that he would take the road trip instead. This imagined chronology was what motivated him to make the film in the first place, the idea that "a lovingly imagined past was as valuable as a past remembered accurately." <br /> <br /> Schreiber said the movie was a series. of happy accidents. After unsuccessfully searching for an actor in Ukraine, he was walking down the Lower East Side in New York, when he saw a poster of a centaur woman, topless from the waist up, with a crazy Cossack sitting next to her. Below the poster, the name of Gogol Bordello is a Ukrainian punk gypsy band. <br /> <br /> Eugene Hutz took over the story. He had never continued acting as music, it was his first passion. One day, a friend gave him the book, and he thought it was written in a similar way to how he writes music; sentences / syntax, the language is mine. <br /> <br /> Later, they received a call from a production company looking for music from Eastern Europe that was medieval but modern. Hutz met with Schreiber, and soon discovered that the film was based on the book he had just read. Shortly after it emerged, Schreiber asked Hutz what he thought of Alex and whether he could make the character by chance. <br /> <br /> - Foer and Schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, shortly after. the events of September 11. They were both in Europe at the time and talked about the derogatory comments they heard about Americans, which led Schreiber to want to try to find an American who challenges the stereotype that Europeans have of Americans. Someone who was clumsy, vulnerable, imperfect, innocent and who sought history beyond the borders of his own country. Schreiber began to think about who that was, and Elijah appeared. <br /> <br /> One of Schreiber's inspirations as a filmmaker is Emir Kusturica (I think that's what he said, who also directed a segment in another festival film, All The Invisible Children) that said "you're not looking to the actors, you look for the people. " Schreiber said there is something about who Elijah is that has a generosity of spirit and sincere kindness as a human being, which appeared in the film. Schreiber said that eyes are important when it comes to articulating a character who is an observer, and that if "the eyes are the doors of the soul, Elijah are the doors of the garages". <br /> <br /> - Elijah Wood had fun with a question about the similarities between his character Kevin in Sin City and Jonathan in this film, since both are a kind of blank slate on which emotions are projected. Wood replied that Jonathan may appear still and seemingly emotionless, but it is about his observations, his experiences with other characters and the environment in which he found himself. <br /> <br /> - About the differences between directing and writing: Schreiber said he likes to write a lot more and jokingly described the address as "hell". After his grandfather died, Schreiber began to think about how to preserve a certain sense of history and himself; Are you satisfied with the content or not, or are you just good at interpreting other people's work? He said that he loved the exercise of discovering what it is that moves you, what is important to you.
