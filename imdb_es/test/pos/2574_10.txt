If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beatings of a woman and rape of children, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively take revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion alive. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music, a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic discourse, that transforms the film. Look for a final scene that is unexpected evidence of the healing of a wounded person. Perhaps those of us who ask ourselves why we immerse ourselves in abundant profanity will learn that love can be placed above the heart. From the pump, follow the rhythm to where love is sacred.
