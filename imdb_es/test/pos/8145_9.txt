I really liked that movie !!! It was very easy to become part of the characters' lives and really feel the emotion they experienced. <br /> <br /> A movie full of laughs, sarcasm, shock and discomfort, just a really great romantic drama! <Br /> <br /> The only part I did not enjoy was in the special features. The comment behind the scenes was a bit unpleasant. Because I had seen the movie before the extras, I prefer to think of the actors as the characters (which is silly, I know), but the personality of the actors is very different from that of the characters they play. But, nevertheless, it is a totally fantastic, spectacular and brilliant film. I recommend that anyone who watches this movie and thinks hmmmmmmm, should I buy it? The answer must be a definite yes!
