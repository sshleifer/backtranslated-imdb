This was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances by a wonderful cast A-List that will make you go from smiles to laughter, to tears and come back. <br /> <br /> I could not help but worry about the characters. Mrs. Merkerson will leave you impressed, as will the young man who plays the young leader. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the design of the set was first class. The viewer is really placed within each era as it is presented. <br /> <br /> Music is an explosion, too. Good selections to represent the mood, time and place. The Blues Blind is stereotyped but offers some great songs. <br /> <br /> This is a great story that will survive many repeat visits. Take the time to see it!
