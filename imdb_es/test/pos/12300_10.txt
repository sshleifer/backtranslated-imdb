The first time I saw this movie in Austria was when it came out, and it fascinated me. It is an exciting and profoundly moving work that must be experienced by all connoisseurs of cinematographic art. What a pity it has never been released in DVD format. Maybe one of these days will be rectified, since it would be a shame if one of the best films ever made was forgotten and vanished in a vault of movies forever. <br /> <br /> Why is that? The 'B' films such as 'American Wedding' and 'Eurotrip' get full-screen and wide-screen releases, and often a special edition with multiple comments and extras, while great works of art like 'The Dead' are almost forgotten?
