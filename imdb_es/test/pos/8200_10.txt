I have read some complaints about the scenes of the court. These people betray their ignorance. This production was simply at incredible lengths to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story occurred. Court manners are something that few people outside the court have seen. While the performance may seem highly stylized, it is, in fact, a reproduction as close as possible to the behavior of individuals in their particular stations, as the director might create it. The actor's facial expressions are a marvel, particularly the duplicate Marquis Changxin and the king's mother. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, reflections of Greek and Shakespearian tragedy on the relationship between the king, his parents and his family. love. The juxtaposition of the king who transforms from good to bad and the murderer from bad to good provides much to think about the evolution of an individual's nature. This film would provide a lot to reflect on in a university course on humanities. <br /> <br /> At the same time, it almost rushes, even in the slowest scenes towards an inexorable outcome. One suspects the participation of large portions of the troop movements, which were quite impressive. It makes the battle scenes of The Lord of the Rings pale in comparison. Few directors have the ability to literally place thousands of humans on the battlefield just for the art. I remember a scene in which you can see at least 30,000 soldiers moving across a huge plain. The logistics for such a shot would have been amazing. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but, simply, I can not recommend this movie enough.
