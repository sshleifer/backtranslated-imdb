Dead or Alive: Final, the film that supposedly brings together the three films of the Dead or Alive trilogy, and which is mainly connected by its stars, Riki Takeiuchi and Sho Aikawa, and that each film has its share of accessories and world neuroses gallant. And a lot of violence, it's the weakest of all. That none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testimony to the creativity of the material, but the pound-for-pound gills that director Takashi Miike brings to the environment and material. Here it presents an openly dystopian, yet low-profile future, where a gay mayor / dictator (Richard Chen) has drugged the entire village, except one group of rebels. There are also replicants, robots, in this year of 2346, one of them is Ryo (Aikawa), a robot of complete lethal ability, but also with the ability to love and learn, etc. Then, a policeman, Takeshi (Takeiuchi) turns out to be the mayor's guard. But things begin to unravel on both sides, Ryo allies with the rebels and Takeshi with his employer, although the blood-soaked accidents like an exchange of hostages went wrong, and with Takeshi discovering that his wife and son are robots ( not done in an alien mood, look, just suddenly as if a power went out, and that he is one too, and all this leads to a last and inexplicable confrontation between the two men. <br /> < It's strange that there's another movie in which Miike has peaks and valleys here, sometimes finding that middle ground of success where science fiction can have some meaning for it, but there's really nothing to extract from this story, except that the mayor / dictator is an imbecile with no previous history who takes charge of his efforts to make sure that his drug prevents couples from becoming pregnant and that everything is under control. I love sclavo, I suppose, in the funny and non-talkative part of a saxophonist who also doubles himself sometimes as a human accessory when he is not disconnecting the melancholy of the blues. Meanwhile, we have the conventional side of the stories of Ryo and Takeshi, and they are never uninteresting, but not convincing enough to maintain interest. Of course, Miike is not above having fun, like when Takeshi drops Michelle (Maria Chen) in the water to make her swim after an assassination attempt on the mayor, or to the fact that the original rebel leader spoke English for not good reason at all There is even a playful tribute to the old science fiction cartoons at the beginning of the movie. But there is nothing very convincing about substances, with the exception of Takeshi's small changes in becoming "good" in the middle of the movie (helping a couple to survive with debugging to have a child), and in For the most part Miike's strengths are purely stylistic and there is the choice of locations and sets. <br /> <br /> It's like a dirty Japanese Alphaville where everything still has a contemporary feel through all the special effects. And I really liked the yellow-green tint that Miike used throughout the film, because it had a great impact on the outdoor scenes and added enough malice in the interior scenes. But as for the peaks and valleys, one sees this more and more clearly, and the level of visual effects of the science fiction movie channel, with perhaps a few more dollars placed during the climax. This contains some of the funniest material in Delusional Freud's delusional sensibility, even if he has to start with an unbearable idea; The way in which Ryo and Takeshi finally meet is a kind of chance and just a means for producers to try to inexpensively join the two previous films, when it was not necessary. On the other hand, in terms of the mere entertainment value of a movie like Miike's where one sees something totally unexpected and very crudely sexual, it is among the best scenes of Happiness of the Katakuris and Visitor Q. Overall, Dead or Alive : Final is a corny effort of 90 minutes that is not taken ALSO seriously, and is even better for its evil contraptions, militaristic decadence and cultural complexes that are exhibited at the level of the pulp.
