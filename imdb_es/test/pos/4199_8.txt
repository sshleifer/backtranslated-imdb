After winning a championship fight, boxer John Garfield (as Johnnie Bradfield) celebrates with a drunkenness, leading to the murder of an aggressive reporter. Although his manager killed the man, Mr. Garfield is blamed. When the manager dies in a car accident, using Garfield's stolen watch, authorities believe the boxer is dead. Still a DESIRED man, Garfield changes his identity to "Jack Dorney" and moves to an Arizona ranch. There, Garfield meets "The Dead End Kids": Billy Halop (as Tommy), Bobby Jordan (as Angel), Leo Gorcey (as Spit), Huntz Hall (as Dippy), Gabriel Dell (as TB) and Bernard Punsly (as Milt). <br /> <br /> Garfield's ties to the young "Dead End", who were sent to stay with the sweet "Grandma Rafferty" (May Robson) as an alternative to the reform school, courtesy of his brother, Past priest "Father Rafferty". Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister, the pretty "Peggy" (Gloria Dickson), who is there to watch the children. Of course, Garfield's past comes back to harass him. <br /> <br /> "John Garfield and The 'Dead End' Kids" make beautiful music (Max Steiner) together, thanks to an effective direction and photography, of Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe. The story is predictably comfortable, with the Warner Brothers support team in good shape. Garfield and the children of "Dead End" are a winning combination; Although Garfield did not make any more movies with the "East Side" gang, the studio did it again with Billy Halop and Bobby Jordan, almost immediately, for "Dust Be My Destiny". <br /> <br /> The boxing scenes are very well staged But, the most exciting sequence is that Garfield and four of the "Children" of New York (Halop, Jordan, Hall and Punsly) climb into a giant tank of water to swim, which unexpectedly endangers his life. Other brief aspects are: the loose Ann Sheridan (like Goldie), the drunk Barbara Pepper (like Budgie) and the young Ronald Sinclair (like Douglas) losing in the strip poker. <br /> <br /> ****** ** They made me criminal (1/21/39) Busby Berkeley ~ John Garfield, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan
