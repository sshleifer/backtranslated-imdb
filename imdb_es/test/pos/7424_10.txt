I used to enjoy "Happy Ever After", but I was completely hypnotized by "Terry & June". With Aunt Lucy gone, the emphasis seemed to fall more on the relationship between Terry and June, a couple of middle-aged and middle-class Englishmen, and I enjoyed it immensely, losing myself very happy in each episode. <br /> <br /> The 1980s was the time of alternative comedy, but it was also the decade of choice, and Terry and June certainly adapted to more traditional tastes. And mine, and I was also a big fan of "The Young Ones"! Every week, Terry got into a silly situation and June went alone and, in general, she had to rescue him. The date the shows are now (it was a different world, but it's fun to watch the trends of the 1980s), like the history of CB radio in 1982 (CB radio was legalized in England in November 1981 ), who saw Terry imprisoned in his car in the back of a truck! I've been watching the shows again on DVD recently, and I still think they're great! Not loved by the enlightened elite, the classes of talks, but a great success with the masses! Wonderful!
