NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three employees who get angry when their innocent and drunken imbeciles take the other three guys out one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are much less deviant and not as good as what the film allows us to know, they beat the daylight of one of our "heroes", the trio decides to return the favor in kind, only they KILL accidentally to one of the other guys! The other two bad guys then begin the systematic destruction of all that these poor schemes appreciate, including their rapidly diminishing sanity. The DVD cover of Phaedra Video presents a critical quote that calls the film "A paranoid freakout of street crime!" or something like that, and the term more that applies here. Meditative, tense, very violent and discreet (but still quite skilful), filmed largely at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motivations that keep the audience guessing along with the besieged protagonists (who, to a certain extent, They deserve everything you get!). I give it a 10.
