I followed this whole series when I was a child in elementary school, by choice, not because it was necessary for school. He used to read the works to the rhythm of the series. The experience gave me a lifelong love for Shakespeare and history. He even gave me a small acting error, although only at an amateur level. Every time I read any of Shakespeare's plays, the images that come to my mind in the first place are of this black-and-white production, which is seen on a large "furniture" TV with an ear antenna. rabbit, with all the "ghosts" and wobbles that go with that. <br /> <br /> Although the sets were minimal, if I remember correctly, that was totally irrelevant because the performance was very good. At that time I had no idea who the actors were. Now I see that many of them have become well known over the years. I especially enjoyed Hotspur and Hal, whom I now see who were played by Sean Connery and Robert Hardy. I would love to see this available on video, especially since many of the works are almost never done and even less are available on video. It would also be valuable as a document of the production of televised games of the mid-twentieth century.
