I could not agree more with the comment left by "coldshitaction" and how this movie is a masterpiece. I've never seen a movie in which the adrenaline that had this movie flowed, and that mostly happened when Bronson goes running on a fire escape with an M-60 and falls as a friend of a gang, it's great. Possibly the best action movie ever made (nor exaggerated), it really could be the best action movie ever made. From the beginning, one should know that you are looking for something sweet when the police let Bronson go and tell him, tell him, to clean up the slums. Once again, genius. And once again Bronson is a bad ass. Paul Kersey is just as cool, maybe even cooler than John McClain or the Terminator, he's just a bad ass. And what is great is the fact that he is a good boy and buys a child a little ice cream and helps an elderly couple before he kills a garbage bag. genius. Highly recommended, if you hate this movie you're crazy.
