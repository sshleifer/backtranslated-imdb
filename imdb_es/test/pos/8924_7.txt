This film was clearly an early attempt of a new director, but still managed to be original and entertaining, as well as in some moments caused reflection. However, I must say that the story would not have looked so good without Paul Anthony's star performance as Pip. He made the written parts very credible and affective, and the weaker parts, much more bearable. Also, I have to mention the performance of Alan Cumming. It was refreshing to see it in a part like this. He brought a weight to his role that provided a very basic element for the film. As for Paul Anthony: Who is this guy? Why have not I seen more of him? Someone give him more papers, please!
