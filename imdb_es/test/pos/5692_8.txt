"Black Water" is one of the most tense movies I've seen in a long time. The story moves fast, as it follows three tourists (all great actors) in a swamp on a tour with a Butch guide in a small boat. Shortly after dropping anchor in a remote area of ​​the swamp, they are overturned by something huge in the water. <br /> <br /> Hurriedly, the three manage to become a tall tree nearby when they realize that a crocodile has attacked them. Over the next two days, they have to try desperately to escape the watchful eye of the crocodile, and they do not seem to want to leave. The film is only a little longer, but what can you expect from the scenario and the limited budget? It is much better than "Primeval" and other recent thrillers of crocodiles and underwater predators. The tension is heavy, and the three drivers give excellent results. Truly chilling, this movie hit a deep chord of claustrophobic fear in me. Apparently based on true facts.
