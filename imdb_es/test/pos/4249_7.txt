Of course, the film is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the jargon of the time. In that sense, the film has actually dated. But as a satirical look at the number one parasitic industry in the United States, advertising remains the goal. But just as important is the counter-message, that is, the effect of large amounts of money on those that would make the industry more socially responsible: not to promote war toys, alcohol, etc. Therefore, the film is also about the charms of capitalism. Consider, for example, how Putney's clothing changes suddenly to resemble Fidel's revolutionary Third World, just before he leaves the company. For a moment, it seems that Swope's mini revolution has been successful among its staff, and it goes ahead, perhaps to spread the movement. But then, the ex-militants succumb to the appeal of the big dollars and he goes out shaking his head, maybe to hijack a plane to Cuba. Downey's last word, however, is ironic, since the Arab (I believe) burns the money tower, leaving the metaphorical structure of (publicity, capitalism) a smoking ruin. For me, it seems that change can only succeed as a purifying act of destruction and not as a process of reform, a message consistent with the radical spirit of the time. <br /> <br /> Whatever the subtext, there are some genuinely funny moments, especially with commercials that play as well now as they did then. Those who compare the anarchic style with that of the Marx Bros. make a good point. Disposable lines fly thick and fast along with scandalous configurations. Forty years later, it is still a difficult movie to handle. However, despite the harshness, the film remains a work of bold originality with some genuinely revealing moments.
