The first time I saw this movie in the mid-sixties was when I was a teenager, and I was really touched, in fact, by the final scene where Han Suyin learns of Mark's death, and then rushes to the hill in disbelief, where then Mark's voice is heard. saying "Give me your hand", and then the image of him disappears, the butterfly with its superstitious meaning, the music, the shattered emotions of Han Suyin's love, just left me sobbing. I was crying bitterly, my mother and my sister looked up and were surprised at my reaction. I just left the room to be alone. Fortunately I do not react like that BUT I always cry at the end. I love everything about the film, especially the music, Han Suyin's costumes and the location. The beauty of Jennifer Jones and the handsome William Holden, both were at their best. I have the VHS and the DVD of this wonderful movie. I also have two versions of Music & Lyrics by Arthur Newman and Sammy Fain. I also have the book A Many Splendored Thing by Han Suyin. I recommend this movie 100%.
