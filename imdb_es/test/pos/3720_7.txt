Belonging to the subgenre of future post-apocalyptic films, it is a stylistic and very intimate delivery. The most noticeable element of the film is its silence; nobody speaks I do not think that Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, has considered it as any kind of great trick. I think what makes it so smart and so effective is the fact that, without any other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and the transmission of emotion, no matter how slight it is. Although I was not stuck to the screen, on reflection, I see that it is a very moving and sensitive perspective of human nature. Your vehicle is the stylized science fiction movie. Part of his reflection on the nature of the human world is that each of his human beings is not necessarily interpreted as a perfect human being: the hero, a lonely wanderer in the desolate new world, is welcomed by a senior inmate, who refuses to keep his part in a food exchange between him and a gruff and brutal character played by Jean Reno, and so Reno tries everything he can, mainly with brute force, to get what he wants. Therefore, the antagonist is right, although he is not a good person, and the protagonist and his sympathy are wrong, although both are good people. <br /> <br /> It is filmed in a crisp and clear black and white. edited and captured in a discrete but small-scale and small-scale approach, and its actors are very real. How can they not be? They, like their characters, are left with the basic needs of communication. This is one of the few really good films written by Luc Besson. His previous work is almost always better than the fluff he now produces.
