Edge of the City, 1957, directed by Martin Ritt, starring John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. It is the story of a man with problems, Axel, who has a mysterious past that is gradually revealed during the film. He has a connection that allows him to get a job at a loading dock that works for Charlie (Jack Warden), a real villain who takes bribes from his workers and mounts them with force. Charlie has an intense dislike for a black man, T.T. (Poitier) who has the same position. T.T. invites Axel to work on his team; Axel challenges Charlie and he does it. Axel finds a place to live and socializes with T.T., his wife (Dee) and his son's white teacher (Kathleen McGuire). When a tragedy occurs, none of the men on the loading dock will talk to the police, and Axel has to face his values, what he represents and the meaning of friendship. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent black and white film that curiously is not about being black or white! It really is about the limits that one puts on oneself and knowing who you are. Charlie is a fanatic and he hates that a black man has a good position on the dock. T.T. He makes fun of Charlie and gives the best he can. There is no talk of T.T. and Axel who spend time together or that the son of T.T. have a white teacher with whom the family also socializes. What Axel, a loner, finds difficult is accepting any friendship or trusting someone - these things he learns through TT <br /> <br /> Poitier shines absolutely on "Edge of the City": it's warm, energetic, loving and intelligent, a man with a true enthusiasm for life, without fear of anything. Cassavetes is excellent and plays a totally opposite character, hidden in the shadows, chronically depressed and always nervous. <br /> <br /> The film leaves open what happens to Axel. Whatever it is, now it's a different man. <br /> <br /> Strangely underestimated and unknown film, possibly in the shadow of many of the angry young films that emerged at that time.
