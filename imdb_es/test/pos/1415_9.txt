Stephen Hawking has one of the best minds, or if that is too simplistic to coin for him one of the most curious and daring, who is also trapped in a body paralyzed by an illness that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer to communicate. . Maybe I did not know enough about Hawking's entry (I always knew him as "that guy who talks like a computer who knows a lot about the universe and stuff, you know") that he's British, that he was a normal kid, and, perhaps most notably, the illness that could have left him dead at age 21 put him in the position of putting his life in focus. <br /> <br /> According to Errol Morris, equally curious and coldly, visually dazzling portrait in A Brief History of Time, Hawking was already brilliant, spontaneously (when other Oxford students were faced with huge algebraic equations, he responded more three times the amount in an hour), but when faced with challenges, mainly from other theories of other scientists, he recovered with his. Under some of the complex scientific conversations, and if you have something less than a B, in astronomy, like me, you should keep your ears especially attentive to explanations of the possible infinity of time or the peculiarities of the black hole. a human being who only wants to enjoy his goose on his birthday. <br /> <br /> Morris captures Hawking just for those who can not get enough of their theories on how particles can enter and exit a black. hole, or if there is even a creator or not depending on how much Einstein is taken into account and time. But it also captures the background story about man and his condition, which creates this as something much more interesting than if Morris had done one or the other. Too much conversation about the cosmos would make your head hurt, and too much about your personal life and you might wonder what all the fuss has to do with this kind of title book from the movie that was on the bestseller lists for over five years. <br /> <br /> Almost in spite of its appearance, Hawking defines what it is to be a conscious entity in a universe that, he observes, will not be separated from itself and when the universe collapses in another 10 billion years to from now on. Through all this, in A Brief History of Time, we glimpse a genius and his humility (not to mention the ten cents of his colleagues and family members here and there) through a mathematically and mathematically unsatisfactory thought process of the universe.
