I've never seen a movie like this before, or so funny. I laughed at my damn ass and saw it repeatedly. In fact, I'm seeing it now. Chad from CKY is also hot. Anyway, if you've never liked it, take off your ass, you have no taste. The film involves Ry (Ryan Dunn) who just broke up with his girlfriend and went to Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon DiCamillo) for help to find out exactly what he did with "Hellboy" (Rake Yohn), and with the help of Raab (Chris Raab / Raab himself) they did exactly that. <br /> <br /> The scene of the mudguard fenders and the Cactus scene in Record Bin were very funny.
