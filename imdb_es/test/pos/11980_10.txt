I caught "On the Run" at the Screening Room in New York and was immediately seduced by his true independent spirit. Starring Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia from the cast of The Sopranos, "On the Run" prepares us on a 24-hour wild ride through the city that never sleeps, while we follow the meanderings of an introspective sales agent who suddenly finds himself dragged for his long career. -The schoolmate has left, he just got out of jail. In fact, he has escaped from it and is "fleeing" in search of some action and a vision of life in the middle of the great metropolis. Driven by excellent performances, this film returns the old feeling of the photos of the 70s, with both characters rediscovering themselves as they burn through the city colliding with wild and local events. An elegy for a certain part of New York that seems to be disappearing, "On the Run" shows great sensitivity and humor. I predict it to be a cult classic that needs to be discovered: future viewers should definitely surrender to this nocturnal trip.
