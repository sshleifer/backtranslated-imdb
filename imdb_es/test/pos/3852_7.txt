Plot in a few words - Duchess (voiced by Eva Gabor) is the well-polished single mother of three kittens. When its owner, the wealthy old woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out, she decides to write her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, which will then go to her butler Edgar when the cats leave. Edgar hears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would have everything before him, and plans to destroy the Duchess and her kittens; He drops sleeping pills at his dinner one night and then leaves them stranded in the French countryside. Out of their element, the Duchess and her kittens become friends with an intelligent stray cat known as Thomas O'Malley (voiced by Phil Harris who made the voice of the great bear Balloo in the Jungle Book); after making a pass in Duchess, not knowing she is a single mother, O'Malley decides to escort them back home, with the duchess genuinely in love with O'Malley as the customary codependent substitute family bond develops; Chaos and chaos ensue, culminating in a violent clash between O'Malley, his cat cats on the streets and Edgar. It also has appearances of British geese, hunting dogs of the south of EE. UU (What they were doing in France is an assumption), a mouse that looks a lot like the rabbit of "Alice in Wonderland" (in fact, expressed the same type that expressed). Winnie the Pooh) and a horse. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the Disney adventure is slow but at the same time pleasant. It presents the memorable musical piece "Everybody wants to be a cat" sung by the late Scatman Crothers (best known by fans of the decade of 1980 as the voice of Jazz in Transformers). Of course, if this were done now, it would probably be a dark social commentary on the division of classes represented by the division between the well-educated and well-fed duchess and the one born on O'Malley Street.
