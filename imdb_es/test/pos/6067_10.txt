I just saw the last episode, No 32, (although the site says that only 30 episodes were made) and I must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the stories of criminals / policemen. Supposedly, the 32 were based on facts with information at the end of each episode of the judicial sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes, this has sometimes been a blatant series, well acted, credible and I dare say, entertaining. The fact that the powers in Denmark decided to dissolve the unit was almost incredible, since they did their job so well and at least in the series, they never failed to "get their man"! It's a 10/10 final for me.
