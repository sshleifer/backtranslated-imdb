The problem that I have as a Finn is that most of the actors in this film are in all Finnish films. I have the feeling that Finland only has about five actors. I think if you're not from Finland, you really like this movie as a refreshing novelty. <br /> <br /> This film is about a terrible chain of events that affects some people quite hard. Alcoholism, cold weather and darkness can be clich√©s, but they are still very real in today's Finnish society. Many people in Finland have depression, especially during the winter. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film is very melancholic. I enjoyed it and the direction of Louhimes was again very solid. I really liked this movie, the only negative thing is that you see the same faces you've seen over and over again.
