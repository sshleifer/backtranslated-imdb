This is a true jewel of a television movie. Based on a completely false story, follows the course of the football league club through its course in the English FA Cup, where chaos and players of all styles of the seventies. The ending is unexpected, the performances are excellent and Nick Hancock shows that he CAN do more than present sporting events. The only thing I regret is not having recorded it.
