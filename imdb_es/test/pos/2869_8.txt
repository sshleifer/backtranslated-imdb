See There's no harm with Kane. The movie has a great story. But it was just not a Horror movie, it screams and screams from Hide my eye, I thought it was going to be watching the WWE Superstars on Monday night. I enjoyed the movie although I loved the story that developed. <br /> <br /> GREAT GREAT MOVIE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE PART 2 <br /> <br /> It does not matter if Kane is killed in The end <br /> <br /> Or they have not killed other stars of the horror in each movie <br /> <br /> They have gone and still come back for more, so part 2 would be <br /> <br /> to be very interesting.
