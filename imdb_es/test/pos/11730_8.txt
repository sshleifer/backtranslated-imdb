This is how Burt Reynolds describes this film, which is the best of all. He plays Tom Sharky, a vice detective who is on the trail of an international mobster (Vittorio Gassman) and the man who is funding to be the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In the novel by William Diehl, the story is more complex because the guy is running for president. This is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two. Filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza Hotel create the perfect setting for the story. Reynolds does not laugh much at this compared to his comedy films. He is very serious here, especially at the beginning of the film because he is degraded by a drug attack that goes wrong. Sometimes, however, the film is more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime movie with Burt trying to get close to the mafia's wife. Only towards the end of the film does the violence that leads to the climax of bang bang increase. Like the great jazz score in DIRTY HARRY by Lalo Schifrin, Sharky's Machine presents an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars such as Chet Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim and Buddy De Franco, The Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams Al Capps manages the score with magic. This movie has become one of the best crime dramas of all time. Check it. <br /> <br /> Score, 8 out of 10 stars
