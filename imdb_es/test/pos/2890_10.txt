Rush in Rio is simply an incredible DVD. This concert is one of the most important moments in the history of Rush and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to be at this concert, and not only that, I was in the front row holding the door that separated the audience from the stage! It's the first and only time I see a live Rush concert and it was a dream come true for me. I have no words to accurately describe this experience, but I can tell you that it is one of the highlights of my life. <br /> <br /> Some people complain about the sound of this DVD that says it is not very clear or polished. But the sound you hear is real, true to what it was like at the concert. It is raw, powerful and so authentic that every time I see it, I come back and live that beautiful moment. Many artists record live shows and then make many adjustments, so the final product is far from what the concert really was. Sure you can achieve a very sophisticated sound and polished in this way, but you do not get the real sound. This is not the case with Rush in Rio, this is the real deal! I admit that I enjoy these fantastic concert DVDs, I love music and sound is a very important aspect, but it is refreshing to hear a concert that is so honest. You listen to Rush as they sound in a live performance, without tricks, or adjustments. This is a true live concert DVD. <br /> <br /> I recommend Rush in Rio, the list of songs is fantastic and the performances of Geddy, Alex and Neil are amazing. Not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love Rush and sing with every tune, even YYZ, which is an instrument! Actually I appear singing twice; in Tom Sawyer I sing "always hopeful but unhappy" and in Earthshine I sing "I just reflect". It's only a few seconds but I just could not believe what I saw when I saw myself on a DVD in a hurry! Amazing!! I hope you enjoy this magnificent concert of the best band on Earth.
