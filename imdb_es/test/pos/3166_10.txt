Almost four years after the beginning of the Iraq war, we are in a hole bigger than ever. That's right, then all those who wave flags who were so sure of the right thing and the best of the American way are now chasing their tails, are not they? Of course yes. This movie said it from the beginning. It is a bit strange that the film, or rather, the filmmaker, knew what was coming. It's almost like going to a fortune-teller and listening to what would happen in the future. There was a moment when I felt the hairs bristle on the back of my neck when GW announced that "the main combat operations are over" on top of an image of a broken RV being dragged with the American flag waving In the back. You have to see it to understand what I mean. But even if you're apolitical or if you're pro-war, this movie will have some kind of impact on you because it's deeply rooted in the story.
