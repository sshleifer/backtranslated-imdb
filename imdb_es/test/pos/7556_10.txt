The film follows four friends from the 1950s (when they are in high school) until 1981. They are Danilo (Craig Wasson) a Yugoslav immigrant; Georgia (Jodi Thelan) a "free spirit"; David (Michael Huddleston) who has no personality and Tom (Jim Metzler) is a big guy, strong, handsome and robust. The three of them are in love with Georgia, but she only loves Danilo. The film focuses mainly on those two: narrates their lives, love and mutual attraction over the years. He also gets into Danilo trying to win the love of his tough immigrant father. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, but it does not stop having its negative points. Thelan's high, shrill voice is annoying (but you get used to it); the story jumps very quickly; The lives of Tom and David are never explained (Tom appears with a wife and Vietnamese children and David has a wife we ​​never know until the end); Some important scenes are misspelled and there are some obvious cuts before the release (probably to keep the movie at 2 o'clock). <br /> <br /> But everything else is so good that you can easily forget the problems. The story is convincing: you really know and understand the characters and you always get caught up in life. With some exceptions, the script (by Steve Tesich) is good; In fact, Tesich was a Yugoslav immigrant and based much of the script on his own experiences. All the acting is excellent, especially Thelan and Wasson, also Reed Birney offers a strong and pleasant performance as Louie, Danilo's roommate at the university. And Lois Smith is very interesting in his role. And look quickly at Mercedes Ruehl and Glenne Headly! <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a great story about immigrants, coming of age, love of the United States and covers 50-80 perfectly. <br />> This movie was (unfairly) defamed at its launch. The studio did not know how to advertise it (IT IS a hard movie to commercialize) and critics trampled it (Pauline Kaels' critique of "The New Yorker" was particularly harsh). He hardly played in theaters (I was lucky enough to see him in his short theater career in 1981) and he has just disappeared. It is a pity. This is a movie that is ripe to be reissued. I will not bet on it, but you never know. A definitive 10 all the way!
