How I Spend My Vacation closes the television series that were broadcast from 1990 to 1992. I have always enjoyed the series for what it is. I have never compared the series with the Looney Tunes of the old days. The release of the video was divided into four or five episodes (I can not remember as I write this) for television and is included in the list of episodes in the series. The good thing about this series is that all the main characters of the show have an important role in the story. We see what everyone does during their summer vacations in different parts of the world. Elmyra is with her parents in a Safari, Plucky and Hampton crossing the country with the parents of Hampton, Fifi is in some beach, etc. The climax is very good and in the end all the Tiny Toon characters get together to start a new year in the "Looniversity", thus ending practically the hot streak of this TV show.
