The network is an excellent movie! This is Angela Bennett (in a great presentation by Sandra Bullock) who is a computer expert who works for the Cathedral Company, cleaning viruses and testing games for clients. Angela is a typical nerd who has no friends outside cyberspace, almost does not take vacations and leaves, and stays connected almost all the time. One day, his friend Dale Hessman (Ray McKinnon) asks for help, sending Angela an album with a strange program that has a lot of confidential information. On the same night, when Dale was going to join her, they killed him suddenly in a plane crash. When going to Mexico on vacation, Angela meets a beautiful guy named Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam), who proves to be a cold-blooded murderous bastard. and one of the guys behind all the secret of the diskette. <br /> <br /> His life becomes a nightmare: all his records are erased and he is given the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious problems. with the police. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it shows how we, humans, depend on many computers and machines (sometimes more than we should) and how vulnerable we are if someone ever decides to do it. We control and change our personal records, without allowing us to prove the error.
