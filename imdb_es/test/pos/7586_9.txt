I have seen more than 2000 sound movies from the Studio era, including many Universal features by Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Shirley Jones and Deanna Durbin, plus a decent amount of opera and musical comedy recorded in studio and live. And I assure you that nobody has the task of singing in front of a camera and a microphone, or maybe anywhere, NEVER TOUCH THE DURBIN ALONE here ... monophonic soundtracks and microphones of the 1930s and all. The Canadian girl sings this fragment of "Il Bacio" as if she lived and wrote it herself and then appeared for a retrospective in Italy at the end of her career, not as a child who learned it from her music teacher. <Br /> <br /> If you omit this Extra on the DVD, or if you go ahead of the Garland solo, you are simply depriving yourself, since this cheap MGM teaser has just captured one of the best performances of the 20c.
