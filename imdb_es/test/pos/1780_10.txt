The Dekalog 5 can be considered a violent accusation against the death sentence, according to the fifth commandment "Thou shalt not kill": it does not by chance put the concept of State in full compliance with the provisions of an unjust law in the same plane as the figure of a murderer. "But the law could not imitate nature, it could correct it," says Piotr, the defense attorney, a true catalyst character, "punishment is a form of revenge that aims to return evil for evil without preventing crime. In whose name does the law come, really in the name of the innocent? " The horrific and detailed sequences of the last half hour of a man condemned to death give value to the uselessness of the dissuasive function applied to the death penalty with the purpose of intimidating all potential criminals. "Desperate situations do not require desperate remedies," Kieslowski says in his message, teaching us how unjust the act of disobedience to a commandment of God can be that judges punishment in the same way that crime is judged. There are three different moral attitudes here: the innate sense of rebellion of the MURDER which aims to awaken the hostile torpor of the surrounding environment; the strong sense of chronic indifference of the VICTIM was inclined to laugh at the requirements of other people; The behavior worthy of the COUNCIL FOR THE DEFENSE always ready to fight against adversity, in favor of human life. The struggle for life is ruthlessly vivisected all the time; The characters are immersed in scenes of affliction and anguish, in an urban landscape accented with greenish tones and seen in their own reflections through the windshield of a taxi. Everything in "Dekalog 5" conveys a frightening sense of alienation and isolation: descriptions of a useless waste of violence and madness, scenes of precarious working conditions, sinister appearances of buildings immersed in an anonymous aura of desolation, wandering aimlessly through disenchanting environments . Jazek, the main character, is forced to fight against an opponent stronger than him: a city completely enveloped in a profound indifference, apparently hostile, deaf to all his mute calls for help, while a faded photo of a girl with a First communion dress keeps gnawing at your soul. It is irremediably directing its steps towards a route disconnected to the condemnation seen through the deformations of 18 mm. Wide angle camera lens with the aim of distorting every detail, altering reality, causing it to fade into remote and strange echoes. Kieslowski does not bring extenuating circumstances seasoned with melodramatic tones in favor of the defender, unlike some Hollywood stereotypes like "I want to live" (by Robert Wise). It does not slip on the banana peel of pathetic scenes useless to exert Jazek's guilt and to mitigate the brutality of the crime, without being interested in the immediate psychological motivations to justify any manifestation of extreme or violent behaviors and refusing to include any useless judicial . proceedings. In other words, in Kieslowsky's opinion, "a crime is always a crime": according to the principle of "par condicio" it puts the prosecutor on the same plane as the condemned, using many signs or symbols to represent a society seen in the world. The most sinister light. And we can not remain indifferent: even if we do not agree with him, Jazek's cries of anguish touch our hearts with pity in the same way that the captivating eyes of Terri Schiavo do.
