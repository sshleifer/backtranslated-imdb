I really liked this movie. I saw it last night in the Public Broadcasting System. What I liked was the fact that they dealt with issues of today, not in the future or in the past. Basically, some terrorists took a van or two and rented them to be car bombs. I think what the movie could have shown was to people from different countries at the same time. It did show the fact that England, or any other country, is not prepared for an attack in the magnitude they showed. I've never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie, so I really can not tell if they are usually their parts. After the movie, they had this panel of experts talking about whether something like this could happen here in the US. UU It was a stimulating debate!
