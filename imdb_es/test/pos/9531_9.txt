The Railway Children was on television again this weekend, and I had forgotten how good it was. <br /> <br /> If I have a criticism, it is that the episodic structure sometimes appears a little too clear, having few narrations. Flow from sequence to sequence. However, the charm and beauty of the film are such that this matters very little. <br /> <br /> I will not revise the comments of others, apart from adding my vote for the final scene on the platform as possibly the most emotional scene in the history of British cinema: like an old and cynical git that happens By middle age too fast, I also find that I can not even think at that moment without being hit with a serious case of "I have something in my eye." In fact, it is not just something in my eye, it also moves things inside me, with that beautiful and happy pain that we sometimes feel. <br /> <br /> And Jenny Agutter was exquisitely beautiful in this movie, standing next to one. foot in childhood and one in youth, and bringing qualities of both to his portrait of a girl who has to grow up too fast. <br /> <br /> Plus a quick applause for Bernard Cribbins. Considered primarily as a lightweight actor, he skillfully created a Benefits of great humanity.
