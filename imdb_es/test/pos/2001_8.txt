Here is one of the most shameful blaxploitation grindhouse items of the 70s; It is a work of low income pimp that appears as a more sordid version of "The Mack". John Daniels, the studly hairdresser hero of Mr. Jonathan in the immortal "Black Shampoo", offers an excellent portrait of the baron, a ruthless and business savvy, forever a powerful peddler of meat that to great dismay of its bitter and brutal Italian rivals reign over the Sunset Strip. When he's not playing horns with his fellow criminals without telling or doing everything possible to avoid being arrested by local vice policemen, Daniels is leading a sweet average existence as his standard suburban type with garden variety (with loving wife and loving children !) in a typically hot small California town. <br /> <br /> The dazzlingly absurd premise alone promises the first-class trashy grandeur of a variety of B-grade buns (George Theakos deserves congratulations on his hilariously ridiculous screenplay). Matt Cimber's senseless and tasteless delivery delivers the junk products through the muddy bottle, which makes this film a very pleasurable portion of celluloid dirt. Among the various emaciated pleasures that can be tasted here are abundant free female nudes, thick dialogues, beautifully striking Me Decade threads (halter tops, felt hats, bright Day-Glo jewels, noisy seersucker outfits), a score of Intensely flamboyant R & B of Smoke, some a hopeless pathetic performance (the little old woman who lives next to Daniels is terribly strident), an unpleasant memorable turn by Patrick Wright as a sadistic bully, a couple of great action pieces (the massacre slow-motion slow-motion kitchen, more) Lurid video footage of the Sunset Strip from which you can shake a feather boa (said video supposedly includes "the prostitutes and the royal bridles of the Sunset Strip in Hollywood"), effectively a dark photograph of Ken Gibb, a bit sickly sexual tableaux fetish, some raw explicit violence (a prostitute has one of her breasts cut!), and fun supporting performances by the family of perennial family dogs Richard Kennedy and George "Buck" Flower as a pair of racist, corrupt, police detectives who cow up. Of course, this movie is not art, but it is certainly naive enough to qualify it as a deliciously dirty piece of entertaining sordid cinematic film.
