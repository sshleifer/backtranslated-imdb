It was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie. The director kept the focus on the main theme without venturing into side plots (the doctor's family or the stories of the other hospital patients), which are so typical of the products of the Bollywood assembly line. He kept the narrative simple to understand and made sure that all actors are faithful to the characters they are supposed to represent. The rustic forms of the grandfather in the clinic, the cold and non-emotional behavior of the surgeon, the zeal of the social worker gave the film a sense of authenticity. I am also glad that the director has not fallen in love with the temptation to add songs or special effects and reduce it to the level of Anand or Safar. A couple of scenes towards the end of the film, like the child who visits other blind children and the workplace of a blind worker, and also the final scene in which the child applauds at the sound of splashes and the singing of the birds make their eyes fog. /> <br /> Many Bollywood players do not realize that members of the Oscar committee value the simplicity of the subject and the authenticity and brevity of the film rather than the brightness and glamor. Shwaas is undoubtedly a better nomination than Lagaan, which deals with a subject that has already been beaten to death. No member of the MPAA will suffer voluntarily through 4 hours of jingoistic drama and many songs and dances. <br /> <br /> I expect more films from director Sandeep Sawant in the future.
