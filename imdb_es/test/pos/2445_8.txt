The Outsiders is, without a doubt, a classic Australian television series. Well-defined characters, tight scripts, varied and interesting places, great guest stars and a filmic environment combined to make this series a special one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Andrew Keir has passed away and Sascha Hehn from Germany has. It does not seem (unfortunately) to have enjoyed the small-screen success in his native country. ABC has repeated the series many times, but a DVD has not yet been released. <br /> <br /> The series is timeless. It is as likely to play a resonant chord with the audience today as it did on his own day. Let's go ABC ... launch The Outsiders on DVD!
