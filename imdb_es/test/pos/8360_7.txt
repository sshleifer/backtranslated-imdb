Being a fan of time travel stories, I was surprised that there was no "device" that would send Russell Johnson's character over time. It just appeared in 1865. It was a disappointing part of the episode. I enjoyed the premise of the dangers of "altering" the future by changing the past. Other episodes of Twilight Zone about time travel like "No Time Like The Past", "Once Upon A Time", etc. They were more to my liking due to the uses of travel "devices" over time. Maybe if the character of Russell Johnson had been the same character that played in "Execution", it would have been more acceptable for fans like me. As science fiction fans know, no character has to "die" in episodes of time travel. All kinds of 'twists' of the plot can be applied in these types of stories. That was the only flaw I could comment on in this episode.
