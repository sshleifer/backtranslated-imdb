I see Lackawanna Blues every time he turns on. It brings me happy times for me. I grew up in a big city in the Midwest. It reminds me of when I was a child, although my situation was a little different, I feel the same. I wonder if everything we know about families are lost. The big moms of the day are less than 55 years old. Will you see what it takes to be an inspiration to others? I hope I'm not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to his past. The music was great in this movie. I really felt that this should have gone to the theaters that I would have paid to see it. When I saw the movie for the second time, I discovered who the life of this movie was. He did an excellent job writing and producing this movie. I guess who better to produce a movie based on your life than you. As soon as I can, I will get a copy for my home use. I always enjoy the producer or the black directors who make that movie feel like you're living at that moment. Thanks for a great movie.
