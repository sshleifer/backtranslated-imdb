I see many movies in the cinema (103 so far this year) and I must say that this is the best movie I've seen this year, although it was released in 1954! <br /> <br /> I felt amazed and watched this genius work and felt rather embarrassed that I had never heard of it before my local art cinema decided to show it for a week in what seemed like a new Print. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie should be the 28-minute break in which there are no speeches or music, just the sound of the men who carry out the robbery. Pure quality <br /> <br /> Although in very dark places, it is illuminated with dry humor. <br /> <br /> Not many films get a score of 10 out of 10, but this does and you also get a gold star for your effort. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the chance to see this movie, do not hesitate, it's a classic. <br /> <br />
