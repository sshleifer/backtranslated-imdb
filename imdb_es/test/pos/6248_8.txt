The lost oasis of Slausen. . . A place for food, fun. . . and MURDER! After a boy disappears on his way to a service station, a group of his friends goes on a trip to look for him. They find a wax museum where they believe their friend could have finished. Unfortunately for friends, however, the owner of the attraction on the road possesses the power to control his wax mannequins and use them for evil. One by one, tourists are harassed and killed by Slausen and his legion of wax mannequins. Can friends escape or fall to the same destination as their lost friend? Following in the footsteps (and turning) of the great classic wax films (House of Wax, Mystery of the Wax Museum), Tourist Trap takes the slasher genre to a completely new and strange level with its strange history and style. Regarding character development, action, dialogue, flow, etc., it seems to be just a basic Slasher movie. But it goes far beyond that when the director takes control of the plot and moves it to the supernatural thriller that it is. The range of performance is acceptable (from the main cast) to very good (from backwoods-showman Mr. Slausen (played by western legend Chuck Connors)). The writing moves well and the dialogue is well structured, but there are some flaws in the logic as the film enters the story. Also, some scenes are a bit silly, like the mannequin attack that moans Becky. However, it is nothing that undermines the effect of the movie. As you would expect from a movie about wax mannequins, it is filled with the endless creepiness that dummies provide. It is strange that a (mostly) inanimate object can simply sit still and somehow be so disturbing. . . Maybe it's the human likeness, or the blank stare, or the fact that you know you're about to launch an attack. . . Whatever it is, the dolls are extremely spooky and that effect is used very well throughout the film. As far as the slashers are concerned, it's one of the best, and it stands out as one of the most spooky movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Mandatory Slasher Elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: The movie is full of some great deaths. The gore is not excessive, but it is done well and leaves it as realistic. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: there is a thin immersion scene with very attractive lead females (although 'very attractive' just begins to describe the dazzling future - the angel Tanya Roberts), but everything is a joke since the girls stay mostly under water, however, they remain with little clothes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Creepy is just the beginning of Slausen and his mannequins. of the best killers in the slasher subgenre. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: From the initial scene, the film keeps a great mix of the creepy mannequin, it jumps scared of the attacks, and Strong level of suspense in the stranded situation ... Everything is very well made to make a really scary movie. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: Well, the mystery was not really the point of the movie ... only the meaning behind it all this is what matters. <br /> <br /> - Awkward Dance Scene: All these pretty girls s and not a single dance. Shame. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8/10. Look at this creepy slasher! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
