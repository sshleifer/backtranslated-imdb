I can not even imagine why everyone hates this movie so much. It made me literally cry with laughter several times ("I trust you slept well?" "Actually, we had a difficult night." "Ah, the dangers of adultery"). <br /> <br /> It's true that the end is a bit flat, but it still has its moments (the false false false of the booger ball that flew towards the ocean, "beach house paradiso"). <br /> <br /> personally, I think this is the most fun movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
