The first time I saw this movie was when I was about 6 years old, my grandmother thought it would be a good movie for children to entertain me and keep me busy ... however, every time I saw her I had nightmares that night. Yes, it disguises itself as a movie for children, but even now it seems very dark to me in some places, especially in the disturbing music that is played every time the guardian angel woman appears on the screen, and her eyes and voice are quite hypnotic. The true "bad guys" of the movie, namely the sharks, Mr. Grimes, etc. They did not scare me at all, I always found the whole movie quite spooky and dark. Obviously, this is something that I can appreciate now that I am 21 years old, but speaking from experience, there is no way I can show it to my children!
