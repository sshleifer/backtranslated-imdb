The eighth, and therefore the second to last short of the Animatrix, this is the only one like this. This takes two of the main types of entertainment inspirations filmed from The Matrix, and combines them incredibly well. This is immensely faithful to the trilogy in that aspect, the tone. The animation is a beautiful, impressive anime. The style, which is omnipresent in this, is Noir. The plot is appropriate, and storytelling, like music, is accurate. The sound in general is fantastic, and it really helps to solidify the atmosphere and the atmosphere, along with the drawings and designs. The voice acting is impeccable. This is one of the only two in which people in the movies also repeat their roles, and both have Anne-Moss, who is the only one of them who appears in this. This is one of the best of the nine, and also one of my personal favorites. This takes about ten minutes. The rhythm is perfect. It never slows down too much, but neither is it overwhelming. The ending could not have been more appropriate for this. This shares a duration of nine and a half minutes with Kid's Story, and is well done and informative. I recommend it warmly to any fan of the universe and the two genres that make up. 8/10
