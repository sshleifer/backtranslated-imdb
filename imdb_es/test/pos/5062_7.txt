I left "Rendition" with a list of defects a mile long, so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie? It is definitely a movie whose sum is better than its parts. <br /> <br /> These parts include a cast of renowned stars, none of which provides a memorable performance (Omar Metwally, unknown stranger, is the one you will remember); useful if the address is not distinguished; and a script that is both too complicated and too simplistic at the same time. Metwally is a US citizen born in Egypt who is kidnapped by the US government's delivery program. UU., Also known as the process by which the United States tortures suspected terrorists to confess information, whether or not it is remotely true. Reese Witherspoon plays his pregnant wife, who claims the favor of an old college friend (Peter Saarsgard), who works for a senator (Alan Arkin) and helps locate her husband. Meryl Streep plays the lead of the surrender program; Jake Gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way. Meanwhile, a whole parallel story follows the daughter of a senior Egyptian official who is allied with the US delivery program and her boyfriend, who is training to become a suicide bomber. <br /> <br /> Ay-yi-yi, that's a lot of plot to pack in a two-hour movie, and I was about to wash my hands of the whole thing, especially the secondary plot of Egyptian Romeo and Juliet , which felt like nothing more than a distraction. But then, near the end of the film, a twist of the chronology links all the lines of the plot in a way that makes you want to reevaluate everything you thought you knew about the motivations of the various characters, and makes "Rendition" a much more interesting movie. of what it looks like it will be. <br /> <br /> Witherspoon, Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard look like high school students who play adults twenty years older than they really are - Gyllenhaal in particular, usually a good actor, looks so bored that you wonder if he is going to gather the energy to deliver his lines. And the screenwriter must be arrested for having as good an actress as Meryl Streep at his disposal and not giving her anything else to work with than this one-dimensional dragon lady. The film, of course, strives to be relevant, but instead of addressing the tangled web of arguments surrounding the issue of national security, it stands at the center of the debate in a predictable way. There are times when you think that the film may be diverted in an interesting direction. What would happen if Witherspoon really began to doubt her husband's past, for example? What would happen if Metwally had actually been in contact with terrorists, as his interrogators accuse? But no, the film takes the path of least resistance. <br /> <br /> But, as I said in advance, I recommend this movie. I know I've done nothing more than list some of his failures, but he has his head in the right place and is entertaining, or at least as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation can be. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
