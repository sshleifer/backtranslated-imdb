I caught my attention in Netflix Instant Play because it only lasted an hour and a half (here it's almost 4 a.m.) and because it's Norwegian, I wanted to continue with Dead Snow and see what else the country offers in international cinema. right now. A fun and deliciously ironic movie, this film presents a man, Andreas, who is sent to a city in the Purgatory of a Brave New World, where everyone is happy and bland, and food has no taste, nothing smells and even sex it loses its appeal. . Directed to the limit by his lack of common senses, he feels almost ready to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> After a hilarious failed attempt by the latter, Andreas traces a man with similar complaints and the two discover a small, vagina-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which the music emanates. The two try to break through to see what's on the other side, tracing a little light they can barely see. But, of course, in the land of fantasy allegory, desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to put an end to Andreas' attempt for freedom and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Jens Lien and the crew create a simple and direct way. move towards history, one that flows well with its themes and moves at a pace just to avoid delays. It is not worth mentioning the similarities in other similar fiction sciences, but even so, the film has a unique feeling and balances some very funny scenes with others quite horrible. I like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie, some uncovered and flogging that will make your heart stutter more than The Passion of Christ, simply because it is so out of place in the scene in gray tones. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a reliable squirrel actor who feels physically out of place, which works very well. Although the concept itself is nothing special, everyone involved makes it work and the film realizes its own world. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
