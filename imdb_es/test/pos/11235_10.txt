No matter what this socially retarded person says, this show is hilarious. It shows how many single men are in a bar scene, and also shows that women are not as gullible as men believe. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the contest of how it is really great and original. It's not the standard reality show we're used to today. <br /> <br /> Give everyone a chance, we only have one episode, finally we have some Canadian programming that is not absolute shit. As Canadians, what do we normally get? Bon Cop, Bad Cop or Corner Gas. Come on, people show that we are not all as prudent as the previous critic. <br /> <br /> Comedy comedy, giving a chance to a new show. The panel is fun and the contestants so far are pretty good.
