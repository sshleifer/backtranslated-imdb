I do not have cable vision and I no longer have "DirecTV". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not of blondes, of course I not only have "Barb Wire", but I have "Stripperella: The First First Season". I still have not found "VIP" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the DVD "Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding". I have the themes of "Playboy" that Pamela Denise Anderson raised. I could go on. I love Pamela! There is no one or anything that can make me feel guilty for enjoying Stripperella. But there are certain elements that I do not like, but with which I live, other series also represent smoking and consuming alcohol sometimes. But those are my personal concerns and I try not to let them ruin the fun of a series like this one for me. I was also surprised by the change in the animation style, but I adapted. However, the amount of female nudes decreased, and that is a big disappointment, since one expects a lot in a series with a premise like this. But again I adapted. One of my favorite episodes of "Mork & Mindy" was when they met Robin Williams! So, of course, one of my favorite episodes of "Striperella" is when Pamela and Tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin. If there really is a "Season 2", I hope to find it, since the most complete I need to complete my collection. I recommend it for other admirers of the feminine form and lovers of blondes. (Hey! Psst! "Blonde" and "blondes" are the feminine way to write "blond!" Your software should already know!)
