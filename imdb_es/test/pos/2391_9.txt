I found the movie very interesting. I really enjoyed the movie the actors were great. It was entertainment. Benny the uncle was wonderful. He was real in his character. The end had a wonderful turn. I would recommend you see it. Eddie Mores's girlfriend reminded me a bit of Sandra Bullock, she was sharp as a nail. I also like the girls who act in the film, it was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tried the sauce in the pot because that's how most people cook hahaha. In fact, I watched the movie twice and I learned more the second time.
