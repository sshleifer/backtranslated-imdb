Lately I've gotten a lot into the Hitchcock series. I always find myself renting one of his films when I'm in Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. As I said before, Hollywood is losing the touch incredibly, I needed a reminder that there are amazing movies out there. Not to mention, I want to be an admirer of the movie, not a movie buff. Is there any better way to do it than with Alfred Hitchcock's films? <br /> <br /> The Man Who Knew Too Much is another great and exciting thriller starring Alfred's favorite protagonist, James Stuart, and the woman who steals the Dorris Day show. They play husband and wife going on vacation with their son, but when a spy tells James some information that could arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom. James seems to doubt Dorris and his ability to get ideas on how to get his son back, but he makes a great comeback and almost ends up being the hero of the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting again, I would say that Dorris was the one who overshadowed the entire cast. James did a great job keeping up the pace, together, these two made you sit down and never give in throughout the movie. I loved the little comedy at the end that Alfred added. You will see what I want to say. I would always recommend this movie, despite it not being the best Hitchcock movie, it is still a treasure. <br /> <br /> 9/10
