An exquisite movie They just do not do it that way anymore! We eavesdropped on an upper middle class family in Dublin at the beginning of the 20th century. They are organizing a dinner after Christmas for their friends and family. Their conversation at the table is just an idle chat, but it is so well written that one is absorbed. Away from the dinner table, playing a good piano helps create an intimate atmosphere as if one of them was one of the guests. Perhaps too perfect for an amateur player, the strange mistake here and there would have contributed to the magic of this movie. It is not a true story, but real entertainment and an object lesson for future filmmakers.
