Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers is probably the best sequel to all Halloween movies. Jamie, the niece of serial killer Michael Myers, has a baby that is later taken by the Man in Black at the conclusion of Halloween 5. A friendly nurse helps Jamie escape, but Myers quickly follows her and kills her. Jamie's baby is found and rescued by Tommy Doyle, one of the children Jamie Lee nursed in the original movie, and Myers arrives in Haddonfield and begins killing the Strode clan that lives in his old house. The film concludes with scenes that reveal clues about the evil of Michael, the identity of the Man in Black and a story close to Dr. Loomis / Michael Myers. I recommend this brilliant masterpiece of terror. <br /> <br /> Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers has an R rating for strong graphic violence, extreme gore, brief sexuality, language and brief nudity.
