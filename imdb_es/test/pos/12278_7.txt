The cult filmmaker Corbucci, the weirdest of his thirteen Spaghetti Westerns (of which I am left with only WHAT I DO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REVOLUTION [1972] to capture) is one that I recently realized through "Stracult de Marco Giusti "guide; It is an uncharacteristically somber genre in the style of the director's own masterpiece, THE GREAT SILENCE (1968), complete with desolate snowy landscapes. <br /> <br /> Johnny Hallyday, the Frenchman Elvis Presley, whom I first saw in Jean-DeTECTIVE (1985) by Luc Godard is a curious but very effective option to play the lonely antihero, Hud (who, like El Clint Eastwood's nameless man from the famous "Trilogy of Sergio Leone's dollars", is equipped with a steel plate armor For protection); By the way, I had met Hallyday's stunning daughter, Laura Smet, at the 2004 Venice Film Festival, but I was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director, Claude Chabrol! Gastone Moschin is another curious addition to the fold (which fulfills practically the same function as Frank Wolff did in THE GREAT SILENCE) but is well known and is amusingly awkward in the presence of a Fabian franchise bath; the second, then, interprets the greedy nymphomaniac of the widow of a banker who seduces everyone in the pursuit of his goals. Sylvie Fennec has the other important female role as a farmer attended by Hallyday and who, at one point, begged Free Love for 'hippie' Apache Gabriella Tavernese (with this in mind, it is worth noting that the film presents surprising features, but Welcome episodes of nudity from both Fabian and Tavernese! Incidentally, the anachronistic addition of a group of long-haired youths (who also engage in drug smoking and revolutionary talk) is a half-hearted attempt of contemporary relevance. but all this adds to the fun (in addition, even the black waitress wears an afro hairstyle!). <br /> <br /> Mario Adorf also has great fun with the small role of a Mexican larger than life bandit nicknamed "the devil" who keeps a young biographer constantly at his side (an element that may have influenced the UNFORGIVEN [1992] by Clint Eastwood) and, at one point, I challenged to captive Moschin to a duel from head to head! Having mentioned this, the film also contains a very unusual 'death weapon'? When Hallyday gets rid of an adversary kicking the cash register of the room in his face! As always, the fun fake cuffs are accompanied by too emphatic sound effects; equally typical for the genre, however, the melancholic score of Angelo Francesco Lavagnino becomes a more important asset. Actually, does the ambiguous ending completely agree with the film's generally somber tone? After the arrival of Fabian at the hands of the locals, the hippies (who had previously idolized Hud) suddenly turn against him when they are wounded and terrorize the city (forcing everyone to the street and undressed), but the infallible gunman manages to get up to meet his challenge (they, however, slip away at the prospect of facing him!) and then leave the city, leaving behind Fennec. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I acquired it through a wide-screen print of good quality in Italian although with French credits and the occasional lapse? about a minute of screen time at all? in the French language (where, apparently, the original soundtrack was not available).
