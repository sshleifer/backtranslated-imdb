Wow. When I went to this film at the Toronto film festival, I had no idea what I was in. This film takes you to an emotional roller coaster in the best sense of the term. Sigourney Weaver was better than I've seen from her in years; Emile Hirsch was great and Jeff Daniels broke my heart. I can see how this will not be everyone's cup of tea, since sometimes it is very hard things that can happen to a family. Do not get me wrong, it's also very funny, in my projection, the audience burst into applause after laughing over and over again. I just think that if you are open to examine your own life, Imaginary Heroes will touch you sincerely. I can not wait until it comes out in theaters.
