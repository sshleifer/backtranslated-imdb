What do you mean by actor's son, not actor? You do not become an actor just because your dad is a superstar, it does not work that way, at least not in the UK. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (this version) is a Scottish low budget movie. You can not compare this with Polanski's version because Polanski has all the world's budgets. <br /> <br /> Jason performed throughout the school, but his big break came in 1985, when he landed the role of Robin Hood in the British television series "Robin of Sherwood." He has appeared in many films since then, including "Shanghai Noon" and "Lord of the Rings 2". Jason has moved behind the camera, forming the production company, Unconditional Entertainment. He recently finished filming his latest film, starring Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ray Winstone. <br /> <br /> And all this has nothing to do with being the son of Sean Connery. If you think Jason said to Sean, "Dad, I want to be in the Macbeth movie they're going to shoot," and Sean said, "Sure, son, whatever you say," and he made a phone call and got him the paper to his son, he's wrong. In fact, Jason Connery is being excluded from his father's will. . Seeing that his father is Sean Connery, that's a big part of the change that Jason will lose. The reasoning behind the decision is apparently Sean's strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself. The relationship has become quite tense. , with Jason even threatening to change his name. <br /> <br /> --------------------- --------------- Being Sean's son Connery, <br /> <br /> "I realize that they are always going to compare me to my father, there are innuendoes all the time, should I spend my whole life justifying myself?" ---------- -------------------------- <br/> <br /> So stop being an imbecile and acusalo for not being able to act alone because it is son of Sean Connery (great thing!). <br /> <br /> Look at Jason in Bullet to Beijing and you form a different opinion about his ability to act.
