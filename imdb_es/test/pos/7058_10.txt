Yes, it feels, and for the most part it is played as a "after-school special" for a slightly older audience, perhaps a teenage audience. But add Bill Murray (who already shows some drama as well as his usual comedic talent), a good cast cast and an unexpected sweetness about growing up and remembering those fantastic days, or not so good, at summer camp, and You will get one It is comforting, fun, dormant. <br /> <br /> It becomes a bit too elegant for its own sake, but that is also one of its charms. When you hear the title "Meatballs", and you see the poster, you expect a sexual romp of teenagers, but what you get is a sentimental, but sometimes sexy, look at those formative years in summer camp. The feeling and memories of simpler times remind me of "A Christmas Story", which I also love. Memories of summer camp were never so well established. The only movie I've seen that is approaching is "Indian Summer", which I like almost as much as "Meatballs", and also stars Matt Craven. Let's hope he completes the trilogy. Maybe he could go back for "Return of the Meatballs," and restore some dignity to the franchise (Meatballs 2 to 4 have nothing to do with the original classic). <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" is easily in my Top 10 guilty pleasures of all time (not really guilty either). It's a wonderful little movie, which always makes me smile.
