This film tells the story of nine ambitious teenagers trying to fulfill their dream at the infamous New York high school for performing arts: Coco, the singer, Bruno, the modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy and Hilary, the struggling dancers, Ralph, The comedian, and Doris and Montgomery, the actors. While everyone thinks they have what it takes to really achieve their goals, they will need much more than their talent. They will have to deal with rejection, anguish, education, pain and love to achieve their fame. <br /> <br /> "Fama" is one of the most entertaining, classic and inspiring films of all time. It has everything a drama / musical for teenagers should have: extremely catchy, entertaining and Oscar-winning songs performed by the incredible Irene Cara, impressive dance numbers, a very attractive cast that makes you believe in the characters and a great story , including the heartbreaking scene when Coco meets the video camera. <br /> <br /> As I said, the cast is incredible. Irene Cara can really act, and it's not just her singing that makes her shine here like Coco. Lee Curreri is very good like Bruno. Barry Miller brings a lot of humor to Ralph. Maureen Teefy is excellent as the marginalized Doris, and if you look closely, you'll see Paul McCrane of "ER" as Montgomery. <br /> <br /> This is a really incredible movie. "Fame" really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer. Any movie that moves me so much is a winner in my book. You must see it! The film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.
