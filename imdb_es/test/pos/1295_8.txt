Having seen other Bollywood movies with Salman Khan in them, I can say that this is my favorite of the most recent. The songs are all quite funny, especially 'O Priya O Priya', which seems to have a good mix of Beatles, Indian music and (I dare say this) a bit of Prince. The love stories are a little more credible than, say, Chal Mere Bhai. Occasional focus on alcohol use is sometimes disturbing, as it really does not seem to make sense to me, but Khan interprets it well, although his voice becomes shrill when he portrays drunkenness.
