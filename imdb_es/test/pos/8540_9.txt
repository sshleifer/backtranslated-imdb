The box in my video store is the reason why I rented it. It looked good because of the boys' faces cut in half, so, of course, I had to try. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw him being a fan of "Evil Dead". The Swedish manufacturers must have been amateurs and have included many references in this masterpiece. A criminal tries to break into the house. Evil Ed was editing the movies that finally drive him crazy and he says "groovy" as he looks at his gun like Bruce Campbell does when he finishes his chainsaw hand in Evil Dead 2. There are also many posters of that movie scattered around the house and the office in the movie. Not only do they cheat Evil Dead, since there is a Gremlin-style puppet monster that curses Ed in his refrigerator. My personal favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says "I'm looking for Barbra," which in case you did not know is the main line of Barbra's brothers in "The Night of the Living Dead." This movie has pretty good plot, great characters, fun things (Gremlin puppets), terrifying things (doctor demon), excellent effects (explosive head) and a lot of female nudes. I only gave him a 9 because he's a little slow before Ed goes crazy, but it's worth waiting for. So if you liked "Evil Dead 2" or any of the other movies I mentioned before, you should rent it and see it with a friend, and when you finish, try "Brain Dead" because I heard it is similar to this masterpiece. <br /> <br />
