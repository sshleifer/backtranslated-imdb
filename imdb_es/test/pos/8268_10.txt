Having known and loved this book since I was eleven years old, I was terrified to see it appear like a movie, what if they had made a terrible mess? In the event that I do not have to worry at all. All were very well cast and the performance is excellent, followed the story very well, except for the strange addition of the scene in prison, which for me did not add anything at all. However, it really is the most beautiful love story and I'm glad I recorded it on video to be able to watch it again and again. My only complaint is: why did not they give Kester a green vest "what made him such a nice man"? Such a simple thing, when they took so much trouble for everything else. If you have the opportunity, look at this, it's excellent.
