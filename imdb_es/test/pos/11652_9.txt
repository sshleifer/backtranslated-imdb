Tim Robbins makes a wonderful movie. His wife (Susan Sarandon) gives a wonderful performance as Sister Helen Perjean, who wants to help Mattew Poncelet (Sean Penn), who is accused of murder and who will also die of an injection ... what you get. Excellent performance and it's a movie that gives something to think about! <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon deserves the Oscar of the best actress of 1995. It is probably one of her best films. <br /> <br /> I did not see 'The Craddle will Rock' but surely I have to watch more Robbins movies. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9/10 or *** 1/2 of 4. Go and look .....
