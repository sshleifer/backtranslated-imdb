First of all, this movie has no history. It is obvious that there were many rewrites during production; Sometimes the characters refer to a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the timeline of the whole story was never known by anyone on the set. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie is something brilliant. Pfeiffer is amazing, and I mean amazing, like Catwoman; She nails the inherent sexy darkness of the character and the good / bad tendencies. Walken is Walken, but even more unpleasant than usual. Devito is not faithful to the comic when it comes to Penguin, but it's good and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keaton is underestimated as Batman. <br /> <br /> And music and style are pure emotion in the cinema. It is true that the third act does not work. But the 2 final scenes are knockouts, and it is clear that Pfeiffer and Keaton must be in a trilogy that derailed by the perverse darkness of this film. That's a shame, because Pfieffer and Keaton had classical chemistry, and if they had performed in a third installment, Joel knows who might not have had the opportunity to destroy Batman for a whole generation of movie fans.
