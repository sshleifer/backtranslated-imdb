The Polish brothers are unique film artists, and they really have pushed the envelope here. A fantasy that has points in common with "Wings of Desire", "Northfork" tells the story of a small town from the 50s in the middle of nowhere that is two days away from being flooded and submerged thanks to the government's desire from the USA UU A reservoir in the place where the town is located. It is an ironic parable about loss and remembrance, with angels, dreams, premonitions and the funniest government recovery officials since "Repo Man". The performances are all exceptional, especially Nolte and Woods. I have noticed in some of the comments that there are people who were offended simply by the fact that the Polish twins use elliptical narrative tactics, and I want to say that this is one of the things that makes this film so great: it is disposition for embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life. The cinematography of David Mullen is impressive. Highly recommended; If he has suffered a significant personal loss, such as the death of a father, he would even call this film a necessary visualization. - Ray
