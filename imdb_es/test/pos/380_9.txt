Well, this is as good as they come. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was just a "master of commercial suspense" or perhaps a "compulsive technician", or if it was really "deep". No one knows precisely what terms like that mean, but it is legitimate to ask whether, at their best, it could not have been all three at once. <br /> <br /> In this it seems that it is almost at its best. . Almost nothing in it is accidental. Doubt, ambiguity and ingenuity abound. And the story is fascinating, apparently Patricia Highsmith has complexes similar to those of Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the plot has been described in detail elsewhere, so I will not bother to analyze it. I will only point to five incidents on the screen of which Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible. <br /> <br /> Bruno Antony (Walker) has followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intention of killing her. She has noticed his attention and feels innocently flattered by her. <br /> <br /> 1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through the tunnel of love and then to an island in the middle of the lake. Walker is right behind them, smiling, in his boat - Pluto. "Pluto." It is not an allusion to the cartoon character of Walt Disney. It is a reference to Pluto, also called Hades, a god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This little touch can not be an accident. And the "underworld" that Walker represents is not just a literal inferno, but the underworld of the human mind. I hate to say that it is a Jungian "shadow", but that is what it is. (Did Carl Jung see this movie? He was alive at the time of his release, but probably not.) 2. Now, this is a very serious sequence, is not it? Walker is a lunatic who is about to murder a woman he does not even know. Imagine how this would have been established by most of the directors. One night lurking through a crowded carnival, stealing from shadow to shadow, the killer looking out from behind the canvas walls, and so on. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker crosses the doors for the first time, concentrating on his victim, a little boy in a cowboy suit, holding a balloon, runs and shouts: "Bang! Bang! You're dead!" Walker shakes his head back in surprise and looks indignantly at the child. And when the child starts to move away, Walker throws his cigarette to the balloon and takes it out, then continues his search without another look. That's one way Hitchcock deals with the impending doom. <br /> <br /> 3. The famous strangulation is reflected in the fallen glasses, which have been stacked innumerable times. <br /> <br /> 4. Miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that you hit with a large mallet, sending a kind of hockey puck to measure the strength of your blow. One of her boyfriend takes it and the disc does not reach the bell at the top. Under the look of admiration and admiration of Miriam, Walker smiles and rubs his hands, then picks up the hammer, hits it and the disc hits the bell. She is excited. He lowers the mallet, looks at her, smiles, and WAGGLES LIKES HIS EYEBROWS as if he were a ten-year showoff! 5. After the discovery of Miriam's body, while the whistles are blowing and the people scream, Walker leaves the carnival and meets a blind man waiting on the sidewalk. Walker takes the old man by the arm and leads him through the intersection, raising his hand gravely to stop the traffic. A macabre joke. <br /> <br /> These incidents and others occur during the ten or fifteen minutes of the carnival visit. (Robert Walker's performance is exceptional in all respects.) It is essentially a kind of invitation to be a Noirish. (Cf: "Ride the Pink Horse") But the threat of the scene is undermined by Hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance. None of the familiar familiar techniques are employed. There's nothing really "spooky" about it. And murder itself is not so wild. I do not think any director other than Hitchcock would have handled it as he did. It would have been all threats and shadows, hiding places, failed attempts, frowning instead of smiles. <br /> <br /> It's not that it's a totally impeccable movie. An impeccable movie is not with us yet. Part of the middle section is a bit slow and Farley Granger, although he is a good guy, is stupid, bored and quite stupid. Your new girlfriend is just boring. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock was treating the bad attribution of guilt with deadly seriousness in "The Wrong Man". I'm not sure Hitchcock has ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt. The latter was imposed on him at an early age by his Catholic education. "Original sin": you were born with him, and all that. In the filmed interviews, he always explained his fear of the police and the authorities in general by telling a story about his father who had taken him to the police station to scare him after a bit of peccadillo. We are justified in asking if that was only what psychoanalysis calls a "screen memory". I hope you have the word game. I know that I know. He is tense and inept, but I spent a lot of valuable time thinking about it.
