As a Frenchman, I found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype that is made of that kind of French, of some faults of Westerners, of spy movies, etc. ... and many other things too, on the way. ... I saw it 3 times and every time I discovered new things and I laughed ... Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, the director of Aure Atika and the whole cast, the whole team did a fantastic job. This movie is fun, but despite being much more than that, it has many levels. He laughs because of simple jokes, due to some critics made with ingenuity (the film is brave enough to be critical), due to physical comedy, because he believes in the characters, etc. Aesthetically and musically, it is also a success. Go see it if you can.
