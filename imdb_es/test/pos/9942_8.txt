Betty is a substitute for the leadership in a Verbis Macbeth production. When a car mysteriously hits the lead, Betty is pushed into the spotlight. The opening night is a resounding success and Betty decides to leave the after party to celebrate privately with her boyfriend. But when the groom leaves the room, Betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown gloved figure with black gloves. The unknown assailant ties Betty to a column, grabs her and places needles under her eyes that will cause incredible pain and pain if Betty closes them. The boyfriend returns to the room and is shocked to see Betty in such a situation. He is even more surprised when the killer grabs him and pushes a knife through his lower jaw so hard that the tip of the knife can be clearly seen in his mouth. And Betty has been forced to see all this. Thus begins the terrible experience of Betty with a murderer, not only with the intention of hurting her, but also of forcing her to look at her while mutilating her friends. <br /> <br /> Opera is classified as Giallo, but for me, it differs in quite a few ways from the model. Less emphasis is placed on the mysterious elements of history than on something like Tenebre de Argento or The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. The masked and masked assassin may be omnipresent, but the clues and false leads normally associated with a good Giallo are absent. Instead, Opera is based on the tension of an unknown killer and making the audience feel uncomfortable. The focus is on the eerie scenes of death, Betty's fear and the murderer's obsession with Betty. <br /> <br /> The characteristics of the opera are some of Argento's most artistic death scenes. When the killer grabs Betty after her boyfriend leaves the room, you're sure Betty had her. But does the sadistic killer just want to force Betty to watch while he brutally stabs his lover in the neck? The knife emerging in his mouth. It's a well-shot and designed scene. And those needles in the eyes? sparkly. Or, take the death of the seamstress. At first, his death seems like an ordinary murder. But when the seamstress accidentally swallows the killer's medallion, what began as just another death scene makes it a notch, since the killer uses a pair of scissors to open the girl's throat and get her chain. Finally, there is the most famous death scene in Opera with which I am surprised every time I see her. Mira gets shot in the eye while looking through a keyhole. That scene shows a lot of what I like about Argento. It has style to burn. As unlikely as it is, it is creative, memorable and a marvel to see. <br /> <br /> Argento certainly was not the first Italian director to concentrate on ocular mutilation, but at Opera, he has taken an eye trauma. A new level Needles with open eyes, a bullet in the eye and crows pecking at an eye are part of the vision of Argento (play on words). And these scenes have the effect that I think Argento was looking for. The first time I saw the killer putting those needles in Betty's eyes, I could not stop blinking. It really had a physical effect on me. What are the eyes that make them a target of abuse in Italian films? <br /> <br /> To be fair (and not sound like a fanboy), there are problems that I have with Opera that prevent me from qualifying him as the best Argento. One of my problems is that the air duct system works through Betty's apartment building. While I do not doubt that there are systems of air ducts in old apartment buildings that connect the apartments, the ducts in Opera are HUGE. I am not an expert, but I sincerely doubt that a building like this movie has had such mammoth air passages. It does not seem practical at all. And do not you think someone had done something about it a long time ago to keep criminals and curious neighbors out of the other apartments? It's convenient for the plot, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> But I guess my main problem with the movie comes with the ending. What's up with that ending? It feels totally out of place, stuck, and like a last-minute bad idea. I'm not sure what else to say that is horrible.
