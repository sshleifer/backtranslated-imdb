I just wanted to say that I really liked this movie, but I also want to ask about something ... Does anyone know the name of the artist / song of the song that the child (I do not remember his name now) plays on his CD player? when your dad and 2 men come and take the television and the CD player? That song is incredibly great, although I can not understand a word of what they say ... Feel free to send me the name of the artist / song to hpn_x@hotmail.com. Thank you very much in advance! =) --------------------- repeating -------------------------- --- I just wanted to say that I really liked this movie, but I also want to ask about something ...
