In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues to make the documentary, discovering a story that he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a pleasant narrator, but unknowingly, privileges the audience. Therefore, the narrative has a double weave, the history of the documentary and the history of the documentalist. <br /> <br /> Our admiration is for the filmmaker, not only for pursuing his story with obstinacy, but also risking his whole idea. of their parents' relationship, but also by never surrendering to sensationalism or melodrama. Although Hollywood things are hidden in the details, Doug Block deals with history as he would in everyday life. For those of us who have always speculated about our parents' lives before we appeared on the scene (or after we arrived, but while we were too absorbed in ourselves to notice that they had a life independent of ourselves), 51 Birch Street gives us a fair warning. : There are wonderful things there in the country, but be careful if you choose to enter there. <br /> <br /> But that precaution is for the audience to go slowly through the details of their parents' past. It is not a warning to those who offer a glimpse into the lives of Block's parents. The film is a wonder to make the mother come alive as a vibrant and passionate but introspective person who makes her own conscious decisions during the 50s. The particular success of the filmmaker is to make the viewers see the young woman behind the elderly father and Grandpa. We all know that our parents were once young and vigorous, but at 51 Birch Street, the mother is. The father who has been distant while the filmmaker and his sister grew up ultimately remains distant in the film, but that is due more to his own elusive nature than to his interpretation. This biography turned into autobiography is dramatic, intense and unforgettable, which will surely send viewers running to see their own family albums up close, but more reluctant to look at the back of those photographs.
