"All men are guilty," says the police chief. "They are born innocent but it does not last". Add this little bit of nihilism to the fascination of Jean-Pierre Melville for the idea of ​​the thief's code of honor and have Le Cercle Rouge. This code of honor among criminals, however, is not simply a cliché; it is a figment of the imagination, even when the film moralists - realistic moralists in their view, the romantic moralists for most others - began to make films on the subject. His theme is that it is not what one does, but how one does it. We almost always end up with stories about experienced men with their own sense of honor, stories where destiny, fatalism and code handle things. <br /> <br /> For most of humanity, except for screenwriters and film directors, this would seriously hamper the way of living life, raising children and being a good friend. This educated fatalism is something like a self-indulgent notion. Le Cercle Rouge is, in my opinion, a classic movie for people who can secretly enjoy the adventure of losing the last bus home. But where Le Samourai - Melville's Criterion Collection, in my opinion, is the story that dominates the style, Le Cercle Rouge achieves the great trick of combining style with a solid story and with compelling actors. The point of the film, in my opinion, does not make sense ... but the film itself is a first class experience. <br /> <br /> Melville's hopeless tale of three thieves - Cory (Alain Delon), Vogel (Gian-Maria Volonte) and Jansen (Yves Montand) - is based on a bit of wisdom that, perhaps, It is attributed to Buddha: that all the men who are destined to meet, ... together with their destiny, can not change. Maybe, because some believe that Melville himself came up with the writing, if not the thought. Either way, we know from the beginning that this film will not end happily, it will depend on fate and coincidence to prepare things for us and remind us of the nihilistic philosophies we discovered and loved when we were in high school. Once Corey and Vogel meet and meet with Jansen's unique talents, we head on a one-way trip to steal an exclusive history of heavily protected jewelry at Place Vendome. The tension arises because not only do we know that the French police are behind Vogel, but we also realize that some determined thieves are behind Corey. <br /> <br /> For me, the great pleasure of the film came from admiring the work that Delon, Volonte and Montand brought to their characters, and the ruthless intelligence that Andre Bouvril brought to his character, the police captain Mattei . Melville hooked me while developing these characters and their own situations; He built me ​​emotionally and then let me go when he made me appreciate his possible destiny and let me see what happened. Melville sets up his pieces: the escape of the train, the escape from the forest, the subsequent shooting in the forest, the meetings with Mattei and a man who refuses to inform, with intriguing possibilities. He creates tension in all these cases by taking his time; a rare feature in making movies and an even weirder trait now. And Melville takes the time to build Mattei as an individual. Mattei is a sad and experienced man. He is a loner He has a fixed routine when he returns to his apartment: he greets his three cats with affection, takes out his bath and, while the bathtub fills, prepares the food for them. I do not know who Mattei is destined to meet, but I hope it's someone who likes cats. <br /> <br /> Nihilism is always fashionable among some creative people and some critics. In most cases, I think it is a much more difficult task to leave nihilism aside and simply live life without harming too many people. (And that's even harder to show convincingly in a movie). Le Cercle Rouge is a film that, for me, tells me little, but I think it's a beautifully made movie in its own way.
