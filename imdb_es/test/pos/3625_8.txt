If you've never experienced what Zasu Pitts is, here's a Zasu Zinger! In 1933, Mae Questel caressed Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the animated cartoon version of Fleischer Studios from the Popeye comic. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) makes his best personification of "Olive Oyl" by walking, moaning and touching his hands or by attaching himself to the police police. I kept waiting for her to say "ohhh myyyy", but instead it is "something always happens to someone". The first time I saw this movie, I loved Zasu and I found his character really fun. Since then I have seen her in other movies in which she makes this same whining, tense and fragile routine. So, when I went back to see this movie, I started getting a little angry with the constant whining and hysteria near a piece of dust. But, there are some funny comedy bits here, and it's also a mystery movie. It's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that really works. The plot of the mystery remains well in the camp of Zasu Pitts and James Gleason, who plays Arthur Crimmer, the policeman. The haunted house is fun with many secret passages and even a skeleton in the attic! Well worth the watch. Read more public domain movie reviews at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/
