... the true dream of a geek girl: high technology, great drama, smart guys, torrid sex and big explosions. (VERY big explosions). Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that the REAL Oppenheimer tapes sound strange: apparently, he had a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! The triumph and tragedy of Oppenheimer is one of the most moving dramas of the 20th century, and this film is a model of what the docu-drama should be: the facts can speak for themselves, while the fictional parts are used to Amplify and Fill in the record, so as not to attract attention. An interesting fact: some of the technical details used have recently been declassified, so they are of special interest. You must see it!
