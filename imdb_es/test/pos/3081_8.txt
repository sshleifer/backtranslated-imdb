Robin Hood; It's worth seeing Men in Tights, recently I saw him because I became a fan of Cary Elwes, and this is one of his main roles. Some moments really made me laugh so hard! I did not expect you to know, it was so fun. Even the second time you would still fall off the chair. The cast is great, of course, especially Locksley's own Robin, Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Do not let the name fool you, it's very big!) Hahaha and everyone else! <br /> <br /> There were some moments, of course, the movie tried to make a funny scene, but you did not. They necessarily laugh at it, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Cary Elwes and Patrick Stewart appeared in a movie together, by the way, both worked on "Lady Jane" in 1986, and it was fun to see them, 7 years later, older, awwww <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, certainly very funny!
