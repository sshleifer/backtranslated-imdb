Every once in a while you come across a movie that surprises you and this is one of them. On the surprise scale, this would be like sharing a hot tub with Jessica Alba, while a band formed by Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Phil Lynott and Keith Moon will play music at night. The reason why this film will surprise you is that because of the low budget they had (8,000 pounds) and that was made by a group of colleagues who just wanted to try it, they have produced something very clever and are easily seen 100 times more than your budget . <br /> <br /> The plan is simple: a group of mercenaries who transport a dangerous prisoner through space are attacked and forced to crash on a nearby desolate planet. After some controls, not only the planet does not exist according to the star maps, but they are not alone as it seems and something very hostile begins to choose them one by one. It sounds like the very standard sci-fi fare that mixes Aliens elements. Predator and Pitch Black, but take all this and turn them into something that feels fresh and original. <br /> <br /> The location in this place is fantastic, using the Balmeddie beach in Aberdeen to the fullest and you really feel that they are one a strange world. The seemingly endless sand dunes and clever lighting effects give it a very gloomy feel, you really think the crew is stranded in a strange world. In addition, the action sequences are excellent, the initial attack to the freighter is a great showcase of the special effects that can be achieved with a budget and the shootings, as well as the impressive end, all show the inventiveness of the film. <br /> <br /> As for the mercenary team, the cast stands out. For a low budget independent film, the casting here was done through the local media and it seems that they have chosen some possible stars for the future. Local body builder Mike Mitchell is not a natural actor in his role as leader of the Arnie-Esq mercenaries. Of the rest of the cast there are two outstanding performances: Patrick Wright as second in command McNeal and Scott Ironside as the ready engineer and ready Vince. Both have some of the best lines in the film and Scott injects some humor into the film with his performance. Patrick offers full performance as second in command. <br /> <br /> Director Mark Stirton can be very proud of what he has achieved and shows that Scottish films do not need all to be 'Kilts and Ceilidhs' or 'Slums and Drugs' Scottish films can be fresh, creative and, above all, very funny. This film is Scottish (with a flavor of the northeast) to the center and praises the actors and directors for keeping intact the accents, which adds to the charm of the piece. Although budget constraints show from time to time (the only flaw I could find) is to be expected. This movie, its cast and crew deserve all the success they get and then something more. For my part, I want Mark and his team to have all the success and theirs is a race that we have to follow very closely. <br /> <br /> Rating - 9/10 The first Scottish science fiction is bold, fresh and inventive, a true Triumph. <br /> <br /> Movie reviews, news and opinions like no other, in addition to the kick ass bimonthly pod-cast. <br /> <br /> www.fightrunner.co.uk <br /> <br /> contact@fightrunner.co.uk
