I just saw him at the Toronto International Film Festival. The impressive star cast of director Neal Slavin includes William Macy (seen in The Contender in last year's TIFF), Meat Loaf (also known as Meat Loaf Aday, AKA's Michael Lee Aday), David Paymer and Laura Dern (also starring Novocaine, also in this year Festival). <br /> <br /> Based on the novel by Arthur Miller with the same name, Focus follows Christian Newman (Macy), who looks Christian but looks Jewish as he fights between hatred and anti-Semitism in his neighborhood. Between the owner of a Jewish store on the street (Paymer) and his anti-Semitic card-carrying neighbor, Newman, Newman, he faces difficulties in dealing with the internal conflict and the conflict that surrounds him. Feeling guilty for knowing what is right, but not doing anything with battles to want to mix and keep peace with neighbors. Things get more complex when she meets and marries Gertrude (Dern), who everyone thinks is Jewish. Gertrude teaches her husband some things about how to judge books by covers. <br /> <br /> In the end, Newman will defend the Jewish man or will he flee? Go see it to find out. <br /> <br /> The performance was fabulous. The writing was incredible. The cinematography was excellent. The sound was well done. Technically incredible, the film was disturbing. Chilling Emotionally intense. I found myself bringing my knees to the fetal position a couple of times. I have a great admiration for all those who worked on it. I have not seen such a good movie in a long time. I was touched. <br /> <br /> Wow.
