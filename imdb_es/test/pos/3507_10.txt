"Just before dawn" is one of the best slasher movies. It is very realistic and atmospheric. It reminds me of "The Texas Massacre in Texas" and "Deliverance" by Tobe Hooper. Deborah Benson plays the heroine very well and director Jeff Lieberman created a very spooky and dark movie. "Just before dawn" is beautiful, photographed and the soundtrack is very disturbing. I never liked slasher or gore movies, except with this one. A very impressive and compelling movie (at least for me)
