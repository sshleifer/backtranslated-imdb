This is one of the best documentaries I've seen together with "Dark Days". I've skated for maybe an hour all my life, and I still love this movie. Peralta and his excellent editor captured the feeling and the atmosphere perfectly, helped in part by some incredible archive images. Tony Alva is one of the best individuals in existence. I love those striped sports socks, rock, Tony! <br /> <br /> Not only is this film a visual feast, but the soundtrack has to be one of the best in history, if you like the rock of the 70's. Buy the DVD, you will not regret it.
