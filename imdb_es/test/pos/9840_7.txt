"The Mayor of Hell" has the feel of an early Dead End Kids movie, but with a much harder edge and very few clear points, which precede the first appearance of the Dead Enders for four years. James Cagney has an opening credit in full screen, although technically, the "mayor" of the film's title is actually played by Frankie Darro, one of several boys sent to reform school during the initial scenes. Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a tough young man who befriended 'Patsy' Gargan (Cagney), and is elected to the position when Gargan takes a chance to humanize conditions in a state reformatory. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers made many of these types of movies, which try to provide a kind of awareness at a time that knew the effects of crime and poverty very well. This film is quite harsh, without apologies for ethnic stereotypes, such as the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a Jewish child runs a candy store in the school of reform. The rules in the reformatory are quite simple: work hard and keep your mouth shut; Leave the line and respond personally to Warden Thompson (Dudley Digges). <br /> <br /> Cagney's role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous, because although he makes a serious effort to improve conditions within the reformatory, on the outside, he still has nominal control of a criminal racket. The attempt of the film to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my opinion, the end tries to wrap things in a clean package while Gargan waits for the result of an almost fatal shot of one of his henchmen. It's not exactly the kind of role model one would look for in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers would disinfect some of the elements of this story in a new version of 1938 entitled "Crime School", with Humphrey Bogart in the role of Cagney and Billy Halop in the part of Frankie Darro. If you are partial with the Dead End Kids, you probably like this latest movie, since it also offers familiar faces such as Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. However, the ending is also somewhat confusing, with the character of Bogart's director involved in a cover-up of a prison escape. Both films offer a romantic interest for the main characters. In 'Mayor', Madge Evans is a reformist nurse who falls in love with the character of Cagney. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, many of James Cagney's early films are not commercially available, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for a Turner Classics screening, or look for the movie at a private collector. Personally, I do not get tired of this kind of thing and I find intriguing points of interest in films of all genres of the thirties and forties.
