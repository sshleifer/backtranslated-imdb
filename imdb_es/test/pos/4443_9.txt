This first movie of the future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the subgenre Giallo. Located in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children in general. Add a wide variety of familiar characters to the mix for giallo movie fans? a madwoman, a journalist, an ineffective police, a sexy mermaid, a priest, a dumb girl, a lonely mentally retarded, etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70s. <br /> <br /> Unusually For a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the most typical women in the angle of danger. The fact that children are the target of the maniac only serves to make things a little more uncomfortable. Fulci is pushing the envelope a bit here and goes even further in a gloriously outrageous scene of a PC where a young boy is subjected to the somewhat inappropriate attention of a naked and sexy young woman (Barbara Bouchet) to whom he has the task of deliver a drink. She shows herself openly and actively invites the young woman to eat her with her eyes; Finally asking if he wants to go to bed with her. Although he is clearly playing with him, it is still a rather unusual scene. Admittedly, here are one or two fragments of involuntarily funny dialogues, but they are very well photographed and Barbara Bouchet exudes high levels of sexual confidence. An outstanding scene. Even if you feel a little bad seeing it! <br /> <br /> Along with Barbara Bouchet, the other outstanding performance is Florinda Bolkan, who plays a crazy woman accused of murdering children. She is not directly responsible, but the viewer must decide if her black magic may or may not have started the later killing. Regardless, she is pursued by a gang of lynchings and whipped in a chain while a car radio explodes rock music. This scene is very strong and unpleasant. His malice indicates the path that Fulci's career would follow. <br /> <br /> Despite the visceral impact of the previous killing, it may be a bit surprising that the other murders are bloodless or committed off-screen. The only other death scene comparable to the linch-mob is the disappearance of the killer at the end of the movie, although this sequence is a bit silly. The plot is complicated and full of false leads, although personally, the identity of the murderer seems a little predictable. However, this weakness is less problematic in later visualizations. Like most gialli, Do not Torture A Duckling is eminently retransmitted. <br /> <br /> Technically, is the film well done with an impressive camera work, solid acting and effective music by Riz Ortolani? Particularly good is a recurrent unaccompanied female voice that seems to come from a distant hill. Fulci obviously made horror movies graphically more violent, but here he shows a talent for slightly more restricted material. However, it is still something wild and is highly recommended for giallo film fans.
