The Beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks who tried to survive in the 1980s in New York. This involves fighting with the other street gang with which they directly share a high school class, trying to stay in school, as well as going to local shows that involve bands that look like Dead Kennedy and have the name of Skulls for the name of his band. Rex (played by David Jacobson) plays an autistic child who starts doing a lot with all these guys, and starts to show them that poetry is really beautiful, and if it applies to what these children do in life, it can really make things work. for the best! Billy Kane (played by William McNamara) and Kate Kane (played by Kara Glover) are brothers. Although they run with this crowd of thugs, these children are not the same kind of people as this group.

While her sister sleeps with the head of the gang, she is also falling in love with Rex, trying to prove to her that she is not a whore.

But they like to think that he is not dead, he's just living his life to the fullest, riding sharks and being happy living in the ocean.

Something along the lines in which these children had no direction, no future, no figure to admire, but as a child with problems arrived, everyone realized that there were much more important things in life than fighting against them. local black children, or be destructive to everything. Rex showed them the beauty of the angry music. Rex showed them beauty in rats, diseases and murders. Rex showed them beauty in almost everything, while some of those things do not have any beauty, yet they could see that when they are used in poems, these poems speak to people. Rex played an important role in this movement, who changed the hearts of everyone from the depression, to see that there is hope for them, and that is why he began to show them; The heartbeat
