This is one of the best fans of Marion Davies, and one of the few that allowed him to show his ability as a physical comedian, who was so endearing in his silent films. Okay, so she makes a number of clumsy shots, but even the dance of the Ruby Keeler era does not hold up for younger generations. The problem here is the script. The story falls on an incredible melodrama in the last roll. It is quite scenic, and obviously it is adapted from a work ... but not enough. However, there is a bit of quick dialogue and slapstick in everything. Worth a look.
