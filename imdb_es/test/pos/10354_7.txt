I felt compelled to comment on this film because it is cataloged as the fourth science fiction film with the lowest rating of all time in the IMDb. WHAT!?!? Sure, this movie is crap, but it's HILARO! It's not horrible on an Ed Wood level, it's more surreal and uneven. <br /> <br /> There are some classic moments in the movie. Brain surgery is serious and excellent, and even more serious when you consider that the movie was classified as PG! Gor chased his dolly before they threw battery acid in his face ... "Mine! Gimmee!" Zandor Vorkoff's speeches at the beginning of the film: "Before Amir, Kali was just another weak nation struggling to free himself from centuries of stagnant feudalism!" Angelo Rossito also has some great lines: "No, Gor! No!" "You want these keys, are not you, my dear?" It is absolutely wrong that this is the 4th sci-fi movie in the IMDb because it is ENTERTAINMENT. No matter how bad a movie is, if it still manages to be strange, quirky, disturbing or entertaining, it has merit and does not deserve to be thrown out. I will not defend most of the films of Al Adamson, but this one, along with Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR, are entertaining enough to make up for their horror.
