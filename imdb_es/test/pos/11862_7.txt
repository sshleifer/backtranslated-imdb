One Night at McCool's is one of those films that starts with a lot of promises, but as the film progresses, it becomes silly and loses a lot of time. Liv Tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to get away with showing off her body to each of the men she knows, all of whom fall under her spell. There are some funny moments in this, but they are getting less and less as the movie deteriorates. A comedy farce. Michael Douglas, who plays the killer, is good, as is Liv Tyler, although it seems she has gained a bit of weight since the attack on the armaggedon. This is fine, but it is only memorable for the scene where Liv Tyler washes her car. You'll know what I mean when you see it! Shwing !!!!! 7 out of 10 (only).
