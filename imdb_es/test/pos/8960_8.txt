Yes, this movie has many gay characters. It also has direct characters, characters who are not sure of their sexuality, people who are looking for something of truth about their existence. <br /> <br /> This is not a film about sexual orientation. It is about loneliness and the difficulty that human beings often experience when connecting with each other. Filmically, Denys Arcand intelligently balances the various dimensions of relationships and relationships in contrast and in constant change. The killer element in series is a little less successful (it feels more like a way to wrap several points of the plot and, unlike the rest of the film, is thematically hard-line). <br /> <br /> Thomas Gibson centers and bases the film; It is a quiet performance, but behind the attractive and arrogant exterior, slowly reveals a terrified soul who is afraid to show or accept the love of those around him. The support cast is strong, especially Mia Kirshner as a friend of Gibson, a rental lady with precognitive powers. Its role is more a metaphor than a literal concept: strangely innocent and depraved at the same time, it represents the light and darkness of the sexual consciousness of the characters. <br /> <br /> The film involves and often surprises in its development of the character. The effect is something similar to Robert Altman directing a script by David Mamet: the dialogue is not contracted with some sharp observations, apart from some moments conceived at the beginning. Often, in our search for love and a conventional "relationship", we ignore the love that already exists around us, in our friends, family members, those who can see us as we are. Arcand and the writer, Brad Fraser, make some clever observations about the different ways in which humans try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial comes back to haunt us in so many unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> This movie is a rewarding experience. It may not be for fans who can not overcome the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater and transcendental message of hope and redemption. Loneliness is a universal experience. A film like this, that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with an intelligent and perceptive eye, deserves a round of applause and an open-minded approach.
