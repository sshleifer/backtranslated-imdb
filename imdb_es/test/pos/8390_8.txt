It only serves to show how wrong you can be. I did not expect that I would like this movie. I was disappointed with both the Kill Bill movies (although I preferred the second one) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-account release). I love Reservoir Dogs, I admire Pulp Fiction and I think Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature film piece, technically his most superior, including the last great performance by Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me that while his films have been good (I have not hated them) he has been stepping on water in referential, reverential and self-indulgent juveniles. <br /> <br /> Then I read the script last year. for Inglourious Basterds - and I hated it! Of course he had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on the page it was more juvenile crap, largely ruined by the generosity of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me think seriously about not watching the movie. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed my mind when I had the chance to see the movie with a Tarantino interview in London. I thought it would be worthwhile to listen to it in the Questions and Answers, since I know how entertaining it can be in person. <br /> <br /> So little I prepared myself for the pure and exuberant fun of Inglourious Basterds. <Br /> <br /> Easily Mr. Tarantino's best job, since Jackie Brown is a triumph. <br /> <br /> Yes, the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes, Eli Roth is a doubles specialist, but it works well, with little to do, but he seems aggressive, and does nothing to damage the film as he feared. While admiring Mr. Tarantino for using the double Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof to amalgamate the emotion of the great doubles scene, his lack of ability to act in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said for Tarantino's appearances in several films, especially From Dusk Till Dawn by Robert Rodriguez, which Tarantino wrote. <br /> <br /> What really makes this work is how GREAT it is. The style of the western spaghetti in much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully exaggerated without falling too low in the quality of Kill Bill cartoons. The violence is so big. The audacity so great. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers, Hitler's moment and Pitt's performance bothered me, but in the context of the movie they are very funny. Pitt is really brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is the fierce samurai of Mifune in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne of Once Upon a Time in the West, has a very James Coburn vibe for him, and of course a proper edge of Lee Marvin. <br /> <br /> Christoph Waltz (whom I did not know before) and Melanie Laurent (whom I noticed for the first time in a brilliant British short film in the French language by Sean Ellis) are sensational and I hope that both will be used much more in the future. Tarantino clearly has not lost his eye for the release, which seemed to abandon him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally great in its performance. Creepy, but theatrical. He is Fonda de OUATITW, Van Cleef de Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is appropriately innocent of Cardinale but strong, a fighter. Both dazzle here. <br /> <br /> For each cast member to have fun with what they are doing, while not just giving themselves away to have fun and trying to get laughs helps enormously. Laughter - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers is close to winking and pushing him too far, but his scene is reigning enough, with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender that seems straight out of the mold of the leader of the Great Escape of Attenborough. <br /> <br /> All the actors shine and Tarantino throws wonderful ornaments, but those who work with the story. The introduction of Hugo Stiglitz by Schweiger is a riot. After a sensational opening of slow burns and a glorious introduction to those basterds, the rhythm never stops and more than two and a half hours go by. <br /> <br /> It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to the real movie-doing instead of just self-indulgent nonsense. The musical options, as always, are inspired by Morricone. <br /> <br /> The film is bold and hilarious. After a summer in which almost all the movies have disappointed me, it was a great surprise that this film really fun and entertaining, but also immersive and impressive should be this, when I never would have believed from the script. Welcome back QT.
