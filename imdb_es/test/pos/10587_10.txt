I've been waiting so long to see this movie and finally I arrived yesterday. In short, I'm glad that I finally did it. Humor is out of the hilarious wall. The plot is so incredibly believable that it has to have at least some truth for it. If something stood out in this movie it is definitely the cafeteria scene. I've been there all the boys. You are dumped. You'll find out that your ex has been tricked by a guy you're sure is an asshole. Now, every time you see something in the next few days, you get horrible thoughts of this in all the wrong areas. She is fucking everyone and everyone knows it. I could probably see that man lick and caress his wallet all day and look at myself and laugh for having been there too.
