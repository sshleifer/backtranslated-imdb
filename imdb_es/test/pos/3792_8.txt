In these modern times (like the theme of the director of the short film of which this German count will speak), the politically correct films are the "leitmotiv" of the projects of the young modern filmmakers. "Shoulder Arms," ​​directed by Herr Charlie Chaplin during World War I (the film was released just a few weeks before the armistice) is an obvious example of why the early film pioneers were a very bold people, certainly! Directing a humorous film inspired by the terrible and bloody First World War was a complicated matter that only a few directors with such dangerous and daring ideas could do. Venturing into such a delicate and successful enterprise was reserved only for geniuses. <br /> <br /> As this German count said, "Shoulder Arms" was made during the First World War, that moment where the whole world definitely lost its innocence (Fortunately not the fat German heiresses of this aristocrat, and it is a hilarious and inventive social satire about that and any war The film is full of great gags and entertaining cinematographic continuity for a story in which that tramp will live through risky and courageous adventures in the front, a hero for the allies? or not. <br /> <br /> To make fun of the war trenches, the unhealthiness, the frontal attacks and the Germans (how dare you? ... by the way, are there many inaccuracies in the film? , the German soldiers had longer mustaches and beards, not to mention that the Kaiser lacks many medals in his uniform, in an elegant, fun and delicate way .. Even today it is an impossible cinematographic miracle To overcome, taking into account those terrible circumstances of wartime, the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent. Obviously, Mr. Charlie Chaplin had a lot of that. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I must temporarily retire because this German count must return to Schloss's trenches. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
