The most famous film by Sergei Eisenstein has really stood the test of time. The story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 has the feeling of Soviet propaganda, but it does a good job of showing the conditions that led to the revolt. The scene on the Odessa steps should remain etched in anyone's mind. <br /> <br /> Well, then "The Battleship Potemkin" was not really the first movie to use the montage, but they did a great job here. Certainly, any kind of film history should show this movie. It is a great historical drama (although I admit that I do not know how accurate it is). 10/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and we should have already learned that "Potemkin" should be transliterated as "Potyomkin".
