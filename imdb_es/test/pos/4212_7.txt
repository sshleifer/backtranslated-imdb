It is always a good feeling when a movie delivers the products when you did not expect it. The Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys were found in many unequal movies, and they generally did better when they were in a supporting role, as in "Angels With Dirty Faces". Here, their presence as a backdrop for the story of a boxer framed by murder gives them a lot of time on screen without being distracted from the main action. <br /> <br /> John Garfield is light heavyweight champion Johnny Bradfield, a left-handed hitter who is very different from the image that portrays the world of sports and the press. When a reporter inadvertently learns that Johnny is a womanizer who loves the party, his plans to spill that information in a column are interrupted by a bottle of whiskey on the head of Johnny's manager, Doc Ward (Robert Gleckler). In turn, Doc tells Johnny's girlfriend, Goldie (Ann Sheridan), to run away with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the journalist's death. While both flee, a police pursuit ends in a fiery car accident, and Doc's body is mistakenly identified as Johnny by the gold watch he wore. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains adopts a mockery of Edward G. Robinson who does not. I worked a lot as a detective who was reassigned to the details of the morgue after a bad arrest years ago. His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a pretty good feeling that the body in the accident was not Johnny. He bothers his boss to give him the closed case, and is assigned the task of removing him from the city and set him aside. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Johnny seeks the advice of his lawyer, and the winds are getting worse when he is cheated for most of his ten thousand dollar savings. Making his way across the country, Johnny ends up at the Rancho Rafferty Dates Farm in Arizona, led by a crusty granny Rafferty (May Robson). The farm is the legacy of Granny's brother, a deceased priest from Brooklyn, and is now home to a band of street boys (The Dead End Kids) who work on the farm. Billy Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this case, and his sister Peggy (Gloria Dickson) becomes the romantic interest of Johnny, now with the name of Jack Dorney. <br /> <br /> Give me a kick. From the historical perspective offered in these films of the pre-war era. When Johnny and the boys take a joy ride in the farm truck, they fill up at a gas station for $ 1.28! Tommy (Halop) has the idea that a service station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money, and with that thought, Jack Dorney decides to face a barn boxer who offers $ 500 per round to anyone who can stay in the ring with the clich√© premise is based on his hearing when Jack is eliminated in the fifth round, but by then he has already earned enough to give the fruit farm the opportunity to fight. Maybe Grandma Rafferty should have been in the ring, she almost took out everyone sitting around her in the ring. When Johnny / Jack enters the locker room, Detective Phelan is at your disposal to stop him. Knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this necklace, it is a question of whether Phelan continues his arrest, he will have to watch the movie to find out. <br /> <br /> I like the cul-de-sac Movies where Leo Gorcey is in charge, but he does not have much to do in this. However, he makes a great movie in the ticket taker at the door of the boxing match. Another thought: would not it have been great if the image always on the priest's wall had been that of Pat O'Brien? <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very good entry in both. The filmography of John Garfield and Dead End Kids, and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half. If there is a drawback, there is not enough screen time for the pretty Ann Sheridan. The film could have ended up even more satisfying if the roles of Sheridan and Gloria Dickson were reversed, since the on-screen chemistry between Pegson and Dickson's Jack seemed more forced than natural.
