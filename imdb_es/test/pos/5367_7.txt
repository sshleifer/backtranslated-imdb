The first time I saw the Brotherhood of Satan, I was 12 years old, I saw it in a small city in the central state of Washington that played before the Tales of the Crypt that we left early because my sisters were already scared by the Brotherhood of Satan . In general, I thought it was a pretty good movie. The beginning was good, we had just sat down and that tank made a number in that truck. <br /> <br /> What caught my attention was the landscape around the city where it was filmed, it was almost like the area around Chelan WA where I saw the film, especially when they were driving towards the City of Hillsboro, which is the location of the movie, a small town in southwestern New Mexico. I have always liked LQ Jones and Strother Martin, and also Charles Bateman, who was on Get Smart, another program that I like. I gave the film a 7 and then, when I could see Tales from the Crypt, I thought that the Brotherhood of Satan was better.
