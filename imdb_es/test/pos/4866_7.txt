As I said before in previous comments, some programs are there to be 'light entertainment'. So I feel a bit frustrated when the commentators seem to be waiting for a program that reveals the meaning of life, you will not get that from Cleopatra 2525 and I'm not supposed to offer it. What you get is a girl who was frozen and who comes back to life some 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. It does not settle in 10 minutes like what happens with other adventures in time and is not the female equivalent of James Bond, ready to face all concerned. Most of us would be However, it is a light entertainment, the stories have a middle beginning and an end in a quick time and there are some surprisingly good moments to act. The episode in which there is a double of Cleopatra is particularly moving and I think Jennifer Sky gives one of the best performances of someone who dies for a long time, and that I am fond of film and television, I know what I am talking about. Finally, to prove my sincerity, I have bought all but four of the episodes and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I do not have the complete set is because I bought the other episodes before I realized that there was a complete set of pictures. Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres complete the trio in a creditable manner and for light entertainment, Cleopatra 2525 certainly entertained me.
