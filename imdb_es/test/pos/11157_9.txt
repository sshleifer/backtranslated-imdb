Okay, I know it's clich√©. Taken on its surface, this is a bad movie, maybe in a league with "Plan 9 From Outer Space." The dialogue is suspicious (but the Singlish is quite nice ...), the plot is not entirely credible, the character of Gavin overactivates excessively. While watching the movie, things happen that really make him wonder ... Handsome and Kim kissing in a tank, Gwen eating a banana in a bathroom, almost everything Gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssssyycho !!). These things taken by Separate are perhaps failures, taken together, however, they are just whimsy.Watch this movie with an open mind (especially if you are not familiar with the culture of Singapore), and with a group of open-minded friends you are guaranteed to offer many You can not go into this movie waiting for a masterpiece, or even hoping to take something seriously, if you can take this film for what it is: a downstairs movie about the non-favorites, fill it to the brim with your own peculiarities, then you should have a good time watching this! I've seen it three times and I would not hesitate to see it three more times!
