I can not believe that this can happen. We do not know if Justin and Richard were worried or had committed crimes in the past. The movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble. So, the first crime they commit is murder? Just to play and push with the police? How do you pick up any girl and just say you are? Richard also seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort, and neither does it seem that women have problems. Hmmm This whole concept is really hard to believe. That said, let's move on. I found myself really hating these punks and I would love to have been present with my gun with tactical police ammunition and see what their plastic suits do at that time. As for Cassie, who was a victim of Carl Hudson, she has had a hard time trying to survive. The memory of being stabbed 17 times by Carl leaves her in an emotional mess. Sandra does an excellent acting job. She sure made me believe she was an angry policewoman. As for solving the crime, I thought it was great. This movie kept me in my chair. I loved the performance of everyone except Sam. He did not get up and left. The only thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should I say the scene of the rape.
