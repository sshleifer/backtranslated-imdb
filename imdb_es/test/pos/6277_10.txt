To be honest, this is probably the best version of my book as a soundtrack version of the Jazz Singer. The 1927 version is really a silent movie, despite its construction as the first talkie. <br /> <br /> Danny Thomas is a great comedian and he sings very well. He does Jewish things with feeling. Peggy Lee is great and any movie that has it is always entertaining. Allan Joslyn is not very entertaining and we could have done it without him. One question: since when does Cantors live in such luxurious homes?
