this movie left me trapped in this endless loop to think about it during the following days ... granted, I am not the snob of the movie that seems to be the people around here, but I thought that this was incredibly well acted and a creation powerful If lacks a bit of subtlety in the execution. It turns out that I admire films that can effectively recreate the sensation of seeing a play, creates an inharmonic restlessness that works well with this film. I'm also a big fan of alan rickman, so that could be my bias. Personally, I found that the lack of spatial landmarks is a good thing, in fact, this could be anywhere, and probably is. I say it's easy in what was a powerful experience for me and probably for anyone involved in any kind of political activity.
