Thursday is clearly derived from the 'new wave' of crime movies released since Quentin Tarantino took the genre by storm with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early nineties, but he has enough ideas of his own to make sure it remains a small movie interesting . On Thursday it uses some characters mostly within a single location. It works because each character is peculiar enough in its own right to be memorable, and when you put together what you have is a very fun little thriller. You can find little substance within the plot, but it does not matter because nobody enters this type of film that awaits an affirming experience of life. The plot follows Casey; a former drug trafficker who went straight and now lives as a successful architect in the suburbs with his wife. The couple wants to adopt a child, but things get complicated when Casey receives a visit from his former partner in crime, Nick, who brought a case of heroin and a lot of money stolen from the police. Thursday will become a very interesting day for our former criminal ... <br /> <br /> The first scene prepares the film quite well and ensures that we know what to expect. We see that a coffee order goes wrong, which turns into a murder scene that the guilty parties quickly cover up when a policeman comes for a snack. The scene is imbued with dark humor and witty dialogues, and that takes place during the rest of the film. Thursday is a very funny movie, and scenes like those that see the adoption visitor appear at an uncomfortable moment ensure that the film is difficult to refuse. It is true that the film does not bring anything new to the table, cinematographically or by plot, but the fact that it is happy to wallow in its mockery ensures that there is more time for the absurd situation to develop around the central characters. The acting is decent enough, with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot. Thomas Jane holds the film well in the main role, while the funny performances of James LeGros, Paulina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke back it up very well. It is unlikely that this film will impress the enthusiastic fan of the film, but if you just want a funny little movie with some nice turns and performances; Thursday is likely enough.
