Strange but wonderfully original film. Truly frightening, spooky and ridiculous in equal measure. The configuration of a high-rise red brick apartment is a perfect setting for unforgettable action. The idea of ​​a secret room sealed in a place like this is good enough, but when the ingenuous leader begins to clean the old bed that he finds in this room, the scene is set for some classic chills. The cast is fantastic. Tanya Dempsey can really chew some stage after being underrated in other Full Moon movies. Joe Estévez shows why Brother Martin Sheen is much bigger in Hollywood; his blank eyes during the bed scene are really fun. Charles Band co-produced with Stuart Gordon and this is really an exceptional release of Full Moon / Darkwave. Danny Draven also directed Hell Asylum with Dempsey.
