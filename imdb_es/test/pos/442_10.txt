This is my favorite Renoir of the fifties. It's the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workers attacking the site to start the construction and training of the dancers. Finally, the vertigo of the opening night and the long cancan dance sequence. It describes the financial problems and demonstrations of the artists' ego. <br /> <br /> Gabin is in great shape like the carefree Danglard: seeing him deal with Nini's violent boyfriend with humor. Gianni Esposito is moving like the melancholy prince who is courting Nini. María Félix, with the body of that amazon, imposes herself as the selfish Lola, Danglard's first lover. Finally, Françoise Arnoul as Nini, the washing girl who ends up dancing for Danglard and becoming his girl, is simply awesome; its charm and its perverted charm will conquer you. <br /> <br /> An advantage: we have Edith Piaf, Patachou, André Claveau and other stars in cameos that touch the stars of a century ago that ruled the Moulin Rouge.
