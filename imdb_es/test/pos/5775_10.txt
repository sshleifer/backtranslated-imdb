This movie of what I remember was a great movie! I saw him on television when he was 11 years old, and I could not remember the title. If I remember correctly, I think it was a special Christmas movie for television. One of my friends at work and I discussed it several years ago, but none of us could remember the title. But we do remember almost the entire movie. Nobody else at work remembered seeing him! Thank God that someone on a TV movie website responded to my post! Now I have the fun job of finding a copy! It's amazing what you can remember when you were a child, but this movie is definitely still in my head ... even after 28 years. And I think I only saw it once. Maybe it was because I'm the oldest sister of my family, or maybe because I took care of children and worked in day care, which stayed with me all the time. Regardless of the real reason, it has been one of the movies I've been waiting to see lately! If someone knows where to see it online or has a copy, let me know. I would love to see it again! Thank you! Seriously, I tried to post this and said that my comment is not long enough. So, apparently I have to write more, did you know that Melissa Michaelsen is the sister of Peter Billingsley who starred in A Christmas Story? I know I'm not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea where to find it, I would greatly appreciate it.
