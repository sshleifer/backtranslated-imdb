The American film by Chris Smith is an insightful examination of the American dream. The film focuses on Mark Borchardt, an independent filmmaker from Wisconsin. Mark has dreamed of being a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had a hi8 camera out of focus. The film follows Mark through his attempt to make his dream movie, Northwestern. There are a number of hilarious scenes in the film while Mark goes through Northwestern preproduction and then his short film Coven (pronounced co-ven, the correct pronunciation, Mark says "It seems too much like the oven"), which he plans to use to raise money for complete Northwestern. The perception and humor of this film are on par with Roger and Me, the great Michael Moore film. The first time I saw it was in a chaotic projection of the Sundance Film Festival that brought out the spirit of the film: a giant air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the film, hit seven people and caused a delay twenty-five minutes; Halfway through the movie, the sound began to vibrate and the projector had to stop to fix it, and in the last twenty minutes, the projector stopped and the movie burned. Despite the delays, the audience stayed through the movie and gave him a standing ovation. American Movie also won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary at the end of the festival. I highly recommend this good movie, it is worth sitting through any infernal projection.
