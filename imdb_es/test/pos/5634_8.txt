What gives this movie its personality is the knowledge, in the end, that everything is true. While it is a compelling and humorous documentary that borders on the mockumentary in some places (are they organized or is it really happening with humor?), It seems to lengthen a bit towards the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun in the places where it has to be, and it flows relatively well. Reminiscent of the Christopher Guest movies, if you liked these or Adaptation, I recommend you take a look at this. <br /> <br /> B +
