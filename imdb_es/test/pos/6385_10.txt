I loved. Others have revealed spoilers, but I will not. It was an unusual premise, actually a little weird, but I accepted completely. Camille was a difficult part to achieve convincingly; Maybe that's why some people hated it. But I think Sienna was excellent and her acting skills allowed her to perfectly fit the part, without being so perverted or ridiculous. I do not know why she was interested in a loser like James Franco, but she married him anyway. I like him as an actor and I also thought he did an excellent job. He has nothing to be ashamed of. There have been movies with similar settings, p. Eg "Ghost". I just love Sienna Miller and I accepted the situation as written in the script. I feel that his great talent as an actor is very underestimated, and I hope he is more recognized by the public. I thought all the actors played their roles very well, and I hope more people can see the movie. I highly recommend it. I was surprised that my local Block Buster store had approximately 10 copies available. I definitely plan to buy it.
