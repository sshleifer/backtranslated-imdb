This movie was great, I do not understand the lack of respect it receives. The first scene is in 87-88 and it was really scary. If you're a fan of the horror of the 80s, you should not have any problems with this movie, because it has everything that makes the horror of the 80 is great. I got to meet some of the actors and they were great. What is not good about an old and spooky house, demons, crazy parties and young handsome and horny. The dialogue and the special FX made this movie a classic. This film also dealt with one of those classic rumors about the horror that black does not always have to die in the end. Even though this movie was great, there is one thing that remains to be discovered, what really happened to the old couple in the The end was on purpose or not, that little side story of Alway has puzzled me.
