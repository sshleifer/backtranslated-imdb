I love dogs, and the most interesting character in this movie is a Golden Retriever. He is smarter, more handsome and more interesting than any of the human characters. Like many other contributors, I have not read the book, but I doubt that I would have changed my opinion about the film. It is predictable from the first five minutes. No surprises Mad scientists create a loose monster and a teenage boy and his wonderful dog collaborate to destroy it. In general, the movie is a dog. But like I said, I love dogs and therefore I will give this movie a rating of 7/10. Look at it if it's on TV, hold it if you're bored and nothing else catches your attention, but do not buy it unless it's special.
