I'm not a fan of this comedy brand: stereotyped characters who act excessively through a farce of thieves and police. But there are enough nice characters to keep the interest. Michelle Pfeiffer is adorable, but the person who really takes the film is Dean Stockwell, who steals each scene as the main mobster (called Tony, no less). <br /> <br /> Stockwell's performance is the reason why I write this review (and the only reason I would recommend it), in fact. It will tickle you for your screen time. Play the boss of the Mafia perfectly, with comic touches in the right places, managing to avoid becoming a dominant clich√©. In fact, Stockwell is a real pleasure to see: a master of the 'double take' and a true 'looker' in those elegant suits and fedoras. <br /> <br /> Meesa says: A good movie to watch while folding clothes or eating leftovers.
