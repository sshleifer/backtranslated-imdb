Peter O'Toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie. I have seen the original version with Robert Donat and I prefer the performance of Peter O'Toole and the film in general, although it is a musical. I've never really seen anything that Mr. O'Toole has that I do not like. He is a brilliant actor, with multiple talents, who offers performances full of passion and depth. Petula Clark also performed surprisingly well and was perfect for the role. It is a moving film, full of tenderness and bittersweet fun. I will always remember (in paragraphs) the line where Mr. Chips regrets that he has never given him children, and she responds: "Of course yes, hundreds of them, all boys". Thank you for the opportunity to vote for this film and express my opinion.
