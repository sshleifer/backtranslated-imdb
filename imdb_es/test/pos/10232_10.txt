Why do not critics like this movie? I do not understand This is easily my favorite Clive Barker effort. "Hellraiser" is a bit too rough (the movie never leaves that stupid house) and, let's face it, "Lord of Illusions" does not move at all. I have loved Barker's writing for years, especially his "Blood Books." Terribly entertaining. He has a vicious side that is totally different from a Stephen King. He mixes freely in his own homosexuality and in religious and occult elements. I love love, love, love. However, I also realize that Barker is a fantasy writer as dark as a horror writer. And fantasy is not my bag. It puts me right to sleep. Always has. I also think that Barker works better with short stories. His novels tend to wander a little. That was my experience when trying to read "The Damnation Game". It started well. Then, in 100 pages, I thought "where is this going?" because I was not going ANYWHERE. <br /> <br /> I read "Cabal" (the book was based on Nightbreed) and I thought it was good. Especially I like the elaboration of Decker's character. The way the mask spoke to him and controlled him. I like the way Barker simply presents it. In black and white. There is. He gives it a simplicity that is attractive and credible. When asked why Decker kills, he says (simply) "Because I like it". Probably something that Jeffrey Dahmer said at some point. <br /> <br /> But I actually liked the movie Nightbreed better than Cabal. I love the visual attention to detail that Barker gives to his films. I LOVE IT. I think it's just beautiful. Lord of Illusions also had some of this. Some of the drawings at the beginning, during the Nightbreed credit sequence. It's like a complete vocabulary that Barker dreamed only for the Nightbreed world. I would be curious to know how purely your design was. I know he is an INCREDIBLE artist who has his own style and language as an artist. <br /> <br /> Nightbreed is also (I think) the most entertaining BArker movie. It moves very fast. Well edited Do not crawl like Lord of Illusions a little while ago. Very fast. Everything is just perfect. It also works as a fantastic and terrifying slasher movie. Things with the murderer at first killing the family and then tormenting the old man in the store are really terrifying things. That mask is terrifying. I'd like to know if Barker designed that, too. It's not just a Jason type mask or "Scream". Something about this is really disturbing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a great movie. Definitely check it out if you have not seen it. Highly recommended One of my favorite horror movies of all time. In my opinion, the best of Clive Baker. Although it is frightening and violent, be careful.
