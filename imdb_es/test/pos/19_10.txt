This is one of my three favorite movies of all time. My only objection is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene, but the performances were so big that I forgive him. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely wonderful brilliant. The script is great, it gives a very good picture of life in the theater during World War II (and, therefore, what it was in the 30s). Many great and subtle touches, many broad and exaggerated strokes, all perfectly done. Scene after scene simply takes my breath away, and then there is the heart-rending climax.
