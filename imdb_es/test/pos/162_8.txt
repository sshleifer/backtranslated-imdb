Three children are born exactly at the same time, during a lunar eclipse. Just before they turn 10, they embark on a wave of murders. "Bloody birthday" is a typical slasher of the early 80's. It's a pretty normal thing with a lot of nudity. The "evil children" never generate any threat and there is almost no suspense. There is no gore or scared in "bloody birthday", but the movie is something entertaining. Unfortunately, there is no real explanation for the sudden homicidal mania of the children. The murder scenes are pretty scary, for example, we have death with a gun, baseball bat, jump rope and shovel. Therefore, if you are a fan of the movies of the early 80's, take a look.
