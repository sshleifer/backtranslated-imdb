I saw this movie "miniseries" on television in 1989 and it was an amazing movie. I'd love to track a copy to see it again and again. It's been 15 years since I saw it and it still remains in my mind. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it attracts you. The characters and the plot continue to hold you. The end was magnificent. The feeling and anger that the son showed when discovering the truth about his father are unforgettable. The suspense about how it will turn out and how he will face his father is really intense. <br /> <br /> If you can get a copy of this movie, you will really enjoy watching it. <br /> <br /> Then, send me an email and tell me where I can get a copy.
