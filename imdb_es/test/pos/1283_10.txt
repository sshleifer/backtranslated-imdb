Christopher Nolan had his stated goals in Going in a very narrow direction, and in that direction he pulled out something that reminded me of the great "row of poverty" movies that Ullmer directed in the 1940s. Only this time, it's able to implement touches of homage, things like black and white photography (due to the budget of shoelaces, but it is also essential for the dark cracks that these characters inhabit) and the casting of the actors (the protagonist of John Doe, the sly male counterpart, and the beautiful-in-a-sandy femme fatale-way, while keeping her in the underground 90s realm, where for several thousand dollars and specific options in locations and music and such a thing could be That, and also in the dark film environment, Nolan also gathers a clever web of a plot, perhaps even more than Memento, where the latter was a work of a psychology that develops through From a plot enriched by looking inch by inch, here the non-linear structure serves to show how someone like Bill can travel a path as dark as Cobb, only in an environment where keeping alert is not for someone who does not It is really twisted and in mental games deeper than Cobb. <br /> <br /> Of course, the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story, and going into it, I was not even sure where it would lead, if it could be some kind of flow of consciousness towards Slacker where Nolan would take his character from one British urban person to another. But the establishment of Bill's ties with Cobb is done quickly and excellently, as we see right when Cobb approaches Bill in the cafeteria to ask him what he's doing after he says that almost everything we need to know about both, that, and The first robbery brings it to him. What seems to be a good score soon on the horizon is really a great configuration of Cobb and his lady (simply called 'The Blonde', perhaps a too obvious tribute to Noir, but why the tent?). But this is revealed in a way that really made me guess, since the manipulation of the narrative worked even harder to elicit questions not so much about why but how. The density is further emphasized due to the actors' understanding of their essential points as characters, with Alex Haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask his "deep" ideas about what it is really to please a robbery. and Theobald with that attitude of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does, but he's smarter in that naive way that he has no chance in the damp environment like this; Russell almost made it too easy, even with a face that would send Ana Savage to shake her head. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman, keeping nothing in it that he does not. add to the environment and the suspense, with the appearance and gradual disappearance not too fast to leave a lasting impression, but enough to add to the logic of the script "this-could-take-anywhere". He follows it in the form of a hand as if he knew where his limitations lie, and yet it's fantastic to keep the essentials: the close-ups when necessary (a face I loved is Russell's face in a small mirror) and a pretty simple techno. Track that never subtracts. Sometimes, as mentioned, the line between seeing something in the "present" and seeing something that is as eternal as a solid pulp story of low-level criminals with mental games and moral ambiguity is always always totally clear, which for I am Virtually irresistible in its dark form. In short, this is one of the excellent business cards I've seen from a filmmaker in recent years, and I hope it's something that future fans of Nolan's other work can hope to discover. Or even for those who think that noir has turned to fast-editing dogs and shots with big guns from the mainstream (even in independent films) it's a bit bright for 71 minutes.
