Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American hospital system with this comedy / drama / whodunit. The hospital shown here is full of problems ... from protesting by neighbors to irate patients or a potential serial killer. George C. Scott is the best doctor who, on the verge of his own nervous breakdown, gets involved with Diana Rigg and his mad father Barnard Hughes. Alternately depressing and troublemaker, THE HOSPITAL presents some of the most acidic dialogue imaginable (watch Scott describe his lovemaking session with Rigg). He also has a lot of great vignettes: Scott, chief nurse Nancy Marchand, after one of the subordinates here accidentally kills a doctor; incipient administrator Frances Sternhagen desperately tries to collect insurance information from a waiting room full of sick people; Scott received serious advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him about his unfortunate family life. All the action is of the first order. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The film is a masterpiece with Chayefsky's script that won a well deserved Oscar (in a competition as hard as KLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening narrative is priceless.
