This movie was different. It took a kind of typical suspense story and reached a more interesting and profound look at the struggle of an individual character with faith. Of course, it helped that the main performance, by Andrew McCarthy, was quite excellent. The other performances were also quite interesting, although not as consistent. The end was a bit disappointing, but there were many good times. The filmmakers tried something different here, they did not limit themselves to the shivers and apparent chills. This is a dark movie (not for everyone), but if you want to be entertained and not be bothered, try this one.
