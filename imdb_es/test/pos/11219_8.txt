NORTHFORK is first and foremost a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography. Just for this, the movie is worth it. The open and desolate plains of northern Montana are captured in the sober and muted earth tones of autumn or early spring. The giant gray cement Fort Peck Dam is the protagonist of the film. The movie comments in a subtle and not so subtle way about a dozen themes of Western Landscape. The dialogue can be tried at times, but the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film. The 1950 period works very well here and runs so well. I think the years that will pass will be kind to this movie.
