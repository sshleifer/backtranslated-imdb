Nothing is worse than the genocides in the history of our world. This film attempts to describe the horror faced by a particular family, a common narrative device, in the world of the atomic bomb of Hiroshima. The most memorable parts are the graphic and sad images that the people of Hiroshima face after the war. The story, however, is more concerned with the effect on a specific group of people and how they manage to move on with their lives; In other words, if you really do not care about them, the movie becomes boring. However, it is difficult not to worry when the homeland of a family is destroyed. I'm not sure if I would recommend this movie, because it says very little in political terms and, honestly, it did not maintain my interest in the family's problems.
