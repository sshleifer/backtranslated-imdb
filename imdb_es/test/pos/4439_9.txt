My Architect is a great movie about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself through the legacy of his famous father architect, Louis Kahn, who died since 1974. The film develops slowly but perfectly, and what starts as a crisis of The apparently lost identity of forty-something develops in a beautiful story with a much deeper meaning with respect to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps most importantly, the work of our life. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Louis Kahn before this movie, although he was vaguely familiar with some of his works. Through the words (both good and bad) of Louis Kahn's colleagues, you have a very clear idea of ​​what Nathaniel must have felt when recalling the memories and stories that have been re-told. Sometimes it seemed that these people were telling Nathaniel how to feel about his father. As I listened to each memory, my opinion about this man went from beautiful to horrible, sometimes in a lapse of time, so you get an idea of ​​the roller coaster in which Nathaniel's emotions were. <br /> <br /> The final sequence in Bangladesh made the film totally for me. The reverence of which the people of Bangladesh spoke of the work of Louis Kahn joined all the loose ends for me and, hopefully, for Nathaniel. <br /> <br /> I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what he was looking for.
