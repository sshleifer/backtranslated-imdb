So totally unique and entertaining! Another great Canadian invention. A regular "Joe" (Dan) and a group of misfit delinquents (also known as Puppets), all share their residence in a house halfway. Dan's job is to monitor four 'threats to society' and help them rehabilitate themselves. Bill, the homicidal doll, Rocko, the cigarette smoker, Buttons, the nymphomaniac teddy bear and Cuddles, the comfort doll. The five are found in all kinds of odd predicaments. Despite their murderous sexual tendencies, and often openly perverse, it is difficult not to find them kind. <br /> <br /> I give this show a 10/10 simply because it provides good entertainment, without the need for a huge budget, and it exudes a Canadian style that makes me proud.
