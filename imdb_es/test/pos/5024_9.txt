An outstanding but very nice performance by John Travolta launches this funny comedy. His interpretation of the archangel is like a man of a squalid, womanizing, overweight lady. And, certainly, it has a fascinating effect on the women he meets on his trip to Chicago. John Hurt has very little importance in his role as a principal reporter for Chicago Tabloid owner Bob Hoskins. Angie MacDowell plays the role as much as she did in "Four Weddings and a Funeral." Maureen Stapleton is clean in a cameo. His comment, "Michael does not suffer fools," is just one of many memorable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only one of the leading performers who can not connect, a little out of control. Mainly, you are there to see Michael face a bull, hypnotize the waitresses and dancers in a western-style restaurant and prove that he is a completely free soul. It is a memorable comedy worth more than one visit.
