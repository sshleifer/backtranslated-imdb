I was pleasantly surprised to find a very nice movie that kept my attention at all times. I'm a fan of horror and I see almost everything in that genre, but Dead Line managed to scare me. The pace is very clever and Andres Bagg does a good job as a desperate man. What is below the main plot? A trip to madness. How can you end up like this? Martin Sanders asks himself as he sees a homeless person talking to himself, alone on the street. Near the end of the movie, Aaron Mandel's character asks the same question while he sees another homeless person doing the same thing; Not knowing, however, that this homeless person is Martin Sanders, answering the question of the beginning of the film. The glasses broken in two are a clear symbol of rupture and division ... of personality. The end is that you are left speechless and you simply know that you would have to do a sequel.
