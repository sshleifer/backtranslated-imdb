Upon returning from 20 years in China, a young missionary refuses to become THE CAT'S DUCK for a gang of thugs from his hometown. <br /> <br /> This movie was a little different from Harold Lloyd's previous films. Comedy derived from dialogue, often quite serious, predominates here, rather than the complicated visual jokes that drove the classics of Harold's past. However, there are some splendid moments that are pure visual fun, like when Harold tries to follow a convertible down a busy street, or when he tries desperately to prevent a stripper from a nightclub from losing his clothes. There is also the climactic scene, set in a basement in Chinatown, in which Harold happily throws himself into the darkest comedy. But most of the humor stems from Harold's refusal to be the gossip of the criminals who have run his hometown for years. <br /> <br /> And it's a collection of bad-tempered politicians and bullies that Harold finds himself with. by a group of actors of fine characters: George Barbier, Nat Pendleton, Grant Mitchell, Edwin Maxwell, Alan Dinehart, Warren Hymer and the stuttering of Fuzzy Knight. Pert Una Merkel is at hand like the girl in the tobacco stall who catches Harold's attention and keeps him intrigued by his sensible view of life. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize Samuel S. Hinds as Harold's missionary father; Charles Sellon as an old cleric of Stockport; and Herman Bing as a German gangster, all uncredited. In addition, appearing for only a few seconds as an attempt to kidnap, is Noah Young, a familiar face of the silent films of Harold, who makes his final appearance in a film by Lloyd. <br /> <br /> Fox gave the film an excellent production of Values, especially in the first scenes set in China.
