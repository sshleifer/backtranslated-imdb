Four young saints from the Mormon country go to L.A. to preach the gospel to urban pagans. But, one of the young Mormons is a repressed gay who "passes" by crossing with a very young party boy "outside". (What would the argument of the film be without coincidences?). These two young people, very different, become friends and, in the process, affect the perspective of each one, which in turn creates an inevitable clash between gay and Mormon cultures. <br /> <br /> That's the premise of "The Last Days," a 2003 film, written and directed by C. Jay Cox, himself a former Mormon missionary. The history of the film is, of course, very relevant, especially in contemporary America. The variations of this story must be told, and re-told, and re-told, hopefully in future movies ... because the underlying theme highlights the odiously superior attitude that Christian fundamentalists often show towards gays. By its nature, "The Last Days" is provocative, and I doubt that the film was well received in Provo or Pocatello, although the script is intelligent, sensitive and insightful.
