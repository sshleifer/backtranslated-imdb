This is definitely the most intimist and stimulating piece of Nolan. It does not mean that Memento or insomnia are bad, but they definitely lived up to Hollywood standards ... while "Follow" is more of an indie movie. The story is very bright and very well developed. In general ... look at this if you're a fan of Nolan's work, I'm sure you'll appreciate it more.
