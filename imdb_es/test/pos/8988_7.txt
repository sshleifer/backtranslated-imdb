Young Warriors (1983) <br /> <br /> While this is a deeply flawed (and, in a way, idiotic) movie, the way it continually challenges expectations makes it worth seeing for the adventurous fanatic. <br /> <br /> Meet the yuppie university student Kevin and his gang of adorable brotherhood friends. In what begins as a particularly atrocious sexual comedy for teenagers, we follow this group of fools and their antics, which involve, among other things, making promises to tie bricks to their genitals. The movie changes abruptly when a high school freshman's sister Kevin is brutally raped and beaten in a coma by a gang of motorcyclists who apparently have nothing better to do. When she dies in the hospital, Kevin swears revenge, to the chagrin of his detective father. <br /> <br /> Until now, we've gone from Porky's-lite, through the Last House on the Left, to what Apparently is shaping up to be your typical urban vigilante revenge movie. However, the portrait of Kevin and his gang ranges from vaguely understanding until they become crazy assassins. Kevin is responsible for the film that does not fascinate the fascist rhetoric against crime that Kevin issues continuously, while it is still understandable that he feels like him. <br /> <br /> The mood goes from happy to dirty and strong very fast, and in the end it is so exaggerated and exploitative that it will leave you incredulous. And that is the strength of this movie. You never know what to expect next. <br /> <br /> In more than 100 minutes, it's a bit long for this type of rate, but you will not get bored. Most of the time he acted badly, with cardboard cutouts for characters and some particularly ridiculous situations and a rather stupid dialogue, this will not surpass any of the classics forgotten in the short term. However, I like it very much and I am sure that anyone who reads this knows if he is ready for it.
