Every episode that I saw when I was an innocent child was stupid. There were some funny-looking puppets called "The Mitts" that always talked about childhood things. They would play this song before "The Mitts", part of the show that goes like this: "Let's join the Mitts ..." There was a puppet of Groucho Marx who told jokes. Before the session, this man sang "Hot Fudge! Right On!" There was a green puppet with teeth named Seymore. We would always see more Seymore. He would make jokes and sing each episode. There was always a moral in each episode. In one episode, a man sang "Liars are the losers!" Another episode that he sang about sharing and caring. Seymore said, tell me about those two girls "Sharon and Karen." The part of Hot Fudge Holey Moley has this man doing weird stuff and they play weird music.
