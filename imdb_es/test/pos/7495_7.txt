'Thursday' is a good movie, but we recognize too much of other films in its genre and that's why it lacks originality. If you've seen 'Goodfellas', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and a lot of other movies that were inspired by the last one you've seen almost everywhere since 'Thursday'. There is a scene that involves tortures that have even the same dialogue as in the 'Reservoir Dogs' of Tarantino. <br /> <br /> Still, it's a good movie. Because you do not take all the parts of the same movie, everything has some new ideas and some nice touches. The initial sequence, to begin with, is quite impressive. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart), Dallas (Paulina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They fight with an employee at a service station, grabbing a cup of coffee and it ends with the death of that employee and the arrival of a police officer. We already saw a suitcase with a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He is married to Christine (Paula Marshall) but he used to work with Nick. She does not know anything. Then Nick calls him and tells him he's coming. We learn that he has ruined his friends and the problems are about to begin. <br /> <br /> What happens exactly is not for me to reveal it, but we find other characters, all interested in money or drugs that Nick. I also had with him. Casey threw them down the drain. <br /> <br /> Very funny moments, lots of blood, a very funny secondary plot that involves the actor Michael Jeter and some surprises (although if you really think about it, you see them coming.) this is a good movie with some very good, well directed by Skip Woods.
