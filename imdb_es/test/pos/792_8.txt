To my eternal shame, I've never seen a silent movie, not even the mother of all vampire movies, "Nosferatu." However, if you show half of the creativity and joy of this effort on the part of Buster Keaton, then I will probably try to observe a little more. This is really fun, as well as being a surprising introduction to the world of silent comedies. The premise, as it is, centers on an unfortunate case of mistaken identity, as Keaton gets confused with the renowned bad Shot Shot (co-director Malcolm St Clair). This leads to a series of persecutions and escapes as authorities move closer and closer to Keaton, increasingly desperate. <br /> <br /> You stay amazed and entertained in equal measure. Keaton is a natural comedian, but he is also an excellent acrobatic, judging by the way he jumps and jumps like Jackie Chan in speed. And the comedy also has an exceptionally high standard: my Best Half had to interrupt a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much. If you have never experienced a silent movie like this, then it is nothing less than a revelation to see: it will certainly leave open any idea you may have had about silent movies. Naturally, it is not as polished as the movies of today: the performance is quite horrible, the truth is that it is said, but that does not matter because you are enjoying the film in any case. Anyone who has a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to see this because they will not be disappointed. Sparkly!
