Directed by a veteran Hollywood director, Henry King, who began his career as early as 1915, Love is a Many Splendored Thing was one of his last great films. It was based on a sales success of Han Suyin called simply A Many Splendored Thing, the phrase that was taken by the author of the poem The Kingdom of God by Francis Thompson, where that splendid word "love" was used quite differently and quite momentous. Context that means the love of God. Made in the 50s, the film marked along with works by directors such as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli, a kind of renaissance of melodrama, its blossoming and once again a peak of popularity. <br /> <br /> The story begins when a handsome American reporter Mark Elliott played by William Holden, once again pigeonholed in one of his irresistible "playboy" roles, arrives in Hong Kong and is there with a young man and Pretty Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) of half English origin of half of China, who works as a doctor in a hospital and whose husband was recently killed by the Chinese Communists. Instantly, Mark feels a strong enough attraction to her, but at first her deep feelings are not matched by Han's heart that went cold after her husband's death ("I believe in the human heart now just as a doctor"). But very soon she surrenders to the lingering courtship of temptation like hell for Mark and they both enter into a passionate relationship that apparently can not be stopped, even by the fact that Mark is unhappily married and that his wife does not want to give him a divorce or social life. Differences and prejudices caused by Han's Chinese origin. But it is still destiny that has one last word to say in order to determine the impartiality of eternity in such a joyful love relationship, since it does not matter how long they last. , we assume that ruthless time is waiting in a rather alarming form of death, prepared at any given moment to demonstrate its impermanence. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, one of the most romantic films ever made, Love is a Many Splendored Thing features the excellent performances of William Holden and Jennifer Jones, the wonderful musical score that won the Academy Award by Alfred Newman and an extremely romantic story, touching, comforting but, ultimately, heartbreaking. Do not miss so much splendid movie. 8/10 <br /> <br />
