The creator of Donnie Darko brings you a thematic story of the twilight zone of the strangest fashion. The film focuses on a young middle-aged couple who live on a salary in 1976. One day a mysterious box with a red button appears. Later that day, a spooky gentleman appears and tells them that they have the option of pressing the button and receiving a million dollars, but someone they do not know will die. It is a disturbing and provocative question that is described in suspense in the trailer and television ads. But let it be known that you simply do not know what it is until you see it. Sometimes, pretentious and a little melodramatic, the film is, in the last analysis, effective due to its good interpretations and its intriguing theme. It would be unfair to ruin any of the plot twists for you, but let's say that the film will offer the aspects that you expect them to fulfill and that, if they are not completely fulfilled, begin to be delineated. There is a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film that is interesting and annoying, since it was not so evident in his other top movie, Donnie Darko. There's not much more to say without ruining the movie for you. It is meant to inspire a lot of coffee talk afterwards. However, I would also like to say that it is well filmed and has an aged look and is worth seeing. Check it out.
