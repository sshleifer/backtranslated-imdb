Love In Limbo is my favorite movie of all time. (Set in W.A) It is hilairious and has an excellent cast that includes a group of three gorgeous actors, Russell Crowe (As Arthur), at the time when he really looked sexy with short hair and no facial hair. Aden Young (Barry McJannet) and Craig Adams as Ken Riddle. <br /> <br /> Ken is a high school student who is obsessed with sex and is expelled for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates. He starts a new job at his aunt's clothes factory and approaches another guy, Barry McJannet, who buys a car so they can go out and pick up chicks. They become partners with the geek of the good two-twoshoes Arthur Baskin (Crowe) and the three boys drive to Kalgoorlie to face a brothel and lose their virginity ... <br /> <br /> Look at it, its a classic !! For so long I have tried to get a DVD or a soundtrack, someone tells me if you have them.
