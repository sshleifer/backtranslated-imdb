First of all I want to say that Ang Lee did a very good job in this case. I saw him yesterday and I was instantly surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say "This stinks people can not fly!" I tell them IT'S FICTION and that's it. This should not be taken as a movie about reality, you could say it is a "fairy tale". And a very nice Asian fairy tale. The image can really blow your mind. Because there was filmed artistically, Ang Lee has a great talent (not appreciated, we could say). The fight scenes are very cool and very well presented to the viewer. But it is sad, but this film did not receive the appreciation that it should have obtained. But, fortunately, Ang Lee received the attention he deserved with his blockbuster. Even for the viewers who are not interested in the story, the images are entertaining enough!
