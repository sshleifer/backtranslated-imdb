Bluff I really think this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> It is a basic type of Colombian film different. It's hilarious and the actors use local expressions that are both the background to listen to. <br /> <br /> It shows a different face or Bogotá and I think that is very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we have to show that for the world. This is the first film by director Felipe Martínez and I really, except that This movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director. <br /> <br /> We need to continue supporting the Colombian film industry, because this film and other good films are the beginning of something great.
