Having borrowed my brother's collection of DVD Series one somewhat obsessive, I expected to go through the first episodes and return it to me. I just shouted on the screen to finish the first season on a rack, just a week later and I've seen it throughout the season. Where I found the time for this, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> This show is great. He does not take himself too seriously, he has nice characters who are well acted, and the special effects (ignoring the weird sticky puppet here and there) are "special" enough to give him that polished feeling. At first, I did not realize that it was filmed mainly here, and I found it strange to hear so many Australian accents in a science fiction program. It was really fun for the main character (John) to land in Sydney midway. First season. <br /> <br /> I think the greatest strength of this program is the vision that the creators of the program obviously had. Little by little, they have introduced new aspects of the characters that explain the previous actions and continue to disguise John's conversations with the jargon in a fun and unexpected way. In addition to that, after having seen the complete series of Voyager and Next Gen, I see a small scam of the plot, so it has managed to maintain a sense of originality throughout the first season. I hope the rest is just as good. <br /> <br /> Farscape is not like any other science fiction you've enjoyed in the past. I heard that the fourth season was not as good as the first three, and now I'm quite upset because they canceled it before the fifth. I hope they revive this program, with the same actors in a movie or another series. It would be a pity to leave so many lines of unfinished plot, since I imagine that with a program that has been thought so much, the fact of leaving it without a proper warning makes me feel robbed. <br /> <br /> I have to go now ... Returning to my brother's house to sapear the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> V.
