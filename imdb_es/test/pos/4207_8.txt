*** SPOILERS *** Although the movie "They Made Me A Criminal" is nowhere as good as that of John Garfield's classic antiheroes such as "Body & Soul" in 1947 "Force of Evil" in 1948 and his last and very underestimated "He Ran All The Way" in 1951 is the film that defined his career from that moment until his untimely death on May 21, 1952 at the young age of 39. <br /> <br /> Garfiled plays the role of lightweight champion Johnnie Bradfield and later the fugitive of the law Jack Dorney who is innocent of the murder of which he was charged, even though he has been officially declared dead. Jonnie's manager, Doc Ward, Robert "Doc" Gleckler, who during a drunken victory party killed reporter Charles McGee, John Ridgely, who was going to expose the public to his fighter Johnnie Bradfield lies that he is a man of one woman and not drinker mom's boy. Doc Gleckler smashed a bottle over McGee's head and killed him when Jonnie was nearly drunk with several women partying in his hotel suite. <br /> <br /> Later, Doc was killed in a car accident with Johnnie's girlfriend, Goldie, Ann Sheridan, but Dr. Burns was burned hard and Johnnie's watch was mistaken for Johnnie. Attorney Malvin, Robert Strange, told him to stay dead and be buried, who took $ 9,750.00 of the $ 10,000.00 of Johnnie's money from this great council. Malvin told Johnnie to adopt a new identity and call himself from now on Jack Dorney and leave the state of New York; talking about sleazy shysters. Johnnie now Jack Dorney travels the lanes from New York to Arizona and ends at Rafferty Ranch Date Farm where most of the film takes place. <br /> <br /> If it were not for John Garfield in the lead role as Both for Jonnie Bradfield and Jack Dorney, the film would have been lost and forgotten. Garfield, who was only 26 years old at the time, brought out the best of all in the film. Even the Dead End Kids transported, I think we can call them The Arizona Kids here, the performance was far superior to what you expected of them and they found themselves as real and sensitive people, not as a group of clowns as in almost everyone. his movies All that because of being on the same stage, or filming location, with John Garfield. <br /> <br /> "They Made Me a Criminal" is a good story in which the undercover champion acts as something but not to draw attention to himself and finish not only behind bars but in the electric chair. In the end, Jack showed what kind of man he is by not fighting in the big fight and against all the odds of winning dramatically at the last moment, but by going to four brutal rounds to get the money for his new family on the farm of the date, including his Peggy Girl, Gloria Dickson, to open a gas station with him. <br /> <br /> Giving European champion Gaspar Rutchek, Frank Riggi, the fight of his life and earning $ 2,000.00, that's $ 500.00 per round, for doing it Jack showed everyone who admired him as "Arizona" Kids "who sometimes get a punch is much braver and braver than throwing one. The fact that Jack could have easily hit Rutched but did not do so to avoid exposing himself to the police, as in the loose assassin Johnnie Bradfield. But instead, he went as far as he could carry everything Rutchek could throw at him to help his friends, and showed more than all the fights he won in the boxing ring. <br /> <br /> For my part, I did not find the end of the film devised at all, but it fit the story. Police Morty Phelam, Claude Rains, who came to Arizona from New York to arrest Jack had to live for years with the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. They told us all this right at the beginning of the movie. Why know that Jack / Johnnie was innocent of the murder of which he was accused and not knowing with certainty if he will be found innocent in a court of law, would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? I can easily see this happening in real life, why not in the movies.
