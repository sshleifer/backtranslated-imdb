"Blind Date" is one of the three stories made by the author Vida Hurst. A lot of familiar faces in this old 1934. Mickey Rooney as a little punk. It seems to be in the film for comic and homely "family values". Jane Darwell plays the strong-willed mother again, just as she did in Grapes of Wrath and the Oxbow incident. Ann Sothern is Kitty, who has been dating Bill (Paul Kelly), but meets rich Bob Hartwell, played by Neil Hamilton, who may or may not be better for her. Without a doubt, it can be said that this was done at the beginning of the Hays production code; At one point, Kitty says she can not be alone with him if there is no one else in the house ... change only one or two years before, when something and everything was fine. Good solid plot, but a lot of conversation and loving talk. It raises the question about what a girl should look for in a man; Should he present his candidacy to a man with integrity who treats her well, or simply find a man with a lot of money, as most of the films of the previous 20 years had defended ...? And how do men change when their situation changes? Beware of violence in the strange dance marathon scene. Viewers of the 1960s will recognize Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon of Batman ... There will also be a strange drama in life off the screen for some of the actors of the present: Paul Kelly had gone to jail for being an accessory in murder a love triangle Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer, who was 20 years older; Rooney ended up getting married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) were dropped in real life. The title "Blind Date" has been reused many times, for movies, television series and even cartoons, but none of them seems to have the same plot as this one.
