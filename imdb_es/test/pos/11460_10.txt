I remember seeing this movie in the theater and I liked it. Last month, I stumbled over that out of fear, I looked at it again and I found it better with age. First of all, for those of you who describe this as the cheese of the '80s, if you objectively compare it to the horror movies of the last 2 decades, it compares pretty well compared to the movies in your unique horror genre. , which I would call action / horror as opposed to psychological horror like "The Shining" or "the exorcist". <br /> <br /> Also, for your budget, this movie really delivers the goods (or in this case it's bad). The film actually has some character development and offers enough history of the infamous helmets to get the mood right before the characters put their foot in the front door. The movie also has several funny phrases and provides the right mood that a spooky horror movie should have. If you compare NOD with contemporary horror films of big budgets like "I am legend" (Vincent Price's version was much better) this movie really stands out. Modern horror films have become almost completely dominated by CGI. Most have no argument or character at all and are completely predictable. Special effects dominate these films from start to finish and the characters are made of 24k plastic. If this is the horror cheese of the '80s, I'll take it to more than 95% of the current entries in the genre. <br /> <br /> On a closing note when watching NOD again, it reminded me of the beautiful Jill Terashita and I wonder why I have not seen Ella in more horror or other movies. Jill, in the strange possibility that you read this, I think you're beautiful and you should have been in more movies. Finally, if you like action horror movies, you will probably like this one a lot.
