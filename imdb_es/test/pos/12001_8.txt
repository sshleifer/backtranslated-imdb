or any story that recalls the case of Leopold and Loeb, you can find this movie entertaining. The cast includes Robert Culp, with Stephen Caffrey and Garrison Hershberger as college students. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is his usual self, pretending to be cheated by precocious students. Caffrey ("Companion for a long time", "Buried Alive") is excellent and should make more of these roles threatening. Basically, the two friends of the fraternity get tired of their demanding parents, who expect nothing less than academic perfection; Assistance to the best schools will only be financed if they are made up. There is an excellent scene in which Culp drags Caffrey over the embers after getting a low rating, threatens to cut their trust funds and Caffrey then tells his friend: "I hate him, I want him dead" ... <br / > <br /> Not everything is good in Beverly Hills. This is always an excellent subject. I think this movie came out in 1990 right after the Menéndez murders. If you see "Menéndez, a murder in Beverly Hills" and then compare it to this movie, you may find some interesting parallels.
