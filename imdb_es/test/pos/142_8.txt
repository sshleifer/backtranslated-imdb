We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you have not seen Oldboy (or the trilogy of sympathy) you're missing some of the best movies made in this century. But I'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what you would expect. Yes, it's a vampire movie, but at the same time it's also a very twisted story of romance between a priest and a girl. I will not go into the synopsis (you can read that above), but I tell you what this movie has to offer. Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception. With some very surreal scenes backed by intense lighting, it creates a perfect atmosphere in almost every scene. The movie starts a little slow, but I felt that this was necessary to build a relationship with the characters. Once things start to move, it almost never stops until the credits pile up. "Thirst" is predominantly a love story, but not in the same sense as it would think. The relationship between the main characters is very intense, but at the same time almost disturbing. Chan-wook Park is no stranger to the controversy we know, and this film touches the taboo almost as much as the old one. The final scene is by far the most powerful in the film, and perhaps one of the best conclusions of a movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an exceptional movie that I think all moviegoers should see. It's an exciting (and certainly different) take on the world of vampires, and romance is far from boring or boring. This movie is rough, disinterested and beautiful in all the wrong ways. Obviously, it is not for everyone, but it is likely that if you are reading this review you are already interested. Look at it. Do not hesitate
