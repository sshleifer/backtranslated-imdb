The Last Dinosaur is a movie that pretends to be fun and exciting. He succeeds in doing both. <br /> <br /> Maston is a big game hunter who hunts big game (imagine). As a business owner, he is planning to go on an expedition with a group of people including a photographer named Frankie, a Japanese scientist, a guy who works for his company named Chuck and an African man who helped him on many safaris called Bun Ta. . The point is to study what is believed to be the Tyrannosaurus Rex, dinosaur that killed the last expedition to the area. They will reach this prehistoric area by taking a drilling vehicle that travels underwater called Polar Borer. After arriving in the area, they soon find the Tyrannosaurus, which Maston tries to shoot but his weapon gets stuck. Chuck immediately feels that Maston wanted to hunt the dinosaur all the time to add it to his collection of "Stuffed Animals." While they were away, Tyrannosaurus invades his camp and removes Polar Borer from his camp. Upon returning, the group realizes that they may be in the area more than they expected and Maston claims that he will kill the Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> The story is great for a science fiction movie. Drilling to a prehistoric area is something that seems like it could really happen. The landscape is beautiful and looks like a place where dinosaurs could still reside. <br /> <br /> I also liked the characters in this movie. Maston is the typical big-time hunter who wants to get anything that could be a trophy death. It was also great Bun Ta, played by Luther Rackley, a former member of the NBA, who really looks and acts like an African follower. Jackie is the typical woman who causes problems for the group and seems not to belong to the desert. Chuck is the former employee of Maston who has his opinion about the change of his boss when he is in nature with him. <br /> <br /> The tyrannosaur in this movie is one of the best in a movie. It's a little too high up like Godzilla does and it drags its tail, so it's a guy in a suit. But the suit looks good, especially the head and tail, and the Tyrannosaurus looks good and very scary. I have seen many other movies where dinosaur costumes look much worse. The tyrannosaur in this movie sometimes emits a roar that sounds like Godzilla and other times like King Kong of "King Kong Escapes" and "King Kong vs. Godzilla". SO a great Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of action in The Last Dinosaur. Of particular interest is a great fight between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. Also a great scene in which Bun Ta tries to attack the Tyrannosaurus. There are other great parts that I will not give away. You gotta see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. Look at it and you will not be disappointed.
