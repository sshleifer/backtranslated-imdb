This is my favorite movie that portrays African Americans from a completely different perspective. because it shows a different side of African Americans that is not shown in the movies. it's not the gang bang, the urban ghetto environment or having to deal with deep racial problems, it captivates the whole essence of being young and trying to succeed and having problems to let your guard down and let someone in your life, and all the bohemian atmosphere gives you that great touch that makes everything great, it's a great script, a great dialogue that captivates you and you get involved with the character. The perfect cast with a lot of chemistry and very good acting, and I have not yet seen any other film with black characters represented in this format, the only one that comes close is "Sprung", but since it's a comedy, it loses it very quickly. I give this movie 9 out of 10 and I would like you to continue making movies with this kind of attitude about African Americans.
