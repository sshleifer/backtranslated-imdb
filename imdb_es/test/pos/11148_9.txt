The film opens in a British male club full of gentlemen in leather chairs smoking cigars. This is the world of Denistoun. A messenger hands him a small box that opens to find a pair of gold earrings. The site of the earrings triggers a reminiscence about the time he spent in the company of the gypsies. The rest of the movie is flashback. <br /> <br /> Golden Earrings has been one of my favorites for a long time and is probably the most romantic movie I know. Dietrich plays against his usual type. Here she is dark, earthy and not in the least mysterious. Instead of being a fatal woman, she is a tower of strength and energetically intends to use all her resources to help Denistoun survive and reach his goal. To make sure he is a really convincing gypsy, she pierces her ears and makes him wear the gold earrings of her dead lover. With her clothes and some fat, she transforms him from a British gentleman into a wild and sexy man. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up I used to listen to the song "Golden Earrings" that is sung in the movie. I think the melody is a little buzzed by Dietrich. / There is a story that gypsies know is true / That when your love wears gold earrings / She belongs to you.
