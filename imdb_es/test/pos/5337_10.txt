A great animated film that really reaches the level of the old ones like "The Lion King". <br /> <br /> I went to see this with one of my best Belgian friends who also watched the series on TV. I was lucky because I did not know that people in Belgium were aware of "Wallace and Gromit". <br /> <br /> When it started and that good topic began to recover memories of when I saw it when I was 5 years old. <br /> <br /> The humor itself was very funny. Some nice comedy style scenes, some puns or just jokes. The animation is not that impressive if you know the series, but it's still fun to see if you realize how it's done. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: not only can I keep my person happy and entertained, but I can also attract older people with ease, so I say: go and look at "Curse of The Were-Rabbit" so Soon as you can.
