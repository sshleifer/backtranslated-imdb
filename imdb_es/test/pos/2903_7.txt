I would give this movie high marks for film photography and presentations. I just read a comment from the user about the performance of the actress who plays an intriguing courtesan who insinuates Sinuoeh, the main character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress after the movie the last time I saw her. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the film industry who were surprised by her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and in tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also featured in this movie. Like other neo-Biblical films of the 1940s and 50s, "The Egyptian" reflects the morals and values ​​of that era, but it is still a great entertainment because the performances are spectacular and the story so well told.
