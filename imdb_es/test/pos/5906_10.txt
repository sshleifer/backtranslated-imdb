In a genre in itself, this film has a limited audience and a narrow appeal along with a subtle tone that permeates the entire production. However, it is a remarkable piece of cinema that is as timeless as a rare work of art. Capturing a moment in Quebec that is rarely seen in movies, the strength of Mon Oncle Antoine lies in the depth of its characters and the richness of the scenarios. The Quebec of Duplessis, parochial and feudal, is presented brilliantly as the backdrop that could not be reached by anyone other than a Quebec Quebecois cigar. <br /> <br /> It would be all too easy to resort to stereotypes, clich√©s and myopic statements of one mind in this story. However, the director chose to omit the forced images and, instead, focused on the essence of life in rural Quebec at the time. That makes this film exceptional in its authenticity and not pretentious in its presentation. If only the most contemporary film efforts did the same, the audience that watch could not be forced to choose between the exaggerated Hollywood Pablum that goes to the visualization of "Must See". <br /> <br /> Mon Oncle Antoine is in. Every sense of the word - unforgettable. It will leave a lasting impression on anyone who has lived, or visited, in Quebec. A classic. *************************************** <br /> <br /> Follow-up: May 10, 2008 <br /> <br /> After reviewing some of the comments, it's worth noting that Uncle Antoine's Bill is NOT, and that it probably DOES NOT HAVE to serve as standard cinema of Hollywood / United States for Sales in the mass market. A story of coming of age, yes, but much more than mere memories of adolescence in the Quebec of 1940. Spectators who seek pure entertainment at the expense of the complex development of the characters will feel very disappointed. Go see action / adventure / romance / comedies to have fun. See Mon oncle Antoine who will be drawn into an exceptional but absolutely extraordinary society that has been overlooked and ignored for far too long. <br /> <br /> The Grapes of Wrath is not a thriller on the edge of the seat. However, the story and the characters are what make this American classic an enduring film. Mon oncle Antoine is in the same genre.
