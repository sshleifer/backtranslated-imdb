This movie is everything a Tenacious D fan can hope for. Director Liam Lynch partnered with The "D" is a mix of epic proportions. Of course, you must understand the humor and format of Tenacious D. When I saw it there was not much laughter from the audience, but the reason is not the lack of humor or clever jokes. This film seems to have been released to a confident audience that has not become familiar with the musical duo. This film remains true to its roots. For the few of you who have watched the HBO television series and listened to the album, you have not forgotten what your audience likes. As in the TV show, people have noticed in the trailer the scenes of the JB and KG apartments and, of course, the open microphone nights with which each episode of Tenacious D would begin and end. The soundtrack is great and every song impresses you. <br /> <br /> ... And Dave Grohl plays a fantastic Devil. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie for those looking for a tough time and a rock musical.
