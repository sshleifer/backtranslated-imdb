Reading some of the other comments, I must admit that some of the (very few) shortcomings found in this brilliant documentary about one of the divas of the twentieth century (up there with Billie Holliday, Bessie Smith, Edith Piaf, Judy Garland and Mercedes de Sosa ) are justified. Because initially it was a television documentary more than 6 hours on his career ("ESTRANHA FORMA DE VIDA" (V) 1995/1999). Much more comprehensive and with greater knowledge of Am√°lia's inner world. As for the subtitling of your songs, I'm in favor! Although the music, the voice and the interpretation can be ... they are! - Universal, there is so much poetry in the words that they only ask to be translated. I think this was a conscious choice on the part of the producers. They targeted the 200 million Portuguese speakers in Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, France, East Timor, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Canada, the United States, South Africa, Sao Tome and Principe, Goa, Daman, Diu, Venezuela. Luxembourg, Germany and the rest of the Portuguese-speaking diaspora around the world. As for the Lady herself, she did not live to see this particular shortened version of the documentary on DVD, but was given a preview of "Estranha Form of Life". And it seems to have been to his liking. Very much.
