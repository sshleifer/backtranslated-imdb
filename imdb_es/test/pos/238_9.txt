A long time ago and very far away, they knew how to make a musical and "Cover Girl" is not an exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> The story of a dancer in a nightclub that becomes a cover and famous girl. The old adage applies here: happiness and fame do not always mix. <br /> <br /> The dance routines are beautifully choreographed. What dance and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> Otto Kruger is the senior man who discovers Hayworth, when he sees his photo that bears a strong resemblance to the woman who left him in the hallway. Grandmother Maribel. <br /> <br /> A jealous reaction from Kelly takes Rusty (Hayworth) into the arms of Broadway producer Lee Bowman. <br /> <br /> The image is basically the story that is repeated at the end. <br /> <br /> To add to the glory of this good movie, there's the always smart and wise Eve Arden and the hilarious Phil Silvers, appropriately named Genie in the movie.
