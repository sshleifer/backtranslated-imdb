This review contains MILD SPOILERS, but not enough to spoil the story ... <br /> <br /> We saw Nihon Chinbotsu (Sinking of Japan or Japan Sinks, depending on where you live) recently, a new version of the movie from 1970 The same name, which in turn was based on the best-selling novel by Sakyo Komatsu. This movie is a jewel of Japanese cinema. It seems that Japan is sinking due to a subduction of a tectonic plate to the west. Americans predict what will happen in the 40-year period, but according to Dr. Tadokoro (an apparently 'crazy' scientist), it will happen in less than a year. The Japanese government is not so convinced, but establishes an evacuation plan in case of disaster and forms a new D1 team to handle the crisis. During a trip to China to negotiate the evacuation plans, the Japanese Prime Minister was killed and sent to the cabinet to a state of panic. The D1 team stays to handle most issues, and is led by the newly elected Minister of Crisis Management, Saoro Takamori (ex-wife of Dr. Tadokoro). Instead, he turns to Dr. Tadokoro for advice, and he plans to exploit astronomically large holes in Japan to avoid the sinking process. <br /> <br /> Japan will soon have to negotiate with several countries and convince them to adopt Japanese refugees Soon, it seems that many countries are reluctant to accept more because of the sudden influx of Japanese into their country and the chaos that follows (If this happens, touch wood, I hope that Ito Misaki is safe ... she can always stay at my house ... hee hee). The evacuation scenes are really well done, showing the chaos, suffering and despair that civilians must face in such disastrous times. And the many faces of human beings emerge, arrogance, selfishness, bribery, bravery, cowardice ... <br /> <br /> This is a very well made movie. the narration is solid, with an attractive story and a wonderful performance. Dr. Tadokoro (played by Toyokawa Etsushi) did very well, representing a divorced and often crazy scientist who kicks and hits things. His frustration and worries were very visible and that is something really good. Reiko (played by the beautiful Shibasaki Kou) was also quite good, and has the most memorable line of the whole movie (go see her to find out) and I think she has a good voice to act. She interprets the love interest of Toshio Onodera (played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi of SMAP). Oh, I almost forgot ... she has very, very long hair ~ And there is also a subtle but substantive love story, which is well written and if there is something the Japanese do really well, it is the love stories. .. <br /> <br /> One thing that makes this film interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur, and if you are interested in geography, you will have a great time (I know, hehe). I can see that they did everything possible to make the theory of this film credible, and the first exhibits and graphic explanations were done quite well (although you will have to excuse the famous "Engrish" of the Japanese. <br /> <br /> Good , now about the effects (it's about the effects, is not it?) After seeing the movie with amazement, I must say that this movie has special effects that are on par (or even better) with some of Hollywood. productions, volcanic eruptions ... massive earthquakes ... destruction ... tsunamis ... explosions ... all done splendidly, the opening scene is so fresh, the first earthquake catches you by surprise, mountains fall, the destruction due to the volcanic eruptions makes you tremble ... see the warming of Mount Fuji is a wonder ... then you see Shibuya fall to the ground ... it is so sad! However, what I felt was one of the best, the scenes were the gigantic scene of the tsunami, in which rescue operations fail and people have nowhere to run or hope. to ... the final scene also deserves a mention ... wonderful things. If you like the effects, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh ya ... every good movie has a great song behind it. The addictive "Keep Holding U" sung by the super cute and adorable SunMin is a duo with Kubota, and is simply charming. I think it adapts very well to the film and shows that no matter what disasters hit us, our love and our strength will keep us waiting. The scenes of the disaster are handled with orchestral music and, sometimes, with silence (a Japanese specialty) and really give a sense of chaos to destruction on the screen. Oh, and did I mention that it's a really WIDE screen, really WIDE? Okla, I've been talking about this movie. Yes, I LOVED it, and hoping to see it again ... It has holes in the plot, but everything is excusable because it was just a wonderful movie of popcorn. Not perfect, but very well done. I would give it a 9 out of 10. I am pleased to say that the most expensive movie in Japanese history is also one of the best. If you have not seen it, you should do it today ... YOU MUST SEE!
