Undoubtedly, the best drama / comedy on television. A written program about a young mother and her 16-year-old daughter who explore life and discover things not only about the world, but also about themselves. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to maintain a close bond with her daughter, but guides her on the right path, which throughout the show is becoming increasingly difficult. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), trapped in a world of books and learning, is beginning to discover children and their own sense of rebellion, which surprises both of them. With the help of Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) and Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy) and a huge variety of other hilarious characters, this show is easily one of my favorites. What really sets the program above all else is the complex, incredible and ingenious writing that often uses references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.
