I have never read Sarah Water's book. Although I have not read the book, the 3-hour movie is very interesting. Start with an interesting story with a twisted end. I have to say that these 2 actresses are incredible. Sally Hawkins is impressive, she successfully portrayed the character in love with her lover and betrayed by her love. Their romance blooms slowly as they spend more and more time together. The scene of love is very tender and emotional, well acted. The ending is quite intriguing and these 2 ended up together after everything that has happened, which is a blessing. In general, it is a great movie to watch, a very interesting plot with excellent performances.
