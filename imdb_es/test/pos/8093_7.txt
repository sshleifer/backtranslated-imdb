Most of this film is, alternatively, a hilarious and brutal satire on Nazism and fascism, made at the height of the success of those movements. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the final moments of the film, Chaplin abandons all pretense of making art (without mentioning comedy) and changes completely to propaganda. And not the anti-Nazi propaganda, either, but the most unbridled and idiotic "progressive" propaganda that has ever come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that nothing we have seen so far indicates that the barber is even capable of giving the speech we see him give (delivered, ironically, with a disturbing wild-eyed fanaticism); such trivialities should not be allowed to interfere with the Message.
