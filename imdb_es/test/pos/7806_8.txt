It is a parody, it is an intelligent comedy, it has a pathetic action and a choreography (and of course, it is intentional), good humble songs, good performances by the whole cast, brilliant by Amir, Salman and Paresh and above all a script. which is so rare in Indian cinema that also in comedy (see David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra, etc.). The story is of two wastes whose sole objective is to become rich and be famous by any means. They realize one of those ways when they discover that a rich NRI is coming to India to get married. The rest of the story is about one's ability and how these losers try to get out one another. The entire cast is perfectly launched from Deven Verma to Viju Khote. The songs are correctly placed and they are fun. The surprise package is Salman, who acts perfectly, and this act in particular gave him his comedy style. <br /> <br /> A whole smoke movie that you should not ignore if you like it and see Indian cinema.
