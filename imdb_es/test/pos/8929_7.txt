"Eighteen" (2004) tells the story of Pip Anders, a depressed and extremely cynical young man who is away from his dysfunctional middle / upper class family and lives on the streets of Vancouver. On his 18th birthday, he receives a cassette tape and a player from his recently deceased grandfather, recounting his memories of his own 18th birthday, dedicated to serving the British army in France, trying to help a mortally wounded companion avoid the capture by the occupants. Germans While Pip listens to the tape (Ian McKellen provided the voice of his grandfather), we see the scenes he describes as flashbacks, alternating with daily scenes from Pip's life, as well as more recent flashbacks that shed light on the dark secret of why Pip it was from home and he finds it impossible to trust someone who is kind to him. <br /> <br /> An ambitious second film by writer / director Richard Bell ("Two Brothers"), with a polished look, excellent photography and a well-developed photograph. - Stereotyped characters (with homosexuals and heterosexuals treated equally), and commendable efforts in emotionally and physically demanding roles of some talented new actors (especially Paul Anthony as Pip and Brendan Fletcher as his grandfather at 18). There is also a remarkable turn on the part of Alan Cummings as a priest who tried to help Pip, and a small supporting role played by Thea Gill ("Queer As Folk"). The complex story, in the director's own words in his DVD commentary, is bound to drive a "vortex of emotion" that pushes Pip to its breaking point, and he certainly does. My only criticism is that the overall effect is too "heavy" or artificial for an audience to really identify, much of the support dialogue (and the end) is too witty and predictable, and the direction needed to be sharper to reduce the excess of activity neglected some scenes I recommend, 7 stars out of 10, including extra points for a remarkable effort.
