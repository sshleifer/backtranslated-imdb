Having not seen this movie for quite some time, we discovered it not long ago on the Criterion DVD, very well transferred. "Le cercle rouge" is a film that owes a lot to other films, since it reminds us of Rififi, "The Asphalt Jungle", among others, because they all deal with capers that occupy a central place in the film and are reproduced. in great detail Unfortunately, one knows the old adage that crime does not pay, and from the beginning, these men involved are condemned from the start. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Melville was a director of few words. He did not fill his paintings with much dialogue, as is the case here. However, for not being "talented", they had a style of their own as demonstrated by "Le Dolous", "Le Samurai" and his masterpiece, "Bob le flambeur", among others. Mr. Melville had a sense of style that is reflected in everything he did. In this film, working with his director of photography, Henri Decae, he takes us for a walk through the streets of Paris that show the vibrant city, mainly at night and the gloomy winter in France. The score is by Eric Demarsan, who emphasizes a striking music that accompanies most of the action. <br /> <br /> Although the film shows Alain Delon, like Corey, at the center of the action, it is the intelligent inspector. Mattei who is the true hero of the movie. As the great Bourvil interprets him, he is a man who shows great patience because from the beginning he has discovered how to trap Vogel, and in the process he gets involved in the investigation of the jewelry heist in which he meets the man who escaped. He is following great looms behind him. Bourvil offers an enormously satisfying performance since Mattei shows equal parts of determination and tenderness, as it is the case of the three cats that he adores. <br /> <br /> Alain Delon always responded with interesting interpretations of his appearances in the photos of Mellville. Here is Corey, the man who sees himself for the first time coming out of prison and promising himself that he will not return, but nothing good can happen when he decides to go ahead and participate in the robbery. Their association with Vogel and Jansen is rewarded for the way they do the work, but it will also be a mistake because they can not get rid of the loot since the fence they have trusted changes their mind. . <br /> <br /> Gian Maria Volonte and Yves Montand are seen as Vogel and Jansen, respectively. They were excellent actors who mix well in the action of the film. Both actors were at their best when they took the roles in the film and it shows. Montand has the most complex character to interpret, since we witnessed him in his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons inside his head. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Mellville obtained wonderful results from his cast and crew in a movie, although he feels a bit more, but manages to show his style in one of the director's most memorable photos.
