"L'Ossessa" (published in English with many titles and the strangest of them without a doubt is "The midnight horror show") is one of the best Italian swindlers of "The Exorcist". To really appreciate this movie you must have a sense of humor. "L'Ossessa" is at the same time sordid (but naive), pathetic and, sometimes, even moving. <br /> <br /> Danila (Stella Carnacina), an art student, goes to an old church to see the statue she is going to restore. It is a wooden statue of Christ, a demonic Christ, perhaps already defeated by evil, or fighting against it, or perhaps planning dark actions. The face shows infinite torment. The statue dates from the 15th century. Danila is impressed by the skill shown by the sculptor: the statue seems almost alive! She lives with her parents. His mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) lives a dissolute life and does not worry too much about keeping up appearances. His father Mario (Chris Avram) observes everything with disenchanted eyes. <br /> <br /> The wooden statue will soon assume a human form (Ivan Rassimov) and will possess Danila in the carnal and spiritual sense. An incredible scene! Poor Danila, from now on, will suffer the torments of hell. <br /> <br /> Danila (the charming Stella Carnacina) was raped, raped, possessed by the devil and now, following his orders, will try to seduce her. others. Are you not emulating your bad mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) who feels great pleasure when her lover whips her with a bouquet of roses? There is a scene so ridiculous as to be sublime and moving, when Stella Carnacina runs desperate through the narrow streets (possessed by the devil, remember?) Of a small Italian city that screams heartily. Luigi Pistilli is a very good exorcist. His performance is, as always, intense. The scenes of exorcism (especially the final battle) are very, very unprofessional, but this will only improve the fun (and / or emotion) if you really have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Stella Carnacina is beautiful and she looks fresh and innocent, and that is a factor that increases her pleasure when she is naked, but I think the film could have explored its natural beauty more. Lucretia Love is a very good companion of seedy death (her nude scene with roses ... well. :) <br /> <br /> Other Italian exorcist scams that I would like to recommend for you are: <br /> < Br /> Malabimba ("evil eye" evil and launched and restored digitally) <br /> <br /> "Malocchio" - "The Exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "Eye of evil", but other films, As, for example, "Rosemary's baby" should also be taken into account. "Evil Eye" is completely above. It is not of poor quality but with a lot of beautiful Italian and Spanish actresses. You'll be drooling all over the movie. The movie is ridiculous, the story does not make any sense, but if you see it in the right mood, you can feel moved! - a diabolical sect, possession, murder, despair, love, investigation and beautiful women everywhere. A wild ride! <br /> <br /> If you liked "Evil Eye", see also "Ring of Darkness" (Un'Ombra nell'ombra). This movie can be found in the alternative market. Look for this title in the IMDb. There are good reviews about it. <br /> <br /> P.S. - "L'Ossessa" has many different faces. It is exploitative, but it can also be serious and moving. It's cheap, cheesy ... sordid (but not so much) and has an underlying "moral" message. This strange brew can sometimes be very funny. We all know that "L'Ossessa" is a scam of "Exorcist", why can not we see it on its own terms? Yes, Mario Gariazzo was trying to make quick money, but he was able to get the most out of a small budget. The story is well told, the film is atmospheric and, in general, the actors are committed to their roles. Watch the movie with an open mind and you will discover two or three new things.
