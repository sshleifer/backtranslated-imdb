This is one of my favorites of all time. All the actors do a great job. Comparing this movie with "Lawrence of Arabia" does not do justice to both films. "The Wind and the Lion" levels a much lower budget with fantastic actors who represent moving characters in a soulful environment. Action and beautiful images are also provided, which together guarantee me a favorite movie.
