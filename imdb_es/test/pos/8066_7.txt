Mary Pickford plays Annie Rooney, the daughter of a policeman who lives in the difficult part of the city. She is a rough and wobbly young woman of indeterminate age (between 12 and 16 years old) who loves to discard but who has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> This is a very typical film style of Mary Pickford. . Like many of his films, he plays a girl, even though he was almost 40 years old when he made LITTLE ANNIE ROONEY. And, like so many other stories, he was brave and courageous. As a result, I had a strong feeling of déjà vu. Now, if you have not seen your other movies, this is not a problem. However, she is essentially playing a character very similar to SPARROWS or DADDY LONG LEGS, although these other two films are much better. Now, this does not mean that it is a bad movie, only that it certainly is not among his best works, mainly due to a rather "absurd" story that is very loaded with feelings but not especially convincing. Entertaining but not essential visits unless you are a big fan of silences.
