I feel very fortunate to have the opportunity not only to watch this movie, but also to learn more about this fascinating person and time. Lumumba is an outstanding representation, which gives a complete sense of history without falling into the usual Hollywood traps. Yes, he is shown with his wife and children, but the essence of the story is his politics and that of the independent Congo that is still emerging. . The film is brilliantly made, moving at a pace that is constantly appealing. I hope to see other films by Raoul Peck, as well as more from Eric Ebouaney!
