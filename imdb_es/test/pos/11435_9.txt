When I went to the movies, I did not expect much. I did not know anything about this movie, but it was the only movie I could see, because at the time I was in a small city. So I saw this movie and it fascinated me! "La stelle che non c'Ã¨" is a journey through the new industrial China and shows it honestly. Most of the time you see the ugly places in China, and see what really happens with this new industrialization. The main characters are sad but hopefully the people. He is the naive Italian boy who can not believe what he sees. She is a Chinese translator who misses her son. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny but increasingly poetic! A wonderful movie with wonderful actors! So only one star is missing!
