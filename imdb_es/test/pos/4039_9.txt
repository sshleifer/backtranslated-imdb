I really enjoyed this movie. Normally I am not from fairy tales or fantasy shops, but this movie caught my attention. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie on the UK channel Hallmark ... it usually shows a few sticky films ... But then the Snow Queen arrived ... and I I was charming! I really admire Bridget Fonda in this movie ... she plays the Snow Queen brilliantly and glamorously. <br /> <br /> I will not explain what the story is about, since other people have already done it, so there is no point in repeating. <br /> <br /> I would just suggest that if you want to see a fun fairytale trip ... get this movie ... but if you want to buy it and live in the UK, you could have a bad time I bought it in South Korea brand new (English edition, of course).
