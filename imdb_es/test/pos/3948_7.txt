One of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way it portrays the "Tories" or the American and British Loyalists, and the kind of brilliance given to their ardent support for King George III. In many ways, the American Revolution was definitely a family affair, in the sense that some of the wealthier colonial families were divided by it. If you make a strong criticism of this movie, it is that perhaps the people in this story are made to be a little kinder than they were in real life. <br /> <br /> In some aspects, the actions of Major Boulton's character, played by Cornel Wilde, make him the least sympathetic member of the cast and in the failure of the story. It seems that it varies from being a type of prickly patriot to being a kind of "anything for the cause," mate. This film concentrates largely on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige that were an important social "norm" at that time. <br /> <br /> In its subtext, the fact that approximately twenty-five percent of the colonial population was decidedly pro-British and was also overlooked. But the strength of the Tory element is obviously not defamed, although the good doctor character is about eighty-five percent of high class twit (to steal a good phrase from the Monty Python Flying Circus). Anne Francis does a pretty thin section of the script a lot, and it stands out. It was a good choice for the woman of divided loyalties, a "girl" who was far more modern than the social conventions of that day could have allowed, had there not been a life or death struggle. <br /> <br /> A good aspect of the film is how the rivalries of American revolutionary leaders degenerated into jealousy, and how these personal conflicts almost sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort. In general, the main characters are very well drawn, the secondary characters are not just human "supports" and the fight scenes are credible enough to take the dramatic action. <br /> <br /> This is a great spy movie. It is not a great historical drama, but it satisfies enough. It qualifies a seven largely because Cornel Wilde is so deeply immersed in his role, and he does it very well, and because Anne Francis makes the most of her support effort. <br /> <br /> The color printing used in Turner Classic Movies was very clear as well, so it was a nice presentation in that important aspect. <br /> <br /> I hope you run again soon.
