If I had seen this movie when I got to the bottom, I probably would have sunk into the deepest depression of my life, and I could have been desperate enough to try, the only thing that happens in the real world is when you steal millions of dollars. From unsuspecting individuals, everything does not turn pink (unless you are an investment banker or an affiliated government), so what does that matter? They rejected me from school after school, and it hurts, so it's a brilliant subject for a movie, and when you turn to the imaginary to see this movie without applying ramifications of the real world, you can really touch someone in that situation , and let them know that they are not alone. The exaggerated soliloquy completely destroys the established educational system as we know it. Really, all I can say is, since I'm in college now, looking back where I was and watching this movie, I can appreciate it in a way that I never could have done otherwise. It's youthful and contrite, yes, but it's an emotional and uplifting fantasy about freedom, and I can not think of a better way to end my night.
