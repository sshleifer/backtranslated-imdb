I do not know what some people thought when they said that this movie was bad. It was great. Classic Bruce Campbell, yes, it was low budget and the special effect showed it, but that's not what you see in a Bruce movie, but you look at it for Bruce. Also Ted Rami was excellent. I found this movie hilarious and entertaining. I still laughed when I remember Bruce in that pink moped. Now I will admit that this movie is not for everyone, if you do not like B movies, you probably will not like this one if you crave big budget effects and the actors stay on the sidelines. But if you like science fiction traps, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Hail the Baby King!
