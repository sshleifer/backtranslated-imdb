Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British DVD label (I think), which specializes in malicious and excessively violent cult films. Mostly Italians, from the glorious times when everything was possible, that is, from the late 60s to the mid 80s. The selection of the label feels like a cross between the works of "Mondo Macabro" and "No Shame" (they probably even took the name of the latter) and already launched some very rare Italian puppies like "Ratman", "My Dear Killer" "," Killer Nun "," Phantom of Death "and" Torso "." The Frightened Woman " It was completely unknown to me, but as the critical colleagues here, whose opinions I value greatly, described it as one of the biggest and most fascinating psychedelic euro-sexploitation films of its time, I did not hesitate to pick it up. This is a very strange movie and It is probably not suitable for approximately 99% of average moviegoers, but if you are part of the remaining 1%, a truly unique gift awaits you.The style, atmosphere and content are similar to "Succubus" "by Jess Franco and" Venus in Furs "by Massimo Dallamano; however, both are widely regarded as classics, while "The Frightened Woman" is virtually unknown. It's all about profiles and good marketing, I suppose. The story revolves around a literally dirty doctor (he lives in a gigantic isolated mansion, owns several vintage cars and has an impressive collection of artistic relics that include a life-size mannequin doll replica of himself) with a stranger and a little out of the ordinary. Attitude towards women. He considers them a threat to the survival of the male race and, therefore, spends his days abducting, humiliating and sexually abusing the chance he picks up from the street. Dr. Sayer then kidnaps the ambitious journalist Maria with the intention of completely crushing her feminine spirit, but he slowly falls in love with her. Simply he begins to believe in real love, she responds with a vengeance. This really is not for everyone, but if you can appreciate sensual and sinister environments, toys of strange landscapes and psychedelic touches that seem absolutely implausible and surreal, you can consider this as one of the best recommendations. It's slow, stylish, sleazy and totally crazy. Shameless Entertainment, okay!
