IN AGREEMENT. A warning to anyone who is a parent or guardian. Be careful with the person who watches this movie, that is, DO NOT TAKE CHILDREN TO SEE THIS MOVIE. I will explain why. <br /> <br /> 1 - the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with the romance - I guess this was totally intentional for the producers, but it's annoying 2 - the movie itself is really very, very annoying. I have some problems: first is the fact that the film is not violent or sexual and, therefore, is not a 'horror movie'. But it's a very disturbing movie, and it involves a child and his parents, and a small city. <br /> <br /> Well, it all comes down to this. The film is not suitable for minors, since it contains sequences and images that are disturbing and could confuse a child. It has a strange quality and ONLY because it has a child that makes me feel that it is not suitable. As a father, I feel strong enough to want to tell people because I read only the other day that I have a premiere in theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope not to offend the filmmakers by saying this, but I think it is my right, because it is being released, and it only has a grade of M (because it is not violent or sexual). Simply strange and disturbing but quite good in itself.
