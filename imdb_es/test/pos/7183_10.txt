Eh oui, impossible n'est pas gaulois. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and very entertaining movie. A good command of the French language and knowledge of modern France (and history) is recommended. I do not think this movie really works in any other language. The movie is incredibly much better than the previous one (In search of ...). In addition to the great actors and the intelligent handling of the camera, it is the ingenuity and the fireworks of allusions, puns, etc. that make it a great movie. The cartoon vorlage is recognizable but the film is very emancipated. The cost of the film is in good use. In fact, all special effects fit 'naturally' in the film, you never feel drowned by them. <br /> <br /> Bref, oui, les 2CVs, ça traîne un peu mais à part cela, Imhotep! <Br /> <br /> -A neighbor on the other side of the Rhine
