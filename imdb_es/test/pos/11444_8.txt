I watched "Night of the Demons 2" for the first time before watching "Night of the Demons". Unfortunately, my old Blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the sequel, but not the first one. Looney, huh? Now, I think all terror fans need this movie. It's like McDonald's, you know it's bad for you and you'd prefer to have The Cheesecake Facotory (or the most expensive restaurant you prefer), but you can not help but want the cheap. <br /> <br /> Night of the Demons has it all: your innocent, sexy, complies with the chicka-dee rules, your token black guy, who surprisingly is not killed. You are a dirty girl, you are a dirty boy, you are a girl or a dark boy, the ball of fools, the cheesy configuration of a haunted house, bad acting and a lot of unnecessary nudity. Is not this great? I mean, deep in my heart of the movies I know this was pretty bad, but it was good for horror movies. The terror fans should enjoy and dig! <br /> <br /> 8/10
