"Campfire Tales" is basically composed of three spooky stories that a group of friends tell after a car accident in the woods after a concert. The film begins with the classic "Hook" story, and then we are introduced to the group of friends who return home from the concert. They crash their car, turn off some flares and light a fire in a small abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to arrive with help while they warm up by the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, about terrified honeymoons, a girl who falls prey to an Internet predator and a motorist who takes refuge in a haunted house. As they tell spooky stories, each story becomes increasingly frightening, but the real impact that awaits them is yet to come ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the last story they tell is probably the More frightening and Some genuine, terrifying effects. The first story was fine, and the motorhome sequence near the end was a bit creepy. The second story generated much suspense, more than any of the others, but its unoriginal plot was its downfall. I remember seeing this movie a long time ago when I was about eight years old on HBO and the third story scared me so much, although now it does not scare me. She probably recognizes some of the actors in the cast, especially Amy Smart for the history of the "hook" interlude, and Christine Taylor as one of the movie's leading actresses. The end of the turn was also quite interesting, I know I did not see it coming, I thought everything was arranged intelligently. <br /> <br /> To summarize things, if you are looking for a horror movie that is worth it, rent this, you should be happy. It is a great anthology of some classic urban legends, and the whole film was well connected. It is much better than one would expect. 7/10.
