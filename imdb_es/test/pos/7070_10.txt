Yes. Watch this movie if you like brave movies. This is perhaps the best Mexican film since Midaq Alley only because of the excellent cast, the outrageous direction and a sublime soundtrack. Many people did not like Cronica, they think it is very aggressive, but they did not understand that it was just a representation with hyperrealism of Mexican society, but very similar to all the families of the third world. I hope that Benjamin Cann and Bruno Bichir (who in this film give another example of his greatness as an actor) will soon meet again with a new movie. Just remember how Los Olvidados (Luis Bu√±uel) misunderstood when they were released, but now we consider one of the best movies of all time. Please, get ready and watch this movie.
