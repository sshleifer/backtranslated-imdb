I'm a big fan of Lonesome Dove and all the books in the series and I love the movie. I was glad to see that they ended up with Comanche moon. I have been a fan of Steve Zahn for a long time and I was anxious to see him in a serious role. Personally, I think Steve Zahn has done an incredible job of recreating Gus. I can not think of another actor that would have been better. He has the voice, the gestures, the pronunciation of the word up to T. Of course, no one could hold a candle to Robert Duvall as Gus, but I think Steve Zahn has done a very good job. Karl Urban acts in the same way in all the films he has been in, so he has made a good match for Woodrow Call. As for the movie itself, yes, it's a bit corny, but can you really beat Lonesome Dove? No I dont think so.
