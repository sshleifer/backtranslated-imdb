This is absolutely the best caricature of the 80s, maybe the best caricature of all time. It had everything of action, adventure, emotion and much more ... <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how difficult it was for the company of Ruby-Spears to make this great cartoon, it has been spent a lot The money for this work The work teacher was worth it, for example, only the broadcasting scenes were difficult because I would not call the 1980s a great technological year with computers like now in the world in which we live, so the broadcasting scenes were excellent ! <br /> <br /> The cartoons will never be the same as before, so I hope they are all released on DVD, especially The Centurions, as it is my favorite. I have the full set of 65 episodes on DVD-R, but it's not the same because if they were released on DVD, people in the world could buy it and watch DVDs in almost every store, which means a lot to the fans. My good friend Ted made this request to recover the program on TV or better on DVD, that is, if we receive many requests to retrieve them on DVD. <br /> <br /> So help us by signing the application at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html
