Algernon4's comment that "Ms. Paget's ultra-lascivious dance (this movie) is the most erotic in the history of the movies" is undoubtedly an exaggeration. It's not even the most erotic dance of Debra Paget. His close turns to the nude in Fritz Lang's "The Indian Tomb" make this number seem decidedly docile. As for being the most erotic in the history of dance. All right! Where do I start? The performance of Salma Hayek as Santanico Pandemonium in "From Dusk to Dawn" (1996); Jamie Lee Curtis in "True Lies" (1994); Jessica Alba in "Sin City" (2005); Rose McGowan in "Terror Planet" (2007); Sheila Kelley in "Dancing at the Blue Iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I love the sequence and I have included it in my "Cheesecake Dance" series on YouTube. I just think that making a claim as "the most erotic in the history of cinema" is really in a very fragile position.
