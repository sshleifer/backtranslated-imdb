I have some of Dr. Who's oldest videos and DVDs. I've played them over and over again. I love each of the "doctors" for different reasons. But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was canceled, even though he was still one of the pillars of the BBC lineup. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the Doctor remained alive through the fans. The BBC allowed fans to write books and cartoons. The impulse of Dr. Who has been constant even after 1989. Then they took a chance with Paul McGann. The movie had flaws, but it gave the BBC an idea of ​​what we wanted. In 1999, the "man" was gone and the rookies at the BBC felt it was time to bring the Doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in the United States, the science fiction channel took a risk and has also become a complete success, although the writers had to start over and explain Dr. Who's mythology to new viewers. It's amazing to me that they did it. In season 1, looking at Christopher Eccleston with Russell T. Davis as the main writer, and Phil Collinson as producer, the Doctor came back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the Doctor is. The Doctor Who universe has always dealt with "Choice", "Love" and "Sacrifice". This is what they provided. I want more and I am sad that Mr. Eccleston has chosen to leave the program. My first doctor was doctor no. 3, the doctor of Jon Pertwee. Mr. Eccleston should not worry about his position in the Dr. Who universe. It is as solid as the rest. He is the ninth doctor. I did not know Mr. Eccleston before his performance in Dr. Who, but now he does. I wish there was some way, he could know, there is a push in the Dr. Who fan community to find his other job and enjoy it. We have already seen that he is a great actor.
