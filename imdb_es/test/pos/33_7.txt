Lackawanna Blues is a complete drama. It details the life of a strong woman named Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is known as the nanny for all who know her, but could easily have been called the Wonder Woman. She embodied force, willpower, confidence and resolution. She owned a house she used to house almost any kind of person that society would reject. Their tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic veteran of war, an amputee and a host of other vagrants that made the house miles away from the ordinary. Each successive event that Rachel took calmly and handled without problems. She was not a dictator without compassion, but in reality it was the opposite. She showed compassion almost to guilt by giving shelter and shelter to so many that seemed to have spread too much. <br /> <br /> Merkerson did a good job, but I think this role was very important. The film had a uniform keel that never left Rachel. There were, of course, dramatic moments, but they were expected. Nothing was so shocking or profound that Rachel herself.
