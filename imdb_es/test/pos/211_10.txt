After having despised the television programming of the network, I remember the first time I saw an episode of "Police Squad!". It was totally by accident. It was during the initial network of the ABC program in early 1982. I am a chronic channel surfing person and was turning the number one night when the "Police Squad!" Credit sequence suddenly appeared. On the screen of my television. I immediately recognized it as a summary of the opening credits of "M-Squad," starring Lee Marvin, one of my favorite police shows of all time. I stopped surfing Then, of course, came the headquarters, followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln. For now I was saying to myself "What the hell is THIS?" Then came the "special guest star," Georg Stanford Brown, crushed by a collapsing safe. I was hooked from that moment. The episode was "Ring of Fear / A Dangerous Assignment", with its comic references to "On The Waterfront", and "Muhammed Ali", but the most memorable, of course, were all the jokes in sight and not minions. Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of "M Squad" were an absolute revolt. "Finally," I said to myself, "A network television show is really worth watching!" Would not you know it would be canceled a few weeks later? Leave it in the networks, I should have known. Anyway, I just bought the DVD collection of the six episodes and they are as much fun today as they were 27 years ago. The "Naked Gun" movies were great too, but I really missed Alan North (he was as good as Ed Hocken), Peter Lupus as Nordberg (what were you thinking of choosing OJ in that part?), And especially to "Johnny" The shoeshine boy. Good thing.
