Clouzot followed Le Corbeau, where no one knew who wrote the poison, so it was suspected that everyone, with another masterpiece, Quai des Orfevres, four years later, in which we know from the beginning (or we think so) the whodunnit Louis Jouvet, of great reputation, does not appear in forty minutes, at which time Clouzot has established a rich environment of Music Hall, music publishers, etc. and an excellent cast of colorful characters. The lookalike of Angela Lansbury (Lansbury appeared in Woman of Paris that same year), Suzy Delair qualifies as the singer whose desire to improve her lot inspires the jealousy of her husband / companion Bernard Blier, who follows her to the house of an old letch just to find it. he is already dead From here things are very bad, his car is stolen before leaving the premises, so his preestablished alibi is out of the window, while, unknowingly, his wife confesses the murder to the next photographer, a lesbian in the closet in love with. she, who volunteers to return to the scene of the crime and recover Delair's scarf and while there, carefully cleans his tracks of the murder weapon, a bottle of champagne. At this point, the researcher Jouvet gets involved and from that moment on he tries to keep the plates spinning in the air. The production of Clouzot was relatively small, but practically everything, as Spencer Tracey said in another context, "cherce", with Le Salaire de peur and Les Diaboliques still to come. In short, this is a must for French moviegoers.
