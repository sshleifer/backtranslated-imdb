For a children's movie, this is great. As an adult and a mother, I enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter. There are many things happening in this movie. The following * could * be considered a * spoiler * ... Barbie learns courage and learns not to judge others so fast in this movie. She also learns not to lose hope and to control her anger. I loved the teamwork that you get when you see Barbie, her sister and friends solve the puzzle. There is nothing in the film that I found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. In fact, I felt that the moral messages of the film were excellent and well done. <br /> <br /> The animation was pretty good. I really enjoy the ice skating scenes and I think they were very well done. There's a lot of action in this movie, so I suspect that most kids will enjoy it ... not just those who are really interested in Barbie. My daughter actually chose him because of Pegasus. She loves horses But she really enjoyed the movie. My daughter is autistic, and she was able to sit throughout the movie and enjoy it. She really liked action scenes and any part with horses involved. <br /> <br /> One thing I was thinking about was that many people are opposed to Barbie (and Ken) because they are so beautiful. However, I think that children, like adults, like to look at people and beautiful things. It's natural. As adults, we enjoy watching beautiful movie stars as well. It is wonderful, however, that the character of Barbie and her "boyfriend" have a lot of personality. While it is fun to see beautiful people, it gets old if there is not a substance behind the pretty face. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this is a great movie for children and parents to enjoy too. :)
