This movie reminded me of the live dramas of the 1950s, not like the recent "Failsafe," which seemed more like a trick than anything else, but a TRUE moral drama that is both engaging and stimulating. Anne Heche is more than credible since the army officer has an affair with her superior, played by Sam Shepard, and Eric Stoltz is wonderful as his lawyer defending her against the army. I found myself waiting for her romance to begin, if only because they look great together. This movie is apparently based on a true story, and it is a relief to be asked to think about real problems for a change. <br /> <br /> Directed by Christopher Menaul, who also made The Passion of Ayn Rand (with Stolz) and the Prime Suspect series, this is a movie with style and style that is worth seeing.
