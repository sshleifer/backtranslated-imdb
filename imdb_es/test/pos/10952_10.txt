Twins Effect, starring some of HK's most popular stars, offers one of the nicest cinematic experiences ever produced at HK. It has something for everyone, action, comedy, horror, romance and some drama. This film can not be taken too seriously, otherwise, you would be disappointed, but if you leave your brain at the door and just watch the movie to have fun, you are bound to enjoy it. <br /> <Excellent special effects, excellent action, cute twins, great actors of HK, FUN movie! <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone!
