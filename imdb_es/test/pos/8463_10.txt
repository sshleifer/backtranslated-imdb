Did you ever wonder where that episode came from, "Tuttle", in the middle of the first season of M * A * S * H? Well, now the cat is out of the bag: they got it from this Soviet movie, a satire on how stupid the Tsar is, due to the sliding of a pen (which translates the phrase "lieutenants, however ..." in "Lieutenant Kizhe" which makes no sense) and nobody is honest or brave enough to contradict him and tell him the truth: Kizhe does not exist and never existed. So they make an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him. And 40 years later, David Ketchum and Bruce Shelly borrowed this crazy plot and told us essentially the same story, just on the other side of what had become the Cold War, which shows that people in high positions can be equally silly regardless of their loyalties. perhaps!
