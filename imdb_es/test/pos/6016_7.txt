Based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee, who painted a much more loving image of her mother than her sister, actress "Baby" June Havoc, in her autobiography, "Early Havoc" in which "They Shoot Horses, Do not They? "Was vaguely based. I saw Ethyl Merman in the original Broadway production of Gypsy, and she was great as "Mama Rose", but certainly more "Merman" than Rose. I was disappointed with the interpretation of Rosalind Russell in the 1962 movie version. An otherwise excellent actress, Russell was a very wooden substitute for Merman. Bette Midler, on the other hand, was better and more credible than Merman and would recommend her performance as the definitive one.
