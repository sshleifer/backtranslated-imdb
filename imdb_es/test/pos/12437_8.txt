An awkward mistake in the Ministry of Education results in the Nutbourne Boys School having to share with the School for Girls of St Swithin. This baffles the respective main teachers of each school and leads to all kinds of chaotic events, however, both are forced to form an uncomfortable alliance in the hope of avoiding major problems. <br /> <br /> The Happiest Days of Your Life is based on the work of John Dighton in 1948, with Dighton writing the role of director Whitchurch specifically for Margaret Rutherford. Replacing George Howe of the play in the role of Headmaster Pond, is Alastair Sim, and here lies the glory of this film adaptation, Sim and Rutherford are perfectly wonderful, bouncing each other to keep what is basically a joke movie, Very entertaining. Directed by the talented Frank Launder, and produced by the equally skilled Sidney Gilliat, The Happiest Days of Your Life is a quintessential British film, obviously a precursor to the St. Trinians franchise, the film entertains children with their jokes of high level of sex heart, while tickling the adults who watch with their very spicy undercurrent. Fortunately, the chaotic ending cements everything that has preceded him to leave this particular viewer with a smile as wide as the Nutbourne train station, very funny 8/10.
