Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Carla Gugino and Gil Bellows revel in this sexy adventure. This movie is smart, the edge of your adult entertainment seat, and the relief that is in these days of predictable cartoon great concept. Good music and working with the camera add to the fun that is this puzzle of New Orleans. Highly recommended Ten stars
