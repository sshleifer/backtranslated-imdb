Funny movie! The script is horrible but the quality of the actors saves the day. John Hurt is perfect, as is Jane Alexander. Beau Bridges is fair and the actress who plays his wife is very weak. History is the true star. Based on a true story, the rhythm moves well and the whole concept of escaping East Germany absorbs and supports you. The happy ending provides enough euphoria to compensate for the script. Do not expect the quality of the Academy Award, but it is a great walk for the whole family.
