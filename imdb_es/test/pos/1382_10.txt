Today I had the opportunity to see this at a friend's house and I was impressed by what he achieved with such a small budget. It's not that this bothered me anyway, since I love low-budget science fiction like Dr Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was not a big-budget affair, so while the money helps, it's You need more than throwing money to make them good. <br /> <br /> The story is simple at first, with a group of mercenaries. Paid to escort a prisoner through space. Your ship is attacked and you are forced to land on the nearest planet. Then they discover that the prisoner has also succeeded, it is a case of cold stone and that is only the beginning of their problems. <br /> <br /> The effects, except the shootings, are minimalist and add to the film without overwhelming. that. The effects of the computer sometimes look a bit confusing, but they fulfill their purpose and add to the story, which gives a futuristic feel to the procedures. Movies like I, Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being heavily styled on substance and substituting special effects for a plot, like many of the Hollywood offerings. <br /> <br /> Although none of the actors obtains the material of the Oscar It is very well programmed and filmed, and in an hour and ten minutes it does not exceed its welcome. The characters do not materialize much, but neither did they in Predator, which resembles the sensation. The great man Mike Mitchell is a good support for Arnie and is a good combination of intelligence and muscular strength. <br /> <br /> Some people may feel upset by the lack of explanation towards the end, but I like it. Unlike many movies and shows that leave things unexplained, it's not so dark that you can not control it at all, and I'd like to see a sequel that explores more the nature of aliens. br /> <br /> A small film of an entrepreneurial team, made cheaply but fun to spend an hour. If this is what you can do with little money, I would like to see what you would do with a little more money, and I hope that the film industry and the armchair critics without talent will not take away all the creativity first. <Br /> <br /> Recommended.
