Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives her life through the telenovela Opera "A Reason to Love" as a way to escape from her vile husband and her boring life. After a shocking incident involving two assassins (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Betty goes into shock and travels to Los Angeles, believing that she is destined to marry the main character of the show (Greg Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty is that weird thing, a lesser-known movie with a stellar cast and a fluffy Rom-Com plot that surprises with her excellent screenplay and place in acting. In fact, such a graph makes a question the R rating, but it is well guaranteed. The shocking incident that sends Betty to the limit is a bit too graphic compared to the light and funny comedy that comes and feels like something out of a different movie, but at the same time it is necessary to credibly show Betty's transformation in Doe Eyed, adorable nut job in which he becomes. <br /> <br /> As we move forward with Betty on her journey, director Neil LaBute performs an extraordinary magic that makes the film unique and well above its standard error comedy. An example of this would be Betty's first encounter with her lover. She dedicates her heart to him and he goes along, thinking that she is auditioning to participate in the program. Even when we are aware of the ridiculous nature of Betty's ramblings, the music swells as she talks, giving the audience the emotional perspective of Betty. We almost believe what she is saying, but we understand that her mind is fractured. While other filmmakers try to accentuate the ridiculousness of the situation to squeeze every ounce of possible offstage comedy, LaBute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the greatest sympathy and understanding. <br /> <br /> The jokes between hitmen played by Freeman and Rock are priceless, the excellent script distributing a smart line after another intelligent one to be taken out. Freeman, in particular, is excellent as always, as his character moves slowly and blindly in love with his own Betty ideal, without really knowing who she is or what has happened to her. Aaron Eckhart, once again, shows versatility in the ungrateful role of Betty's not good husband and is almost unrecognizable. The other revelation here is Kinnear, whose representation of the soap star is not overly annealed. There is a tendency to lean on the clich√© of the celebrity bastard as thickly as possible, and Kinnear resists, instead impregnates a pompous but moderate importance, despite being a soap star. <br /> <br /> The telenovela has been made. so well, it could almost exist. LaBute and his partner hit the nail on the head with this and something good too. If the telenovela had been too satirical, a large part of the film would not have worked. Making a parody of "Days of our lives," as seen in Friends, would have been the wrong move for this movie. The dedication to the details is worth it, since the style and the sensation of the soap opera begin to bleed more and more in Betty's reality, while maintaining the general, not intentionally comical, aspect of the genre. The scenes on the set feel real, unlike some movies in which the environment feels so artificial, you wondered why people who do it for a living can not do it right. <br /> <br /> The perfect resolution of The final act, although it is a bit predictable, is totally satisfactory in general. It's a shame that after LaBute directed this wonderful movie, the mainstream would call him to direct the abysmal remake of The Wicker Man, a good example of a man so totally above the material he was given. Unfortunately, one can not absolve him of any responsibility. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Nurse Betty, it is something you must discover. If so, it's worth a new visit. There is a charm for Nurse Betty that is contagious, even if she can not leave you thinking much later. A gem hidden though.
