The plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in the movies, but directly, and is looking for his first big break. Discover Molly in a play and immediately know that she will be a great movie star. He signs a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. The producer agrees and his great professional careers are underway. What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and the first sound films with great emphasis on comedy. And, oh yes, there is romance, and also a little sadness. The performances of Don Ameche and Alice Fay are first class. Music is a real advantage also with some old familiar melodies heard. Many DVD extras also in this restored version released in 2008. It should be emphasized that this movie is a story, not just a tribute to silent movies. Later years would bring similar films such as Singin 'in the Rain (1952) and Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner, The Comic (1969). However, the special thing about this movie is the re-creation of silent films in 1939. We see parts of them as the cinema audience in that past era (although some sound effects are included) in glorious b & w, while the rest of the film is in pristine color One of the best in the silent era, Buster Keaton, who at the moment was on an uphill climb, is used excellently in 2 scenes recreated from silent movies and is at the top of his game ! It is said that he also had some input into his scenes. But the real reason to see the movie, if you're a fan of movie history, is that beyond everything else, Hollywood Cavalcade is Mack Sennett's cinematic legacy. It does not take a genius to realize that this film is a "positive" reworking of the lives of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand. The character of Michael "Linnett" Connors is Mack Sennett, whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And Molly, of course, is Mabel. Sennett had the cake releases, the bathing beauties and Keystone Cops. He worked with Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin (cameo), Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle (double body) and fell in love with his protagonist. Not only all that, but Sennett was technical advisor of this film and also appears in it. Since most moviegoers prefer sound characteristics, those who associate with short subjects and silences are left to the pasture. When Mack Sennett fell into that category, it's lucky that there's Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennett, of course, was very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies. His career began in 1908 as an actor, then writer, director and producer. He retired in 1935 with approximately 500 films under his belt. He had worked with the best, such as Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, W.C. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle and even Roy Rogers (in Way Up Thar). Since film comedy is an extremely difficult road to continue throughout a career, Mack acted sensibly and only did selective work for the next 25 years. In 1931 he received an award from the academy in the category of short subjects and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work. In the 1940s, its presence was still felt, eg. Here Come the Co-Eds (1945), where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in Mack's Wandering Willies (1926) is made. In 1947, The Road to Hollywood, he used some of Sennett's films in Crosby. Two years later he brought a bit of nostalgia with the movie Down Memory Lane in which he participated. With his ability to always associate with the right people, a guest role with the eternal popular Lawrence Welk and his radio show came later in the year. 1950 brought a re-release of his greatest triumph, Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914) with sound. In 1952 he was honored on television, This Is Your Life, then published his autobiography, The King of Comedy (1954), which is a great complementary piece of Hollywood Cavalcade. 1955 brought a more concrete association with Abbott & Costello, as he had a cameo at A & C Meet the Keystone Kops. Finally in 1957, another tribute to the compilation film, The golden age of comedy. So when you see Hollywood Cavalcade is the legacy of a pioneer of the movie. In the film of the banquet scene, the camera passes the guests on a long table. When we arrived at the silver-haired Mack, only he turned his head towards the camera as if to say: "Here I am!" When he gets up to give a speech a little later, he is at his most moderate, minimizing the words that are given to him to transmit mentally: "I know that my influence in the comedy will never end, but people will forget the individual Mack Sennett Maybe this movie will help. "
