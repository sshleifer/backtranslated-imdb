I really enjoyed the movie, especially the interpretation of the exceptionally beautiful Gong Li as a concubine. <br /> <br /> However, it was a bit annoying to have dialogues in Chinese PLUS subtitles in English PLUS voiceover with an American accent, even though the voiceover was very well synchronized. <br /> <br /> The family name of Qin shi huiang di (The first emperor of Qin) was Zheng, and his given name, Yiong, so in English he should have been referred to as "King Zheng" or "Emperor Zheng", and NOT as "King Ying Zheng", since in those days the two names of families / names were not used together. <br /> <br /> The state of Qin is pronounced "Chin" not "shin", pity that the investigators have not been successful in this. <br /> <br /> I forgave this, but in the end I was horrified when the comment announced that I was buried in "Zai-an" along with His terracotta warriors. The city Xi'an is pronounced "See-an", never "Zai-an" - certainly the American voice-over speakers could have done well!
