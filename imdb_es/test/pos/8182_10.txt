The film invites comparisons with Shakespeare. Mandarin is beautifully written and spoken, and the plot is intricate and intriguing. Never Gong Li looked better, never the glory that is China has been better represented on the screen. The balance between the political turmoil and the personal intrigue that Gladiator hinted at, but in reality never fulfilled, is here in broad strokes. Simply incredible.
