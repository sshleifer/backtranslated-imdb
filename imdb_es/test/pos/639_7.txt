I entered this film expecting a slasher, and although Mute Witness takes influence from that filming style, this is much more than a simple bar hit. There is a series of thrillers that focus on a specific disability: blindness is more common (Blind Terror, Wait Until Dark, Cat or 'Nine Tails, to name a few), but the implications of having a mute advantage in a thriller like this They are well represented and, in fact, are an integral part of the plot, since the fact that the main character can not speak is often the reason why he finds himself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to leave. . Our silent witness is Billy Hughes, a makeup artist who works in a horror film production in a studio in Moscow. One night, after several hours, she finds herself locked up and, after trying to call her sister for help, she runs into what at first seems to be the making of an illicit sex movie, but soon it turns out to be a movie of snuff! She tries to convince the authorities of what she has seen, but discovers that nobody believes in her story ... <br /> <br /> Recently, Hostel made headlines for showing snuff films in a foreign country, but this movie did. First and actually does a better job. It may not be as unpleasant as Eli Roth's work, but the gore is more effective, and since the director Anthony Waller (who directed one of my favorite modern thrillers with 'The Guilty') implements a good sense of humor in the procedures, Mute Witness is bloody enough and fun to watch. The director certainly has the talent to create thrilling suspense games, as this never stops. The plot is put into action quickly, and Waller constantly introduces twists in the plot that give a great hand to the overall entertainment value of the movie. The acting is not bad for a B movie, with the young performers Marina Zudina, Fay Ripley and Evan Richards offering good performances. The environment is harsh and the Russian places are hostile, which helps the film to preserve a premonitory environment. In general, Mute Witness is a much better movie than you would expect. The plot flows well, and the atmosphere and tension are correct.
