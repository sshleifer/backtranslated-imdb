For me, North and South (Books I & II) is the last television series of the 80's. Seeing all those appearances was very entertaining. Gene Kelly, James Stewart, Elisabeth Taylor, Olivia De Havilland, Robert Mitchum, even Johny Cash. No series has approached this achievement. Have you ever seen someone who looks like Lincoln? Dick Smith's prostheses made Hal Holbrock's powerful performance even more so. The handmade suits, the places of fall of the jaw, everything. It is clear that there are now excellent and brilliant television series (Desperate Housewives, Lost, 24), but North & South was, and still is, one of its kind. Do not miss it! Only the representation of David Carradine of the ultimate villain (you can call him simply his violent husband) is worth the visit. Maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped, I admit it but the positive sides clearly overshadow them. I am very happy that it is finally available on DVD in Spain.
