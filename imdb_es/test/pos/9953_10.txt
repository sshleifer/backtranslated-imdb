Hi. Hello and goodbye. But before I leave, I want to talk to you. I just want to quickly mention some key points about this movie. The first is eroticism. especially homo-erotica. <br /> <br /> yes, good. let us begin. When a man and a man love each other, they merge into one spectacular, not to mention the tender explosion of cinema we call the merchant of Venice. <br /> <br /> Homo erotic love was, in the worst case, sensual. and even more sensual at best. It was hard and emotional. He touched me inappropriately and I'm pretty sure I touched him. and when nobody was looking, I touched a bit too. <br /> <br /> I laughed because Portia was denied. She was the second in our friend's row, homo erotic love. oh antonio antoni only toni I love you More than you loved that boy. whose name may or may not contain a "B". It was very ugly. <br /> <br /> Antoni was very greasy. she soaped her body in a wrapper of her own hair grease and sensual juices, proceeded to twist the screen and introduced herself to the guy with the name I like about the movie, go see the movie if it were not for the homo connotations erotic, For the love of a man like antoni. only toni
