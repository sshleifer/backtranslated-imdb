Exactly how are Asians managed in a culture that generally refuses to recognize the concept of homosexuality? For millions of Hindu and Muslim homosexuals, there seems to be little hope of leading a life that is accepted and supported by their families, who are otherwise very close. This is the main point that is explored in the Chicken Tikka Masala, presumably named for the western spicy dish that includes tender pieces of young chicken meat. Jimmy is a typical Asian young man raised in Britain by traditional parents with narrow and selfish common views about marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of people, he is taken to an arranged marriage that seems inescapable, although apparently he is completely gay and is deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom he lives. He knows that the truth must be told, but he fears the consequences, especially because his father seems to have a terminal illness. And so it is involved in a network of deceptions that becomes increasingly broad as the plot unfolds. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully sensitive and in no way critical or condescending to any group portrayed. The acting in general is excellent, although it may seem a little difficult in places where the director tends to look for humor instead of letting it blossom naturally. There are no prizes for photography or the script, but the film is completed with the wonderful feeling expressed at the end, a feeling that all the parents of the world would do well to learn.
