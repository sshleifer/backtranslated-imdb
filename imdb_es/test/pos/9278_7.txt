I really wanted to see this documentary about what I considered one of the most entertaining films ever made. Growing in L.A. During the 1960s, many of these old black and white films were shown at local stations. I even remember a show on Friday night called "Strange Sci-Fi Tales" that showed a different science fiction movie every week. However, this documentary devoted too much time to the opinions of the four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic films of that genre and how they used them as inspiration in their filmmaking. <br /> <br /> That is not what I expected in this documentary. It really could have been a thorough examination of the decade instead of a brief summary of the best-known films of the time. Anyone who has studied or been interested in these films is quite familiar with such highlights as War of the Worlds, Forbidden Planet, The Thing, The Day the Earth Dtood Still, etc. I would have liked to see some excerpts from lesser known films and maybe some interviews with people involved in the making of these films. He would have to agree that the documentary was too focused on Spielberg's opinions and was a type of commercial for his new release of War of the Worlds.
