The excellent performance of the 5 stars makes this a must see. <br /> <br /> Based on a play, THE SILVER CORD is about "mother's love" at its worst. The film was very controversial because of the implicit homosexuality of the youngest son and the unnatural "romantic" feelings of the mother for both children. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne plays the new girlfriend (and biologist) who travels with her husband (Joel McCrea) to visit the family before heading to New York City for her new jobs. But something seems wrong. <br /> <br /> The mother, Laura Hope Crews, seems rude to the fiancee of the youngest son (Eric Linden) (Frances Dee). But Dunne puts those thoughts aside and ignores some of the strange things that the mother says. Then he discovers that "his" room is at the end of McCrea's hall, and his room is next to the mother's room. <br /> <br /> Later, she goes in while "mom" is getting McCrea and kissing him (on the lips) good night. Mom has also been working on Linden and making him doubt his feelings for Dee. Everything explodes and with Dee running in the snowy night towards the frozen pond. While the boys run after her, Mom shouts from the window that the boys go back to look for their coats! Dee falls through the ice and is rescued. <br /> <br /> When the girls leave the house the next morning, Dunne lets mom know what he thinks of her and her attachment to the children. But Mom has a firm grip, a false illness and always boasts of her sacrifices. The girls leave but the boys are left behind ....... <br /> <br /> The crew is magnificent as the voracious mother (repeating her role on stage); It is a part that few actresses would dare to play. The sexual nuances are incredible for a 1933 film and Crews takes advantage of his best cinematographic role. Dunne is also excellent, as he tries to maneuver the course without losing McCrea. Dee has some excellent scenes after Linden disconcerted her. All 5 stars are great in this drama that is strangely underestimated and unknown. <br /> <br /> A forgotten jewel for anyone who likes the great performance ...
