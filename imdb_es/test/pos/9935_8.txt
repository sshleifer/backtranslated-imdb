Even if it's not labeled as a Slasher movie, it has all the elements. The fact that slashers are well known for their low budget, the lame plot, the cheesy effects and everything that can add does not mean that there can not be good slasher movies. "Opera" fills the description. Although it is part of the Italian giallo; that is far from being a subgenre slasher. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento shows that he deserves the label of one of the best directors in Horror. "Opera" is one of the most elegant horror films of the last 30 years. Although the film takes place in a beautiful and gleaming place; The situation and the gore make it one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I think of "Opera" as a stylish Slasher, although there is a deep plot and character development. The cheese factor that is often used in most of the Slasher films is not present here, but in return we get an amazing and visually stunning story. The plot of the film is simple (as in each Slasher). There is a psycho in the opera who is somewhat obsessed with the main actress / singer and forces her to see gruesome deaths. The death scenes are extremely horrible and are the best of the movie. The famous death scene "peep-hole" is the highlight of the film in my opinion. It is a terrible scene of death that nothing less than Argento could throw. The knife that goes through the neck (and the mouth) is another frightening scene but less violent than the death of the scissors. Gore in "Opera" will please the evil and lovers of violence. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the movie is the lack of coherence or logic. I mean, after seeing the first death, the woman leader, calm as if nothing had happened, takes her home and does not give much importance to what she saw. In addition, she has been left alone at home and does not take security measures. Even so, the suspense in the movie makes you forget the lack of logic. Argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious. For example, when Betty's friend tells her that someone was watching her from the outside, she gets scared and puts on suspense in case something happens. <br /> <br /> The direction of the film is great. For an Italian giallo it is excellent. The creative shots of Argento's POV are impressive. The crows also added a spooky feeling to the movie. Argento adds its unique spice. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is one of the most underrated but popular Horror community for these reasons, in my opinion: -the scene of the death of the holes (bright) -the crows attack at the end - the Opera's configuration: the knife that crosses the neck and the mouth, the heavy metal score combined with the music of Opera (this music had never scared me before), the ferocity of the killer. <br /> <br /> What The only thing I do not like about "Opera" are the heavy metal songs used in the scenes of death. It's fine to annoy the audience, but I think Opera's music might have added a more spooky feeling. Even so, the "shocking" use of heavy metal is a singular and disturbing aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Watch "Opera" even if you do not like gore. There is a lot of suspense and tension that could scare the most skeptical person. This is not "Suspiria" but it deserves to be among the best of Argento.
