In general, the movie Dad's Army is very funny, although the humor is not as flashy and bright as in the radio and television series. So where does this leave us, the spectators? If you've never seen Dad's Army, then the movie is a good way to catch up and hook up with the crazy world of Walmington O / S. The downside is that you can not "get it" because, as I said, the humor in the movie It is a bit stupid. <br /> <br /> For fans of Dad's Army, the movie has nothing new as a story. it is more or less a clipping from the television series, but it is a unique opportunity to see your favorites in "high definition" compared to the crap quality of the BBC video recordings. <br /> <br /> The film also presents what must be the sequence of delay in the history of the universe. However, I can not decide if that is positive or negative.
