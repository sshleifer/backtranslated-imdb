A very interesting look to some characters of the growing middle class of India. Although India is rapidly modernizing, its culture is not kept up to date. This film involves the patriarchal society, where women are not yet truly free citizens. A land of arranged marriages, men who live with lovers with total impunity and women who are expected to tolerate all this, will eventually fall short. I was impressed by Nandita Das, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total seriousness. But I was more impressed with Shabana Azmi, who I understand is a Bollywood accessory for a long time. Her calm beauty and low profile psychic suffering were excellent. The lesbian subtext of this movie was never particularly erotic, and never exciting. (Damn it!) It's worth taking a look for those interested in very different cultures.
