When I saw LAUREN BACALL doing CACTUS FLOWER on Broadway, I never dreamed that I would one day see an actress like INGRID BERGMAN playing the role of Bacall on the screen. But here, Ingrid really lets out a good time for some good comedy moments like the dental nurse who claims to be WALTER MATTHAU's wife so she can continue with the treatment she told GOLDIE HAWN. <br /> <br /> It's a story that laughs out loud. From beginning to end, things of good humor that never remain without dry wit and wit throughout their execution time. There are a lot of phrases or gags that are far above the usual situation of the comedy that is heard on television: the lines sound true because they combine very well with the characters and their motives. <br /> <br /> Like The dazed girl who contemplates (at first) committing suicide because of her unhappy relationship with Matthau, GOLDIE HAWN (newly arrived from her starring role in "Laugh In" of television) plays a foolish role blond to perfection. It's easy to see why she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. <br /> <br /> Ingrid is surprisingly playing an uncommon comedy role, although there are times when she seems a little too mocking for the role. In any case, it is a surprising choice to interpret the nurse who acts frozen in the office but is much warmer when it is out of service. <br /> <br /> As Goldie's neighbor, Igor, Rick Lenz, declares himself admirably. and makes a suitable combination for her in that final scene. <br /> <br /> Matthau interprets the type of character that became his value in the trade in all those Neil Simon roles he had: a friendly cad that gets caught up in his own mess when he says lie after lie. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of comedy that will make you laugh out loud at some of the funny phrases that Abe Burrows and IAL The diamonds have managed to discard together, based on a French farce.
