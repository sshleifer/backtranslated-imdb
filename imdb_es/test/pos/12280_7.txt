The copy of this movie that I have seen is not very good. It is grainy and has almost no color in some parts. It changes from one side to the other between English and French, often in the middle of the sentence and, sometimes, even in the middle of a word. To make matters worse, there are no English subtitles during the parts of the French language, which I think constitute at least a quarter of the film. But, surprisingly, the film is still very understandable and enjoyable, even in this condition, and I think it says a lot about how well made this film is. <br /> <br /> This is a top-notch western spaghetti with great performance, an interesting story and excellent music. He also has a great protagonist, a beautiful girl with dark hair, some strange characters and events and a general feeling of melancholy. This movie has "Euro" written everywhere. <br /> <br /> I hope there is a pristine negative impression of this movie somewhere, because it deserves a quality DVD release, and when it comes out, I will do it. Be one of the first in line to get it!
