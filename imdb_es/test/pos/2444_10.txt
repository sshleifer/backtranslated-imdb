I watched this when it was screened for the first time and then I lost it when it disappeared from the British screens. It showed a different side of ancient Australia that we need to see more. Good juxtaposition of veterans and young Turks. Then the realism of the hard back was fantastic. Unfortunately, it was lost. This show was a cold look at the old way of looking at Australia. Hard life and hard work. The young idealist collides with the old practical boss. Real Politicka fighting with the newcomers from New Labor. To add a modern political vernacular. <br /> <br /> This show was the first of its kind that I found that did not try to do a touristic job in Australia. It was a great show of realistic and realistic spectacle. Some good movies were at that time doing a similar job. It would be fantastic to see more of this type of television coming from Australia, since unfortunately it has been lost these last twenty years. All we have received is the soap of varying quality.
