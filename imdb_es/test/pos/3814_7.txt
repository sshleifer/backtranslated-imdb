I saw this before 'bubba ho-tep' at the fantasy film festival in Montreal. All about it is tipping the hat to Tim Burton (or cheating completely). However, I enjoyed it, even if it is extremely derivative. what impressed me the most was the quality of the visuals given the obvious budget of the shoe chain. The design of the set and the accessories were original and original, although the script definitely was not.
