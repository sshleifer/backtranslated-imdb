The first time I saw this movie was in 1980 and it touched a cord that reminded me of a more innocent moment. The opening narrative, music and Norman Rockwell's paintings set the tone for me. Either you like the movie or you hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was at his best and played the Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a very innocent and moving way. This movie is at the top of my favorites of all time, a pity that it is no longer available on DVD or VHS. The ending was also wonderful. John Hancock did a wonderful job capturing the essence of time.
