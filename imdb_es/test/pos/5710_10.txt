"The Student Nurses" is an excellent film about four women linked by friendship and career. For the first time, one can see a realistic representation of relationships within the workplace, outside the workplace, the risks of those relationships and the consequences. This film also offers a rare opportunity to see veteran theater and television actress Katherine "Scottie" MacGregor as a nursing instructor, "Miss Boswell." Ms. MacGregor is best known for her performance as "Mrs. Oleson" in the television series "Little House on the Prairie." The direction, the music and the print color are very good, as well as the opening theme interpreted by Clancy B. Grass, III. This film offers a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes centered in the late sixties and early seventies, offering a "softer side of life" while appreciating the beauty of the female sex.
