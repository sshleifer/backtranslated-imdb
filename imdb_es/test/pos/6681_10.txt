If you have enjoyed the Butterfly Effect, Donnie Darko or The Machinist, you will also enjoy K-Pax. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie seemed really edifying and at the same time depressing. Spacey offers a great performance as a Prot. Also, let's not forget the appearance of Saul Williams in the movie, of whom I am a big fan. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I recommended the film to many of my friends, and they were all impressed. far. <br /> <br /> But still, it is very underestimated, perhaps due to the lack of action and explosions. I'm sorry, this is not a movie about how to exploit things, it's about how humans behave and how people live in worlds that do not exist. <br /> <br /> Continue and enjoy.
