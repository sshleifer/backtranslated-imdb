In this film, astronauts sent to explore a newly discovered planet must deal with several dilemmas, and they do so intelligently. The film tackles its main theme of the plot in a unique way, and unfolds it gradually, although it can be guessed in advance. <br /> <br /> The performance is very good, although sometimes rigid, as it can be the performance of some of the late 60s. It can also be somewhat tedious and even melodramatic, especially after the theme of the plot is revealed. Visually, it has a scene that resembles that of "2001: A Space Odyssey" from the previous year, and that tends to date the movie. Some of the actors went on to star in the 1970 TV show "UFO," which is delightfully elegant and worth seeing on DVD. <br /> <br /> Despite these small points, space flight itself is realistic, and considering this was in 1969, the scenes inside the ship's cabin also had a realistic appearance. (Also look for video technology from the 90s and 2000s in use!) One thing: I suspect a love scene has been cut, but I can not prove it! Anyway, it would have been a distraction. <br /> <br /> Unlike most sci-fi movies, this movie will make you think about the plot, and it's worth checking out. I am pleased to have this movie in my video library.
