The best short film I've ever seen. Some commentators suggest that it may have lengthened due to the density of information it offers. There is irony in that comment and little merit. The performance depends on Noonan and takes his ungrateful character to perfection. I could have preferred that the narrator be less "recognizable", but the gravity is perfect. This is a short for people who read, for those whose "bar" is high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge opposites and bitter defenders of beauty. A beautiful short film. FWIW: I liked Picasso's reference, since I once believed that Picasso was just another bitch of art with little talent; Like, I suppose, most people, until the day I saw some drawings he made when he was 12 years old. Picasso was a more refined artist and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will become in his life. I understood immediately why I had to do the art for which he became known.
