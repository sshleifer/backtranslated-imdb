Arriving on the heels of the "Blackploitation" era of the 1970s, CONRACK (20th Century-Fox, 1974) offered audiences a kind of drama, sincere and everyday. Offer a fair very different from your audience (which was much more general than those "Gansta" movies); to be a realistic dose of realism that offered a lone counterweight to the "em-ups" of shots. <br /> <br /> REPLACEMENT of main characters that were evil detectives, super flies and mega / macks / pimps (Make your choice in terminology), was a lone teacher, humble and meek. The academic we are talking about is the main character, Pat Conroy; Who is the only and only teacher hired to take responsibility for a kind of school house on an island off the coast of South Carolina? <br /> <br /> "CONRACK" (Jon Voight), The name that the young people attribute to him finds the conditions in the school terribly backward. In addition to the physical properties of this "Little Red Schoolhouse", any systematic and progressively graduated educational system was totally absent. <br /> <br /> OH yes, by the way, do we mention more complications for any educational success? The company manifested itself in two incontrovertible facts. Those were that Pat Conroy was both a stranger and he was white; with almost all the population of this coastal cay was black and very poor. <br /> <br /> PERPETUATING these unacceptable and deplorable conditions were the agents of the local board of education; being the principal of the school, Mrs. Scott (Madge Sinclair) and the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington (Mr. Hume Cronyn). Between the two, we are made to understand that the teacher, being the man low on the totem, is powerless in most aspects to affect any kind of significant and lasting improvements. <br /> <br /> BUT do not do it. You do not tell a "young Turk," like Pat Conroy, that he can not. (You can not do anything, that's it). "Conrack" spends a year of unorthodox class presentations and is really making progress; but, unfortunately, the strong-headed teacher will not surrender nor will he recognize the authority of his superiors. While he, by law and without his knowledge, serves you super pleasure; he disobeys the specific order and Mr. Skeffington's prohibition of taking his children from class to the South Carolina mainland on Halloween for some trick or treat; even going to the brazen act of stopping with them at the Skeffington residence. <br /> <br /> Next we see a Western Union Telegram messenger singing happily as he crosses from the mainland of Carolina to the island; where he delivered the telegram to Conroy, who had the news of his dismissal from his position in that school and district. <br /> <br /> NOT BE ONE to get laid off, Pat files suit against Mr. Skeffington. The Principal, Ms. Scott and the Board of Education protesting her dismissal for being illegal. By impartially reviewing both the "offense" and the law, the judge asks Skeffington if there is any minor punishment that could be replaced by the separation of Conroy from the school system; to which he receives a negative response. Appropriately, the judge discards the suit with his hammer striking while saying: "It's very simple!" <br /> <br /> The story comes to a bittersweet conclusion when 'Conrack' students see it off the Chinese mainland release, while a phonographic record provides us with the 5th BEETHOVEN SYMPHONY; who had played an important role in the educational agenda of Conroy, as well as our history. <br /> <br /> In HUMBLE's opinion of this writer, the story (which we believe was at least semi-autobiographical, even giving the main character, the name of its author, was much more than a story of a localized event, both for my friend Schultz and for myself, this is a kind of representation of a microcosm that represents the deplorable conditions in general that permeate the Government Schools throughout the nation. (Just one opinion) <br /> <br /> AS TO THIS movie, it was just one of the many films portraying ordinary people's shops, leading a life of "quiet despair" in the large areas of the interior of the country, which lie outside the DC Beltway and the urban centers of companies and communications located on the coasts of the Atlantic or the Pacific. <br /> <br /> FOR YOUR OWN In a few words, this is a good movie, which will soon be joining the 20th Century movie vaults -Fox with large or bras as NORMA RAE and BREAKING AWAY. (both are from TCF in 1979). <br /> <br /> SEE if you have not already done so. Recommended by Schulz and his friend. * <br /> <br /> NOTE: * Of course it's me, of course! <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
