"The Aristocats" is the Disney classic at its best. It is not considered the best Disney classic along with Disney's best-known films, but it is a well-made and fun movie that definitely deserves to be a Disney classic. "Aristocats" is undoubtedly a pleasure for children, since it has all the components for a fun movie for children. I will like it very much as a child. I'm not sure that this movie is a safe pleasure for adults, who could see Disney classics for nostalgia, but I still enjoy this movie as a young adult. <br /> <br /> Storywise, "Aristocats" It may not be so complex or innovative, but it does not matter. This film was made in that period in which the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and the wise verse, which certainly shows "Aristocats". The characters make the movie; all are nice, fun, have great lines and have a great interaction between them. The voice actors are also part of making the characters so convincing (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley and etc.). One misconception could have been that of Napoleon and Lafayette dogs, since they are incredible and do not have much to do with the real story, but fortunately they are fun and funny characters, and the scenes with them are pure gold. <Br /> <br /> "Aristocats" is entertaining and cute, but it is also a very funny caricature. The style and appearance of the animation are perfectly adapted to the French environment of the film (especially the city of Paris looks very good). The animation and design of the character is great. And the songs are really catchy too. My favorite is "Scale and Arpeggios", but the title song is a nice song, along with "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and the memorable "Everybody Want's To Be A Cat". And George Burns' score is perfect for the fun and emotional situations of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, "Aristocats" is, in my opinion, the best Disney cartoon of the 70s and it is a film that deserves both. be seen and remembered So, what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor and share this Disney classic with your children. It deserves to be in your memories.
