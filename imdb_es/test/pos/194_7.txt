It is not difficult, after seeing this movie, to see why the post-silent Soviet cinema remains in such low critical esteem. Do not get me wrong THE CRANES ARE FLYING is, at least during the first half, extremely entertaining, with a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin; a fresh, energetic and spacious technique that finally irritates as much as it initially charms; Two impressive subjective pieces; and a romantic outbreak that flirts with, but never collapses, in the territory of Lelouch. It's just that, by subsuming vast social, national and world events into a love story, it's essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, in a Soviet Union that emphasized the state Above all, and in an era (World War II) that suppressed individualism and the freedom to defend murderous symbolism, this close-up of Two young attractive lovers is a relief. And the thematic similarities, all the love consumed separated by war, with two of the most marvelous of all movies (SEVENTH HEAVEN, LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG) also add to their potential friendliness. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. Boris, a young factory worker from a brilliant medical and artistic family, and Veronika, a student, carry on a relaxed relationship at night, his only free time. The cousin of Boris Mark, a composer, also has eyes on Veronika. When the Nazis invade Russia, Boris volunteers in secret, much to the disgust of his family and lover. He promises to write to Veronika, but never does, thinking that maybe she has not bothered to fire him, or maybe the mail is simply unreliable. Veronika's parents die during an air strike, and she moves in with Boris's family, helping in the hospital where her father takes care of wounded soldiers. <br /> <br /> Afflicted by Boris's silence, Veronika is also assaulted by Mark's attentions. , who has obtained exemption from military service by bribing a local official. Finally, it wears out and marries him, to the disapproval of his adoptive family. Boris, meanwhile, dies in action. Veronika, disgusted with herself and an adulterous brand, refuses to believe this, and awaits his return, raising a young orphan who bears his name. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the birds that the couple sees at the height of their love, symbolic perhaps of their transcendent epiphanic power. But this is illusory: the cranes fly in a V shape, and this shape permeates the entire film, through the geometric shapes of buildings, interiors, exteriors, groups of people, composition, camera angles, the name of the heroine, or editions in which feet that walk southwest in a story meet feet that walk southeast in another. <br /> <br /> This serves to fatally trap lovers who have no control over their destinies, and also suggests the Stalinist power that is never, specifically, mentioned in the film. While the couple seems to be free in space, either literally in an unopened environment, or privileged in generous approaches, they are always ironic, minimized, torn by circumstances, families, the crowd (see the brilliant, if it is obvious , sequences where Veronika is swallowed by tanks, or the couple does not meet in a large crowd, or simply because of the structure of the film, which is constantly moving away, through parallelism, its closeness, although at the beginning, lightness and Brilliance of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll, it is constantly broken with strange editions or camera angles of distracting music fragments. <br /> <br /> The most notable thing is how these blocks The romance is achieved by abstracting instead of emphasizing the historical forces The whole film, but especially the war itself, is strangely unreal and dreamlike, it never shows its harsh and brutal reality, only its effects on the ama In fact, it becomes a majestic spectacle, devoid of unpleasant Germans. <br /> <br /> In the front of the house, the air incursions create delicious effects of light and shadow, or ruins of almost Gothic decadence. In the bunker, the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than Boris's perception of indifference. The empty and dreamlike spaces of Moscow that initially the lovers, that Veronika and her mother, walk, are places less real than the emotional spaces. <br /> <br /> When Mark tries to impose himself on Veronika, the air attack is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations. This is a brilliant sequence, filmed with silent and expressionist terror, in which the screen seems to explode with hysteria and violence, all the more convincing for the melancholy softness of the previous scenes. <br /> <br /> It's not much different in The Front either, where fights for girls' honor are more urgent than tactics, Nazis or despair. The movement of Boris and his wounded companion in a final space is an additional abstraction of the war experience, its location in a forest that gives it a sexual dynamic; and the final flashback of Boris, prior to death, is an extraordinary mixture of fulfillment of dream desires and increased anxiety, in which what is desired becomes menacing and grotesque. <br /> <br /> From this point in the movie it becomes a little less interesting, a little more obvious. One more handling of Expressionist overload - Veronika's attempted suicide and her rescue of the infant - is handled clumsily; and his grim guilt casts a paralyzing shadow over the entire movie. The use of deep focus, at first dazzling, soon becomes exhausting, as it lacks moral force or meaning that Welles gave to its use in CITIZEN KANE. After what it seems, a stealthy critique of totalitarianism in favor of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end, when individual suffering, as so often happens in Russian art, is transmuted into a symbolic hope (that is, without sex, dehumanized ). A shame
