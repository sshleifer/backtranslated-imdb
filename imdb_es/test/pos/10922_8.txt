Some films want to make us think, others want to enthuse us, others want to enthuse us. But sometimes, a movie just wants to make us laugh, and "In & Out" certainly succeeds in this department. <br /> <br /> Indiana High School teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is going to marry a classmate Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) in three days, but the whole city is more excited about the nomination to the Oscar of former resident Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon). But when Cameron wins an Oscar for playing a gay soldier, he thanks his gay teacher, Howard, for his inspiration. What follows is that Howard denies it in a hilarious set of setbacks in a truly dazzling way. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline is great, exudes gay stereotypes. Joan Cusack really has a gift for antics. Debbie Reynolds is absolutely hilarious as Howard's mother. And Bob Newhart is also a flash as the main homophobic. <br /> <br /> Gay writer Paul Rudnick really achieves a delicate balance here. He knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that is for the most part tolerable for the conservatives of the Midwest and, however, for the most part harmless to the gay audience. It's not exactly progressive, but it's fun and harmless, and it's definitely one step ahead of "The Birdcage" from the previous year.
