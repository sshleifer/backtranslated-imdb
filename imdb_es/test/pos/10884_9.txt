What can be said about one of the best N64 games? That the action is fast enough to keep even a veteran FPS veteran with his sudoral bullets literally? That the graphics are great, even the explosions that everyone loves to see? That nothing is as fun as playing in multiplayer mode, and shooting your friends and brothers in the back with machine guns? <br /> <br /> Very few hits Goldeneye 007. Almost all that was missing was the voice acting, and a little more intelligence in the enemy soldiers. If you have an N64, and you like to shoot people and things crossed with espionage, get a copy of this.
