This eternal summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. I can not even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is a movie that I could probably watch every few weeks and still love. <br /> <br /> There is something timeless in this movie. I have loved other "love story movies" like Pretty Woman and when Harry met Sally. I think they're up there, but there's something in Dirty Dancing that makes it absolutely perfect. The characters, the chemistry between Swaze and Gray, the direction of the film, the INCREDIBLE dance, the warm summer atmosphere, everything about the dirty dance is absolutely perfect. It's an instant classic and I've never seen a movie like this before or after. <br /> <br /> I do not think there is a particular element that makes this film so beloved but many things, a lot of which are mentioned by numerous critics. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, languid, summery mood, realistic characters, a relatively honest message along with incredible music and dance, and one of the best dance sequences the cinema has given us. <br /> <br /> This movie is always on TV and I will continue to watch it as long as they show it. But I will mention that I have no interest in seeing "Havanna Nights", this should have left her alone.
