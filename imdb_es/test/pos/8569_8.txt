H.O.T.S. It's a fun movie for a trip back to when skin movies had a more positive and fun-filled agenda. They were made simply to stimulate and have some laughs. Everything seems less cynical and jaded. All the girls have natural figures and some are playboy companions. The simple plot is about a group of young women who open an unauthorized house of brotherhood to return to the frequented girls who rejected and insulted them. Instead of the petty tricks of today, most hijinks are simply innocent fun. Women are decent actresses for this genre and are mostly very attractive. To keep our attention between the topless scenes, we have mafia minions, a stolen bear, a hot air balloon, a funky house mother and the cheapest robot ever seen. There's even Danny Bonnaducci of the Partridge family. If you have a sense of humor, let yourself go and enjoy a light entertainment.
