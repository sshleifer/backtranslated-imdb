The Monkees, surprisingly, are my big favorites. Yes, they could have been the original rock band made; A trick that has undoubtedly reached an excess in the 21st century. However, his music remains one of the best that the 1960s had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are excellent songs, written by good composers like Boyce / Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen / King and John Stewart. While they were not great musicians or composers, they had a nice presence on the screen and a lot of attractiveness, and some of their own things were really decent. His television and TV show dates back to 2007, but I still see the show on occasion as a time-of-life capsule in 1966-1968; that magical and dangerous moment in the history of the United States. <br /> <br /> However, as we all know, as portents of things to come for the likes of Kelly Clarkson, the Monkees did not want to be considered manufactured and simply Puppets for their recording company. Despite their average talent, they wanted to write their own songs, produce their own albums and be successful when it came to touring. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a disaster; especially when Peter Tork chose Jimi Hendrix as an opening act due to his theft of the show and his heavy sexual suggestions in his music compared to the rated content of The Monkees G. <br /> <br /> However, the latter nail In the coffin of the Monkees (until 1986) was the infamous film Head. The head was written by Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson when they were supposedly on top of Mary-Jane. The film received bad reviews and only won $ 16,000 at the box office. Today, the film is a cult classic, ahead of its time and conveys a message of what was on the minds of young people in 1968, Summer Of Anger. <br /> <br /> Head really has no argument. Basically, one to four of The Monkees jump from scene to scene without any rhyme or reason. They go from eating in a restaurant, to seeing Davy Jones being hit by Sonny Liston, to a western, to being absorbed by emptiness, to acting in a concert and so on. The film basically offers oblique views of what was wrong with American society. The monkees hit commercialism, the war in Vietnam, American politics, censorship, establishment and greed. You have to read between the lines to see what the objectives of the mockery were. <br /> <br /> The Monkees spent a lot of time boxed in certain movie joints, symbolizing how they felt their record company had seen them; as nothing more than toys to play when it was time to record another successful album. A scene in which they are outnumbered 16-4 on the western scene could be a symbol of them against the musicians of the session, composers, record producers and others who controlled their careers and the cannon they shoot them is his way of saying "Begone!" . <br /> <br /> The movie is truly a psychedelic journey for the eyes. The striking colors of the tie dyeing, the hypnotic concert and the scenes of belly dance and the images of drugs are everywhere. The acting is actually very good, but that is partial, since I like The Monkees T.V. Show. A small soundtrack presents "The Porpoise Song" and three songs written by the same Monkees. <br /> <br /> The movie actually has some funny scenes sometimes; although maybe they were not supposed to be. Mickey Dolenz hit a Coke Machine that did not give him a soda or his violent punching at the boxing scene (that is, he was a muscular guy who probably weighed no more than 135) made me laugh. <Br /> <br /> In short, this movie is a must see for any Monkees fan. I think a lot of people will feel that this movie is really "on its head", but for those obsessed with the 60s and society at that time they will find it a great time capsule.
