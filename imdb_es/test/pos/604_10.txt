The Muppet Movie by Jim Henson is a charming, fun and brilliant movie that can be seen and enjoyed by adults and children. I feel like this is my favorite childhood movie because it combines great characters, a great story and a great wit that is irresistible. The plot involves the frog Kermit (puppeteer and voice of Henson) in his odyssey throughout the United States to follow his dream in Hollywood. On the way, meet Fozzie Bear, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf and DR. The teeth and electric chaos. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many good things that I can not even tell them. But it is memorable and every time I think of a puppet or a muppet, I think of this movie. Look for the cameos of Mel Brooks, Dom DeLouise, Paul Williams, Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey), Elliot Gould, Carol Kane and the great Orson Welles. Excellent and spectacular, one of the best movies of the 70s. A ++
