I used to watch this program when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it quite well. If you ask me, it was a pretty good show. Every time I think about it, I do not remember the opening sequence or the theme very well. In addition to that, they were all ideally launched. In addition, the writing was very strong. The performances were first class, too. I hope some network brings it back to see each episode. Before finishing this, I would like to say that I will always remember this program in my memory forever, although I am not sure I have seen all the episodes. Now, in conclusion, if a network brings it back, I hope it catches it a day before it leaves the air forever.
