Life is made up of infinite possibilities; Some known, others a mystery and destined to remain so. And what about the vast unknown, the realms beyond which knowledge has no limits or established parameters? Who is to say what exists or what is possible? Valid questions, all raised and explored in the story of a particular individual's personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that challenges facts and logic, in 'K-PAX', directed by Iain Softley, and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Following an incident at the Central Station in New York, a man named Prot (Spacey) is transferred to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan, where he is delivered to Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges), who tries to discover the truth. about his patient, who claims to be from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell, since Prot, with his calm, direct, forthcoming manner and a propensity to produce (he eats banana peels and all, and Red Delicious apples are his favorites) is quite convincing . But Powell's job, as well as his nature, is to be skeptical. Prot's assertions, however, remain intact and stand firm even under the most intense probe and the watchful eye of Dr. Powell, who finds himself in a kind of dilemma. Prot even tells him the exact date and time he will leave for K -PAX, a scheduled return trip that allows Powell but only a little time to solve everything. And it seems that Powell can not understand his idea that he is dealing with a true alien being; And it's something you'll have to solve quickly, if you're ever going to know the truth. And he has to know. The truth, after all, is the only thing that will set him free in his own mind. <br /> <br /> Softley has created and delivered a sensitive and stimulating film that challenges the viewer to sustain the mystery. surrounding Prot, while forcing you to reflect on your own concepts of what, in fact, is possible. And since you never know for sure about Prot until the end, you can identify with Powell, see the situation from his point of view and try to solve the enigma along with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of awe and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that Prot can be what it says it is. And in the context of the reality to which the film is set, it is a fascinating business to try to wrap your mind around. How do you react when all the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations that we have imposed? While in the heart of the film there is a deep depth of humanity that is evident, not only in Prot, but also in Dr. Powell. All of which makes it an extremely attractive and exciting drama. <br /> <br /> As we have come to expect, Kevin Spacey offers a brilliant performance as Prot, presenting his character from within, emotionally deep and physically compelling. at the same time. This is a unique individual, and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which adds to the credibility of the character and the credibility of the story itself. For this movie to work, it is essential that we create who and what is Prot; We do it, and it does. Spacey simply pulls it out superbly. It is a memorable performance, from which evolves a character that will remain with you for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges, meanwhile, emerges on an equal footing with Spacey, deftly becoming a very real person of Dr.. Powell. It's a fairly simple role, and the challenge for Bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make it unique in its own right, which, in contrast to Prot's character, was not an easy task. And, again, for this movie to work, it was necessary for Bridges to live up to the occasion. And, with an exceptional ability and being the consummate professional that he is, he achieves it without a doubt. Bridges infuses Powell with underlying complexity, and is giving so much in its performance that it makes the interaction between Powell and Prot vibrant and sometimes intense. It is a demonstration of two of the best actors in the business doing what they do best, creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring. It is an excellent work of Bridges, who never tries to steal the attention from Prot, which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher category. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr. Villers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). An entertaining and emotionally enveloping film, 'K-PAX' is a dissertation on possibilities, as well as an examination of the constantly evolving complexities of the human condition. It is a film that demands an open mind and rewards those who can approach it on its own terms and embrace it. In the end, it makes you realize how real K-PAX is; and it makes you appreciate Prot's trip, and how much we share and have in common with those around us, humans or aliens. And it may only make you reflect on your own journey, where you have been and where you are going. And that is the magic of cinema. I qualify this 10/10. <br /> <br />
