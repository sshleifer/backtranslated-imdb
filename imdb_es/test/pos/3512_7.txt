I was lucky to see the DVD version of "Horror Classics" of this movie before it was mysteriously extracted from the 4 movies DVD and replaced by something else. The quality of image and sound of the film in that edition was a nightmare in itself. However, that version is still superior to that of the luxury DVD treatment. The reason was established in Brad Fiedel's interview segments on the Special Edition DVD. I had noticed what I found so surprising about this movie. Being the use of music in moments of inactivity in the film, but leaving the moments of activity in silence, thus giving a stronger feeling to the scenes of horror. The problem with this reissue is that it carries the additional score of the film that is used to fill these intentional gaps in the score. Fiedel complained about this and made it clear that the filler music was not his. Actually, the music was very similar to Howard Shore's work for Videodrome. It's sad for me that I'm also a big fan of that movie and I have to associate the two. <br /> <br /> The film itself managed to add some interesting realistic elements to the horror movie genre. A group of friends climbs a mountain, one of them inherited. On the mountain they face a family with a nightmarish secret. The film advances at a great pace. In fact, every time I've seen it, I'm still surprised to see that 45 minutes went by before things started going bad for the campers. <br /> <br /> While the Horror Classics version is full of loopholes, the fact that there is no score accompanying the horror scenes is what makes this film intelligent and even superior to the Most of the slasher movies I've seen. Director Jeff Lieberman had made some unique horror films before this one, which made it the most popular yet very different from the mainstream at the same time. It is a very funny movie with amazing acting performances. The new optimized DVD version is worth renting, the Horror Classics version now of the collectors item, now it's worth looking for the OOP.
