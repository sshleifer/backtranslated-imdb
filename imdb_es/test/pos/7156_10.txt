The most "spiritual" movie I've seen in a long time. maybe sometime also a scene around the dining room table, a piece of comical perfection. I understand that a release date is to come in the fall. If it's about your city and you want to see a movie that makes you think that's the case. Aviva is very good at that and certainly is a future star (Superbad is already where she is) and also all the actors seem to be perfectly calibrated. There is a tone set by this movie that is used to surprise. I would not know what to call it, it's a comedy, but the underlying message is so fierce and direct that "comedy" is not a word big enough to say. I love this movie. It is the comedy of a thinking man. But even that phrase is not good enough. FTF has a message and that message must be heard at this time
