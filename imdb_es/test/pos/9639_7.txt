The good images of the ships and airplanes of the World War I complement this excellent war drama set in the Adriatic. Walter Huston is excellent as the commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings. The safety of the ship and the mission should always come first. Robert Montgomery is the lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role a leader must play in combat. He makes bad decisions, endangers the submarine and its crew, but finally becomes a "real man" after being tried and fired from the Navy. Robert Young plays a first-degree lieutenant and Jimmy Durante as a chef. Parallel to the war drama there is an equally important wartime love triangle between Montgomery and Madge Evans, who plays the daughter of Huston and the wife of a tragically wounded aviator. Recommended.
