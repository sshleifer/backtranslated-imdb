A horror story is fine. But maybe not as you know. The real monsters in this movie are humans. While the monsters are human and prey. Oddly enough, I see this as "Monsters Inc" for fans of horror movies. <br /> <br /> Sure, the effects are from a std horror movie, the monsters are there as in any monster-based movie, the gore is also there, there's even a slasher with the shape of Dr. Decker ( played by David Cronenberg, I see the flash of Cillian Murphy when Dr. Jonathan Crane in Batman starts here, or is it the other way around?). And it's Decker & c who are the bad guys. The monsters mainly want to deal with their own affairs, keeping the intrusive humans more or less wrong, wanting to join society. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you really like pretty small monsters (and the dog) - maybe not what you expected from the first scenes ...
