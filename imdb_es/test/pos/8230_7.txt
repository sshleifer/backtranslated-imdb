I'm a fan of Randolph Scott Westerns. While some of them are incredibly clich√© (as are most Westerners of this era), their easy delivery and style really elevate the films to a classic and almost classical state. While this film presents another example of how real-life western heroes are exploited after his death by Hollywood (in this case, Bat Masterson), the film works well because of him, as well as excellent supporting characters. One of them is the always strong performance of Robert Ryan, an excellent actor who unfortunately has forgotten today. The other is the ubiquitous Gabby Hayes, who has one of his best roles as the crisp and colorful deputy. Here he is more pleasant than in his many supporting roles for Roy Rogers and John Wayne, mainly because his part is better written and he is given more to do. <br /> <br /> The plot is practically the plot of half the westerns ever made. There are some bad guys who hire a group of thugs to run over the locals and it's up to a good (Scott) to restore peace and kill the villains. However, the way in which the plot is executed is much better than the average and, due to this, the film is still very entertaining. Do not expect much innovation or uniqueness, unless you want to see what could be the best performance of Gabby Hayes.
