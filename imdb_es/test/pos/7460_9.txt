I agree with the previous posters that the characters were exceptionally strong and credible and that all the actors were in their best shape. Especially I loved David Boreanaz, who stretched out in a role so different from everything he played, proving once again his incredible gift for comedy. The first part of the film was light and funny, the blackmail part was a bit surreal but interesting, and everything went downhill from there. <br /> <br /> I found it frustrating that at least two of the 3 girls (Keira and Lisa) are freed from blackmail and betrayal, leaving no trace in their psyche. I know that the film modified the darkest end of the play, and I'm not saying that I missed the murder part. But surely I needed to see those two get their deserved somehow and I was moaning in frustration at the end. (That's why I gave him only 9) <br /> <br /> But definitely an interesting movie.
