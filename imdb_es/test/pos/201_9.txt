A true masterpiece of Soviet cinematography. It is a pity for the Soviet Union that Samojlova has never been given the opportunity to play in Western films, but, again, he would probably never be there. In "Letyat Zhuravli", she is unforgettable. This was one of the few movies I cried about ... <br /> <br /> Besides Samojlova, Batalov and Merkurjev, who are top-notch, it was a brilliant job of the director and the operator what did this. Film and classics of all time around the world. Just remember the scenes of piano music and the proposal under the intense German bombing, or the death of Boris with a sky spiraling over his head and his last visions appeared blurred in those skies. The very simple means, but the great technique added to the emotional weight ... Of course, 20 years before "The Star Wars", 41 years before "Titanic", and with a Soviet budget.
