This is the best there is. <br /> <br /> These are six episodes that trace (briefly) what life might have been like when dinosaurs dominated the earth. Made in the style of a documentary about nature, this program eliminates the talking heads. Instead, it only gives us the good with the dinosaurs that try to survive. <br /> <br /> Certainly, this is not a true documentary, since nothing of what to see on the screen can be witnessed with any certainty, but it is a better guess and an entertaining one. Here is a show that gives life to dinosaurs in a realistic way that does not imply that they eat people. This is a program that should be shown to any child who loves dinosaurs, as it will instill the OH WOW factor to go out and discover more. It will also entertain everyone, and you. <br /> <br /> See this. If you like shows with animals, nature or science or Disney's True Life Adventures (except no one really dies) or just a good trip to some other place, get a copy. Your brain will thank you.
