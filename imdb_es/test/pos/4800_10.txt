Nazarin is a kind of saint, he wants to live in life exactly as Christ taught him to do to man. But it is too late: now the Catholic Church is in the hands of a wealthy bourgeoisie, the bishops live in luxury and do not give a damn for the poor and the sick. That is why our hero can not follow the path that his hierarchy asks him to follow. So he empties himself of everything, and on his way to purity, he is joined by a kind of Mary Magdelene and a woman. who is attracted to him sexually (the scene between this girl and her fiancé says it). In Spain (they were the end of the fifties), they thought that Nazarin was a Christian film. Knowing Luis Bunuel, it was frankly incongruous: all his work is anticlerical. to a fault. Comparing Nazarin and his "holy women" to Jesus is nonsense. On the road to Nazarin, only brambles and grasses grow. His attempt to help the workers on the road is a failure, they persecute him as a strike breaker. All his words do not amount to anything. At the end of the trip, he was arrested and offered him a pi. Neapple by a woman (sexual symbol of Bunuelian). Thanks to "Nazarín", Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where the censors had no idea) and direct "Viridiana".
