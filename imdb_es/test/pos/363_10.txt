This movie was fabulous. It is definitely one of the 5 best hitchcock movies. The direction and shots of the camera are almost impeccable (apart from the scene of the dog when he licks the boys' hand, clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very credible that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that. <br /> <br /> I would rate Bruno as the second most interesting character in Hitchcock (of course, Bates is the first). Robert Walker plays a very credible maniac. He did not overshadow the part that made him credible (in the same way that Perkins did not overdo his part). In general, this is an excellent movie, a must for all hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
