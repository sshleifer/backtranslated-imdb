This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where you saw the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or pinning Ben's hands on the wall. However, the same can not be said for girls. In the end too, you see Taylor disappear while walking. It seems that the message was "There was no Taylor". And the whole movie was a product of Ben's imagination. Also, there was no scene during the torture moments in which any of the girls faces or is in the same frame as Ben. It was Taylor all the time. But in reality, Taylor was Ben. If they were two different people, why was not there a scene that showed them both in a single painting during the horrible times? But, of course, before that, they see the two of them together and THAT is simply Ben's imagination in action. Also, when Ben was out of prison, the text on the screen clearly says that Ben's story was unrealistic and that there was no place like the one he had explained (he read mine, cars, etc.) Even after that Liz Hunter leaves Kristy and returns to Find Ben, she can not find him. Why??? Because Ben (Taylor) was looking for the girls. In contrast, Kristy has all the time in the world to see Taylor's webcam (Ben), photos, etc. <br /> <br /> Somehow, it all comes down to one fact that Kristy and Liz both knew that Taylor was Ben. So, my conclusion is that Ben was schizophrenic and that the film where he and Taylor are seen in a single painting was nothing more than a product of his imagination. Otherwise, if there really was a Taylor, they should have discovered it given all of Ben's detailed explanations.
