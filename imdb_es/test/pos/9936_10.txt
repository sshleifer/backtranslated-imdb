"Opera" is a great movie with wonderful and imaginative images. An opera singer (Cristina Marsillach) is being stalked by a murderer who forces her to see him kill all those he knows by tying her and sticking needles under her eyes. This idea of ​​needles comes from the fact that Argento does not like it when people cover their eyes while watching their movies. "For years it bothered me that people covered their eyes during the saddest moments of my films, I filmed these images because I want people to see them and not avoid positive confrontation of their fears looking the other way, so I thought for myself Same: 'How would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to observe the most frightful murder and make sure they can not avoid it? Eyes?' The answer I found is the core of what "Opera" is about - says Argento. Much suspense, wonderful cinematography and brutal bloody murders A man is stabbed in the throat with a knife that causes a stream of blood Wounded, Daria Nicolodi is shot in the eye while he sucks through the peephole, etc. For any person who has not yet detected it, try it.
