I've never seen this in the theater, my second visit was tonight on a big screen DVD instead of the old VHS tape from the rental store. <br /> <br /> Saucey for the time being and I am sure that the Hayes code was pushed to its limits. <br /> <br /> Hitch's platform here is the "game" between two fighters. And yes, if Guy calls Bruno's police immediately, the movie is 63 minutes shorter, HELLO, people always choose the best option or the most logical one. How many times have you been in the place of any of the people and have you made the right decision? For the love of God it is called poetic license. However, as Guy sees the situation in which he finds himself, he is in charge of rectifying it. He does not ask for help or lie to his new wife. His defense of him sets off the final show with Bruno feeling that he has one more card to play. <br /> <br /> For the policeman who shoots an innocent person in the days leading up to the camera and before the rules of engagement, this kind of thing happened. In the world after Rodney King, a presidential candidate backed the police by sending 43 bullets to an unarmed man. If you have not seen or witnessed outrageous police behavior in your blind or have an application pending for the academy. <br /> <br /> Go back to the movie ... <br /> <br /> Go see it. Try using a post WWII filter and pretend that you see a great thriller like so many did for the first time back then, and it sure has been copied since then, but you're looking for one of the sources of inspiration for many of the following.
