This is the best version of Gypsy that has been filmed. Bette Midler is simply excellent as Mama Rose. She has the voice, the gestures, the appearance and, above all, a supreme acting capacity to take the paper and make it. The character comes alive. His singing is, simply: SUPERB! She shines especially in two numbers: "Everything's Coming Up Roses" and "Rose's Turn". The other actors are also fine, particularly Christine Ebersoll as Tessie. Peter Riegert is also good; Her interpretation of Herbie is interpreted with great style and credibility. The direction of this movie is very, very good. There is no fake note or Gaffe in the entire production. This film is a big improvement over the Roz Russell version filmed in 1962. Since I saw it again, I can say that the three best Mama Roses are: Ethel Merman, Bette Midler and Angela Lansbury. Watch this movie You'll be glad you did.
