This is an exceptional photo with so much to recommend. The acting and writing are spectacular and there are many twists and turns in the plot. Like a French movie of "Noir," their language is certainly much more earthly than their American counterparts, but for me this adds to realism. Also, I liked the lack of glamor of everyone, especially the husband and the lieutenant. About the only negative aspect, and the reason why the film gets a 9 and not a 10, is because there was a dazzling plot hole. Like another famous French film, Dr√¥le de Drame, the confusion between the police and the accused could have been easily solved at first, but the characters made rather stupid decisions. For this, you just have to suspend disbelief and keep watching: the reward is well worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> This is simply one of the best French films I've seen. Period.
