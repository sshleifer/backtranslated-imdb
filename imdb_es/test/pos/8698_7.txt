A few years ago, while renting some movies, I came across subspecies 4, I finished watching it and, actually, I liked it, we need a good film of Gothic blood that does not stop. But when I went back to the video store, they said they did not have other subspecies videos, unfortunately, the same thing happened with any other video store that I verified. I gave up, until someone on YouTube actually published all the subspecies movies and I could see them all last night and I'm hooked. Now I'm a fan of the Full Moon Subspecies series. I think because this was the kind of horror movie I've been looking for, I've been looking for a good cheesy scare for a long time and subspecies filled that place. Radu is one of the coolest vampires on the screen and almost makes Nosferatu run down his fangs! <br /> <br /> Radu is an evil vampire who is behind his bloodstone, his birth rite, the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives him strength. Three American girls who study Romanian history and culture meet a man, Stephan, who offers help. They stay at Radu Castle, where we discover that Stephan is Radu's brother; Radu seduces and converts two of the girls, but Stephan falls in love with one of the girls, Michelle, and will do anything to protect her. <br /> <br /> The subspecies is a fun series, despite the cheesy effects, it makes it Somehow more enjoyable. In addition, Radu was a perfect villain, since Stephan was the perfect angel as a romantic vampire. The story is chilling and I think this was a fun vampire movie. This was also the first of the series, the best part is that the sequels are just as fun. I would recommend this for a terrifying movie night, see it in the dark, Radu is sure to send chills down your spine, or even your neck ... Ok, cheesy joke, I could not resist. <br /> <br /> 7/10
