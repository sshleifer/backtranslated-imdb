After hooking up to the mini-series, "North and South," I could hardly wait for the continuation, "North and South II." Then, years later, Book III appeared, "HEAVEN AND HELL - NORTH AND SOUTH - BOOK III". FINALLY, the last installment came for the ongoing saga of the Maine and Hazard families. This series captivated me so much that I recorded every part of the television and then I got my family and friends to get hooked and I saw it again, every time someone new wanted to see them. My tapes are old and I want this trilogy on DVD. If you missed Book III, you did not get full satisfaction and you do not know how everything turned out. Do yourself a favor and demand this set on DVD!
