The man who knew too much (1956) is a remake of a film that Alfred Hitchcock made in England in 1934 with the same name. In my opinion, your last effort is much higher. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and that it does not have the tingling suspense of the original with Peter Lorre. In both films, the plot is essentially the same, except that the original is set in Switzerland and the remake in Marrakech. Tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on vacation with their young son and meeting a suspicious man, who is very curious about his past. As it happens, he is an agent looking for a partner involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader. Then, he is stabbed in a market in Marrakeck because he discovered that he is a spy and that he falls into Stewart's arms. When he dies, he tells him the whole story of the murder plot. Stewart and Day later discover that another couple they met was the couple the agent was looking for and has kidnapped their son. The film contains excellent performances by Stewart and Day, in a direct dramatic role, as concerned and frightened parents. This film showed that Doris Day could act in suspenseful dramas and in musicals without worries. The address of Alfred Hitchcock is top notch. The movie keeps him at the edge of his seat every minute. The scene in Albert Hall is a classic. The original is so slow and monotonous. I do not know how people can compare the two. Just look at the remake and enjoy it. I give the movie a 9 out of 10.
