I was a little scared when I went to the movies to watch this movie. In fact, it is always difficult to make a movie from a comic and the first episode of the adventures of the two great French heroes was good but not fantastic. Finally, it is very fun from start to finish with unexpected gags, some cartoon scenes, no waiting times, a great FX, a great cast, great landscapes, all great! <br /> <br /> However, I wonder how they will manage to translate all the French names in English or German, because it is certainly fun in French, but how will it be in another language?
