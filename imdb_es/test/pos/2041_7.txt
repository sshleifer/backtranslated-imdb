<br /> <br /> SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW <br /> <br /> Long Kiss Goodnight is another excellent example of a common affliction of many modern movies; begins with a very interesting concept: a trained killer whose memory was erased regains consciousness of itself, and the initial configuration is attractive, but then it seems that the writers do not know very well where to go next and everything goes down. Paths increasingly confusing and / or inane, leaving the disappointing taste of something that was good but that promised to be much better. The bad guys are notoriously inconspicuous, and even Jackson's comic turn is more like something from his days before Pulp Fiction; It seems that Harlin, as in Cutthroat Island, made every effort to make sure no one emphasized his then wife. Your character is by far the best in the movie and this fact only makes you feel even more frustrated by not being able to do something better with her. <br /> <br /> However, there is still something about this movie. which, for me, sets him apart from the Hollywood activist more than once and places him above the average, if only. It is something very subtle that I can not point out; It is a disturbing edge, cold, dark, even sickly, a sensation of nightmare and unreality, a decadent air, a middle vein that keeps appearing in various ways. It is in the dark reddish photography and in the almost permanent night in which the characters live, in the dreams of Samantha in front of the mirror, in her vicious eyes and smiling when she is about to kill a man or when she announces how she will enjoy seeing your enemy he dies with the listening of his daughter, he is in Mitch's comeback behind the wheel of a car while he spouts so much blood from his mouth that he can hardly speak ... I do not know, it's an atmosphere, something I can not define but what that gives me chills (a little) and makes this movie is still strangely strange to me.
