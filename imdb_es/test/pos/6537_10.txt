This movie made me cry. I must say that if I did not have a beautiful husband at home, I would ask this beautiful work of art to marry me. Aaron Carter offers a masterful performance as a confused young pop star, while Timothy Barton writes a quick and witty dialogue that only fosters the genius of Carter's performance. Kyle is quite gay, but his performance was nothing short of spectacular. He is also very handsome and cute. I'm thinking of inviting him to a date and giving him a sweet gift of good night.;) <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about this movie in the future, contact me. <br /> <br /> Nick Burrell Vassar Class of 2012 Malibu, California Malibu West 310 924 0126
