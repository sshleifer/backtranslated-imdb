I must say that every time I watch this film, I feel deeply moved, not only by the four most painful years of Hongsheng's life, but also by how his family faces his drug addiction. It is also true that becoming addicted to anything, such as drugs, alcohol or pornography, can not only hurt you, but also the most important people in the world: your family. Since the family is the number 1 priority in Asian culture, it takes guts for the circle to meet and show a person how much the family loves it. This is actually the first Chinese movie that I enjoy, not for the fun of it, but the elements that surround it (excellent acting, moving story, great direction) make it worth seeing this movie. What stands out most is that Hongsheng and his family represent the story themselves rather than that some B-movie actor tries to imitate the real person. Show the authenticity of the movie
