Martino, a young teacher on the island of Elba, has been trained by Maestro Fontanelli, an excellent educator, to be his own man and say what he thinks, something that gets him into trouble at the school where we first meet him because He is teaching revolutionary ideals. The island is in a frenzy due to the arrival of one of the most influential men in 19th century European history. Napoleon is coming to his exile, it is not exactly an important moment in his life. <br /> <br /> With surprise, Martino is chosen to accompany Napoleon, who is writing his memoirs and needs help for his own project. The young man comes from a sea merchant family. His brother and sister want him to go on a commercial expedition, but Martino has decided that his place belongs to Elba because he will try to assassinate Napoleon. Little dissuades him after his mentor, Fontanelli, is tried for treason and sentenced to be shot by firing squad. <br /> <br /> Martino finds his consolation with the much older Baroness Emilia, a beautiful woman. In his own interaction with the deposed emperor, a different type of man emerges. Napoleon is seen as a more human person who really enjoys the company of Martino, without suspecting the plans that the young man plans for him. Unfortunately, Martino can not put his design into action because Napoleon has other plans in mind. <br /> <br /> Paolo Virzi, the director of "Caterina va in citta", shows why his early promise is still there. Mr. Virzi also collaborated with the script, which is based on a novel by Ernesto Ferrero. The director shows that he is as good at intimate drama as at this kind of show. Alessandro Pesci, the director of photography, does an excellent job with the images he was able to obtain. <br /> <br /> Elio Germano, a young Italian actor is the best of the film. He is playing against more experienced players, but he manages to convince us that he is the young idealist who tries to do justice to what he perceives as a noble cause. The great Daniel Auteuil is a Napoleon more tenuous than one might expect from the interpretation of any of this man greater than life. Monica Belucci is Martino's love interest, but she has little to do. Omero Antonutti plays Fontanelli.
