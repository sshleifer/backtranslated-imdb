William Wellmann, who directed one of the most exciting silent films ever made, 'Wings' (1927), returns to the skies with another heartbreaking story of daring aviators. Wellmann had been an ace of air in World War I, and nobody knew the biplanes like him. Here they are, tricks, accidents, explosions in the air, and everything you can imagine, plus a fascinating glimpse of commercial air operations in 1932 as well. And there is a good strong story, excellently played by the somber Richard Barthelmess (the silent star who made several films with D. W. Griffith), Sally Eilers and Tom Brown. Eilers is a true sizzler. What a relief to see a real woman with real fire and character instead of one of those botoxed phototechnical dolls that play in movies in Hollywood today and they all look the same. The story is sad, it is played with genuine pathos and is well directed. Towards the end of the film there are some extraordinarily exciting scenes of danger and rescue, and what must be the most ingenious blind landing in the thick fog ever thought of. I dare not reveal the ingenious aspects of that particular episode. The character played by Barthelmess is very similar to Wellmann himself, a true hallucinatory in the air. Anyone who likes early aviation would love this movie, and it is very rewarding for all those who enjoy good solid entertainment, love, tears and non-stop action, all combined in a kind of delicious Wellmann omelette.
