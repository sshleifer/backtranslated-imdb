The combination of amazing special effects and a performance worthy of Oscar make the Vindicator one of the most important science fiction films of recent years. For some reason still unknown to me, this gem was found in a container of gangue, so some worthless human thought it was okay to mess up a modern classic when interacting with a container of gangue. I've never been so terrified of a man with aluminum foil and random explosions of fire. Forget about Terminator, Robocop, Aliens and other films that started this masterpiece, the vindicator is an unstoppable force.
