I really can not criticize this movie. It is, literally, the first movie I remember seeing and that led me to a lifelong love for science fiction movies, horror and prehistoric animals. Fortunately, seeing it years later, it stayed pretty good. Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was destroyed by the mammoths. Nobody believes him, including his best friend, played by CÃ©sar Romero, whose brother was among the murdered. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was shot in India and has a good stage. The acting is at a high level. I do not think Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor have had a bad performance. Mammoths, when they finally arrive are quite effective. The ending also has an unusual twist, particularly for a science fiction movie of the 1950s. Definitely worth seeing.
