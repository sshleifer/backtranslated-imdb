I was about 14 years old when I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved both the movie and the songs that I went to the cinema several times to watch it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learned the songs by heart, just as I did with "The sound of Music" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics whose comments are published is that they do not have a romantic soul and did not see the film through the eyes of a young teenager. Maybe he is a fan of Ingrid Bergman but he was happy with Liv Ullman. Could Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What was so good about her? Maybe the critic did not appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses, since he sees a great resemblance between Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. The idea and the story behind the film, philosophy, was the most important and interesting factor, and a musical in color made it more entertaining and enjoyable without damaging the intellectually attractive aspects. It is a pity that many other movies with so-called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are absolutely boring in comparison.
