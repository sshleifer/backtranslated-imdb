Actually I found out about Favela Rising through the IMDb website. I have a particular interest in Afro-Brazilian culture and films. Favela Rising is one of those gems that gives a new meaning to human transformation. Beautifully documented and filmed by Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary, it is the story of Anderson Sa, a former drug trafficker from Rio de Janeiro who, after the death of family and friends, becomes a Christian, Malcolm X and Ghandi, all in one. Sa formed AfroReggae, a grassroots cultural movement that uses Afro-Brazilian hiphop, the percussion of capoeira and other forms of art to transform desperate and angry youth into vibrant, viable and caring people who love the community. <Br /> <br /> A few years ago I remember going to a screening of City of God (Cidade De Deus) and I left the theater completely numb. The images were grim but impressive and you could not take your eyes off the screen. I remember how desperate were some situations in the Favelas and how decadent was the society due to the negligence of governments. How the drug trade was a way of life, how indifferent were the citizens of the slums because death was something that happened every day. Like City Of God, Anderson Sa talks about how people in the favelas were also insensitive. He talks about police corruption and how the communities were so immobilized by drugs and gangs that relatives could not be visited in other Favelas that should be in a neutral place. Unlike the grassroots movement of the City of God, Anderson Sa, AfroReggae provides solutions to anger, to despair. <br /> <br /> There was a part in the documentary where Anderson, in the spirit of a preacher, approached some young people and asked them to join. AfroReggae These jaded youngsters were so marked by everyday survival and violence. Their role models were the drug dealers and this is what they aspired to be. Anderson said then that drug dealers do not live long. Of course, there was reluctance, but five months later he was able to get some of the young people to join AfroReggae. <br /> <br /> The images in Favela Rising are incredible. For me it is clear that Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary are not only great storytellers, but also visual artists. This is a documentary that must be seen! There are some truly magical and transforming moments in this documentary. I do not want to spoil them for you. I want you to see it for yourself. Please tell your friends, academics, youth counselors, family members about this wonderful movie. It will make you worry about the world and our children. <br /> <br /> I would give it eleven stars!
