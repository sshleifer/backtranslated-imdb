I went to see this movie with one of my friends, who do not like the movies of theft. But she enjoyed it. I missed fragments of the movie. It's a story about Edward Norton and a team that steals some gold, and Norton decides he wants it all for himself. Then the people who betrayed want to go back with him. It's a well-organized, intelligent, fun and action-packed film that I need to see again ... all the way. One of my best summer movies so far. <br /> <br /> A big help for the entertainment factor is Seth Green. I do not know anyone who does not like Seth Green, and he adds flavor. He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roommate stole it. He is a computer genius who is a marvel to see. <br /> <br /> He told himself that Norton did not want to make this movie ... but if I were him, I would have liked to log in. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that it is very predictable. Any fan of the movie should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint with the movie is that Eddie Nortons chose facial hair. The thick, but thin mustache, and a small pike on his chin ... looks like an 80s porn star, for God's sake.
