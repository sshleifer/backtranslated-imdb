Despite its age, this film retains its undoubted charm and attraction, and is a good example, survivor, of the old British cinema. It has an underlying air of strangeness, interspersed with axes of humor that are not out of place, and serves to demonstrate the direction assured and the production values ​​involved. So many episodic films are disjointed and disorganized, but this is not one of them. The acting standard helps a lot, and the different disparate characters are interesting and credible. In short, this little forgotten gem deserves the attention of anyone, despite the discordant note in the film that, surprisingly, escaped the attention of the censor!
