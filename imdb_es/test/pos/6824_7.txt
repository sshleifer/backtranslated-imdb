The problem with the film is quite simple, Conrad's prose is powerfully verbose and can not be adapted to a movie. Marlow's narrative in the novel captivates you from the first sentence and you only "see" what Conrad writes. In the film, it's different, you see the visual, but the description and reflection that the novel really does, is terribly absent. But to the extent that a non-adaptable book has been adapted, it is of a good level. There are exactly the same scenes, which are identified with quite a genius, but never have the same effect as in the novel. The plot in the movie has been improved and works very well to make it more interesting. The references to ancient Egypt were carefully inserted. My advice, read the book and keep it that way, there are better movies out there.
