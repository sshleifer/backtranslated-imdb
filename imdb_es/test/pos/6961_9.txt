If there is a theme of this film, it is that people can face difficulties by having a good imagination. This family is poor, his father works in the cemetery and his mother works double shift, and Peter is constantly chosen for a variety of reasons, and he feels increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl. He is just beginning to approach that age of 10 or 11 years where his perceptions begin to change, and he thinks that his appearance begins to matter. The backdrop to this story is the 1967 World Fair and the Centennial of Canada. The best moments of the film come during the various fantasy sequences where we see how they manage. Look at the flim, and if you've ever had a childhood friend with whom you dreamed, and then, for some reason, lost, you will really like this movie. Children may like this movie, but only adults will really appreciate it, including its references to the Bolsheviks and what parents will do for their children.
