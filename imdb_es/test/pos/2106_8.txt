I just returned to visit this little remembered moment of cinematic madness from my first days, and I must urge you to beg that you steal it or borrow it. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a duel between a fair Shaolin priest and our villain. Abbot White, needless to say, Abbot White kicks in the Buddhist ass, and pounds his campaign against Shaolin unhindered with the help of his new ninja allies (a golden dress that fights with a gold ring, a black dress He struggles with a spear, and my favorite, one who struggles with a pair of knives that can disappear and reappear like a flying carpet.The rest of the story is about the training of the disciples of the Shaolin monks killed by Abbot White, one of which is Alexander Lo Rei. While we are accustomed to the harsh training sequences that the two young avengers must go through to learn the Shaolin Finger Jab technique necessary to defeat the invincible armor technique of Abbot White, we see some of the ways in which our villain keeps fit ... mainly using Taoist magic To extract the blood of naked women We all know how this will end, but we are here for the psychedelic trip between the two. In conclusion, this is a good example of what Taiwan was doing when Hong Kong was getting tired of martial arts films, and that is making more and more outrageous martial arts movies. This film is very well choreographed, it has some nudity, something bloody and enough balls for the wall to entertain, even to entertain the most jaded spectator.
