Centers in the Czech pilots of WW2? the old Frantisek, the youthful and impulsive Karel and, in the background, the silent piano that touches Honza. When the film begins, it is 1950, the war is over and Frantisek and Honza are imprisoned in an old monastery. In their native country, now controlled by the Soviets, they are "enemies of the people". Honza is severely mistreated by his countrymen and dies. <br /> <br /> In 1939, many pilots manage to escape from the Europe occupied by the Germans and go to England, where they join the RAF. Despite their high motivation and experience, they face the reticence of the RAF and the rigid upper lip of Britain. Finally they fight gallantly in the battle of Great Britain. However, Frantisek and Karel find their friendship severely tested when both fall in love with the same woman. <br /> <br /> In terms of romantic subplot, this is very similar to the Hollywood Pearl Harbor production. However, given the context of the film and the final fate of Frantisek, it is also possible to read the English woman's treatment of the two men as a symbol of the British treatment of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots: conveniently forgetting them once end the war. br /> <br /> In addition, the film is much less clich√© than Pearl Harbor and the characters are more realized. Dark Blue World also features its impressive aerial air fights, created to perfection with a mix of models, live aerial filming and departures from the 1969 epic Battle of Britain. <br /> <br /> In summary, Dark Blue World is a well-made, moving, stimulating and exciting drama that embarrasses people like Pearl Harbor. Highly recommended
