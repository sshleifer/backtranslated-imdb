(WARNING: SPOILERS!) <br /> <br /> Five young men ignore the warnings of Ranger George Kennedy and walk into the hazy Oregon mountains, where they are harassed and killed by a pair of huge, deformed, twin servants from Hillbilly. When there are only two left, Warren and his girl, Connie, turn to their animal instincts to stay alive. The movie ends with Connie pushing her half of her arm down one of the killers' throats, choking him. A very powerful, if slightly overrated, slasher backwoods movie that is an effective use of lighting, sound and photography make it a cut above the usual cash entry of FRIDAY 13. Directed by an attractive cast and sympathetic, especially Deborah Benson (where is he now?) and Gregg Henry, this ingenious piece of accompaniment for SQUIRM (1976) and BLUE SUNSHINE (1977) by director Jeff Lieberman should not be missed.
