I am surprised with the amount of negative reviews in this movie. If you do not like this movie for what it is, a silly and exaggerated mafia story, then you're just reading it too much. This film is a classic tale of a mafia woman trying to escape "life" and the problems that follow it. Michelle Pfeiffer is an excellent shirt from the 80s, which is an uncomfortable and uncomfortable mafia wife, while Matthew Modine is a mafia tracking cop who falls in love with her. The plot is mostly predictable and monotonous and Mercedes Ruel steals the show as the Queen of Mafia wives. If you're not looking for something too dynamic and complex, this movie is absolutely entertaining and a cult classic from the 80s. You can not stop looking if you start.
