The young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are outstanding in this excellent film about two children who have promised to "take care of their mother" and how they face when their new stepfather starts hitting the younger child. The cast of support around the boys is top notch as well. The script really enters the mind and heart of an imaginative child. It's hard to believe that Wood can grow up to look like Tom Hanks, but that's nothing new in Hollywood. Honestly, that's my only criticism of the movie.
