This is the only Pauly Shore movie you should see. O.K., is the only one I've seen, and I think I've made good decisions. Normally it seems to me that Shore is a bit tired, but he is very funny in this movie. Actually, the script is pretty funny, and Shore does not overwhelm the other actors with his ... what do you call it? Antics? Anyway, this is a funny movie, although ultimately, forgettable. --Frink-3
