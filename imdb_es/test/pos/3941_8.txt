are you crazy or what? This movie has talent. Who are you to criticize a film made by famous directors and producers? I mean, you should be watching a crappy version because if you had a suitable version, you would not think it was a low-resolution graphics game. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people who enjoy Hong Kong cinema. what Asians enjoy watching ... you are so complete ... Hong Kong cinema is totally different from Hollywood cinema, Hong Kong cinema belongs to a class of its own ... <br /> <br /> so If you do not enjoy watching movies from Hong Kong producers, do not go and ramble about how it is a waste of time to see them. Just let other people enjoy the movie ... <br /> <br /> and I personally have seen this movie and I love its history and the way it was made.
