An amazing movie I was paralyzed all the time and so emotionally overcome at the end! The two young male actors in the film were more than convincing in their interpretation, since their friendship and support among them was quite credible and I thought that the comparison / contrast between their respective lives at home and health situations became very real among them. The success in giving life to this film was obviously a team effort for actors, EP, producers, writers, directors and all the production that I say, "WELL PLAY!" Having lost the credits at the beginning of the movie (it was showing on HBO), I was so surprised that I had to investigate (albeit briefly) the Internet to find the title of this movie, something so great. It should have been known to me, a clear indication that this movie should be reissued.
