Being a child of the 90s, I really enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it in a big way and even more than the classic WB cartoons. <br /> <br /> I do not know why; The cartoons of the early 90s had something special; I do not know if it was the atmosphere of uncertainty, a generational change, whatever. But "Tiny Toons" kept the atmosphere of the 90s and delivered one of the most popular, fun and least valued cartoons ever created. <br /> <br /> Memories are murky, but I can only say that I enjoyed every episode and product. Related to the show. Easily, no other caricature made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark comedies aimed at teenagers). <br /> <br /> All the characters were fun and had the peculiarity of not having a real main character. Each character was hilarious and deserved to be called a protagonist.
