As you can see in the few comments posted here, mine may be the last one you see, unless there is a great DVD release or TCM play it again. - This is a "Our Gang" type movie with a group of different children. MGM was certainly the musical studio: if the musicians, dancers and singers were not under contract, they were available. Heifetz was one of the most expensive ... he does it for a small charity job! The quota that he received at that time was unprecedented. Another musical film with Jos√© Iturbi (Mexican pianist) presented about 100 children playing a simple melody on 100 pianos ... so the skeptics who think that young children are not musicians are wrong: I was one. <br /> <br /> As everyone writes, "Frankie Smith", good American name, (Gene Reynolds) was the bad guy but good that is taken from the streets by the owners of a music school. Can you believe that Walter Brennan ("Prof. Lawson") of all those western movies was the man who ran the school? Joel McCrea ("Peter McCarthy") and Andrea Leeds ("Ann Lawson") were the biggest stars in "They Shall Have Music", with a series of well-known extras (many of which continued to become stars themselves. ). As others have commented, almost all the children of the orchestra (actually, The Meremblum Symphony of Los Angeles) had great successes in their lives, either as musicians (for studies) or other businesses. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are not many youth orchestras today, a sad mistake. Parents with children at school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads above water, and many do not even know what is happening to children at school. Music instruction can be expensive, and almost everyone would prefer to have a football team ... <br /> <br /> This is the cheapest Jascha Heifetz concert you've ever heard and is contained in this movie. .... in those days, a quarter. His game is brilliant, even if he seems to prefer to be somewhere else ... without emotion. By contract, any concert of Yo-Yo Ma is so happy that it makes you want to run and buy a cello ... this boy is having a good time ... like the children in the "street" concert, when they cheated Heifetz to play at his school. <br /> <br /> All the orchestral numbers were played by "the children", and they make it sound easy. I love this kind of film: its arguments are so simple, it does not take you two days to discover if you enjoyed or understood the movie, at all. We need some new films like this: we can not do anything other than inspire younger children to play other instruments besides guitars ... Bravo!
