ALICE is the kind of movie they made in the 30s and 40s. It never tries to be an "event". He just wants to entertain. And he does it I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland. In a paper that could be a clich√©, it made it real. The plot makes allusions to ALICE IN WONDERLAND. A man dressed in white goes through a hole and Kiefer drops one. Like ALICE, the plot turns and spins, but with a freshness that is not seen in small movies. I loved the address, Sutherland, just a very fast and interesting movie.
