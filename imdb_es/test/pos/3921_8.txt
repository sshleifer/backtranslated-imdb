I must admit that, before watching House of Wax, I assumed that it would simply be a second-class movie for teenagers that follows in the footsteps of films like The Darkness or Amityville Horror. After watching an advanced show on my university campus, I can honestly say that the people at Dark Castle have done an excellent job with the task of making a slasher. <br /> <br /> Beginning with the usual basics of a horror movie for teenagers, like the small group of friends who set out on a road trip, they encounter a strange detour that takes them through rural roads , they meet spooky people, after a slow but obligatory background story this movie really hits a quick clip. Paris Hilton appears in this film as many already know, but I really have to give it to her for her great performance. Clearly, his performance was not worth an Oscar, but the filmmakers use their appearance to the fullest by squeezing two flagrant satires of her, say, a less noble appearance of the media in this film. Ms. Hilton also claims the title of the best death scene in the movie, and not simply because it was her death scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is filled to the brim with hectic moments and cheap scares, but Jaume Serra has definitely created suspense of quality and tension between the characters. The causes of the horror are based in part on making the audience deal with the characters, what we do. When doing the usual accumulation followed with a loud noise and shook the camera some other moments of fear. These standard film techniques adopted from many past films are almost perfected with this film and provide many scars. In fact, there is not a slow moment after arriving in the small town where the dreaded House of Wax museum is located. <br /> <br /> This movie owes much to many previous films of this and other genres, although I'm not quite sure how much it came from the original 1953 movie of the same title. References to movies like Texas Chainsaw Masacres, Saw and even Titanic (see the scene of the great death of Paris Hilton and you'll know what I mean) are common, but in the end the reward will leave you scared and satisfied if you do. Looking for a good scare with a few laughs. Not bad.
