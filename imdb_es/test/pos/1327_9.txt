I heard that after the first movie of the Oceans, the sequels begin to go downhill. I think this is not the case (at least not for this movie). This movie is even better than the first movie! The original team returns three years after they successfully stole the Terry Benedict casinos. Now, Benedict is visiting each of them personally, telling them to recover the money within two weeks. To do that, they must make a couple of robberies in Europe to get the money. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. The cast of stars exceeded expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some confusing moments in this movie. But that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments. Anyway, this movie is only made for harmless fun. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great movie of theft. I rate this movie 9/10.
