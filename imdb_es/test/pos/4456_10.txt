If you are one of those people who think that Lucio Fulci has to do with gore, guts and zombies, you have to see this (and "The Psychic" too, for that matter). Although the film includes some brutal scenes of violence and a disturbing theme, it is not the main thing here. This is a really impressive murder mystery, directed by characters and characters, which could well be the director's masterpiece. Here, he demonstrates that he is a true craftsman, creating a memorable, disturbing but surprisingly beautiful masterpiece, full of creepy Catholic images and interesting social commentary. It also has a great cast, which includes the beautiful Barbara Bouchet, as well as Tomas Millan (by Beatrice Cenci) and Irene Pappas in a small but important role. However, it is the Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan (who also looked at the strange "Lizard in the skin of a woman" by Fulci) who steals the scene in the role of Majara, giving an excellent interpretation of a woman crazy for her superstitions and her vicious murder. The scene is particularly heartbreaking. The second star of the film is the cinematography of Sergio D'Ofizi, who, along with the melancholic score Morricone-esquire by Riz Ortolani, helps to give life to the environment "Italian village isolated with a dark secret". I must admit that I thought that the fictitious head that struck the rocks snatched me, but nevertheless, this is a classic of the ultimate Italian terror: a work of touching genius, sad and, ultimately, thought provoking. 10/10 for me If you liked this, I recommend that you see "Alice, Sweet Alice" by Alfred Sole, since they are similar and are underestimated gems.
