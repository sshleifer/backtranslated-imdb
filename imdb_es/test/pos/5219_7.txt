I do not like boxing, I do not understand the attraction. I liked this movie. Positive representations of Latinos, without drugs, sex or street violence. The plot actually showed stable and loving families. The fight sequences are violent, like boxing, but not as exaggerated as the Rocky movies. There is nothing wrong with trying familiar themes with a different angle and ethnicity. It is a good rental.
