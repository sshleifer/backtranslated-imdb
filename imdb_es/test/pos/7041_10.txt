I love meatballs! Fantastic characters and moving situations make him very loved. Bill Murray is hysterical and in the end you're going to love that 4-mile race. A total classic and one of my favorites for about 20 years. Brings good memories of the camp and treats very well the experience of being rejected by silly companions and the empowerment that is obtained by being rescued by a caring adult. Tons of excellent phrases and a wide variety of crazy counselors. This is the kind of movie in which key phrases are repeated among friends for years. Also, nothing overtly rude and what a sweet soundtrack of the late 70s to cause just nostalgia. I can not say enough about the meatballs; it's a classic. Be forewarned! All the aftermaths are stinky bombs that simply bought the name rights for marketing. They have no connection to Ivan Reitman's masterpiece.
