This movie is funny and quite sad, I think it's true. If you love Office Space, then you'll love this movie because it's another Mike Judge hit, but it does not look like Office Space at all. I told everyone to watch this movie. I only wish it had been in more theaters so that I would have obtained the recognition I deserved. I love this movie and would love to see more of Mike Judge. Luke Wilson is also what makes this movie what it is. I am very happy not to be alive in the year 2505, because if this movie turns out to be true, we will all have many problems. I just hope more people see this movie because I know they will also fall in love with it.
