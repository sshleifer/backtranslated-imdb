I have to admit that I loved this movie. Of course, I'm sure you know that the star of "Malcolm's in the Middle", Frankie Muniz, and the always so sweet Amanda Bynes "The Amanda Show" starred in this children's comedy as two friends that I'm sure we can all go back to watch. - late for. The film is about a guy who Jason Shepard (Frankie) and his friend Kaylee (Amanda) are going on an adventure in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> When it starts, Jason is a typical 14-year-old boy who finds it easy to solve the problems of everyday life. One day Jason is hit by Mr. Wolf (the great bad director). Jason's English newspaper is stolen by Wolf and the adventure begins with Kaylee to gain the trust of his father. They fly to Hollywood in search of Wolf to recover it. Frankie and Amanda do all kinds of crazy things to get Wolf back, and all he has to do is call Jason's father and tell him he stole the idea. But the end is not a real surprise, be good proveles and triumphs. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and she is delighted with the fifth grade, but what do you expect her to be described as PG? I really believe that this is one of the best family comedies of the years. Not only are the children acting well, the exceptional cast is well written, but it is good fun. He made me laugh and fall in love with his innocent message. I highly recommend it and would like to disagree with that person who gave him a zero out of ten. The unemployed critic is not unemployed at all. I give it (well I've voted ten out of ten) a perfect one.
