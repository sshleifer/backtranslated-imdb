Double Shock is one of the many good episodes of Columbo that reaches the level of a good movie. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements we like in the episodes of Columbo. We laugh when Columbo does something awkward, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee you'll laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode. <br /> <br /> We also get the riddle as always with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murders worries Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is another good episode of Columbo, and I'll qualify it as 7/10. It's about 8/10. <br /> <br /> "Just one more question": The performance? Peter Falk is very good as always.
