there is one of the best films directed by andrzej wajda, that story told about the young writer who is looking for his place after a second war (he survived the German camp). Excellent true atmosphere (action in the camp for the displaced), main hero (played by one of the best Polish actors, Daniel Olbrychski) finally falls in love, but unfortunately his lady has been murdered. There was a beautiful scene, when he talks to an American soldier and says (about his girl's death) "it's okay, you're just shooting us now ... your soul condition has been destroyed.
