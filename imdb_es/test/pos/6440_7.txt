In 1850, in Yorkshire, a crazy boy is falsely accused of theft by his crooked teacher and flees. He falls into a treacherous local river and is transported to an underwater kingdom, where he makes many friends and rescues the legendary water babies of an evil shark. <br /> <br /> Based on a book by Charles Kingsley, this is a lovely children's film, half live action and half animation, which is a grim and evocative depiction of the Victorian era and a tremendously enjoyable underwater adventure . They really are two films in one, that somehow complement and combine in a much richer whole. The animation of Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is wonderful, as is the photography of Ted Scaife and the music of Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has a great quality of rough diamonds like the (literal) fish that comes out of the water. I love the moment he is at the top of the mansion, he sees all the chimneys and he shouts "Blimey !!" at the top of his voice. Mason and Cribbins are the dirtiest and most nasty thugs you could expect to see in a costume drama (if you want to see the true Victorian values, do not look at Sense And Sensibility, look at this), and Whitelaw, Pertwee (who makes innumerable voices) and Percival They are all excellent. This is what a good movie for children should be like: the fun of yesteryear, but also a bit thoughtful, sad and terrifying. High Cockallorum !!
