It has aged really well, it's still exciting and full of suspense today. Without doubt one of the best films of Hitch. Beautifully filmed, with a great premise for suspense, the sexual attractiveness provided by the beautiful Ruth Roman. Because of the great premise, you feel you have to see it to the end. If you find yourself losing faith in Hitch and doubting your title as Master of Suspense, I recommend this cute little movie as an antidote. 5 out of 5
