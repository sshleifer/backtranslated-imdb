I really liked that movie! Since I do not want to reveal much, it is basically a mother and a daughter and the life they have together. It is a very moving story, among the struggles they have. I also believe that Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry throughout the whole movie! This is definitely worth seeing! Two thumbs up, very high!
