A very good Australian movie. It beautifully recreates the appearance of Sydney as it was in the 1950s. This film impressed me a lot when I first saw it during its initial release at the cinema and it still remains very well. Phil Noyce did an excellent job of directing, a wonderful camera work, careful lighting and some good performances in all areas. An absolute "must see" for any Australian film student of the 70s. One out of the box!
