I agree with all the comments mentioned above. This show was a delight to watch. Fun, witty, cool and crazy performances. It is always exciting to find a program that is written intelligently, that assumes that the audience has intelligence and shows a subtle humor. I would spend good and hard earned cash to watch it again on DVD. And as long as we are requesting an intelligent series that never had a chance ... What about the DVD releases of Maximum Bob (another well-written and strange duck show with a delightful cast of characters)? And add to the list ... Middle Ages or Frank's place. There is a way to launch these programs out of the vaults and into the hands of devout fans and new audiences.
