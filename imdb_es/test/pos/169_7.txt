This movie is great Film slasher of the 80s on three children born during an eclipse, so they kill everyone they see. The reason why they kill does not make any sense, but adds to the charm of this movie. And damn, these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you've seen the movie, you know who I'm talking about. That child is vicous Although the film does not have much blood, it is entertaining and, for some reason, you care about the characters. He also has a good nude. It also has a bit of decent acting, really a good 80's movie, it's worth seeing if you ever get the chance to see it. Although you will have nightmares about those damn children, I guarantee it!
