I loved it, it was really scary and disgusting. I thought that the tearing of human flesh was completely provocative. The way he was representing the human crucifix about Jesus Christ was really interesting. The tearing of the extremities and jaws was amazing brutally horrible. Do not look at this if you have a weak heart, you could not stand it.
