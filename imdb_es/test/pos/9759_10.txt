Jean Paget, Joe Harman and Noel Strachan, all are unlikely heroes and survivors. The small but strong Jean, whose strength and resolve helps save lives, marching hundreds of miles and with calm self-discipline and persuasive powers, Joe Harman ("oh my word") took risks for Jean and the other prisoners, only to suffer worst. pain imaginable, and Noel Strahan, who trusted Jean regardless of the odds. Her good humor and strength inspire all those around her, and those who have the courage to go with her are rewarded. The beautiful landscape and the musical score adds to the adventure. Despite the length I never got bored. These ordinary people did extraordinary things and are based on a true story. Someone borrowed my VHS a few years ago and I never saw him again. I learned my lesson, classmates, and I'll buy another copy when it can be found. It's a pity that the miniseries is not on DVD.
