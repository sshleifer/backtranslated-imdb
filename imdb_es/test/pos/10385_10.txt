It looks like the betting movie I've seen. Not too much for intelligent perception, but so rich for sensitive perception. Antonioni is equally wise to his film. Malkovich's so organic roles are so true, situations are so real. I have changed my vision of the world after this cinema. I am a beginner literary writer in Russia, the country of Tolstoy and Dostoevskiy, and I am pretty sure that seeing Antonioni is good and fun for the Russkies, because we understand his point of view. so I do not understand his minor ration in IMDb. I am sure that, speaking from Russia and our people, we like Antonioni for his romantic soul and the positive feeling of the surrounding reality.
