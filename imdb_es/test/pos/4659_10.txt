I have no idea what the budget of this movie was, but whatever it is, they made it work! I've seen movies that spend 100 times the amount (Pearl Harbor, someone?) And they're 200x worse. This movie has it all. David "Makin 'It" Naughton in the lead role as Adam, an average college student who gets involved in a game called Great AllNighter "led by Leon! This guy is cool! A" genius "with nothing better to do than come With a game made for a group of people to play, but he does not just choose his friends, he has a team of Jocks, nerds, fat guys, average kids and, of course, the Flounder team that are the "bad guys". But this movie does not have black and white, there are many shades of gray, Adam is not the altruistic hero with no faults, he treats Alex P. as garbage, and language is the way it is due to the pressures of his father and the Irritated stomach, Athletes play dirty, but everyone else! This movie is amazing! The scene at the PBR factory? Classic! "Johnny's obese child?" Can you write a better clue? it's gold Jerry! GOLD! from a different generation, but I love movies that look crazy but that still have roots in reality. This never happened ... but it could. e-Gypt .... EEEE .... Easter Bunny .... Easter Parade! Oh, and watch a young Paul Rubens who still works on that Pee wee character. PD: Devra Clinger WAS / IS HOT! She must have been a bad actress to not work anymore in Hollywood. SEE THIS MOVIE!
