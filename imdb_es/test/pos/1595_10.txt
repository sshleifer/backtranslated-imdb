If all the films had to be destroyed and only one could be avoided, death in Venice would have to be like that. It is a monument in the history of cinema. Highly criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in stating his point (an old man discovers beauty in a child and is tragically destroyed, first mentally and then physically), we should appreciate this film for what it is. 'Morte a Venezia' was filmed more than 30 years ago, and portrays a period even further back, at the beginning of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Life was slow at that time, compared to the current one. People were supposed to behave in a certain way, hiding their true emotions even from themselves. The director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the main actor, manage to demonstrate admirably how the aged composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a child. For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his time, this must have been too powerful a blow to reach an agreement. We see his inner struggle, especially in the face of Bogarde, in the beautiful background of Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music, composed by Gustav Mahler. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, it can not be denied. . No special effects, chases or car fights to keep the audience immobilized in their seats. There are also no scenes of perverted sex; The interaction between the man and the child is limited to the stolen glances from a distance and the occasional smile. <br /> <br /> So, basically, is not nothing happening in this movie? Not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum. If you want them to play like the strings of a violin in a romantic concert, this is the movie to do it.
