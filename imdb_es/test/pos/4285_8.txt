Another great performance by Tom Wilkinson emphasizes "Separate Lies", a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it is the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning, where the husband (Wilkinson) believes that he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near your house the night you have a party brings the police. It is a stroke and career that killed the husband of his maid Maggie's Bassett. James suspects a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage in his car. He confronts Bule, who admits he did and promises to go to the police the next day. When James arrives home, Ann gets angry for doing so well and says that she was driving the car. Of course, James is not so eager to run to the police then. She suggests they call Bule and tell him his decision. "Oh, f___ Bule," says James. "Well, that's it," says Ann. "I'm f___ing Bule." The devastation of James is just the beginning in this well-crafted drama. Without revealing the plot, this is a good example of how gender change changes a story. Example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car to a lake and her children drown. She gets life in prison. What if the father had done it? The chair. You would be surprised how often the result would be different. The same is true here: if it had been James who had the adventure and the subsequent activities, viewers might feel something different about the story. If Ann were in James's place, she would be destroying. As it is, it is tremendously sad. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson is heartbreaking as a man blinded by the woman he adores, and Emily Watson does a beautiful job as Ann, who, once she gets rid of her lies ... her involvement in the accident and happy marriage: he knows what he has to do. Rupert Everett as Bule is very effective: indolent, luxurious and, ultimately, needed. Everyone here is very civilized in their relationships with each other, and no one is good or bad. <br /> <br /> There are separate lies: James says that his marriage is happy, that Ann is on the list above, and there is A lie that unites: the accident, about which all parties are silent. It's enough for Ann that Maggie knows. In the end, everyone must deal with the separate lies that the lie did not discover. <br /> <br /> Bright film.
