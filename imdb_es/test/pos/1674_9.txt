The minutiae of what a robbery entails is what makes this one of the best robbery movies. Then there is the theft itself, a thirty-minute biter of words that has never been exceeded, followed by what is probably the most pronounced example of dishonor among thieves in movies, as things begin to unravel spectacularly, and we have what is undoubtedly the biggest All movies of theft. <br /> <br /> This was a hard and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and is just as hard and unsentimental today. (Shows part of the avant-garde brutality of the previous "Brute Force" by Dassin). There is not a flabby moment or a good performance in the whole movie, and Dassin captures the surroundings of the seedy clubs and Parisian alleys like no one else, and the final journey through Paris by a dying man is one of the sequences most iconic closing of any movie. A classic.
