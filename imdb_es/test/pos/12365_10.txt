Körkarlen (1921), a classic film with cult status among silent films, directed by Victor Sjöstrøm, who also plays the leading male role, is based on a story by Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlöf.

But David fights with his friends, suffers a hemorrhage and sinks into the ground. Meanwhile, the ghost car approaches. The driver is nobody but David's late friend, Georges, who seduced him into alcohol and died a year earlier. As David refuses to get into the carriage, Georges forces him. Together, they drive to the stations where the people who suffered from David live. They visit the nurse Edit whose love for David could not recognize and who infected with tuberculosis so she is dying now. But his unconditional love for David will save his soul. Fulfilled with his spirit, they reach David's wife and children. David can prevent his wife from killing herself and her children, because she does not see a way out of the misery in which David has thrown her. They also visit David's brother, who has committed a murder after being seduced by David to drink. David asks Georges to return to his body, because he finally sees that his path was wrong. As it was Georges who had seduced him once to drink, David's wish is granted, he has a second chance and Georges has to be another year the driver of the Phantom Carriage to pay for his own sins.
