Speaking about the characteristics of the competition at the Split film festival, we have titles from around the world. China, Korea, Canada, the United States and Australia, and many of these stories indicate that the world is really a vale of tears. Modern love ... that's for sure. <br /> <br /> In that Alex Frayne movie, two young married people and their son travel from the city to the coast to visit the tomb and the uncle's house of the man who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances. The coastal town looks like something in an American horror movie in which the town is strange and people are rare mutants. But episodes in Alex Frayne's pastorella can not be described as horror in the normal way. In fact, this is an extremely interesting drama in which we are seeing relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more. In this story and, obviously, through the psychological facets of the actors, we are shown a sample of the film, a lovely and eccentric Australian film. This is the case of Frayne. Always something new and fresh. The visual intelligence and the unique sensibility of some Australian directors is an amazing asset. Frayne's movie is super. There is something in the Australian landscape that shows his films as special as we have seen in FRAYNE's Modern Love and in the films of RAY Lawrence, Lantana and Jindabyne. <br /> <br /> It looks like it will be the same in future Alex titles.
