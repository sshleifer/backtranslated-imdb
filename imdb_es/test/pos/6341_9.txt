I just saw "back from lonely pigeon" and it was very good! I have seen many negative comments about it and I do not think the viewers are being realistic about it! In the television / film business, it is difficult to recover all the actors for a second part or a third part. WE ARE LUCKY OF HAVING OTHER MINISTERS THAT ARE IN THE ONLY D. FIDELY !! This production was first class with the original music, and the actors put their hearts in it (it can be said). If you want to see it alone d. with Robert Duvall and Tommy L. J. then look at the original. Return to L.D. I did not have that much wit and it takes a more serious tone, but it's totally captivating. From the moving moments to the villains, this is a winner! "Wonderful!!!"
