In comparison with this, Tarkovsky is a phenomenon of speed. <br /> <br /> Compared to this, Bela Tarr is MTV. <br /> <br /> Compared to this, the movie "Russian Ark" is a roller coaster ride. <br /> <br /> I just described 3 of the sllllowwwwwesssstttt experiences that I have known, and this is the best one of all. But that does not mean it's bad. On the contrary, I liked it a lot. But it was a task. <br /> <br /> I will not describe the plot, because you can easily find it elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the plot is crazy. It is one of the most creative and strange ideas since "Becoming John Malkovich". I think the interesting plot is the main reason why I kept it from falling asleep (also, the humor was nice, that's something we rarely see in slow and artistic films). <br /> <br /> Here we see a strange inversion of norm. Most movies have little plot and little substance; however, they fill up in 90 minutes with many eye-catching images to keep us captivated. But "The Hole" has a 100% plot / theme without much to please the eyes. In that sense, I suppose it's a truly intellectual experience, like reading a painfully verbose novel like Thackaray's "Vanity Fair" (which I have NEVER been able to finish!). <br /> <br /> If you have a tremendous span of attention, I think you will really like this movie. Despite its gentle rhythm, it is highly creative and imaginative. It's like Jean-Pierre Jeunet in quaaludes and with a gray and dusty camera lens. Best of luck.
