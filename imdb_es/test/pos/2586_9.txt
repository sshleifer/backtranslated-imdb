I just got back from seeing Black Snake Moan. I had spent my time reading reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... "a skinny white girl chained to a black man's radiator" ... I hate when "critics" lose the sense of a movie. Now I guess it helps me to live in Memphis ... and have lived in Mississippi a couple of times too. It could also help that I am the former Director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this movie. The simple "tale of redemption" by Brewer is easy to follow and could have had several themes to tell the story ... but I think it's a great effect like a "blues". I hope that people do not read all the hype ... and / or several reviews ... and miss a good movie. Overcome the various things, like thin girls in white panties ... surpasses Justin Timberlake, accepts his character Ronnis (who plays very well) ... beats "Serpents in an airplane" and observes what mercury is Samuel L. Jackson ... since he has become a very credible mid-south blues man. If you know little about the culture of the South, much of what happens may seem cartoonish ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer KNOW how to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story and enjoy this movie. You do not have to count the endings ... so watch this movie ... and yes, I'll agree with one thing that the critics did right ... the music is wonderful!
