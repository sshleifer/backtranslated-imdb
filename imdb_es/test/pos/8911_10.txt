In the first place, the alien saves a small black child and a Mexican, despite what the summary of the IMDb plot suggests. This movie is the fulfillment of the purest of male farces, interracial rape. The main character in this film is a George Michael fan, who does not understand the primary human impulses like drug abuse and murder. In fact, each time he uses violence to solve a problem he has an internal conflict that makes it physically difficult. What a place In any case, my favorite scene is when he writes to gang members a letter stating that if they want the $ 500 they receive from the Reading Center for their protection, they should meet with him. At the meeting, he is surrounded by countless Chicano gangsters, but he keeps a cool head. In slow motion, it hits the wooden post of a stop sign that breaks on contact. Then, still in slow motion, he points to the leader of the gang and says: "Noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" The gang members comply. Great, right? The beauty of this film is shown through these simple solutions for social problems such as prostitution and gang violence.
