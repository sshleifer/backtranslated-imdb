Mikhail Kalatozov, The Cranes are flying, is an excellent movie. Winner of the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival, she has an excellent photograph and performance by Tatyana Samojlova, the only Russian actress to have won a prize at Cannes for a performance. She plays Veronika, a teenager in love with her boyfriend, happy and carefree, with plans to get married. Your life will be turned upside down when World War II arrives and your boyfriend volunteers in the army. The film describes the effect of war on the love of a teenager and on the people who stayed and saw their loved ones go to fight, waiting for a letter or other information. It is a portrait of lost innocence. Samojlova does a magnificent job, and the transformation of her character will break your heart. The movement of the camera is fast with many close-ups, it is a dance camera. The first scene on the stairs is fantastic, but it is not the only one, then there is a scene in which Veronika tries to commit suicide, and another, in my opinion, one of the most powerful scenes in the history of cinema, the bombing of the house of Veronika. when he runs the stairs in the middle of the fire, to find his apartment completely destroyed. Simply great! 10 out of 10
