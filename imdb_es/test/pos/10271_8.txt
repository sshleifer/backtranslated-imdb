A polished production that maintains interest from the first scene in which Max chooses a ring in a jewelry store. Much of what follows reminds us of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream," in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's friends. Here, Max and Lucien, prone to love at first sight, mingle with Lisa and Alice, and Alice complicates things when she calls herself Lisa. In addition to the happy confusion, Max is inclined to get involved in incidents that bring back memories of two years ago. And since Max has many of these dream episodes, we are subject to one flashback after another, too many in my opinion because when I saw the film for the first time, I was not sure if it was in the present or in the past. A lot of running through corridors, stairs, through doors, elevators, etc. I accept all that in a fast-paced movie, but do we have to have so many people crashing into each other? After four collisions it stops having some impact, if you excuse the pun. High qualifications for art design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decoration, but I wonder how a couple of young women can afford that luxury in Paris. Saving a person who tries to commit suicide by jumping out the window is always exciting and is also in this movie when Max almost comes out at the same time. However, a kiss or two soon make it feel better. If you manage to find your way through all the flashbacks, you will finally find yourself at the airport where Max's devoted sister gives her a very affectionate kiss. It can be said that it is she who solves the complications of love, like Puck in a "Midsummer Night's Dream".
