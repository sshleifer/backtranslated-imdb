The fact that after 50 years, it's still a very visible movie, says a lot about it. It is more intelligent and interesting than almost all recent movies of the same genre that you can find, and has a certain feeling of endearing innocence. I'm not a big fan of this kind of movies, but I could see everything without getting bored, which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who does not necessarily share their taste in movies. I liked the palette in black and white, the excellent cast, the clever robbery scene that keeps you guessing about the trick they will do next, and the ending like everyone else. Observe the sequence of the robbery makes one realize the power of silence, which unfortunately is so little used in today's cinema.
