This movie has one of the best club scenes, very good soundtrack (if you like techno / trance music) <br /> <br /> some situations (like the main character, Carl starts taking drugs, for example) They are a bit out of reality, but the plot is entertaining, but the characters are a bit superficial ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend you watch this movie if you do not like techno music <br /> < For the plot / performance alone, this movie is a 4/10, with the really great special effects and the club scenes and the soundtrack is a 7/10, but if you want to go to the movies just to hear good clues and it takes a little club feeling, it's a 10/10. <br /> <br /> special effects are sometimes hidden, sometimes clearly visible. (ie clouds / sun / moon that move quickly, changing background, changing cuts) <br /> <br /> For my part, I enjoyed it very much, it was a pity that there was not a dance floor at the cinema; )
