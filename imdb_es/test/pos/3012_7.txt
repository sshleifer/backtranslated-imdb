In spite of all the adornments of the style and the cinematographic invention, this is basically another thriller of assassins in series, following the same type of plot preferred by the favorites of always like Silence of the Lambs? The police team follows the trail of murders (especially unpleasant), someone else is kidnapped and somehow they have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the murderer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need the psychology science fiction machine of psychologist Jennifer Lopez to enter his head and force him to tell everyone. This is where the film becomes completely new and different, as we enter (through a 21st century CGI update of Dr Who's kaleidoscopic favorite, the fashion-time tunnel) a kind of Hellraiser-and weird world of fearsome madmen that happen all over the world. The place, governed by D'Onofrio, is now a kind of overlapping lord of his twisted mental world, inside his body in a coma. The sequences inside the mind are well done and often they are impressive, all the tracks work properly, the grotesque is the most if you like that kind of thing, but the exaggeration of all this led me to a disappointment for me, because I had expected something completely new and different from everything that had been done before, not quite successful mix of the main genre of serial killers and special effects. Sometimes horrible, often beautiful, a very exciting story told with care and attention by talented film people, but in no way the great leap into the unknown has been marketed as.
