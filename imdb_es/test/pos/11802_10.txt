The Cure is one of the few movies I rated with 10 out of 10. I mean, everything is impeccable for me in this movie. I saw it almost a year ago, and yet I remember many of the scenes, especially the final touching scene that comes with the credits. <br /> <br /> The two young actors clearly gave everything they could and this contributes enormously to the excellent plot, which makes the film perfect. <br /> <br /> The message is clear: friendship, and it shows throughout the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say here. Simplicity is one of the things that I love so much about this movie. And, of course, it's fun and touching at the same time, for people of any age. <br /> <br /> 10/10, well done!
