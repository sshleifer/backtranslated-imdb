Walter Matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his comedy partner Jack Lemmon from THE FORTUNE COOKIE to THE ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films, a companion. This was Glenda Jackson, the double Oscar winner in English, who demonstrated her comedic abilities against Matthau, the first in HOUSE CALLS and then in HOPSCOTCH. Matthau's role was slightly higher in both films, because his characters were more central in the arguments, but the chemistry between them was pretty good. If you ever want to see two professionals who demonstrate how sex can be madly fun, watch Walter and Glenda as Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson experimenting to see if two people could have sex in a bed under the old rule. of the film code of the two parties. Everyone has one leg on the ground! Sex has never been seen from such a clinical and mechanical point of view. <br /> <br /> Matthau's Charlie just widowed before the movie started. He has only had one woman in his life: his wife. So now he is the eligible bachelor. He is also the leading surgeon at the hospital where he works, but the chief surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Apparently, Carney is senile (there are moments later in the movie that show that he turns on and off his senility, see the scene where Richard Benjamin's car hits). Amos is ready for re-election (Charlie is his closest competitor for the position, if he wants). However, Amos manages to convince Charlie to allow him to keep the job for reasons of self-esteem. <br /> <br /> One day, Charlie realizes that Ann is in the hospital. She has had a slight accident and is resting in bed, but Amos has put her in a cage-like device (which Charlie has not used since 1920). He takes her out of the device, and soon he's falling in love. She joins the hospital staff, but criticizes Charlie's willingness to care for Amos, and criticizes certain selfish tendencies he sees among the hospital's doctors. <br /> <br /> The confusion of Amos causes the death of a wealthy hospital patron (Lloyd Gough), who owned a baseball team (his biggest innovation is the cost of separate admission for double headings) . Amos tries to calm the young widow of the team owner by delivering praise in the burial service (the line in the summary above is the praise evaluation line). However, she is still determined to sue (her lawyer, Thayer David, says the hospital is the most incompetent she has ever seen). So Amos suggests that Charlie romanticize the widow to satisfy her of that costly demand. But how will Ann react to this? The film is quite funny, and was so successful that, in addition to causing a sequel to Jackson and Matthau, it also led to a television series.
