This film travels further in 8 shots, 2 kisses and 100 clich√©s of what should be possible. However, it still works. Sparkly. <br /> <br /> While driving to my house from the theater, I tried to discover how he managed with basic movies like the pages of a novel manuscript that blows across a beach or the impossible series of random coincidences without everything the audience stood up and shouted: "I've seen it a million times before! And you've pushed beyond the limit of credibility!" But the actors were so lovely and the screen so full of believable extras that I forgot to worry. A friend who saw him with me said that he transported him to Paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and we realized that we were still in Indiana. <br /> <br /> In general, a romantic comedy thriller with subtlety. , ingenuity and elan.
