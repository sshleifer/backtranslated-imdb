SPOILERS Each important regime uses the means of the country for its own purposes. Whether it is the Nazi ban on certain leaflets or the televised Chinese alternative of Tiananmen Square, governments have tried to influence people through different media since the beginning of time. However, in 1925, celebrating the failed mutiny of 1905, the Russian Communist government supported the creation of this film, Battleship Potempkin. An important piece of film history, it is still powerful and beautiful to this day. <br /> <br /> Located aboard the Battleship Potempkin, the crew is not happy. In miserable living conditions and with food infested with worms, they are angry with their high class suppressors. Now, however, after the rotten food, it is enough. Directed by Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), the crew resorts to their masters and fights for their freedom. <br /> <br /> In regards to propaganda, "Battleship Potempkin" is perfect. By presenting a positive light on the first failed communist mutiny, the film was a useful Soviet tool. However, eighty years after the premiere of the films, the USSR has completely disappeared from the map. However, the surprising thing about this film is that while the country for which the message was intended has disappeared, the film remains a powerful and dignified film piece. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. It is true that it is far from what we would today consider 'entertainment', but the film is a beautiful work of art. <br /> <br /> Whether in the scenes on board the ship or in the scene that is often spoken of. In the footsteps of Odessa, everything about this movie is perfectly done. The music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is impeccable, even the performance, although a little exaggerated, is perfect for the piece. Basically, there is no way to criticize the final product of this movie. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to know how the Russian people received this film after its release. Praising a country that has not existed for fifteen years, it is difficult for us to know the spirit that inspires the film. However, as a work of art, it is magnificent. Beautiful from beginning to end, it is far from being an easy watch, but it is worth the effort.
