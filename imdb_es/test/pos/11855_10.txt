Intense, fun, ingenious, and more than anything, social comedy about the forms of adult quotations and their results, whether good or bad. Mohr and Nicholson are committed to two months of the wedding, when a strange event in their engagement party forces Nicholson to rethink the relationship and start hanging out with other people so he does not feel so pristine when it comes to the sexual experience. . This leads to a disaster of events after Mohr, Nicholson and their cohorts. Very intelligent and necessary in this moment of awkward and condescending comedy, while it contains its usual variety of comic, sexual and frustrated characters (especially Charles as a sexually frustrated sex demon ... very annoying) that even seem to have the right sensation until this sentimental comment. <br /> <br /> The film is what movies should be like these days, showing that kids are sensitive at heart and have morals. Most of the male characters are moralistic and straight eyes, while the woman are the street marauders who will stop at nothing to get pleasure. Men will appreciate the message made to men with self respect, however, it is easy to assume that most men who DO see this movie will use their message of masculine sensitivity to cover any defect or trait that a woman may find offensive. Still, the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for its male drivers, particularly those of Mohr, Richter, and find the director in a cameo as a salesman. <br /> <br /> The females are by far the most promiscuous, as they talk about nothing but pleasure and what it would be like ... with someone else. However, they have friendly features, although they are covered by the image of kittens driven by sex. Very funny things <br /> <br /> On another level, the film follows part of its set in different relationship work. Richter encounters a stressed divorcee (a VERY remarkable and remarkable performance by the always reliable Helen Slater) named Penelope, who is divorced with a son who hates her for separating from her father. As the two deepen in a relationship, human interest is revealed and both the comedy and the tragedy of divorce and the beginning are studied. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, Mohr and Nicholson have become a profound way of seeing what comes next, and it depends on what they have learned from each other and themselves to decide what to do next. Then it becomes appropriate and dramatic at the right time. <br /> <br /> The direction of Wallodorski is emulated very well when the characters learn to face after everything that has happened ... with the correct ending. <br /> <br /> In short, this film should have been released all over the country, and I hope it is ready for some Academy Awards ... maybe Helen Slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. Anyway, this movie is a "do not miss", give everything that you have farce of romantic sex, is shown in a very mature and aesthetic. <br /> <br /> Great movie!
