Challen Cates does a wonderful job representing a girlfriend in conflict, divided between the challenges that await her professionally, the memories of freedom she thought she would have when she studied at university (inspired by a famous author) and the security of her pending marriage with a man she does not really love. Definitely worth watching this movie, no matter how predictable it may be, the acting is inspiring and there is a real chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm Jamaal Warner.
