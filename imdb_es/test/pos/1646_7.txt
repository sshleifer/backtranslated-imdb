This is not a bad television movie. Shtrafbat is the abbreviation of Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Criminal Batallion. These battalions were formed due to the growing demand for soldiers since the Soviet Union was suffering heavy casualties throughout the war. These battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the opportunity to clear their names by proving themselves in combat. They were seen as scum and were easily spent during combat without much regret, or much honor, from the military. They were often sent to suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties. Those who refused to fight were executed in sight. Needless to say, their lives were crap. <br /> <br /> There were some very good performances from the cast, especially from Yuri Stepanov who played Antip, Aleksandr Bashirov who played Stirah, and Roman Madyanov who played Major Kharchenko. However, the series is not really that addictive, partly because it's too long, it could have been much shorter and more effective. <br /> <br /> Although it is about war, Shtrafbat has a very mild violence and practically no violence. blood. It is based solely on the actors to make it work, and after all, it is a television series, so the producers did not want to scare the viewers and sponsors. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the Soviet regime, and explains why so many men chose to fight against the Nazis instead of joining them. Personally I prefer to be fascist than communist given the circumstances presented in the film. One character explains that the Soviets stripped their farm and his family died of starvation. He was burned by anger, which arrested him for destroying Kolhoz's property and ended up in the criminal battalion as a criminal. Antip recalled how her mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family. Both explained that they fought for their homeland, instead of for the Soviets. <br /> <br /> The criminal battalion had a naval infantryman who raped a girl, killing her partner in the prosesa, threatened her other. The comrade kept his mouth shut on both tests, and then He faked an injury when it came to fighting. Besides all that the girl committed suicide because of shame. I imagine that if enough marines saw this movie, they would pick up banners and riots in the streets asking for a boycott or an official apology from the producers. <br /> <br /> At least, I would recommend it to Anyone with the least interest in the former Soviet Union or World War II. I do not think I lost more than 500 minutes of my life.
