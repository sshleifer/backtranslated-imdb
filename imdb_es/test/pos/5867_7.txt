When I was very young, my mother had a series of four Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies shorts on the tape and I saw them all on several occasions. A Coy Decoy was one of these shorts, and I was very surprised to read in another comment that had been banned. When I was young, to begin with, I probably did not even understand Black Beauty's gag. However, this is probably why it was banned, although until I saw it on a video site, I did not even remember the gag. When I saw the video I remembered certain shots, in particular the shrinking of Daffy's hat and Daffy's eyes that got moving when the lure surrounded him in The Lake. I was not bothered by the gag, which was probably why the gag was forbidden. Instead, I was inundated with childhood memories of seeing this short. Due to how much I liked this short film as a child, I rate it with 7 out of 10.
