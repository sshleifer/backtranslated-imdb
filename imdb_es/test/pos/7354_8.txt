After the return of "horror movies" (come on, Scream is not scary!) I did not have much hope in this three-story, low-budget horror movie. But I was positively surprised! Man, this is scary !!! The first 2 stories are simply brilliant. The first about a new married couple driving in a dark forest with their RV, when they run into a fierce ........ (watch the movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl, who is alone at home for one night ... I know it does not sound special, but it's scary. I promise. The latest story is not scary but at least it is not bad. It is a biker and a ghost. In fact, the stories are based on real urban legends (I think Kevin Williams can also steal ideas). Rent this movie that is good! I'd say it's the most terrifying three-story horror movie ever made!
