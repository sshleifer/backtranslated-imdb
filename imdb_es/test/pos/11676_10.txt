<br /> <br /> First of all, I reviewed this documentary because I was interested in the subject I was describing, the Los Angeles punks. <br /> <br /> I listened to that music and I loved that music and read many of the small magazines that were made in the early 80s and that were not so easily achieved in Finland. <br /> <br /> So, if you do not like this kind of music, why do you write here about it? I like this kind of music, my soul speaks, so I know punks from all over Europe and America, so why do you, who find this music "disgusting", interested in commenting? <br /> <br />
