In the first twenty minutes, we are dragged several powerfully portrayed emotions: a suffocating and dominant mother has a violent argument with her daughter of 40 years; the love of a piano teacher (and music teacher) for her students expressed in an unshakeable critical assessment; the joy that music can inspire both the listener and the interpreter. In this short space of time, our senses have been convincingly attacked with very real characters. We also let ourselves be carried away by the powerfully interpreted music and we are shown the difference between an excellent and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to the nuances. That material alone would have been the basis for an exceptional film of great appeal. But the trend in French cinema is what it is, goes further, exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher, the expression of sexual freedom and the subsequent break in a context of passionate attraction and the inevitable cycle of real abuse. We are attracted to her suffering and, at least initially, we wonder how much suffering can be related to the achievement of genius, particularly in the composers she admires. The piano teacher contains graphic dialogues and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people prefer not to see. The scenes are essential for the dilemmas that the film seeks to pose and, therefore, can hardly be called gratuitous. It may be a great movie, but the overview is not.
