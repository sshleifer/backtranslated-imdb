This was really a tense and dark episode. Excellent performance, wonderful performance and atmospheric direction, 'Ice' is one of my favorite episodes. Along with 'Pusher' 'Grotesque' 'Wetwired' and 'Home' (in my case they are pretty good in the dark atmosphere) I find it quite realistic, their paranoia, their suspicion and their growing anger was perfectly executed by the great actors However, 'Ice' had a problem that I overcame after some clocks: IT WAS VERY SHORT! I WANTED MORE! <br /> <br /> In general, 'ice' had what 98% of all episodes of X Files have: Excellent acting, Intense story writing, Rough direction. All the works <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
