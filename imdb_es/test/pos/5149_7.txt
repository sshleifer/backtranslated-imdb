Roy Andersson has managed to create something that challenges almost all the conventions of what a movie should be, a work of art that is both beautiful, fun and evocative. The final result is a poignant, albeit somewhat fractured, account of humanity in its simplest and most honest forms. <br /> <br /> It is unlikely that this will attract everyone, in fact, the humor is so fine-tuned that many will not. get on your wavelength. The almost absurdly long shots, the uncomfortable silences and the consistent medium shots will definitely leave out the most willing audiences. But it is in these unconnected stories and unconventional thinking that Andersson models a world where each character seems to be the center of attention in his own absurd way. Each scene is absorbed by the desolate environments, with the characters apparently alone in their own rarity. It is a difficult piece to watch at times, among other things because, like many of its scenes, it requires patience. But while some acclaim it on an artistic throne, others will simply see it as confused. It is a film that combines underestimated humor with its own brand of heart.
