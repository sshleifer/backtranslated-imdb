Although Flatliners is 15 years old, tonight was the first time I saw him. I had heard about the movie Flatliners, but there was never a buzz about it to go rent it or make a point to watch the period. Well, I got it in one of the premium channels and I must say that it was very good. <br /> <br /> This film is about some young medical students who decided to explore death. They have discovered a way to make a person die briefly and give him back his life. In addition to the cast of stars, this film had a serious bite. The very idea of ​​exploring death is fascinating enough, but I really thought that the writer and the director did an excellent job of giving a different but at the same time more attractive vision. This was not a generic attempt to thrill, frighten and make the mind accelerate ... this was the real deal. <br /> <br /> Instead of turning it into an empty, superficial and star-filled thriller, this movie had substance. . A hard-nosed thriller, white knuckle, seat edge, hard nose. I give it an 8/10.
