This is, by far, one of the best biographical films of recent times. I'll go so far as to put him there with Ray and The Aviator. It is the story of a young, bi-racial child who lives in a boarding house managed by the incredible Miss Rachael, also known as "Nanny". You will fall in love with Nanny, a woman who gives herself to those around her. S. Epatha Merkerson brings the character to life beautifully, and the other members of the cast do the same. If I had to praise each actor for the way they played their roles, I would have to mention everyone in the entire cast. <br /> <br /> The music in this film blends perfectly with the story, almost dictates the way it develops. And what's more, this movie is really entertaining. It will not bore you at all, not even for a minute! <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend an afternoon at home watching a very smart, entertaining and quality film.
