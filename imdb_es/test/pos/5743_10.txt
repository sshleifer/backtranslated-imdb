Forget about Samara / Sadako and Jason ... <br /> <br /> Horror has a new name: GRANNY. The plot is simple but efficient. The actors are good (two thumbs up for "Michelle" and the killer) and the dialogues are even very smart. From the beginning to the end, the action will leave you breathless, you just can not escape ... There is blood, terrible murders, funny moments and a sense of perversity that goes far beyond any rule. "Deja vu" ? Surely NOT: "Granny" is not another slash movie, it is really a classic by itself ... It deserves the success it had and there is still more success with its re-launch. Congratulations
