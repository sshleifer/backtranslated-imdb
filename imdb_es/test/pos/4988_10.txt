It is also the best book I have read. Karl Urban and Steve Zahn are very well together. He had drama, adventure and sweetness and sadness. I laughed. I cried. It's hard not to laugh when Gus is talking. I wish Gus had hit Clara as he did with Inez. Clara only guided Gus in all those years without any intention of marrying him. She just liked to play with him. It was sad that he spent his whole life thinking about her. It would have been nice if Woodrow had married Maggie, but she would have died of him anyway. Woodrow was a man who could not express his feelings and kept them bottled. It was obvious that he loved Maggie after the raid in Austin when the rangers returned and ran to hug her. Val Kilmer is excellent for playing strange characters. I loved his interpretation of Captian Inish Skull. I loved the whole Lonesome Dove saga. Comanche Moon is the best of the group.
