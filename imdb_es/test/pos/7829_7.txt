Snakes on a Plane was a movie so well promoted that it was inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another movie with almost the same title in the same year and much less in the same week. Reading the other comments here I see the results. Many people are crazy. Crazy because he does not have the best special effects. Crazy because he does not have a star cast. Crazy because they wanted to see Samuel Jackson say "I'm sick of these M ^ * & * &% - Er F * ^ (^% - Ing Snakes in this M ^ * & * &% - Er F * ^ (^% -Ing Train "! <br /> <br /> Well, I'm sure this is not Samuel Jackson's version, and maybe that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Snakes on a Plane got lost in the police movie and the horror, a family action film and a bloody film of death.The actors of Saturday Night Live laughed while Jackson swore enough to make a grandmother cover her ears and, as far as children are concerned, They would be traumatized by the violence. <br /> <br /> However, the snakes on a train knew exactly what it was, this was a horror movie made on a train on a train, of course it had snakes and many of them They were scientifically innocuous garden snakes with fake rattle sound effects, but never once is a step lost in their plot or intention. The "on a Plane" version was shot from the first scene. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the superior fun that Snakes on a Plane had to offer and I admit that the "... in the version of a train" was a bit dry. But hey, in the trade, it was a fresh and unexpected story. This little horror movie could have gone worse than it did. <br /> <br /> Because of this, you get 7 out of 10.
