"Pharaoh's army" defies the formula. Instead of selling cliches and big stars, it is based entirely on the excellent performance of a strong cast, the strength of a well written script and a fascinating and bitter story. The result is a crude and realistic movie that moves fast, with a strong emotional current. One of the best I've seen about the Civil War, and I think that's because of the pleasure of being an independent film (if you like this movie, try watching the independent movie of the Civil War "Wicked Spring", equally brilliant). as well). <br /> <br /> "Pharaoh" simply tells the true story of a small expedition / forage team of Union men riding on a Confederate farm to take provisions, but they end up trapped there due to an accident by one of the men. Tensions and relationships are made and broken. Nothing happens as Hollywood would write it; This film comes from the mind of someone who really cares about the quality of the film and the storytelling. The magnificent dialogue and the exhibition of the plot move throughout a film that seems very professional, but often it does not seem that you are watching a movie, rather when listening to a story. <br /> <br /> The film features an incredible performance by Chris Cooper, who shows surprising versatility in exploring his role. It transforms, but it is always at the height of credibility and it is easy to relate emotionally with it. Patricia Clarkson is equally stellar and realistic in a role in which many actresses would collapse. She shares an interesting chemistry with the character of Cooper and where she is the most severe of the characters, it is still so easy to identify with her. The rest of the cast is quite capable and fulfills its roles well. <br /> <br /> The artistic design and the stage are wonderful, and I personally love cinematography. Everything feels like a photograph of the period of the Civil War, with the camera that presents contrasting colors and shadows and a metallic tint similar to that of a can, but always maintaining the natural appearance of the rustic environment. It seems that they used natural light, but whatever they use works perfectly. Everything seems to belong to where it is, feels period, something I find strange in the movies of the American period. The actors act in the 19th century, not like the people of the 20th century in old clothes. <br /> <br /> Above all, this movie is very personal. I think as indie can afford it. The film is almost impeccable with an outstanding script that creates and explores without effort the relationships and personalities of these characters and allows them to grow in a situation, however bad it may be. He does not fail to get his point across, and he does it without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war movies these days. It is brave It is based on its characters, a fantastic script, human emotions and the fact that the Civil War was not all CGI, big stars and hoop skirts.
