Drive was a nice episode with a dark ending. Basically, a man and his wife are infected in the inner ear by a sharp sound wave emitted by some military equipment. Some of my favorite parts of this episode are Mulder's dialogue in the car, and the scene in which Scully enters with Hazmat's team and finds the deaf old lady who is not affected by what they thought was a virus . The ending, of course, is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that he can actually carry out this elaborate plan to save the victim, but when Mulder arrives, the man is already dead. 8/10
