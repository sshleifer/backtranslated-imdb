Cold Mountain (writer / director) by Anthony Minghela is a carefully constructed, sensitive and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederation during the civil war, which deals with the politics of war in a very subtle and realistic way. While accurately describing the brutality and inhumanity of that war, it also does something that many films related to this period can not handle so effectively: Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out and portrays changes among non-slaves who possess People forged by the war. And, almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not generalize too much to southerners, northerners or anyone else. <br /> <br /> The film navigates through the genres as needed, without presenting a dull moment. It's a romance, a war story, an action-adventure and historical fiction, all very well interwoven into one. <br /> <br /> The story centers on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who are trapped with each other for very simple reasons. When this young romance begins to sprout, Inman enlists in the Confederate army, taking with him a book that Ada has given him and a photograph of her. The character of Ada is one of the brightest aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from the perspective of a third person, but the story is clearly yours from the beginning to the end. Ada is a smart southern sister and the daughter of a liberal minister. She begins the film as a daddy girl who is an expert in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants for most of their lives were expected to learn. In other words, as she admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a teacher of everything that is useless. <br /> <br /> Ada's father leaves, and she stays to manage her modest property on her own. With no experience of this kind, she struggles and survives by keeping Inman's memory close to her heart. Ruby enters the scene as a tough girl who has been raised by a drunken and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities that Ada lacks and, as they become inseparable business partners, they love each other as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but something like a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for causes they do not really believe in, and decides to defect. No one he knows comes to his rescue when he begins the thousand mile walk back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place during the long walk of Inman, following Both protagonists live, learn, grow and change. A continuous act of will born of despair preserves his intense passionate love. For Inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of sheer despair. For Ada, it is the same, but it is also a symbol and a remnant of the old South, a world that is passing quickly. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is powerful and impressive. There are beautiful images of Appalachian landscapes that give the film a strong sense of history. The screenplay and editing are also extremely strong, emphasizing the broad educational and class differences reflected in southern ante-bellum dialects of the middle and lower classes. With the cast of this film, nothing less than perfection must be expected. And the cast, in its majority, rises to the occasion. My only criticism, however, is related to the accents adopted by the characters of Kidman and Law. You probably should not expect an Australian and a Briton to accurately reproduce the southern US discourse, but there are times when these two exceptionally gifted actors produce vocal cuts that distract attention. I admit my excessive sensitivity to this, and I can say with some confidence that it will not bother most people. The performance of Zellweger is outstanding and creates a character that I will remember in my senescence. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
