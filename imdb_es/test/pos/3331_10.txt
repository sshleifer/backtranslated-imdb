Come on. Anyone who does not understand the greatness of this caricature here should be expelled from the panel of any critic. They should not be allowed to be heard, because obviously they have no sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Anyone who does not love this here, an animated cartoon run by Tex Avery must be chained to a chair and forced to watch episodes of "Huckleberry Hound" for 20 years in a row! <br /> <br /> The double takes and shots of the Wolf in this cartoon are the best examples of this important comedy past that has been captured in the film. <br /> <br /> Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this caricature. Is the best.
