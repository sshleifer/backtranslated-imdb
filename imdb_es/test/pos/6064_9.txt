This is one of the best non-English series I've seen. Weave interesting single and double episodes of crime resolution along with a personal aspect that you simply do not get in CSI. All the characters have personal lives that combine well with their daily work and occasionally interfere. In addition, all the characters manage to evolve naturally throughout the episodes. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent and was recorded throughout Denmark, giving a good example of the highlights that Majestic Country offers. Unfortunately, only 32 episodes were made, however they are first class televisions. We hope you consider doing more episodes of the same caliber.
