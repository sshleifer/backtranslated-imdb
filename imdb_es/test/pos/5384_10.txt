Bwana Devil is supposedly the first important studio, a feature film filmed completely in the 3D process. Supposedly the producer Oboler went to Africa to film a different film, but after listening to the story of two lions devouring men, terrorizing the railway constructors, he decided on this. It's also a good story, almost like Hemmingway; Fear, redemption, the great white hunter and everything. It is the narration of the story that seems to drag, almost as if the filming in the new process was too heavy for the crew. The action scenes are rigid, almost too staged. But these technical problems seem small in light of the dramatic conclusion of the film.
