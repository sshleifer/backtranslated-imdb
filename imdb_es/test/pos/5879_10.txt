I was impressed when I saw "The best years of our lives". The performance, screenplay and direction of Master William Wyler (winner of the Best Director in 1946) is Brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film is about three veterans of World War II who return home together on a plane and all by chance live in the same town. They all meet with their families. <br /> <br /> The first man, Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar-winning role), has to adapt to his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and the children Peggy and Rob. (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) being different than before going to war. <br /> <br /> The second man Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews in an excellent role) has to find a good job and adapt with a wife he had only been married to 20 days before going to war. He begins to discover that she is not the same. <br /> <br /> The third man has a much harder adaptation to do. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his excellent role as Oscar) lost his hands in the war and must deal with the reactions of his family and his fianc√©e 'Wilma (played by Cathy O'Donnell) to the hooks he has instead of at your hands All these men and their families meet in the film in different scenarios. The stories of these men are beautifully woven together. <br /> <br /> This movie really defines the meaning of a "Classic". This unforgettable drama (winner of the best film in 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If they asked me to choose a favorite movie, I would choose this one. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, I would give you "The best years of our life" and an 11. <br /> <br /> So the next time you rent a movie, you will not regret it.
