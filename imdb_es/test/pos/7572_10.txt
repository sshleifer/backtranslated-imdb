Jack Palance, (John Witting), used to be a bad guy in most of his films and in this movie, he showed his great acting talents beyond my expectations. John Witting unexpectedly returns to his son's farm after years and years of separation. Christopher Walken, (Jacob), has difficulty accepting his father's appearance after spending the night in the family barn. Jacob's son and his youngest daughter greet their new grandfather and accept him as he is, a very old man, at the end of his ropes. Glenn Close, (Sarah Witting), delves into the character of John Witting and begins to reveal the truth about what happened to him during his years of absence from the family. This is a very warm and loving film about the real events that happen in most families for generations to come.
