Let's be fair: there are no RULES for writing scripts, so I will not say that the film MUST be something other than what it is. I will say my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way it is said and the characters are introduced. However, I think that when a work adapts to the silver screen, maybe I could try to adapt to this other medium. Since this film was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the work, it is not a surprise that the film was too theatrical. It is the first movie of man, for crying out loud! What I'm saying is that there are parts in the film, like the city of Nordestina, which resembles a bit the "Hoje é Dia de Maria" set, which seems like we're not in a movie theater. We are in the theater! The lines are spoken too formally, the characters move choreographically, and the clarification is clearly destined for a stage. Sure, maybe that was the intention, but it has been done. On the stage. Wonderful things have been done by adapting a play to a movie: the beautiful "Closer", for example. However, when I went to see this, I did not feel I was watching a movie. But in general, it was a good one, worth seeing. It is a beautiful love story, funny at times and sad to others. My vote is a 7.
