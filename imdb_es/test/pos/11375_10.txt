This movie is a masterpiece. It was exciting from start to finish. The story of writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson about a porn star is told with style, grace, humor and even commotion. The actors and the characters they play are top-notch, including Mark Wahlberg at the helm, who proves himself as a solid actor and can lead a movie. Burt Reynolds gives perhaps his best performance as a porn director who discovers Wahlberg. The film recreates the end of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s with total precision, from the disco scene that starts the film to the "Miami Vice" outfit of Don Johnson from Wahlberg that he uses in the final scene. Most of the viewers who watch this movie will definitely compare it to PULP FICTION, but they really have much more in common with the films of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese. The movie is a triumph in style. The first shot that starts the movie is as impressive as those of THE PLAYER and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS. The edition of Dylan Tichenor is simply phenomenal. I could not believe that the edition did not receive an Oscar nomination (GOOD WILL HUNTING was a better edited film ?!). The best scene in the movie has to be that of the firecrackers. I had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense. When I saw the film for the second time, I had exactly the same reaction to the scene. Unfortunately, it may not have the same impact on television as in a movie theater with good stereo sound. It is a pity that many people have not seen this movie during their theatrical presentation, because it is the best way to see it. Anderson's use of widescreen will suffer on television (so get the DVD or a mailbox tape). It's amazing how easy Anderson makes everything look, because this is only his second movie. The music, the stage, the costumes, the photography, the extravagant characters, sex, violence, happiness and anguish are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with cinematography.
