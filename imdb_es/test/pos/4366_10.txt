Yes, this movie was simply funny and the performance was first class of the entire cast. Except that the German accent of Shelley Winters was not so good, but that does not matter since she is not in the film. So if you're a fan of her be careful! The two main stars of this film are Laurence Harvey and Julie Harris. Now, before this movie, I would only see Miss Harris in East of Eden with James Dean and I have an audio tape of The Glass Menagerie that she made on stage with Monty Clift and Jessica Tandy, so I was not sure how I'll be in This paper and BOY, she impressed me. How hammy was she? I love ham ;-) Mr. Harvey, he tickled my taste! Now I'm a full time Laurence Harvey fan! That hair !!! * laughter * OMG! It's almost like Burt Lancasters, that crazy and messy look, there's nothing better than that. He is young and very innocent in this movie. WATCH IT NOW! It's definitely in my top ten! :) I am very happy to have found a copy that is all mine! Unfortunately, this movie is sold out and it is very difficult to find it in a video. :( <br /> <br /> Btw, watch out for the scene in the hospital hotel room! It's one of the best parts! Or when Mr. Harvey has convinced himself that he is sick and He's trying to get his knee kicked, you know how doctors do with that little rubber hammer ;-) Well, he does it himself and kicks his leg and kicks the table * squeaks * Look at the expression on his face, How innocent !! I can not describe it, but for all those people who say they could not act very well and other comments from the fanatic, watch this movie and see what a GREAT actor it really was. You will be overwhelmed! If you're not, then I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you, you have no choice. ;-)
