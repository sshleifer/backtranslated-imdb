And I do not understand why the show is so beaten. In my opinion this show is really excellent. Well, the first two episodes were not so good, but they charge a lot of momentum in the third episode. What seems to be typical of a comedy by Steve Moffat. I would classify it as one of the best comedies that Great Britain has produced. <br /> <br /> The show itself is a farce at its best, it's not in the Fawlty Towers line, but you can definitely rank it as high as a Black Adder, Link, or The Youngsters! I'm watching the first season, and all I can say is that I'm happy to have bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> The problem probably with this program is and why it hit so hard, according to the internet, that the original press release compared it to Fawlty Towers, and everyone was disappointed that it was not! Well, even the Green Wing is closer to Fawlty Towers than this show, all I can say is that your mind is clear of all prejudices. Give the show at least one run up (including episode 3) and then decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> All I can say is thanks to Steve Moffat for writing it and thank you for all the staff who made it.
