Bright work The wonderful actors dissolve as brave and courageous characters. All the unforgettable parts in a thriller of action more than intriguing and captivating. The casting is perfect. Both from the side of the stars as: Armand Asante, Bernhardt, Kier, Denier. But also for new faces. I was very impressed by the young actor who plays the gang member, Mustafa. You trust each one of the Turkish gang. Michael Barral and all the followers of white power are very convincing. I admire the musical rhythm of the main theme of "Children of Wax". This soundtrack is a delightful mix of Turkish, hard rock and Udo Kier buzz. And at the same time, Children of Wax, "a story that focuses on racial conflicts, intolerance and brutality between skinheads and Turks.
