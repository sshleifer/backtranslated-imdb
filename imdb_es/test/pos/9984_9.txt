I was impressed by this movie. I am one of those people who take risks with movies that sometimes do not particularly attract me, and I must say that this had its reward. I mean, wow! Even my young children enjoyed the movie (5 and 6 at that time), although I'm pretty sure this was not geared to their age groups. <br /> <br /> This movie was also clean, which is a great idea. plus. It's great to sit in a movie that you thoroughly enjoy without profanity, violence (except in a very brief scene) or anything else that you are likely to find morally objectionable. <br /> <br /> This movie has taken you on a Journey that you are so willing to believe for the great performance. You feel the wide range of emotions represented along with the characters. <br /> <br /> I never thought that a golf movie would put me on the edge of my seat, but I could not help but be interested in how it is. I would not have anything to compare it with, since I have not seen golf in reality or in the movie before, but everyone did a great job to keep the rhythm and emotions captivating here. The score also did wonders; Excellent, excellent score. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not think this is your kind of movie, look at it. You can be pleasantly surprised. It certainly was.
