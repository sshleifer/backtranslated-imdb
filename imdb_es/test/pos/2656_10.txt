Spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey is undoubtedly the most challenging and successful film by Stanley Kubrick. This is not a movie you see for entertainment or fun. Instead, it offers you a feast of food for thought, images that remain in the eye of the mind long after the movie is over. It's a movie you could meditate on. <br /> <br /> The film intentionally offers us more questions than you can answer, it is meant to disconcert and mystify, but leaves the viewer with a sense of awe and reverence. (that is, allowing him to be involved in the process of seeing it, the enjoyment of this film requires an effort on the part of the spectators) the questions he raises are large and sinister, in relation to the genesis and destiny of the race human, is The most important place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of a creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself. <br /> <br /> The first of the four film quartets gives us a different view of the species' past. We see our distant ancestors, half mono half human, in a state of near starvation. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are close to starvation. An extraterrestrial object appears, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, and the animals are inspired simultaneously in their presence in the manufacture of tools and in violence. They are transformed overnight into carnivores, and when two tribes are near a water source, the tribe that has developed the ability to make tools and belligerence destroys the neighboring tribe. The new chief of the winning tribe, enabled by the first vestiges of technology, triumphantly throws the bone he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons. We soon learn that the world is torn by nuclear paranoia. The features inspired by the appearance of the monument that once helped us survive now threaten our existence. <br /> <br /> Once again, humanity is in crisis, once again the supernatural presence represented by the black monolith will intervene to help humanity in the next step in its development. In an exploration of the Moon we discover a monolith identical to the previous one that we have seen. The governments of the world, usually mortal enemies, have met in secret to discuss the implications. A mission is fixed. The monument has been involved in some type of radio communication with Jupiter. A few men will travel to the destination of the broadcast. Most of them, for the most part, will remain in a state of suspended animation. The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL, a super computer programmed to imitate all the features of human beings. <br /> <br /> The movie has many outstanding sequences. As usual in Kubrick, the use of classical music is outstanding. The most memorable ones are "Blue Danube" and "Spake Zarathustra" (especially appropriate given the theme of the film to transcend ordinary consciousness). The cinematography is also excellent, after a single time you see the last 30 minutes of the movie will pursue you for the rest of your life. <br /> <br /> The character of HAL is the most important from the point of view of the central thesis of the film. By imitating all the characteristics of human beings, it also has its negative traits. The paranoia that develops, which almost leads to the ruin of the mission, is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation on Earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the traits we must leave behind if we want to move on to the next phase of our evolution. <br /> <br /> The architecture of the film is also significant. The designs of many of the spacecraft are meant to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the film. The end of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This film takes a vision of life similar to the one presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and the novel Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce. It raises a pattern of human history and evolution that is cyclical, but progressive, and repeats the same events at great intervals, but with the human race developing according to the will of a being with a greater purpose in mind. Although we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not destined to fail, its destiny is great beyond its ability to imagine. I am still surprised that, despite this movie, many people continue to consider Kubrick as a misanthrope. <br /> <br /> This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed, but because it is an invocation of wonder before the vast panorama of existence and its implication with the deepest questions and vital to the purpose and the truth. <br /> <br /> In the hands of any other director, all this may be too much. Hollywood's view of life is too insignificant, usually to encompass the greatness and intensity of a vision like this. But Kubrick was a visionary, he leads with absolute confidence, not only that he can handle material of this type, but he is the only one who can do it. The process of making this film used all its creative resources. The writing association with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in film history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie's amazing climax. The resources to realize his vision did not exist at that time, so he created them. <br /> <br /> 2001 is an absolutely unique cinematic experience. Those who miss it do so to the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities.
