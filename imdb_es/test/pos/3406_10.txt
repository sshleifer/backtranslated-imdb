This was the only movie to watch about the Civic War. My aunt really played in this movie as an extra in the wedding scene of Justin and Madeline, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine and precise. The costumes were done with good taste, the sequence was in order and even the accents were good. I love Patrick Swayze and James Ried a lot. They were the 2 best options, and they even had a great cast of support. The Civil War is my favorite thing in the history of the United States, and I love movies about it. I've seen enough, and this movie and its sequential book North and South took the cake. If you have not seen it, rent it. As soon as possible. It is an entire education.
