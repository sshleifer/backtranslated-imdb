It's a unique movie, since it gives us the only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all his ironic glory. Because it seems so reserved and distant, it is perfect for the role of an unloved cad who uses all those around him in a practical way. However, in the last act, which is lethal and serious (no pun), when Coward must act like the Flying Dutchman, he feels much less comfortable. <br /> <br /> But his way with an epigram is unparalleled, and Hecht and Macarthur have given him some gems (Macarthur, in fact, was the wit of the couple). <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully illuminated by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement other than a storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr did not care one thing: put their dialogue on the screen. (NOTE: the same H & M have cranks and you'll miss them as vagabonds in the Flophouse scene). <br /> <br /> The most notable support player is the only Alexander Woolcott, the famous Broadway. The columnist and close friend of Macarthur and Coward, who appears as one of the malicious authors, always waited in the reception room of editor Coward. <br /> <br /> It is curious that Woolcott agrees to make a film that clearly clarifies the legendary round table of Algonquin, of which he was founder, and Macarthur something like an auxiliary member. <br /> <br /> Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for the best story, although that victory is probably due more to Coward's imposing presence than to any brilliance in the plot. It's Coward, Woolcott and the dialogue you remember ...
