If only I was allowed to watch a show in my entire life, I would definitely have to choose "The Chaser's War on Everything." Of all the satirical programs that have been on Australian television, I found "Chaser" to be the most fun of all. It's just amazing, the guys are not afraid to do anything. <br /> <br /> Whether dressing up as a Hitler to enter a Polish Club, or pushing a MASSIVE string ball around Melbourne to try the tourism ads or rock up to the Coca-Cola factory naked in a bathroom with $ 2.40 to buy some water. The Chaser boys will go there. <br /> <br /> According to the previous comments (and / or below) "The Chaser's War on Everything" is more popular than its previous program "CNNNN". But CNNNN was just as funny. Some unforgettable moments of that show ... Clean Cambodia !!! Classic. <br /> <br /> So, anyway, to prevent Ranting from continuing, I ONLY advise you to give Chaser at least one chance, you will most likely find him HILARRED!
