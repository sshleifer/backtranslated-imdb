"Hail The Woman" is one of the most moving films I've seen in my entire life. I saw him twice in a row and I sobbed my eyes. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of the silent film deserves a much wider audience; unfortunately, the only impression left is so scratched that most people will not see it completely, and the gem that shines beneath the rough will be lost. This movie could use a digital restoration to help highlight its beauty, but I doubt it will get it from anyone, since its main theme is the spiritual restoration before Christ of the family unit, and this is not politically correct these days. However, it remains a powerful theme for those whose hearts suffer from the pain of broken family relationships. <br /> <br /> The cast is magnificent, especially Florence Vidor, who literally shines as Judith, the daughter; the ethereal Madge Bellamy as Nan, the poor girl who gets pregnant and is left out; Theodore Roberts as the old dominant dominant father who destroys everyone around him with pride; and the handsome Lloyd Hughes, like the son David, afraid of his father, but really of life itself. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch at Christmas, especially. You will not regret being patient and seeing it in its entirety despite its deterioration.
