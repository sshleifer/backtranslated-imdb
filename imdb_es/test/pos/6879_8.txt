The famous actor of HK CATIII, Anthony Wong, is for once (well ... not really once, he was a cop in the films of DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS and some others ...) not a psychopathic bug in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. In general, he is recognized for his wacky role as wackadoo in "nasties" of CATIII as THE UNTOLD STORY and THE EBOLA SYNDROME. This time, Wong is at the receiving end of the nastiness ... <br /> <br /> Wong plays a boy who goes to a sorcerer who promises to give him very good dreams, for a price. True to his word, the dreams that Wong has involve having angry donkey sex with sexy schoolgirls who smoke, but dreams have a price that is more than money. The sorcerer can manipulate dreams and, with the help of a sexy ghost, blackmails Wong of his money and business, kills his family and eventually kills Wong himself ... Wong's brother comes to the city to find out what is And finally, he discovers that the murder of his family is the work of the wicked sorcerer, but it turns out that Wong's brother is a very foolish witch and, with the help of the wronged wife of the sorcerer, turns the tables on the sorcerer and his plans. .. <br /> <br /> EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the nicest CATIII movies I've seen in a long time. Absent is the harsh, dark feel of some of the other CATIII entries such as RED TO KILL, THE HISTAN STORY or HUMAN PORK CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, although it is still sleazy in terms of sex and theme, it is more "fun" than some Movies more serious of the genre. More comparable to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA: a more "carefree" CATIII entry that offers a lot in terms of nudity and a bit of gore, without being too funny either. Definitely worth checking out, especially the genre enthusiast. 8/10
