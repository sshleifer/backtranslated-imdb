I really enjoyed this movie, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well run. I think it was important that they show the other couple's life, like Terry and Bobbys, and show them as people with emotions. As this movie I needed to show Bobby as a cold and vengeful person. <br /> <br /> I agree with another criticism: it was sick love, not true love. He did not need to make great efforts as a murderer to give a baby to his wife. I should have been honest with her and told her I was sterile and decided to adopt a baby together. Some critics say that she was naive, I think it was naive when it came to adoption, even if they were the best actors in the whole world. Great movie to see !!
