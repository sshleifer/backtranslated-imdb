Thirty years before THE DEER HUNTER came this film, an excellent meditation on the effects of the war inflicted on the American family seen both by the heroes of the war and by their wives. A truly ironic title, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is anything, but since those times have vanished into fixed images and all that remains is an uncertain future for those involved. <br /> <br /> Truly a joint cast despite the top - Myrna Loy's bill, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES focuses more on the stories of men. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns to a house that has irrevocably changed as his children have grown, although he finds the support of his wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry, returning, can not find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is caught in a marriage he does not want with Marie, a carefree girl who wants more life and who increasingly hates him. . Homer Parrish, on the other hand, has greater problems due to his loss of hands in the war and feels that the whole world, including the girl he loves and his family, thinks is a phenomenon of nature. <br /> <br /> With almost three hours of duration, the film never seems long and prolonged. There are so many emotions happening even in small moments that the plot looms; nothing seems wasted or placed on the screen due to lack of editing. A performance does not sound false, although the highlights are those of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry. Even then, each character has its moment in the film, and it was the right time to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in American films (including those made around the First World War, that did not dabble in him). such subjects). While there is never overt violence, it is all there, in the enchanted expressions of the faces of the three male chiefs, in the lot where the planes now reside, ready to become garbage (and therefore, forgetfulness), in cynicism of the owners of the stores who could not bother to employ these men who had seen the battle or even worse, prompted them to wonder what was worth it. This is the movie where ARRIVING AT HOME and BORN THE FOURTH OF JULY are in debt to. At a time when the United States fled war movies, to get to this when the end of World War II was still fresh was a necessity to make a more honest film.
