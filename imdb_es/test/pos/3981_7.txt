I do not think I've seen a movie in my whole life about a high school kid who is creating his own college, just to impress his parents. Nowadays, movies are remakes or sequels, or arguments that have been used in many different movies. This has an original story and, to follow it, it becomes a comedy film that only clarifies the agreement. With this story well thought out and mixed laughter, this is a good movie. Now I have seen something better, but upon entering the theater I was thinking about another drug / beer / fraternity party with some sexual innuendos thrown in (also known as a "American Pie" movie) but I was surprised. To summarize, I enjoyed the movie and the next time you turn the role of the movies, look for the schedules of the shows in "Accepted". If you want to laugh out loud, that's it.
