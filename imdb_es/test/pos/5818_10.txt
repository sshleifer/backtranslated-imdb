Life is crazy You're crazy, I'm crazy, we're all crazy. We are all a little Minnie, and a little Moskowitz. Sometimes it seems better to be sensible ... but then, what could you be losing? <br /> <br /> You have to be you. You do not have to park cars and shout at people semi-randomly, but you can not hide behind a veil (or dark glasses) and pretend and act as if everything is fine. And sometimes, you really have to throw caution to the wind, because why are you alive? <br /> <br /> I am not going to 'rate' this love compared to the other Cassavetes movies, because they are All are absolutely 100% unique works and each has its own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives . In that sense, everyone is great, and comparisons are odious. Of course, this movie has that madness, sometimes maddening, but ultimately, wonderful and liberating quality that all your movies have: you never know what will happen next, and you never know what the characters will think, do or feel. following. Neither are the characters themselves, and do we really want to live our lives differently? Unlike Moskowitz, you can have a great job and save money on your IRA, but still live the life of an adventurer within your feelings, your spirit and your own life experience. Yes, we can have it both ways, that's what Cassavetes shows us. Thank God someone did it.
