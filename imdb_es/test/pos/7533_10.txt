"Nagisa no Shindobaddo" or "Like Grains of Sand" is an incredibly beautiful story about adolescents and girls facing the state of becoming one with who they are. This film is not about homosexuality, but about sexuality. <br /> <br /> Aihara, a distant girl, will definitely make viewers reflect on who is behind the distant girl. Does she love Yoshida? Or does she love Ito? Or did she become a lesbian in some way due to the "incident"? (I doubt it). <br /> <br /> And what about Yoshida? Do you realize that you love Ito at the end? Well, we all know that he loves him as a friend. But you will never know it once you see this movie ... haha ​​:) In the end, Aihara (together with Ito) delivers an exceptional message to the audience: what does NOT matter if you love a boy or a girl. And I have to tell you that I am so dense that I did not understand it at first. ^^ ;; It's because there are no talking scenes ... You have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and NOT by what they say (especially the final part ... wow, boy, that was confused!) It's a confusing story, but it's still beautiful. :) This movie is undoubtedly one of the best Japanese movies I've seen (and trust me, I've seen many).
