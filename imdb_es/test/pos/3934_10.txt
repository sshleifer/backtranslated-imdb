I'm not sure why this movie has such a low average in IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could want in a horror movie. This is the definition of being a horror movie. I consider myself a great fan of horror and I must say that this house delivers the goods. The house of the wax is the story of a group of university students who go to a game of football in which they decide to camp for the night and run with a strange place. When they wake up the next morning, they make an awful discovery and decide to go to the city for a broken part of the car. The city is spooky and I'm going to stop there. Because that's when the truly awful chaos begins. Trust me when I say that if you are looking for a horror movie go see this, you will love it. It is wonderfully diabolical and inventive with its murderous scenes, the story is interesting and the characters are well drawn with the actors giving them lots of personality. Paris Hilton included who is doing quite well with her part. The film is a bit superficial but it is very funny and who cares. This movie should devour the box office and all terror fans should participate. Go see House of Wax, the movie that shows skin peeling, super-glued lips, corpses of dead animals, hot wax sprinkled on a person who is still alive, a finger that is cut, a decapitation, a stick in the head and much more. I was fortunate to see this film at the premiere of Tribeca and all the actors were present to promote the film. And, anyway, they have something to be proud of! The house of wax is the ride with the most terrifying paint roller of the year! 9/10
