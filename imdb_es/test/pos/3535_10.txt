I saw the Messiah: - The first murders and I thought it was one of the best programs I've seen in my life. It was one of those programs that you think that, oh, no, I can not see the rest of this, but you feel obligated to see it just to see who did it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely incredible actor, to be able to switch between two totally different characters, one of which is the evil and nasty one who did it and the other who is Jez Clifton, the policeman. In order to do that, well, I certainly could not do it, well not without cracking anyway. I really love and love Jamie Draven with all my heart and I always will, until the end of time, I think Jamie is the sweetest, cutest and sexiest person in the world. I absolutely love Jamie in Ultimate Force also because he looks so sexy in the blacks he wore. I love Jamie Love Paula Draven <br /> <br /> -X-
