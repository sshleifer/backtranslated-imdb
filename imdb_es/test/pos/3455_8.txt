I watched this movie during a special preview in Reading, Berkshire. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Michael and Rory make a friendship, when Rory shows up at the nursing home where Michael already resides. Michael is surprised to find someone who can finally understand him, because until now his country made people think he could not communicate. <br /> <br /> Rory introduces Michael to the life he is missing. Rory is a fighting character, who does not allow his condition (Muscular Dystrophy) to affect him. <br /> <br /> They join and request independent living, and find a beautiful apartment and an assistant, and have fun to the fullest. they could dream <br /> <br /> Do not go to see this movie if you are looking for something "Entertainment". Go see this movie if you are willing to see something a little different. <br /> <br /> The story is solid, the actors are fantastic and, despite the sadness that accompanies the film, the atmosphere is encouraging. <Br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. Although if you are like me and prone to mourn, take handkerchiefs, as you will need them!
