A powerful film that has recovered much of its significance in this second half of 2007 after the new desperate movements of the Burmese people against their tyrants. I felt a complex mixture of feelings about the people there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time, along with a little anger because I feel that no one, not the countries of the world, nor themselves, are doing anything effective for this shame I think these feelings turned directly from the movie, and that they were intended when it was made, so it's a successful movie. The desire for peace, the search for enlightenment, respect for life sometimes leads to subjugation. In fact, it is the Burmese Buddhist culture that has left the doors open to its dictators. But how can you feel angry for these poor people?
