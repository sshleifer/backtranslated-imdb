The 1979 musical film by HAIR was loosely based on the infamous Broadway musical of the 1960s that became famous due to its infamous nude scene. The musical scene is not really much more than a group of parodies united with some fun musical numbers; However, for film director Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar for directing ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and the writers took the basic premise of the play and the score and built a real story to make the show more "easy to use "for the big screen. In the film, the naive farmer Claude Hooper Buchowski (John Savage) is about to join the army and decides to spend a couple of days in New York, where he meets a group of elderly hippies (Treat Williams, Dorsey Wright, Annie Golden, Don Dacus) that involved him in a group of crazy adventures, including the search for a girl from the presumed society (Beverly D'Angelo). The story is divided into a series of vignettes ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime, but all are beautifully photographed with an intelligent use of the places of New York City and the imagined musical numbers (with an outstanding choreography of the legendary Twyla Tharp ). Treat Williams lights up the screen as Berger, the unconventional and free-spirited hippie who does everything he can to make Claude relax and joins the scene of Savage as Claude, who brings a lovely sweetness to the role of Claude. Annie Golden is a lovely one who Jeannie, the pregnant hippie who is pregnant with Wright or Dacus, does not know what the father is and does not seem to care. Here is an outstanding musical number ... "Aquarius" is a tour of Central Park that includes horses dancing ... Treat Williams interrupts an elegant dinner at "I Got Life" ... "Black Boys / White Boys" presents the deceased Nell Carter and Ellen Foley extolling the ethnic virtues of men and "Easy to Be Hard" is a powerful interpretation of one of the best songs on the show by original cast member Cheryl Barnes, who plays the ex-girlfriend and mother of Wright of his son. This is a beautifully photographed trip, sung well and danced with psychedelic acid from a film that must be seen and seen once, will initiate multiple presentations as this dazzling has much to offer to capture everything in a single sample.
