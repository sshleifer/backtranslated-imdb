This movie has no pretension to being a great art, which is good. But it's a well-written script with well-developed characters and solid acting. I think if I wrote it, I could do without the drama that surrounds the wife, but it did not distract me enough to detract from the main story about the character of Minnie Driver. I think, too often, Hollywood abandons a real-quality writing attempt to try to inject more visual drama when, with an adult movie like this, the kind of emotional drama is all that is really needed, and probably more credible as well. . In general, it is a very well made offer and it is worth seeing.
