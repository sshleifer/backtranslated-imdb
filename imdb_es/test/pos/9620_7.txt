Chang Chang Ho's martial arts film, "Five Fingers of Death," from 1972, is considered by many film experts and fans of the kung-fu movie to be the martial arts movie that started it all. <br /> <br /> Being launched in 1972, it was the second phase of the three-step process that would lead to the explosion of martial arts films in the West: "Billy Jack" (1971), with its famous showdown of Hapkido in the park, was released the previous year, and Bruce Lee starred in "Enter the Dragon" (1973) two years later, thus solidifying the place of martial arts films in Western cinema. <br /> <br /> But, what's all the fuss about "Five Fingers of Death"? The film, with its terrible dubbing, explosive (if not very improbable) sequences of action and technical failures and everything, has a plot, although very fine. Chih-Hao (the late Lo Lieh) is a young and dedicated Chinese gong-fu student who is selected to represent his school in an upcoming martial arts tournament. His teacher offers to allow him to train himself in the fighting style "Iron Fist", a style so lethal that he could easily kill a man in one fell swoop. <br /> <br /> In addition, Chih-Hao's arrival at school coincides with a violent conflict with a rival school, its students and a trio of murderous killers from Japan. Before you know it, a major setback threatens Chih-Hao's training, and her ability to represent her beloved school at the next tournament. <br /> <br /> Let me say that "Five Fingers of Death" is, in fact, the movie that started it all. As another viewer mentioned, "Five Fingers of Death" helped establish many standards in martial arts films over the next three decades: martial arts films from Asia, Europe and North America. Such standards include the dedicated student, the learning of patience and endurance, the conflicts between rival schools, the intense ethnic animosity between the Chinese and the Japanese, and the learning of a fighting system for that good reason of action film to the old one: revenge. "Five Fingers of Death" would also be a great influence in the films "Kill Bill" by American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino (Tarantino borrows quite liberally from this project, among many others, so he knows). <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good, considering the fact that this is a martial arts movie from the early 1970s, the best of which is Lo Lieh. As an atypical student of martial arts, his performance is quite innovative, although at first glance in this film you would not really know it because of the way that particular character has been killed so many times over the years. He is quite humble in his performance, doing everything possible to persevere over his enemies and not fight against them with anger or bow to their level of stupidity or arrogance. Also, when he suffers his big setback, he makes his heart sink a little because he is so brutal and wonders if he will recover enough to realize his lifelong ambition. <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers of Death" is a classic in every way. It is by no means perfect, and viewers would be crazy if they expected something of the caliber of the "Godfather" of martial arts films. What it does offer is the latest example of hand-to-hand combat in the East since the time before Oriental cinema was an important element in the West. <br /> <br /> 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS: "Enter the Dragon" Bolo Yeung also appears as the Mongolian street fighter near the beginning of the movie.
