This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable. Add Rita Hayworth as her love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as her partner and you have the ingredients to please the crowd, which is exactly how it turned out. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays Danny McGuire, owner of a nightclub in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the "wrong side of the tracks" in the films of the 40s) whose main attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) Rita is charming, and even plays a double role as the grandmother of Rusty and Rusty. Rusty has a chance at the great moment through the machinations of John Coudair (Otto Kruger), who romanced and lost Rusty's grandmother. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Danny cutting Rusty, to the detriment of his club, because she has a chance of success that he can not give her. But, of course, that's not what Rusty finally wants, because, as usual in the movies of that time, the right guy is the only thing in the girl's mind. No surprises, but everyone does it well. <br /> <br /> Kelly does the first of her incredible trick dances, this time with herself as a reflection of a glass window. He was the master in that kind of dance, and one still has to wonder how they synchronized everything so precisely that it really seems to be in two places at once. The melodrama gets a little thick, and there are some gratuitous war references that do little, but they provide the opportunity for a song or two, but Kelly takes this movie to the next level. This was before it became a mega-star and too soft, perhaps for its own sake. An underlying edge of the crudity of his character gives him a believable and almost melancholic air. <br /> <br /> Kelly's character in the 1980 "Xanadu" was also called Danny McGuire. This movie was the beginning, the movie at the end, of an incredible career for a dance genius. Clearly, this movie meant a lot to him. Highly recommended
