A film like Crossfire puts another film that extends around his social conscience, that is, the recent movie Crash, almost to shame. Not necessarily because either of them exposes their most rotten intolerance message (although I would bet that Crash throws the hammer much thicker compared to this), but by the way in which the narrative and the devices never become so complex. As with Crash. It may not be really necessary to compare the two, since Crossfire is at its core in the depths of the black cinema vein as if it were style. Actually, it was interesting to see what director Edward Dmytryk said in the DVD interview, where he mentioned that the budget for the photo was significantly lower (on purpose) so that more could be spent on the actors, and the calendar was made at a Very fast, fast pace. But then, what is striking about the image is that one would think that looking at many of the lighting configurations that took a lot. Just for a small scene, like when Robert Mitchum's Keeely enters for the first time to interrogate him with Captain Robert Young, the contrasts of shadows in the room are exquisite. That there are many other lighting configurations that go even further with so few marks, as essential in the field of the appearance of the black period. Just take a look at a picture of the characters on a staircase, the bars that are silhouetted against them and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> But going back to the essential part of the film, it's really a story that consists of a murder mystery, but that we, as a public, do not take long to find out the answer. Then, it is more about something else in the mind and soul of a murderer that would not be found in a common crime image at that time, since in reality there are no "criminals" for the most part in the movie. There is a very calculated risk with this, then, that the characters could be too thin to keep the message (worthwhile) against anti-Semitism. But Dmytryk's direction of his cast on the top shelf, along with a really fantastic script by John Paxton, throws the characters, less of which, so they should not seem too thin along with the message. And what would then be a noir without any attitude that accompanies it? Mitchum helps him, even in scenes like between him and Young, where he bases a lot on the situation of the moment of the story (that is, a detail in the plot), by injecting a bit of wit in some of the dialogues. It may already be in the lines, but it helps the character have a good advantage for his scenes. <br /> <br /> There's also Robert Ryan, who stands out in Montgomery as a man you know you do not know. 'I like it a lot at first, only through his bs. behavior, but you're not totally sure about that either. Then, once it begins to clear up, ironically, through a subjective point of view of the suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) in the department of Samuels, who will soon pass away, his performance becomes a great act of balance to be full of trash. Also quite frightening in his blind way. It is a good performance when it is also countered with Cooper, who has real personal problems that he faces and presents himself with regret and humility. However, it is really after the film ends that one thinks about a lot of this, and while watching the film, it is more about entering the dialogue and the flow of the scenes, and the camera movements sometimes raw and overwhelming in the scene. Actors, so the message is somewhat secondary. It's not that it's not important, especially for the period of time (coming from WW2), but years later it's seeing the actors, even those who do not get the great status as Gloria Grahame as Ginny (the femme fatale of the image, if I had time for one that does not have) and William Phipps as Leroy (the "hick"), working on each other and cling to the compact script. <br /> <br /> Dmytryk is also very wise when choosing to limit the musical score, it is also powerful, because for long periods we do not hear anything, and especially when it appears, it is secondary to the surroundings of the character. It could easily have disappeared with musical notes added in some dramatic scenes to emphasize them, more specifically to the audience that opens the movie. By staying away from that, and getting the right attitudes and nuances in the camera and the cast, it raises the standards in the genre material to a very fine and memorable level. My favorite scene would probably go to Finley's story about an Irish immigrant that he tells Leroy, where all those elements fall into place. I may not get very high on top of my favorite noirs, and yet I release Murder My Sweet as the director's masterpiece in these types of images, but it is certainly higher in quality than anything on level B.
