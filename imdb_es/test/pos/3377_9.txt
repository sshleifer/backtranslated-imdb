I wanted to see this, to see the show from within. He told the story more about Robin Williams, after Mork & Mindy. Still, I thought it was great. We have to see, Robin is always "on", whatever happens. The performance of Diamontopolous was incredible. <br /> <br /> The presentations of the main players seem very real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so lovely in this, that he helped me overcome all of Williams' energy. The small pieces behind the scenes of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), were enlightening. I also thought that the Richmond-Peck Harvey was also a pretty rock in the pond. (This is a good thing). <br /> <br /> This film told the historical story of the people of Hollywood, going through the ups and downs of stardom. He kept me glued to my TV, and I learned to love Robin, well, hell, almost everyone seems to be the super people that I sometimes think is Hollywood. Go figure. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder why the people in the network are always interpreted as idiots. We never saw the head of ABC. I just heard it, like Charlie by Charlie Angels (I wonder if I planned it that way). It seems so sad, that a program at number 1, can be destroyed by its own network. <br /> <br /> I think this story could be told about anyone's life, as they climb the ladder of any job. The movies and the stars of television are always loved or hated by so many people that you grew up with, you just want to go back to the past, remember your own past. I remember seeing the program, and always wondering what happens in their personal lives. <br /> <br /> Mork and Mindy, they will always be part of me, and I have to see part of them. It may not be all the truth, it is not a lie either, but in the end, he told me a sad, sad and wonderful story.
