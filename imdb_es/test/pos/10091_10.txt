I must say that I am an avid fan of horror movies, and I am not currently weary of foreign horror. Since the horror of the United States really depends too much on the blood. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic. This movie reminded me a lot of the SIXTH SENSE of M. Night. The way the film was directed was great. The director took his time to fix everything. It took a good 40 minutes to set up the movie in a horror movie. I thought the movie was just a drama. This movie simply accumulates and the reward is not too much. <br /> <br /> I've never done this before, but this is the main reason why I liked the movie ... I actually shouted out loud because a scene startled me a lot ... which is a bit pathetic ... but for a movie to do that, it's great.
