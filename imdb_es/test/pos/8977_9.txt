I stopped watching "The West Wing" after Aaron Sorkin stopped writing and producing. It just was not the same. Imagine my excitement at seeing a movie that he wrote again. It's been a long time - The American president, some good men. His script was a beautiful mixture of humor and tragedy. He made a compelling story believable and made me cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was amazing as a small-time Texas congressman whose constituents just wanted lower taxes and keep their guns. It's not a difficult job, so he had a lot of time to joke, and that's what he did. The staff in his office looked like he was at the Playboy Mansion. As he said, "you can teach them to write, but you can not teach them how to grow tits." Despite her sexist attitude, which fits perfectly with a member of the Texas Congress, they were fiercely loyal, especially her assistant, Amy Adams (Junebug and former Hooters). <br /> <br /> Now, add a rich socialite from Texas who wants something made in Afghanistan, perfectly interpreted by Julia Roberts; and a CIA agent who deals with the pain in his boss, superbly done by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you have a movie that is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Outstanding writing, superlative acting and a story that needed to be told. What more do you want in the cinema?
