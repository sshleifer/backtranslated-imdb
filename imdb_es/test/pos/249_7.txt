Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour - she's one of Danny McGuire's club dancers, the most special according to Danny (Gene Kelly) and almost anyone who finds her. For example, the magnate of the Vanity magazine John Coudair (Otto Kruger): delighted by the resemblance of Rusty with his grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks), whom he courted with devotion when he fell in love with her, tries to relive his youth fixing what he thinks went wrong between him and Maribelle. He does not believe that Danny can give Rusty happiness, or everything that she should be entitled to, even makes Danny believe it. When Rusty reaches fame as Vanity's 'Cover Girl', Danny takes her into the ready and expected arms of Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman). So, what happens when Danny returns to the city with his partner Genius (Phil Silvers) in tow, only to discover that Rusty is marrying Wheaton? <br /> <br /> As a musical, COVER GIRL benefits from the beautiful score and the written songs. by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, including the Oscar-nominated 'Long Ago and Far Away' (possibly one of the most beautiful ballads ever written and beautifully, sweetly sung as a duo of Hayworth and Kelly), Maribelle's number 'Sure Thing '(the most mediocre' Poor John 'is not a Kern / Gershwin collaboration) and' Put Me To The Test '. The dance, of course, is top-notch, as Gene Kelly had more than one hand in the choreography. Shows in the simplest of dances, for example, his dance with Hayworth to "Put me to the test", or the cheerfully exuberant number "Make Way For Tomorrow" (played by the trio of Danny, Rusty and Genius) ... prefigures the reaction of the character of Gene to the police police in the title number in SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN. Kelly, in particular, got a technological and artistic blow with the dance 'Alter-Ego'. Like his successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (Jerry the Mouse and the 16 minute ballet respectively), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity that Kelly brought to modern musical cinema: wanting to use the medium of cinema for the current dances that could not be shown on stage, and years before the CGI, Kelly insisted on dancing with the only person who could possibly match him in talent and style: himself. The number barely lasts five minutes, but (and the genius of Kelly) still runs out of breath, even sixty years later. This is the reason why I saw COVER GIRL, and if not, this dance is really worth it. <br /> <br /> It can be said that a lot of money was lavished on COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth, it's not that she does not deserve it. Witness the scene when Rusty arrives on Broadway: the big screen that shows the different cover girls gives way to an astonishingly large stage set up for Rusty's entrance. Hayworth is in fact one of the most beautiful girls without effort that are shown in the film, and dances with a style and grace almost worthy of Kelly. (Very few of Kelly's co-stars have that honor). She is hilarious in some scenes, for example, her drunken scene when John and Wheaton come to look for her from Joe. <br /> <br /> For some reason, however, his performance still lacks the spark of grandeur that would help COVER THE GIRL to overcome her general curse of mediocrity. That curse only rises whenever Gene Kelly is on the screen (dancing or not), or when Eve Arden, like John's long-suffering secretary, "Stonewall", goes through another cutting comment or intelligent observation. As the film, in the end, belongs to Hayworth, neither Kelly nor Arden can save it in its entirety. This does not mean that the movie is bad, it is not. It is entertaining, with great songs and nice numbers and many beautiful girls to watch. But it is not a classic. The dance is classic, so look at COVER GIRL and you will not regret it.
