The numbers do not lie, 109 people have voted for this movie. That says a lot about the position of one of the most intuitive and intuitive comedians of the late twentieth century. And for those of you who know the work of Bill Hicks, if he were alive today, imagine what he would have to say about the child president of his home state? That his short career is not recognized is a sad situation and this movie, or rather these two films explain why. First, you see how his talent was obvious from the beginning, over and over again, those who knew Bill Hicks always say that it was not only fun, it was also unique. The film also shows how the quality of its material was too challenging for many in the entertainment industry. His alcohol consumption also contributed to the problems of his career, but that is less evident in this movie. And then the second movie is a complete performance. If you have never seen or heard Bill Hicks, this is a wonderful introduction to the person and his dark but intelligent humor. Especially due to the fact that the issues are now almost 14 years old and, however, remain ironically updated, which is highlighted by the fact that many of the events took place under the first President Bush. <br /> <br /> Watching them together - first the biography and then the presentation - makes you aware of how talented this young man was, how fast his life was spent and how the American media can sometimes act like the great homogenizer Let's make sure that nothing is too provocative, that nothing is too interesting. And the result? Well, as the man himself said, go to sleep in the United States, his government is in control ... In his life, at least in Britain, this artist was recognized for his talent and succeeded there. 11 years after his death, 109 people in IMDb can say something about the film. After having seen both of them, I hope you understand why more people should be listening to Bill Hicks.
