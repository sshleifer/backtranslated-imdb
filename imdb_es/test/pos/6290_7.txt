Despite me, I really like this movie. Pauley Shore is invariably laughing out loud and is an exception. It is excellent to play the weirdo with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> His performance in this, although nothing out of the ordinary for him, is so good that it seems to improve the performances of other cast members. Perhaps this is because it is the kind of person from whom it is easy to bounce. <br /> <br /> The clich√©s about country life in this film are hilarious and because of the way the "city boy" of Shore, "Crawl" is so at odds with the lifestyle is also fun, but not just the one who is a fish out of water; The comedy also comes from the fact that, for any person or "normal" person, Crawl is a monstrous nightmare of a person. That's why this movie works in an excellent way: we love Crawl, it's a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathize with the Warners. He is a hell of a cultural shock. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is the classic Pauley Shore, so you do not need a great mental capacity to enjoy the movie, enjoy it, and there is even a "never judge a book by its cover" type moral here somewhere. Not bad, not bad at all.
