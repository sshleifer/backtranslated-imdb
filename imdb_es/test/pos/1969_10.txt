This was a movie that I found by accident. I was flipping through and I saw that it was on Showtime, so I saw it. Now I see it at least once a month. This is a movie that is full of symbols that can make some people destroy it. Do not listen to people who hate this movie, if they want an action film with expensive f / x, they should have rented a movie that promises them. If you're in the mood for a good science fiction, I recommend it. If I buy on DVD I recommend the Alliance Atlantic edition of the film, it contains many more extras than the Dimension Films edition.
