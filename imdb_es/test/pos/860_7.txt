I enjoyed this movie very much and to this day, this year, it is one of my favorites. The story was excellent, although the turn at the end was too predictable and I knew what would happen too soon. Usually, when this happens, the film spoils me (like "The Others"), but even knowing the result, I enjoyed it until the end. Looking at the comments of others, many people were impressed with the performance of Kelly Overton (Eve), I'm afraid she was not. His performance seemed to me the weak part of the film, in contrast to the incredible performance (or characterization) of James Haven (Don Wake) ... I hope we see more of him. What a great little movie, highly recommended for everyone!
