Before reviewing this film, I must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film critic. Anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that I have always been controversial in a discreet sense, giving high marks to failures such as "Captain America" ​​and "Creatura" of 1985 and exploring film classics such as Alistar Sim " A Christmas story "and" Shakespeare in love ". Keeping this in mind, this confession may not come as a surprise: <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. Woah, now, do not start crazing yourself yet. Let me explain: in no way do I believe that he is the best actor in the world. I clearly confess that it is not. It's certainly not Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins, but I would say that his ability to act is probably somewhere with at least Bruce Willis. However, what I admire about him are the human qualities that he brings to his heroes of action. He is just an average boy who laughs and cries and bleeds, who is a hero because he has to be, not necessarily because he wants to be one. In my opinion, it takes a lot to be able to highlight those qualities in a character (especially in the films in which he has worked), and Lambert's heroes are very far from those of Schwartzennegger or Stallone. Frankly, Lambert's characters are easier for me to relate to. Therefore, he is not the best actor in the world ... He is just a personal favorite. <br /> <br /> I can not say the same, however, for your movies. As much as I interpret his performance, it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leaves something to be desired. Frankly, most of them are terrible, and whatever ridicule I've done over the years is not due to their performance, but to their bad choice in the scripts. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, I can say that his debut film, "Tarzan", is one of his best films and probably his best performance. As I mentioned, it is effective because of the humanity it brings to the role, and because of the seriousness with which the director, the writers and the actors handle the material. This is a jump away from the action adventures of the B movie with Johnny Weismeller of the 1940s. In fact, I would hesitate to call it an action movie. Instead, it is a serious drama that takes seriously all the material of E.R. Burrough, showing Tarzan's quest to discover his true family in Scotland after realizing he does not fit like a "white monkey". He is divided between his old family and his new one, which includes a wonderful Sir Ralph Richardson in his latest role. In an attempt to adapt to humans, her simian instincts are also activated, and she can not decide what she loves most: her real family, or the one she has always known. In general, it is a wonderful commentary on society and a wonderful study of characters. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, he launched Lambert into international stardom, which continued in the 1980s with films like "Highlander" and "The Sicilian." Unfortunately, it did not last. But wait a moment ... His recent career moves like "Gideon" and "Resurrection" have shown that, although he still has a long way to go, he is an actor competent enough to be able to make a ... a ... return if he simply chooses his roles better. <br /> <br /> For now, however, here is the verdict in his first film: <br /> <br /> **** ***
