A history of obsessive love, where the characters have been extremely convincing. I think this film highlights the talent of professional actors. Especially for Vincent Cassel, who would not be (at the time it was filmed) the first character you can think of for that role. And yes, he managed to seduce the beautiful Monica Belluci, beyond the film, during this creation. I can only say that this movie should have been released as it is in the United States, instead of thinking about doing a remake. It's just so French, almost perverted ... and yet, so true ... this film must remain intact ... <br /> <br /> A director who should definitely get more projects, since this kind of The theme requires the correct amount of ingredients so that it is not a failure.
