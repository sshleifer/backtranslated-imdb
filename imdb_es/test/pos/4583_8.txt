This must be the dumbest movie I've seen and that's why it deserves a special prize. OK, so it starts pretty well, logical, humor and then quickly changes to complete and pronounce uh f @ rt, @ ss, f√∂ck stupidity that makes a lot of sense. The strange thing is that I barely laughed at that, although I suppose it's supposed to be fun, with a very serious message. After thinking why I did not laugh, the answer was quite clear ... this movie is much more realistic than I would like it to be. So it is extremely silly, but very wise if the goal was to reach people who are not 'blessed' with many neurons, synapses and electrolytes (eh, electrolytes?). This movie could actually be understood at some level by a large audience! <br /> <br /> Although they probably just laugh. <br /> <br /> Ah, well, good try ... <br /> <br /> Now I'm editing (adding well) my comment, because I read some of the other comments. First I noticed that some people see racism in this movie. Well, that did not cross my mind when I saw it. However, I can imagine that if you look from that perspective, you will see some. Of course, we could debate the link between intelligence and race, but I think this is not the place to do it. I wonder, if we were to classify the Huxtable family here, would you complain that they were all black? I do not think so, but I suppose you could ... (aside from that, of the 2 wiser people in the world, half, the woman, does not seem totally Caucasian, what's the problem?) <br /> < br /> Second, the film gets very varied ratings; from 1 to 10 and everything else, but there is a lot of polarization, which means that the film does its job very well. It agitates people, makes them want to talk about it and judge it. That means it's a good movie, like it or like it. After 5 minutes it becomes very predictive and boring, but you still see this shit. I guess you're still hoping it's not like that. Or maybe it's our sick way of seeing terrible accidents. Well, this is one sure.
