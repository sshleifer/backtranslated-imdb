When I was a kid, I loved "Tiny Toons". I especially loved "Tiny Toons: How I spent my summer vacation". I thought it was laughs on the funny floor. A few years later, my friend had the video. And I thought I would see it for the good old days. I was still on the floor laughing. My opinion, the work of Plucky and Hampton is the best. They decide to go to "Happy World Land". And they end up having a crazy adventure to get there. All the parodies are fun. I'm still looking for the video. Therefore, if someone has any advice. Please write to me. <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest cartoons I've seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
