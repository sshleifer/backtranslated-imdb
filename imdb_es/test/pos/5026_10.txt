Honestly, I loved Michael. Even though there was "give me a pillow, I need to take a nap", it was great. I think everyone did a great job in this movie. and Nora Ephron is on my "good" list of directors. <br /> <br /> It's good to see John Travolta as a potbellied angel. It is not often that you see one in a movie. Some people may call this a boring movie, but I loved it. Angels and everything.
