The movie is excellent. One of the most notable things about this is that Flynn's performance is excellent. It is worth emphasizing this, since he was often ridiculed as an actor by Bette Davis et al. <br /> <br /> I remember the scene in which Flynn intoxicates Arthur Kennedy to take him to his destiny in the battle of the Little Great Horn. The cold, calculating look on Flynn's face as he does so is extraordinary, much better than the much-acclaimed Spencer Tracy or many other stars could have done it. <br /> <br /> The other thing to note is the excellent performance of George P. Huntley Jr. as a lieutenant "own queen" Butler. It is disconcerting why he stopped making movies shortly after, one would have thought that they would have created it for years later as a character actor.
