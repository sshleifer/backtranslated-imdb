I heard an interview with the main actor who said that the movie was not meant to be a horror movie, but he himself would describe it as a mental horror. I subscribe strongly to that. <br /> <br /> It is not clear why he travels to this place, but everything is monotonous, with no bright colors, no honest smiles, nothing personal. Everything is orderly and everyone seems to be satisfied living this kind of life. Our "hero", although from the beginning it seems out of place and he feels it himself. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so important and good is the remarkable similarity to life in many large cities or even countries today. You have to work, you must not allow your colleague to know your weaknesses, show your wealth, your car, etc., and above all you lack the true love for life that children have. Naturally, in this film you do not see children or elderly people, they just do not fit into a society of strong workers. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone, and I will make sure that this utopia does not come. true!
