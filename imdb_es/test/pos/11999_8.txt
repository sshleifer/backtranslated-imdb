In the end, it is clear that the murderers placed the murder weapon in Mrs. Columbo's car and went to the police ballistics laboratory. <br /> <br /> But where did the gun come from under the hood, used in the demonstration? Would not the killers have cleaned things under the hood? Did they have a whole week? Or did the Columbo policemen replicate the camera / gun under the hood that was used in the demonstration? How did they do that without breaking and getting into the car? Maybe that's why the murders seemed surprised at the end. But how could Columbo replicate his camera / gun device and calibrate it for his keychain? Columbo must have recovered the ballistics weapon and replanted it under the hood of the car, and was very lucky that the rest of the device with the camera was still there and transmitting. <br /> <br /> This was a 10/10 sample until this obvious plot error at the end.
