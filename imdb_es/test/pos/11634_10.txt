Yes, Barney does not make sense now, but when I was a child it made a lot of sense. <br /> <br /> I have not become smarter, but I enjoyed it. As a child I scoffed because nobody could say my name, so I changed it. Since I was 4 years old I have called Tina de Barney because I could relate to her being from a different culture. Now I am 17 years old and Barney is a big part of my life. ... my name came from there ... I can not see the show I grew up with, no matter how stupid it seems now. <br /> <br /> I do not care if they block me, I have nothing else to say. They should not do the minimum of 10 lines because some people just do not have much to say. Ok, done
