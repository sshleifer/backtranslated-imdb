While reading the comments, I was surprised to find one that said that this movie "was not very deep". I have to disagree: this has to be one of the most profound and stimulating films I've seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; They have been praised again and again in criticism. However, I also praise the heart of the film. It resonates with deep meaning and feeling, it is a story of redemption. These are two very different and very defective characters, defeated by life but too strong to lie down and die. It is about a man seeing more value in a girl than what she saw in herself. It strongly reminded me of the book Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers, which has a similar story of redemption. Yes, the images and the themes are messy and, sometimes, shocking, but if you look closely enough, you can see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the truest things in life are not pretty, but they are real.
