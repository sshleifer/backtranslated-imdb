I always thought that a movie that has a plot that focuses on a virtual reality video game never sounds like it's something special, but eXistenZ showed that it could not have been more wrong. This movie is amazing and, although it is very entertaining, it offers much more than that. From beginning to end, this film has conceptualized it to the point where it can have so many ideas that it can not reach a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has talent for this, since he does many things. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; The way it is written and the way it is written is very unique to your style and can only be a good thing. Cronenberg set a clear goal with this movie and it was to keep the audience guessing what he did with apparent ease. His fondness for the grotesque is not as prevalent in this film as it is in The Fly or Naked Lunch, but there are still some elements, such as the game capsules and the way they are made, that can make the audience shudder. With respect to his previous work, eXistenZ is more a combination of Videodrome and less violent Scanners, a rather impressive combination. Placing the film in the not too distant future was a really good decision, since it allowed Cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the environment of the films and also allowed him to visualize more concepts, allowing a less inhibited writing. It was important that the film was not too confused and Cronenberg avoided it very well by keeping things relatively simple. Also, if I wanted to make a movie that can not be seen, I would know how to do it much better than this. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ has a cast of extremely talented characters and everyone has a very good performance. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives outstanding performance as the game designer who spends more time out of reality than in him. Leigh is sexy and dominant in her role as Allegra and she really has her teeth in the paper. The emotional range shown in the film is particularly impressive, making it completely believable (if you can believe something). Jude Law is also good and is very convincing in his character's fear of implantation. The chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film a little more flavor. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are just two of the great supporting actors who add more depth to the film with colorful performances. The cast of the film is not huge, but eXistenZ definitely has the ethic of "quality is better than quantity", which works very well. <br /> <br /> In addition to being entertaining and stimulating, eXistenZ addresses social issues such as Control and loss of self. This further proves the film as an intellectual vessel and could also explain why it was not a Hollywood hit. eXistenZ has a lot to offer and, although it may not be everyone's taste, those who like Cronenberg's work or those who like science fiction will almost certainly like this movie. It's one of those movies that needs to be seen with an open mind but it's really something special.
