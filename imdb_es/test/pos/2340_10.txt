Seriously attractive, intelligent and provocative at its best. Mean, exciting, capricious and captivating. Each house must have a copy! Do not take my word for you to see it yourself. One Life Stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. The beautiful photography and the impressive performance make it one of the best cinematographic experiences of the year. The debut of John Kielty is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and rough film. This is a film that cares and has an unparalleled honesty in recent years. There are no car chases, but a movie full of hums and emotions. The first time I saw this film was screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000 and now I am delighted to have a DVD copy.
