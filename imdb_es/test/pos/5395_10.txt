This movie was great! I love the way he mixes dark humor with drama. There are times when you think there is no possible way to laugh at the situation presented, and yet you experience a surprising giggle. He performed wonderfully, with great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels and Emile Hirsch. It is well written with an elegant and surprising ending. I'm not someone who says that everyone will like it as much as I do, but give it a try and fix it. The DVD has excellent special features, including full comments from the director, Dan Harris and Emile Hirsch and one from Sigourney Weaver, who provide interesting information about the film. I hope my comment is useful, and that you enjoy the movie!
