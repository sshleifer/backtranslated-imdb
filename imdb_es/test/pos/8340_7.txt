This is one of those movies that seems so "outdated" that being like that is part of the fun. You see and hear things that you would NEVER see or hear on the silver screen today. Some of that is good; something too corny for words, something bad (depending on your views on certain cultural issues). <br /> <br /> For example, in this short film (68 minutes) of 1931 you have: <br /> <The grandfather of the family that appears in this story exalts the value of patriotism and why one should speak in against the criminals for the good of the United States (picture that in today's movies!) <br /> <br /> A district attorney (Walter Huston) almost asking for death sentences and the proven population supports 100 percent (once again, imagine in today's movies). <br /> <br /> Along the way, there is something shocking violence, like that of a child who was picked up a few times and, literally, throwing his head in the closet, and that his father was repeatedly picked up and beaten with the head towards the wall. This is a difficult thing, to say the least. <br /> <br /> However, the film is peppered with comedy, mostly by the patriotic grandfather, played memorably by Charles "Chic" Sales. There is a lot of laughter for all those who see this unique crime movie. And, for the soft touches, are the two young people, one of whom, Dickie Moore, became a very famous child actor in his time. Here, he is just a little boy about 5 years old who, understandably, is far from being a refined actor, but you can see stardom on the horizon. In fact, he did it the following year with a solid performance in "Blonde Venus", starring Marlene Dietrich. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is an entertaining movie due to an effective mix of violence, comedy and sentimentality. .... and has a nice ending to feel good and a stimulating message. I was also ready for an Academy Award, for "Best Writing, Original Story." I'm sorry to say that it's only available to watch on cable TV, since it's never been put on VHS or DVD ... and that's a shame.
