I had no expectations when I started watching this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful and twisted movie that will give your mind a good workout! It's not simple If you only enjoy the style of the Police Academy, movies without brains, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep and complex film with influences from films like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with many completely new ideas. The wonderful twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story make this one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Be open minded, and you will love it!
