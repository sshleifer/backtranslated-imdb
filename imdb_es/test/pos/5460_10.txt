Although it's a cable TV movie made by HBO, it's a nice movie and a fascinating look at the world of television. Allowing the viewer to take a look behind the scenes of the so-called night wars in the early 90's, while Jay Leno and David Letterman competed for the coveted position as host of the Tonight Show. Kathy Bates gives a good performance as Leno's business manager, Helen Kushnick, and one can feel empathy for what Leno / Letterman endured at the hands of television executives. Now it's just as timely, considering the recent events that involve ABC's failed attempt to replace Nightline with Letterman. No matter how many times I've seen this movie, it's still a pleasure to watch it like I did when it was first broadcast. If it were ever released on DVD, I would definitely add it to my collection.
