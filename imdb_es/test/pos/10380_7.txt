The NVA combines oriental humor, military comedy and teen film. Although somehow it is sentimental typical of a German movie, I think it is a great movie and very funny. Not only will he laugh at the NVA, but he will also get some information about the East German armed forces of the late eighties and how young recruits and professional soldiers experienced the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the German democrats. Republic. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy the NVA if you liked Sonnenallee (another film directed by Leander Hau√ümann), but not necessarily if you enjoyed Good Bye Lenin, which is much more serious and less obviously fun. <br /> <br /> The acting is acceptable. But beware of the former singer of the boy band Kim Frank, who has only two facial expressions: natural and surprised cymbal eyes!
