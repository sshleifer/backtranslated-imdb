Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna was a historical television and television film composed of two stars, based on Peter Kurth's book, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. It remains historically enough, names are changed, etc. But it adheres pretty well to the real story. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom do quite well as the Russian royal family, Tsar Nicholas and Tsarina Alexandra. What remained in my mind were the too-short representations of Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. In general, it was a quite elegant production with good performance. I was amazed at the production values ​​when it was first aired on NBC in late 1986. It was also starred by the excellent German actor Jan Niklas, who had previously participated in NBC's other Russian epic film, "Peter the Great." <br /> <br /> I felt that Part 2 omitted some important details of Anna Anderson's trip to the United States. It is also important to know that in 1986 less was known about Anna Anderson's story. Back then, it was not known if her claim to be Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine. In the late 1990s, more was known and it is said that Anna Anderson has been a fraud. <br /> <br /> Too bad the networks are no longer making well-made movies for television like this one.
