As the Muppet movies go, this is easily and clearly the best. It features lots of cameos from great comedy stars of the era, a solid script and some great Disney songs, and combines them in the culmination of the best show of Henson's talent. The story is basic, and jokes have many levels to entertain both adults and children who were marketed, without exposing them to ideologies that their parents can not find desirable. <br /> <br /> This is just fun, but it's also a well-made classic, well-written and beautifully attractive. <br /> <br /> Rate a 8.9 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
