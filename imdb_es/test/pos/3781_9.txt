Chaplin enters the trenches of World War I in this energetic comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions: all these things are present, but Chaplin seems strangely alien to everyone. On the one hand, he's in France: to fight against the Germans, something he does with incredible success. <br /> <br /> It almost seems like an extensive ego trip for Chaplin, very funny until the last minute. when it rises to a new level of intensity and everything makes sense. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's what all the soldiers dream before going to war.
