If you love the drive-in cheeze of the early 70's, you'll love this one. How can you make a mistake with a low-budget movie about bloodshed in an asylum? You can not Crazy people and sharp objects are always an entertaining combination. <br /> <br /> It seems that the movie was filmed in someone's home for approximately $ 320.65. For me, that is dedicated to the fun of seeing this kind of thing. The blood is a little gentle compared to others in this class, but there is enough to keep our bloodthirsty patients (like me) happy. Some horror movies drag parts and leave you waiting for something to happen. That is not the case here. The characters are entertaining enough to make each picture fun. There is never a dull moment from beginning to end. The mind is melting. The climax at the end is simply incredible. I liked it so much that, just after the final credits, I saw it a second time. It is an absolute necessity for any self-service fan that respects. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 in the Drive-in Freak-O-Meter ... requires visualization <br /> <br /> Yes, I love you ... I LOVE YOU ... now take your Thorazine and put on your clothes again ... please ... 8)
