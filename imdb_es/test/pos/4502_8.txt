I have not read the novel on which "The Kite Runner" is based. My wife and daughter, who did it, thought that the movie was very far from the book, and I am ready to take their word. But, by itself, the film is good, not excellent but good. How precisely does it portray the chaos created by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? How convincingly does it show the intolerant Taliban regime that followed? I would rate it with C + in the first and B + in the second. Human history, the Afghan-American who returned to the country to rescue the son of his childhood playmate, is well done, but it is in this particular account that I was told that the book was much more compelling than the movie. However, the most exciting part of the film, the kite contests in Kabul and, later, a mini-contest in California, may not have been matched by the book. I would bet money on that.
