Instead of going to the place and making a realistic movie about drug addiction in Windy City, the opposite director Otto Preminger decided to go the opposite way and make his film seem as artificial as possible, so he opposes the fashion of men like Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who were doing their photos all over the world. Nelson Algren, in whose novel the film is based, was recorded as contempt. One wonders what Preminger was doing, and why did he make the film this way? <br /> <br /> The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a caricature of Mr. Magoo. Louie, the drug dealer, is dressed to look like the kind of gangster that Mad magazine artists used to draw. Arnold Stang, the wonderful comedian he was, seems out of place in a serious image like this, and his appearance, topped by an oversized and oversized baseball cap, causes laughter. Robert Strauss, another actor best known for his humorous roles, is also out of place, as his large and strongly jowled face and Runyonesque lines look more appropriate for a Jerry Lewis movie. Against all this, the stars Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker have to work overtime to prevent the spectator from laughing. Sinatra is nervous and manic at all times, suggesting that a man feels uncomfortable with himself, making him completely appropriate for the role of a drug addict. Miss Novak, with a vegetal and sublime aspect, is sympathetic and seems to be a product of the sordidly ingenious neighborhoods she adores in the film. Parker is pure Hollywood and hardworking as the crippled and cunning Zosch. She is never convincing, but neither is the movie. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic depiction of the lives of drug addicts in the United States. The Caligari sets only make it incredible. It is possible that Preminger has been pointing to a dream effect, as the cardboard backgrounds give the procedure the surreal feeling of a nightmare operetta, perhaps going back to the early days of Preminger in Vienna.
