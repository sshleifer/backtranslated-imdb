Another masterpiece that needs a DVD release, but some libraries have VHS and it's worth looking for. Just a brilliant game about many things, mainly euthanasia, "respectability", religion and fundamental human relationships. The script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to deal with a problem like a child with a severe disability, but also to force parents into their love for "Jo" and each other. As a couple, Alan Bates and Janet Suzman combine to perfection both in acting virtuosity and in giving life to their intelligent and profound characters. <br /> <br /> I've recently seen Bates' brilliant performance in "Butley", which was released as a movie a couple of years after "Joe Egg" and he plays a teacher in both cynical, intellectual and funny , although Butley is much darker than his character Bry here. If you perform such great performances in "The Go-Between", "Women in Love", "Whistle Down the Wind", "The Caretaker" and "Georgy Girl", not to mention the most obvious "King of Hearts" and "Zorba" the Greek ", and I would say that Alan Bates had a career comparable to Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and the other great British actors of his time. <br /> <br /> Director Peter Medak also had one of my all time favorites, "The Ruling Class", published the same year (1972) as "Joe Egg", which comprises one year of career in the anyone's book He has had a kind of irregular filmography ("The Krays" was another highlight), but these two gems will mark him as a great director.
