The beautiful, charming, extremely versatile and talented Irene Dunne is one of the 5 or 6 best actresses in American cinema. In Over 21, as in all his films, he illuminates the screen with a natural and glamorous presence. She is both authentic and human, and a charismatic, inspiring model. This role is the quintessence of Irene Dunne, full of pathos and wit and a little mischief. I love all his films, and this movie was a fantastic discovery for me when TCM issued it last night. I hope you do not wait years to re-issue it. <br /> <br /> In the same way, Charles Coburn is one of the best actors in all American cinema. It is true that he often portrays variations on the same subject, but I never tire of seeing his pampering with a soft mouth. Here his character is the perfect complement to Irene Dunne, and Coburn portrays him perfectly. Your conflicts in this movie are absolutely fantastic. They never lose a heartbeat. In addition, they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of Irene Dunne's husband, portrayed by Alexander Knox. <br /> <br /> I'm not so familiar with Knox's work. It was recognizable, but that was all. However, cast with Dunne and Coburn, he has his. He delivers a fine and nuanced performance. His character has noble motives that are accessible to us through the performance of Knox and that is never imposed on us as a holy grail. He is noble, but he is in conflict and doubts his ability to successfully complete the SCO. His interaction with Dunne is always compelling, too. Dunne supports him without being mellow or becoming a martyr, and he responds with kindness. His scenes are very well done. <br /> <br /> The film, in itself, is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and a half that is not portrayed in other films. I do not remember the top of my head from another film that portrays the United States still struggling against World War II, but with the end in sight and focus on the establishment of the postwar world. It's not the usual movie of World War II! That in itself is interesting; It is also essential to the plot and the message of the film. In contrast to other commentators, I thought the climactic speech was good, but not excellent. It was delivered very well by Knox, but it was not written as "tightly" as the accumulation made me wait. I've heard better film speeches on very similar subjects. It fulfilled its purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the greatest value of the film was the representation of the life of Dunne and Knox, as reflected in the typical OCS experience. The sense of community among the wives living in Palmetto Terrace seemed absolutely authentic, as did Palmetto Terrace, despite the fact that it was obviously a perfect setting. The incredibly brief encounters between the wives and their spouses of OCS. The rigors of the OCS candidates, mastering the difficult and complex material they had to learn. The "base housing" in poor condition - obviously built in a hurry. The worn and worn furniture. The constant and terribly short deadlines: to return to the base, to learn lessons, to take trains to subsequent "posts". Tenants are constantly meeting their predecessors and successors in the base house, as they moved in and out. Yes, I suspect that this was a glimpse of a true World War II experience: dressed in some comedy, but very real in its essence. I loved it, and I recommend it highly.
