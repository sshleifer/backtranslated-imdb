In & Out was a funny comedy with good performances by Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Dillon and Kevin Kline. To think that Kevin Kline was gay was very funny. If I were him, I would hate to say that I am gay at his own wedding with his family, friends and his wife there. Very rarely that would happen. I also loved when he danced when the voice of the radio spoke to him. I would say that In & Out was a silly comedy with lots of laughs and giggles. This is a recommended comedy and Kevin Kline had a great performance as a gay man. Trust me that you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
