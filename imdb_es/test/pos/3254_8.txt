Having seen and loved this movie in Australia, I really wanted to make me kick a copy. I got one on DVD in the UK just to find out it's a very different edition. <br /> <br /> The Australian edition of Australain that I saw is more agile. The United Kingdom, and I suppose in Europe, the editions spend much more time in the narrator played by Jimmy's dead brother. And, in truth, it is opposed to that and some other points do not offer any real benefit. <br /> <br /> It's not a serious criticism, but the Oz edition is broader and I think I'm more confident. <br /> <br /> I can not say why they felt that I needed an expansion for the foreign market. <br /> <br /> Why? One you go to <br /> <br /> I went for both.
