Remake of the 1951 classic "The thing from another world". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antarctica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space: they devour and completely duplicate whatever they choose. It starts like a dog but is released and has the opportunity to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else, they are isolated, the radio is destroyed, their helicopter also. What are you going to do? <br /> <br /> The 1951 film made the thing a great superhuman monster. That movie was scary. This is also true, but the story is different (and it is based more closely on the original material, the novel "Who's going?") And it's scary in another way. The film immediately begins with the mysterious score of Ennio Morricone with the right tone and, when attacking Thing, the amount of blood is amazing. There is blood and parts of the body flying everywhere: the arms are biting, the heads are separated and, in the strongest, a man is devoured by the Thing. Gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I do not get scared easily, but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally in 1982. The effects of Rob Bottin are simply incredible. How has this image surpassed me with a rating of R! <br /> <br /> It also has a very spooky feeling: apart from that, it's very suspenseful. You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and score really increase the tension. One complaint: no one receives any distinctive personality trait. The actors simply remain serious and say their lines. That's annoying ... but the movie still works. <br /> <br /> This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982, competed with "E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of blood and that there were no female characters in the film. Now it is considered one of the best of John Carpenter. A must see ... for strong stomachs. NOT a date movie! <br /> <br /> A funny note: when this was published, Universal sent a note along with all the impressions of the film. They suggested to the owners of the theaters that they project the film in an auditorium near the bathrooms. They feared that people were so sick from the violence that they would have to be near a facility to vomit!
