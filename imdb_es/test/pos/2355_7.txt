I saw this movie the first time in 1953 with my older brother. It was one of the great films of 3 Demension released at that time. We saw it at least thirteen times and we were proud of it. Scott performs a typical recording job in the west while surrounded by Indian arrows instead of surround sound. Oh, for those polaroid lenses again.
