"Nurse Betty" is the kind of movie that can not be described on a poster or in a trailer or commercial. It's the kind of movie you're waiting for a more mature "Dumb and Dumber", that with the temporarily crazy waitress is launched on an adventure across the country while preventing criminals try to kill her. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this movie is a wonderful and moving story about two people pursuing their dreams. The best part of "Nurse Betty" is its unpredictability. Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to separate dreams from reality, and along with the moving drama and hilarious comedy, you can never say what will happen next.
