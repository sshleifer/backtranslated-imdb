I still count "Police Squad!" as the funniest television show of the eighties. Somewhere, in BetaMax no less, I have all six episodes. I knew that such a good show would not last and that I had to keep it for myself. How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that the spectators did not know that "Police squad!" It was a comedy because I did not have a laugh! Right! When Drebin has a phrase like: "You risk getting up in the morning, driving to work or putting your face in a fan". I have seen each episode at least ten times and I still see something new that I missed before. Even deep funds always have gags in progress. Do not miss it if you have the opportunity to watch an episode, but if you are reading this, it is likely that you already have copies saved somewhere like me.
