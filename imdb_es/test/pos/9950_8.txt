This is a precious movie of my childhood! I can still hum the theme song in the blink of an eye! I remember that I stayed up late to watch this movie with my father, usually two or three times a year. We always refer to him as "giant robot". Although the effects in this film are crude compared to current standards, they were perfect for the genre of this movie. I am also a GREAT fan of Japanese "Monster" movies, so this movie fit in with the others. I have not seen this movie for years and I would love to have a copy in my hands to share with my 8 year old daughter.
