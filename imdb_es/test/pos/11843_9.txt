Joe (Wes) and Jim (Adam) re-familiarize us with beauty, isolation (both psychological and physical) and the absolute terror of "killing most poultry" in southwestern Navaho. Characterizations, adjustments and plot continuously built ... even if sometimes personal visits leave us wanting "more" ... with some interesting alternative options as to "who did it?" Flashbacks (for example, Peter Fonda ... it's good to see it) provide clues, but they do not go where you think. The comic aspects (for example, the Preacher) are mild and appropriate. Where the "Skinwalkers" and "Coyote Waits" begin to crawl ... "Thief" clings to the clutch and to the four wheels in the next corner, without being sure of what is there. I do not agree with Joe Leae's manic commentary on Jim Chee to "slow down" the potholes. Wrong ... there are no bumps in the plot, only clues to follow. To the next episode! Excellent photography (as always), attractive characters and more to explore.
