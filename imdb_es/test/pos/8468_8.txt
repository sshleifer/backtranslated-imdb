This is a very interesting experiment to see. It is the first attempt, still existing, to unite sight with sound. It has two men dancing with a violinist (possibly William KL Dickson himself), who is standing next to an Edison recording cylinder, which captures the sound. <br /> <br /> The sound and the images were not linked together as one yet And it was not until recently that the sound and the image have been technically added together. Probably the reason why people hesitate to call this film the first sound image. <br /> <br /> The film is made by William K.L. Dickson, an assistant of Thomas Edison himself, who ordered him to devise a way to unite images and sound. The answer he provided was the Kinetophone, a Kinetoscope (basically a large wooden box with a peephole in it, so that people could see the moving images) with a cylindrical phonograph inside it, for sound. This is the first, as we know, the surviving movie experiments that present this technique. All subsequent films that used this same technique were filmed, while silent movies and sound effects were recorded later and separately. So the Kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images, but rather an attempt to have images accompanied by sound. In some cases, people can even choose between three sound cylinders, with 3 different orchestral presentations to accompany the images. Only 45 Kinetophones were manufactured, so it could hardly be said that the Kinephone is a success. Also after this experiment, the focus was on other film techniques, mainly with regard to film projectors. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the experiment itself obviously did not become a success, also given that it took more than 30 years before the first films. With sound they were made and launched commercially. They just could not synchronize technically and combine the sound and the images even at that moment and even if they could and the techniques had been available, it would have been a very expensive job to do so. Therefore, it is not really the most influential or historically important film in film history, but it is very interesting to see how people constantly try to improve the quality and techniques of cinema and the creation of old movies. <br /> <br /> 8/10
