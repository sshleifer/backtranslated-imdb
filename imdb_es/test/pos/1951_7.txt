A teenage film about anguish, friendship, loyalty and growth? but this is not a happy departure on their part due to the circumstances and the life-changing dilemmas that surround the premise. What happens is quite stunning, disturbing and downright cold. However, I expected something a little more powerful and effective, and although absorbing and unforgettable, it did not fully awaken the emotions. The performances are reasonably a mix, but there is a brutal honesty for all of them. Dennis Hopper and especially Daniel Roebuck are incredible? Crispin Glover eccentrically does, and Keanu Reeves' dead as wood in turn seems to bear fruit in his usual lazy role. Joshua John Millar is pretty good and Ione Skye too. Jim Metzler intervenes with a short but very attractive performance. The story is dramatically confronted, full of characters and heartbreaking in its eventual rupture, where it infuses a rough and painful blow. JÃ¼rgen Knieper's musical score is mingling with anxiety, tension and wonder as morals and commitments are tested and learned.
