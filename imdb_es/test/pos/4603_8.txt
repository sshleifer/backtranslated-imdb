A good evil movie with likes of "James Bond", "Romeo and Juliet" and, maybe, even "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> The evil Count Von Bruno receives an English gentleman as a guest for A very dangerous hunt. Elga, the simple and well-meaning beautiful lady who was forced to marry the count, provides the love triangle. The count's lost eye points to a terrible past. English is not what the count thinks and it is a terrible deal for him. There is also the terrible hunchback, the crocodiles and even the lateral appearance of some instruments of torture. <br /> <br /> Boris Karlloff, here in a supporting role, makes a strong but somewhat rigid presence. The other actors (and the direction) are the symbol of an era, the strong representations of the films in black and white. From the beginning there is no doubt who is the bad boy, who is the good guy. Even traitors and rigid ones can be identified with some ease.
