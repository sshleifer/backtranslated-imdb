What a great movie this is. I found him full of the deliciously unexpected pain of being a single parent of a teenager. And it is located on a tropical island 'paradise' as well. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardeiux brings his special European style to this story about a father divorced from a teenager. They are on vacation together and she begins to increase the excitement on the island in many unexpected ways. But you will need to watch the movie for yourself to see all the fun situations they find for themselves. <br /> <br /> There are some cult classics that all teenagers should see. This movie must be added to the list. In addition to Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Animal House, you must demand the study of the movie My Father the Hero. Look at it as if you had a teenage daughter and you'll laugh. Watch it with your teenage daughter and get ready to laugh for months.
