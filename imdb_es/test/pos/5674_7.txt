"Black Water" is a film that somehow surprised me and definitely exceeded my original expectations. "Black Water" is truly a very well structured, unpredictable, exciting, well-directed and very spooky movie. The plot is actually something original, and it will definitely keep you intrigued with it. One thing I love about this movie is the direction, because mainly about how it exceeded my original expectations. My original expectation of "Black Water" was that it was a made, acted, directed, stimulating and boring movie. It really was not. Well, the performance is nothing praiseworthy because there were times when I felt that they did not show enough emotions, and there are some lines that feel so written. However, I love the address because all its shots seem predictable, but they are not. Like when I see him say that the camera takes a slow shot of the water, and everything goes as if you were about to attack the crocodile. However, crocodile attacks are very unpredictable (which was bad for me, which does not handle movies like this to a large extent), and this makes you jump. Also, I love that it's one of those horror movies that do not rely on the big sound explosion to make you jump, but on the real movie. I also like how the story is about the people who are trapped in these trees, it made it look very real, and it definitely kept your eyes on the screen. I must say that I did not think the first 20 minutes were good, and I think they made the boat a bit heavier than it would have been in real life. Also, I did not like how they did everything possible to make the situation of the characters seem totally hopeless when it really was not. Again, I just do not think some of the characters' actions were realistic. For example, I would not have gone anywhere near the water knowing there was a crocodile in it, let alone a killer. However, these problems really are not that important, and I could still enjoy the movie. In general, as far as movies are concerned, I've seen better, but as for horror films of animal attack (a genre that leaves me easily marked) it's one of the best you'll see. And it sure is not perfect, but that does not mean it's not worth trying.
