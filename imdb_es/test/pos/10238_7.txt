The fun of Barker's Nightbreed is that it is the story of a human in a riot, a deadly threat to monsters around the world. In this, the monsters (the night race of the title) are the "good" guys. He shares his sense of celebrating the different, the twisted and the dark with the first Addams family movie and much of Tim Burton's work. He also has the sadness that one expects from a piece by Barker. <br /> <br /> Especially funny is the performance of Cronenberg as the true and evil human doctor who is willing to destroy the Nightbreed. As in most classic monster movies, villagers surround the monster castle with torches and pitchforks. Only this time, the modern environment replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and rustic "weapons" with weapons and bombs. And this time the sympathy you felt when you saw Frankenstein's monster burned in the windmill is the center of the film. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, and even Barker has done more interesting things, and certainly more. chilling, work. But it's pure fun, it looks great and stays light without making fun. Worth a look!
