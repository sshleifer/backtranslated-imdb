The "hunting trilogy" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedy watermark of the collaboration between Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese. While they are rarely mentioned in the lists of the "biggest" or "most important" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly the funniest drawings I have seen in my life. Michael Maltese never obtained the credit obtained by directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery, but it is his dialogues and situations that make the Warner Bros. cartoons and these three in particular, some of the funniest that have ever been made.
