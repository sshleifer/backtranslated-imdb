I am 13 years old and I am writing this review in my mother's registry. She will write her own review later. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie of all time. It was filmed in England in 1944. I saw it so many times when I was little that I spent the videotape. I love this movie and it changed my life! The beautiful landscapes. The powerful horse of pure and bold race. The little Irish town with the girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done, compete in the Grand National Steeplechase in London with her most beloved horse, the pirate. Everything that made me want to ride a horse (what I have done for 7 years) and learn everything I could about their breeds to be able to draw them and paint them. It is an innovative film about winning against all odds, overcoming your fears, believing in yourself and reaching difficult goals by working hard. Also, the horse racing scene was one of the best that has been done and I have seen many movies with horse racing. I never get tired of watching this movie. Everything is perfect. Especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses!
