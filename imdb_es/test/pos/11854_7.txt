This independent film is worth the enormous talent of its creators, Wallace Wolodarsky and Marsha Forbes. Mr. Wolodarsky has addressed the young cast, and he should be commended for this effort. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is a warning about the danger of wanting something that one can not have. What is the story of Alice and Ed. After living together for a while, Alice suddenly becomes restless because she imagines she lacks experience in the area of ​​sex. The relationship of Alice and Ed, although not an example of ideal happiness, is a convenient way to share their lives with each other. That is, until the moment when Alice and Claire, his sister, stumbled upon a sexual encounter with another couple who has no idea of ​​being observed. <br /> <br /> This incident causes Alice to re-evaluate her own sex life with Ed; She finds that she lacks substance. When she proposes to "see other people," Ed is surprised, to say the least, but not wanting to contradict Alice, he decides to move on. What happens next is that both Alice and Ed enter a world that has been unknown to them. People who know, in the end, are not worth it. Unfortunately, in the end they realized that they were made for each other. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching the movie to see the amazing Julianne Nicholson, who we liked in another independent film, "Tully". . Mrs. Nicholson reminds us of a young Shirley McLaine; she projects such a luminous quality on her, that it is difficult to remove her eyes every time she is in a scene. This young actress shows that she is a successful artist who improves with each new appearance. Basically, she takes the movie. His Alice is a study of contrasts. Alice is a decent woman who thinks she is inadequate to please Ed because of her inexperience. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr, is an excellent companion for Mrs. Nicholson. They both do wonders together. Your Ed is perfectly credible. We have met people like him. In the end, he is a good person, who suddenly finds himself in a situation that he did not call, however, he goes only to discover that he is too decent and is not made for a life of free sex with women willing. They do not have problems with a fall in the hay, just for fun. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is wonderful. Lauren Graham does an amazing job as Claire, Alice's yuppie sister. Andy Ritcher is also wonderful as the buried Carl, the nerdy friend who finally finds satisfaction when he meets Penelope, a single mother. Like Penelope, Helen Slater makes a happy, though brief, appearance in the film. <br /> <br /> The director has a huge talent, which will undoubtedly go somewhere because it shows that he is well prepared for the job. .
