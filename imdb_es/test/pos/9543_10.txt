I avoided this movie when I was a kid because I thought it would be boring not to fight or shoot, cops, thieves, cowboys or Indians. It was definitely not a great movie to like. So I did not see TRC until I was about twenty years old and it seemed like one of the most beautiful and captivating movies I've seen. All the actors deliver the characterizations perfectly and each emotion is extracted from the spectator scene by scene. Filming and directing are deceptively simple, but they feel so natural and completely attracted to me in the story. My two favorite scenes are Bobbie's birthday party and the scene on the station platform almost at the end, directed and edited to perfection. The quality and expression of Jenny Agutter's voice when she calls: 'Dad! My dad!' it extracts the emotion of the spectator. Tears come from my eyes when I think about it. <br /> <br /> This adaptation is not just a movie, it is a beautiful work of art, as well as being the perfect example of what all filmmakers should be. Struggling to achieve the creation of an emotional experience.
