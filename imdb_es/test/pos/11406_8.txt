People say that this movie is a 'typical horror movie for teenagers' ... well, it's a horror movie with a teenager ... what are you waiting for! It's a good movie, I counted 3 real screams in the audience while the movie was going on and it was a terrifying, very shaky movie. I was not bored in the movie at any time and was even on the edge of my seat at any given time. The only thing that was a bit bad was that it was a bit slow to enter the real story, but all this led to why she was where she was and why it happened, it happened. The performance was good, the stage was good and the story was good too, I hope to see a 'When A Stranger Calls 2' in a few months! Good movie!
