Along with ¡In the army!, This is one of the best films of Pauly Shore, if it exists. While the entire West Coast meets the culture of the Midwest, the shock is nothing new, this film shows that the story is a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a Shore, which at that time is new. While the change in values ​​probably would have gone in the other direction, the whole concept was quite entertaining. Shore's interaction with the family was not only hilarious, it also had Carla Gugino and Tiffani- Amber Theissen (she will always have the Amber in my book) in two dazzling and early roles. One of those movies that I have no problem seeing when he is on television.
