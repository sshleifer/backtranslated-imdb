OK ... I've seen almost everything ... and some are considered classics that should not be (like all Halloween movies that suck junk or even Steven King's garbage) ........ and some are considered Just fine, that's really cool ... (like the carnival of souls) ........ and then some are simply ignored ............ like (evil edition) or (head of pumpkin and brain death "the cocoon one"), then some stick in your head once seen and never leave ........... that's what made me this ... ..... and for my money this is much better than the last house on the left ............ the last house was great until the end ... then it exploded pieces ... What kind of mannequin is going to give a blowjob to someone who has just killed their children ????. completely stupid .. I will find the movie "bully" or even "fun games" if you want realism and that you get scared ....... ..but this damn thing stayed with me for years ....... .. one of the reasons why Connors was always scary ......... two Tanya Roberts is the best female victim ... ... three the girl being suffocated with plaster is still one of the worst murders of all the times in the movie ... and fourthly, the telekinetic power amazed me and it was totally unexpected ... not to mention the mannequins wax figures puppets, etc. ... should be there with psychopath, last house, Texas chainsaw, etc. ... is a classic .............. and deservedly so ...........
