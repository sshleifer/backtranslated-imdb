The line above sums it up pretty well. The best resources of the comics are their visual jokes and jokes of words (the latter are almost impossible to translate, so the comics are in their best language in their original language). <br /> <br /> Both are quite difficult to capture in the movie, so they will never be as good as comics. Movies are simply a different medium than comics. With that in mind, this movie works surprisingly well by capturing the fun of comics. <br /> <br /> The word gags is bearable, and sometimes even funny (Debouze makes a reference to Amelie!). I have to mention that I saw the French version. If you do not see the French version or your lack of understanding of the French language limits it to the subtitles, the word jokes will probably stink. <br /> <br /> The slapstick is also good; It's a very simple way of humor, and not very funny when you're over twelve, but it captures the spirit of the comics. The other visual jokes are the salvation of the film for the older audience, as they are often quite funny. <br /> <br /> The performance is totally exaggerated, but once again, it is not at all annoying at all, as it captures the spirit of The Comicbooks. Only Depardieu and Clavier do not exaggerate, which could be the reason why some people think they did not enjoy their roles (I did not notice anything). On the other hand, Jamel Debouze and, especially, Claude Rich turn the overacting into an art form. It's really fun to see it. Once again, I'm afraid it would not be so much fun when the voices are doubled. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not a bad movie, much better than the previous one. It's not a classic and it does not dethrone The Twelve Tasks of Asterix as my favorite Asterix movie, but it's still worth watching. The French version, that's it. 7/10
