This was a fantastically written script when it comes to perceiving things from another perspective. The comedy was timely and not exaggerated, the acting in general was excellent, and the plot line served a greater purpose of generating a misconception when we think of people based solely on their outward appearance. The plot twists when the brother / sister character of Amanda Bynes tries to play soccer in the boys' team and finds a new love interest along the way. Tatum Channing is where the true misperception lies and, at the beginning, it does a good job of acting disinterested, and then realizing that the most important thing in life is friendship, not attitude.
