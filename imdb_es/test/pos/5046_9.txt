This film has just won the best film award at the Cleveland International Film Festival. It's an American title that apparently is Spring Fall. The acting is excellent. The story takes him to the life of an older man who takes what life gives him and increases it a little. Encouraged by his best friend (and partner in a not so serious crime), he puts people at every opportunity, but often still reveals his heart of gold. Her long-suffering wife has reached her final point and makes a life-changing decision, which is heartbreaking to observe. The resolution of the story is beautiful.
