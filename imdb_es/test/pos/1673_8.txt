This film is a pure class work from start to finish, for a moment, forget about the famous 28-minute robbery without dialogue, forget that it is set in Paris and forget about Noir. The film itself, the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience ... it is intelligent and thought out in great detail, just like the robbery itself. It represents real characters that are not only credible, but also those you identify with. It's a movie that does not glamorize the notion of a theft but shows it for what it is ... theft. This shows that a robbery is hard work and, ultimately, is not worth doing. Now, considering all aspects, a bold sequence of 28 minutes without saying a word and set in wonderful Paris with a great attention to detail and a fantastic cinematography and that last scene ... when you look up and see those trees .. . wonderful use of basic and basic filming techniques ... it's a masterpiece from my point of view and I'm glad I saw it.
