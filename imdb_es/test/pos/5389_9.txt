If you like Gary Cooper, this is one of his best roles. His gentle intensity to correct an error is what made his career. "Blayde Hollister" comes to Dallas to take revenge on Will and Brian Malowe, who burned his Georgia farm and killed his family. The inept Marshall gets in the way of Hollister and tries to arrest him when he is interrupted by a street shooting between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickock. The shooting is organized to take the law away from Hollister, and he takes the Marshall from the "East" back under his wing to keep him alive in Texas, as they change their identity. <br /> <br /> That was a great start, and the image remains until the end. The action may be a bit "slow" by today's standards, but it's one of my 10 favorite movies.
