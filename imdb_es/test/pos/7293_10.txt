All I have to say is that this movie is the bomb. You will cry when you see this. I mean, this is a reminder to everyone how difficult and easy it is to fall in love. It reminds you of the days of your youth when you were carefree and everything that was bad for you was washed with a single kiss. Even though I'm still a teenager, that's how I live my life. When I am with that certain person, everything that was negative in my mind was erased. So, I give this movie a 10 for its heartfelt message and its moving plot. Actors Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein also give a 10 for having a pretty face.
