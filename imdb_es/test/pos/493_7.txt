Not being familiar in the least with the characters in the comic series, I hoped that this film would simply fulfill the basics: introduce myself to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present a plot and end the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps insinuate the possibility of a sequel. And that is exactly what happens with this movie. <br /> <br /> However, unlike most other comic movies, I felt that this one did it with a little class. Risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic scenes of struggle, "Blade" presents a very modern, credible and somber world whose small nuances managed to provoke a sense of fear, however minor, of a spectator who rarely It involves a story, unless it is an emotional aspect (ie, sappy). <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie has countless moles and ridiculously unreal situations like a standard doctor being cunning enough to accomplish what no one else has been able to do for several thousand years. But when you have an enemy as great as the one in this movie, and you fight scenes with exciting camera cuts and special effects like this, what else matters? It may last a bit, but for what it sets out to do, "Blade" stands out to a large extent among most other films of this genre.
