The simple and charming feature of Nick Park and the company that simulates movies like "King Kong" and "The Wolf Man" has Wallace and Gromit as the security of the rabbits and they find it difficult to solve a major problem in their town ... a giant bunny It is feasting abundantly with the vegetable crops of the citizens! What makes this even worse is that the big vegetable festival is about to start and the citizens have prepared to win the prize. What makes the situation even worse is that Wallace is the reason behind all the fuss of eating vegetables ... he was trying a new invention related to taking his brain waves in an attempt to brainwash the captured rabbits so they do not like vegetable crops. What happens is catastrophic, since in the process some kind of rabbit bunny hybrid is created ... and it has more to do with Wallace than he could imagine. It will depend on your loyal (... and surprisingly intelligent) and fast dog Gromit to save the day. <br /> <br /> This is an ingenious and imaginative effort by the crew behind other Oscar-winning certification functions. Starring Wallace and Gromit. Seeing the good fashion of fashion is refreshing, considering the rise of the CGI that has presented a fairly lackluster rate here recently as the industry spits out an increasingly mediocre product. Here, we have a full function with witty humor and some extraordinary acrobatics with a wonderful animation, not to mention gags that destroy the entrails.
