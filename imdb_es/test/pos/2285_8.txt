Not many people seem to know about this movie. Which is very bad because I think it's pretty good. Of course it is a little cheesy at times and can have a predictable history. But the presentation of the movie is pretty well done. I think the casting is good with funny actors / characters. Tom Selleck does a good job playing a baseball player (imagine ... I guess it's not too exaggerated) and Ken Takakura (of Black Rain) is the boss (the coach of the Japanese baseball team). There is not much to complain about. It is just a light comedy, carefree, cheerful and I recommend it.
