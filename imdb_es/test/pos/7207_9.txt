For those who do not know, the books of Asterix are a series of comics of great success on a people of indomitable Gauls who resist the invasion of Caesar thanks to a magic potion that makes them invulnerable supermen. There have been several animated features (only one of them, The Twelve Tasks of Asterix really capturing the wit and spirit of the books despite being an original story on the screen) before Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu took the lead roles in Two live adaptations that proved to be colossally successful throughout Europe but did not make any impression on the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> The French version without cuts is very funny, but unfortunately it does not seem to be available in a version with English subtitles outside the UK DVD. While there are still no signs of a premiere in the United States or a DVD, the Miramax version of Asterix et Obelix: Mission Cleopatre is also on that DVD (and it has been played on UK television), and you'll never guess what, It has been completely re-Edited (at least 21 minutes) and doubled to English. Perhaps Harve mistook it for a Hong Kong movie: after all, he never saw a foreign film that he did not think could not be improved with a reissue and a bookshelf for a few years. <br /> <br /> Whereas Asterix and Obelix Contre CÃ©sar was affectionately dubbed into English from a particularly good translation script by Terry Jones, but otherwise was not altered, that sort of thing really is not the way from Miramax. The results are not good. The film was the best attempt to get on the screen the mix of slapstick books, anachronisms and classic humorous dull, but many of the classic references have disappeared (such as the great gag of the jellyfish Raft of the Medusa or the references of the Cyrano of Bergerac de Depardieu), along with anything that seems too French or that can slow down the image, with the result that the first 20 minutes are now a real problem. Several punches are missing to the sequences, the part of Depardieu has been cut (his part was already quite small due to his serious health problems during the filming: the US version has been partially digitally modified to change the pallor unhealthy of his face in the original!), and as usual with dubbing, because literal translations into English do not fit correctly, the lines rush so much that they are no longer fun or the dialogue has been completely changed (some of these changes are certainly fun, like a single character dreaming of a world in which he could move his lips in French and hear the words in English). <br /> <br /> It's not a total disaster, but it's very disappointing considering how good the full version is. It would be good to think that Miramax would do a Shaolin Soccer and release the two versions, but since they left aside both films for two years since they paid $ 45 million for them (another classic case of the notorious remorse of Harvey's chronic buyer: gee, ask yourself why) Disney was so excited about their excessive spending) and still have no plans to launch, that may be too big an illusion. <br /> <br /> It is a real pity that such an accessible and entertaining film is now only available for people who do not speak French in such a clumsy version. It seems that the brave Gauls could have defeated Caesar's legions, but they are no match for the Miramax boot.
