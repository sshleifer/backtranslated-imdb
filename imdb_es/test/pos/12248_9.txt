I did not like it very much "As good as it gets", but I'm a big fan of the work of William Hurt and Holly Hunter, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most surprising thing for me was the magnificent work of Albert Brooks. Here, in Spain, it is little known, and only as a version of the second division of Woody Allen on the west coast. He played a great role, but Hunter and Hurt were also good, especially Hurt, in a relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played the part that reminds me a bit of his part in "Once Around" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991). <br /> <br /> Finally, the rest of the cast is also great. Robert Prosky, one of these familiar faces of American cinema, the ex-girlfriend of Lois Chiles, very well placed in that role, I think, the always perfect Joan Cusack in her early years; and especially the brief appearance of Jack Nicholson. Maybe it does not have a good scene, but it's Jack Nicholson, anyway ... The best James L. Brooks film, a great story (well resolved) and an excellent cast for one of the best movies of the 80s, surely .
