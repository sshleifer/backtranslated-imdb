Is torture ever correct? No The answer is simple and absolute, without possible qualifications. The reason this film showed is the effect that torture has on a society. The values ​​that were fought hard in Western society through centuries of revolution and struggle are for ALL men and women to live in a free and open society. One where individuals are treated equally and with respect to their essential rights as human beings. To protect this society, institutions have been developed to deal with irregularities openly, fairly and honestly. These institutions have been adapted and perfected through generations of hard work. One could argue that these are the true foundation of democracy, since they belong to all of us, they allow us to be heard. If we allow undemocratic and inhuman acts to be committed on our behalf, if we divide our society into those who have rights and those who do not, we undo the work of our ancestors. In addition we are all accomplices and all guilty and stained. If those we accuse are guilty or not, it does not matter. We are defined by our attitudes and our responses.
