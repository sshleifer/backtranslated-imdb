As an explanation, Disney "The Kid" has absolutely nothing in common with Charlie Chaplin's 1921 classic of the same name. What we do have is a nice, if amazing, family comedy that makes us feel good, since only Disney people can offer. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis, in a change of pace, plays an egocentric plush shirt from an "image consultant". He degrades not only his clients, but also those who are close to him. You know he will have to change before the end credits. <br /> <br /> In his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of Willis's character when an 8-year-old boy played with a cutesy cake conviction by Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these kids somewhere ). This forces Willis to face his past and well ... you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Appearing as the love interest of Willis are Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as their Executive Assistant. Both have little to do, since most of the film involves the interaction between the characters of Willis and Breslin. <br /> <br /> "The Kid", although it is not the best Disney movie, however, it is one you can sit on. Go down and look with your family and leave with a warm feeling.
