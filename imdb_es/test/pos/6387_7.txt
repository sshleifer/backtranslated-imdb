Like most people, I'm tired of Hollywood's clich√©d number movies. It seems there is no creativity in Hollywood. Companies that only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an integrated audience. <br /> <br /> This movie is a welcome change. It could be classified as a romantic comedy for its genre, but do not let that discourage you from this movie. This is a very original movie that is not like most of the things that Hollywood produces. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this, you already know the basic argument, so I will not bother to review it. The only movies that come to mind to compare this are "Interstate 60" and "Art of Travel," which are little-known gems that take a different path than most of Hollywood's trash. <br /> <br /> This is fine It's worth seeing if you're tired of seeing more of the same. <br /> <br /> Dean
