This movie is probably Hal Hartley's best. The theme, unusual originality, is treated (as usual in Hal Hartley) with great humor. This feature is by no means the only quality of this film: the demanding frame composition (everything is parallel, even the smallest details), the shooting angles, the lighting, giving a more supernatural dimension to these blurred images ( the fall of Jesus could not be filmed in a conventional way), the falsely acting "poser", are qualities that make this reading of the Bible, carried out in the form of an apocalyptic delirium, essential.
