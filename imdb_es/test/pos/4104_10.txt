It may be a new version of the 1937 film by Capra, but it is a mistake to consider it alone that way! It was supposed to expose Hilton's novel in a completely different way. As a musical it is excellent. The scenery is fantastic, the characters are good and anyone like "Leonard Maltin" who believes that Bacharach's music is horrible must be completely deaf. I highly recommend it.
