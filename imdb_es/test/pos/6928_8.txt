At first I thought that this movie was going to bother me. It was as if I had seen this movie somewhere before. The disillusioned hero, the father figure and the 9-year-old sister who is older and wiser than her years (see Gregory's girl), but then, at 15 minutes, it became a laugh, a comical jewel of a movie. Dylan Moran (who I thought was going to bother me) was excellent. As was Mr. Gambon and the crazy Hitman of Scotland. Lena Headey was extremely sexy. During the middle of the movie I tried to remember where I had seen her before. The probation officer. She has the most incredible smile. But clearly the real hero of this movie is Mr. Caine. This man should do a lot more comedy. This is next to some of his best comedy roles (Without a Clue, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels). It is a pleasure to see him in all his scenes, but especially in the end. <br /> <br /> No one can say anything as good as Michael. <br /> <br />
