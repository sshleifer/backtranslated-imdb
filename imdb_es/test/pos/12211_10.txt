I would like it if they came back to the surface. I really enjoyed the show together with my family. I felt that the development of the plot and the plot were first class. As the other person said, it seems that everything is reduced to the lowest common denominator. Nothing but insipid, politically correct garbage survives. Just look at the internet to see how many people were watching the program. Also, it is not good to leave hanging on what happened with all the characters in the program. This is the same thing that happened with the time travel program, I think it was called 8 days, but it should have been called backstep. Did they kill the Olympics to the surface? I know that the writers strike killed another of my favorite shows years ago called the greatest American hero.
