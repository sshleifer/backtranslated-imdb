To be brief, the story is very thin and you can see the end that comes from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth and an incredibly young Phil Silvers keep the film afloat and sometimes raise it in the air . Some of the songs are terrible clunkers ("Poor John" is a train crash) but most of them are very funny, and Hayworth's scene acting in the absurdly huge arena for Kelly's rival must be seen to be believed. Another delight is the perfect imitation of New York sets in the best Hollywood tradition. <br /> <br /> Another attraction, if you consider such things as attractions, is the masculine "chivalry" and terribly frightening towards women. The oily look and the transparent obsequiousness that went through the masculine charm back then (in the movies, at least) are presented here in their most rugged way. Some of the men are like a cartoon wolf. <br /> <br /> A minor disappointment is that Eve Arden is trapped in such a small role that she barely has the chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interaction between her and Silvers, a missed opportunity.
