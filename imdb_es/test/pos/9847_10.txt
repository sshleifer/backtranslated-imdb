It's the best acting movie I've seen. All the artists are old Turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this film. Sometimes it is said that "They do not act, they live it", you can really see this in this movie. The director is also competent, you can not see many moving cameras but the positions of the cameras are also good. But after the performance, the most prominent part is the content of the film. It gives happiness, enthusiasm, desire to live, importance of true friends for people. We all begin to live individually today, in this movie you see that there is someone else that we do. And most importantly, you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is to love, to love your friends, to love your love. Everyone should see this movie ...
