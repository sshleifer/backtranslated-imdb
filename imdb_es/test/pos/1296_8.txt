Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye is a great family movie. Salman Khan looks handsome and great than ever! There's even a scene where he takes off his shirt! What a surprise!!! Rani Mukherjee is also great. Pooja Batra had very few words to say, but I'm glad that he was recognized for his role because he definitely has potential. <br /> <br /> This is Prem (Salman Khan) and he is a wedding singer. He is about to marry Nisha (Raveena Tandon) but he stands up. Prem goes to Nisha's house and asks why he was abandoned and it is because his brother is sick and needs to marry an NRI, Rahul (Inder Kumar), to get the money to be treated. Prem moves and enters Priya (Rani Mukherjee). Prem falls in love <br /> <br /> with Priya, but it's a shame he's about to marry an NRI! Who could this NRI be? Priya also falls in love with Prem while Rahul is there with her. Prem gives Priya an insulting comment one day and leaves and heads to Agra for the wedding with Rahul. Will Prem stop her? Look at KPNHJ to find out! <br /> <br /> The movie was very funny! The songs were great, especially the song "O Priya O Priya". It's a shame that the movie has failed in India and I do not know why! All the films in India are going to fail today! This movie deserved to be a success. The only problem I found with the movie is that they had an obsession with the NRI! They think that ALL NRIs are rich! The movie deserves a 9/10!
