Well, I love Aidan Quinn's performance even with a bad script. This is not the case in The Assignment. As other viewers have said, this was a movie I found on cable and I got so involved in it that I did not want it to end. Take an officer of the Cuban-American Navy (Quinn) who is a soldier and a straight and straight family man. Add to a crazed agent (Donald Sutherland) who is looking for the most famous terrorist in the world and add a Ben Kingsley and you have "The Assignment". Sutherland witnesses Carlos' most notorious terrorist actions at a caf√© on a beautiful day when he is so shocked by this man's illness that his only reason for living is to get this man while he breathes. <br /> <br /> Take a soldier on a pass in Israel that is a dead name for this man and Kingsley hits him and holds on until they realize they have a plan. Assuming Carlos to be him, or always being responsible for never helping him get rid of him, makes it a very heavy task and a trip of guilt. By not helping his country, he is bound as a man and his military duty to choose wisely. This is how the training begins. Let's say that Carlos's training matches the academy of arts and holocausts. When I say that this intensely and beautifully translated, scripted and executed film qualifies the best, I am not underestimating it. The three actors could save almost any script. Altogether, it is a film that can be seen from the first frame to the credits. I do not like terrorism or movies about it, but I was hooked! Bravo again to Aidan Quinn, who for once plays a heavy role that could support any actor, including Gary Oldman. That is a compliment. Rent it and get a bunch of popcorn. Oh, did I mention sex? It works better than "Last Tango!" And it's educational.
