OK, I got the DVD last week and I'm finally posting my reviews, but I liked this sequel in many ways. <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead. IN AGREEMENT. This movie to a fast clip, has some really good gore effects and a really well done atmosphere and style. In fact, I would like to know that this may be one of the most elegant DV shooting films I have ever bought. Most of the time, I get very angry with DV movies for being boring and looking like soap operas. Even a movie like Bone Sickness that I like, has incredible stretches of DULL. Not this movie. It never stops long enough to let you catch your breath. Although I would not say I liked it better than the first movie, I will say that Sheets certainly improved technically in the two years between films. This one has better gore, the inevitable zombie feeding scenes, scum characters and some returning actors (although their roles are different), mainly Jerry Angell, as a pretty good psychopath with a murderous mullet from hell. The shots are more ambitious, as well as the script on this occasion, because you can say that Sheets is trying to get much more than he did in the first film. Something works and another does not, but I must say that at least I was not trying to make a bigger version of the first movie. It was not mentioned this time around a chemical spill power plant, just Satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life. So I congratulate Mr. Sheets for trying to do something different with this one. I give this movie two damn thumbs up!
