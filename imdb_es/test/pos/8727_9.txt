Goldie Hawn's portrayal of a young girl trapped in a love triangle with an older man, a dentist, played with such enthusiasm for Walter Matthau, who won the Oscar for best supporting actress in 1969. <br /> <br / > The film, however, is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman. On rare occasions, we saw her in a comedy and she literally kicks in here like a dedicated dental nurse who gets involved in a plan for Matthau to tell Hawn that they're married. <br /> <br /> It's such a joy to see Matthau and Bergman fall for each other here. His is an accidental romance in the making. <br /> <br /> As a friend of Matthau, Jack Weston is fabulous as his partner in the plan as well. Rick Lenz also provides broad support as Hawn's newfound boyfriend.
