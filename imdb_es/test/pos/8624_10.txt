With what they had. John and Carolyn were very private, so the writers had to put together what they could. I really liked Portia de Rossi as Carolyn, but the voice of Jacqueline Bisset resonated in my nerves. She should have used her regular voice. I would have preferred the whole movie to focus on John and Carolyn instead of repeating things we already know about John.
