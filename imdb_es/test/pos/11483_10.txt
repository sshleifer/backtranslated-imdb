I saw Linda, and it's a first-rate movie! The lives of Paul and his wife, Linda, whom he adored as a young man and finally married. They meet another married couple, Jeff and Stella, and the four become very good friends. But, their friendship takes a twisted turn after spending their vacations together on the beach of Varona ... A turn that never returns married couples to their previous state of friends. <br /> <br /> Linda is a must see !! ! Virginia Madsen's performance is acceptable; However, Richard Thomas steals the film with his incredible performance ... and the emotions it shows. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie! "Lotta Honey"
