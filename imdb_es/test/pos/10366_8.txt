Tell me as someone who is happy not to see Hastings in this episode. Dr. Watson of the poor man does not do anything for me, as he simply drags every scene he's in. Often, history is necessary for history as a representative of the bureaucracy, and a small Miss Lemon is fine to dress, but Hastings sways painfully. Degraded to exaggerated in different episodes. If I have to sit through a vacuum more "Oh, I say it there!" I'll take the gas pipe. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, the more Poirot you get in a Poirot story, the better. Each line of Hastings is far from Poirot. And I've never read the books, so I do not really care about the fidelity to Christie's characters. Many viewers / critics seem to have trouble separating films from books. If you want the book as it is written, then read it. I do not see the point of watching the television version if you know what will come next in each stage. The theater is not prose, do not expect a transcript.
