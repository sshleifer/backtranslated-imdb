I lived in London most of my adult life before moving to the United States, so I missed this movie when it came out and I only saw it on HBO. I do not agree with anyone who thinks that this should have been a Hollywood production, the UK team gave it a chilling and premonitory atmosphere from the first day and I was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes wondering what would happen in my house. city. And, of course, nine months after the movie comes out, 7/7 happens. Yes, the truth is stranger than fiction. Having lived in both countries, it is also clear that the probability of this happening in the United Kingdom is much greater than in the United States, Muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the United Kingdom, in the United States they assimilate much more easily.
