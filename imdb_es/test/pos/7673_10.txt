I saw this once, probably, like most people my age (55) in the 60s. I understand the dissatisfaction with the final product of both families. But this is a great movie, it was a great opera; But as a movie it is wonderful. This film should be released at least for video, other generations can get an appreciation of good music and storytelling. The cast was made up of some of the best black actors in history, most have already passed away; Only Sidney P. is still with us. Please do not wait until it's gone and the movie, like every old movie does, becomes unusable because of the ravages of time. Again, this is a great movie that is something you do not see very often today, if you do.
