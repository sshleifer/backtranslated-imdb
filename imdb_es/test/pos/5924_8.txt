1ยบ seen 10/10/2009 - 8 of 10 (Dir - Billy Wilder): Spectacular representation of the famous Lindbergh flight of James Stewart as Lindbergh and Director Billy Wilder. There really is not much background in this story, but it's fine because Wilder makes the event really extraordinary, since it comes directly from Lindbergh's perspective, since he used his book as the basis of the film. This first movie about the flight also has to be one of the best in the act. Stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you a lot of information about what Lindbergh did on this 33-hour solo flight across the Atlantic. And he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before, which is incredible! There is a small background story about how he bought the plane and how he got the financing, and some flashbacks about his life during the flight, but the film is mainly about the flight. The story is also beautifully done and photographed and it is a joy to see her despite her age. I appreciate the fact that they did not throw much fluff and let the story tell itself. Well done throughout. This is a classic movie that should be seen by everyone.
