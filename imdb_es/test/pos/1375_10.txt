I really liked that movie! Yes, it is quite cheap and I am sure that many comments will be presumed about it. But, my God, how much they package for the money involved. I remembered Sam Raimi's early work. Yes, it's hard, but it has good energy and lots of fun. The acting varies from the good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser to the not so good in some minor parts. Is it a cult movie? Well, it grew on me. The first time I liked it, but in the third session I loved it. The movie is probably 7 out of 10, but I give it 8 for pure cheek. It is worth seeing anyone who can achieve this for 8 thousand dollars. I almost want to visit Scotland!
