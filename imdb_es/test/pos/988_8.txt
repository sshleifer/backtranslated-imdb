This is a masterpiece of film making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling in these warts and in all the studies of the bohemian and self-indulgent years of the poet that encompasses the aerial bombings of London and the quiet exterior of a retreat coastal Welsh - the limits between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience in the face of practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and selfishness in the face of heroism and self-sacrifice and more. A subtle, mature script that suggests and occasionally dramatically focuses on the underlying tensions is well matched by perfect performances (apart from the odd, inappropriate smile that Keira Knightley is prone to, though she may be under the direction this time, as the other characters often mention. ). But, above all, the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with an ingenious and elegant use of the foreground, the angle of the camera and the lighting, including the punctual images of fake home movies, is a wonder and joy for the eyes. It is as beautiful to see as Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more attractive part of the work of that teacher. A very rare type of film these days: it attracts attention and agitates emotions without abandoning artistic integrity and succumbing to superficial and manipulative shortcuts.
