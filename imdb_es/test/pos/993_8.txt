I did not expect to enjoy this. I actually saw it because a friend knew that a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but was not credited. Knowing Dylan Thomas, and really appreciating his poetry but conscious and rather baffled by man, I did not feel the need to see an adaptation of his bohemian life lightly. And that was not all. Critical and yet appreciative was. made me cry. Kiera Knightley was excellent, even with that slightly tense Welsh accent, and it's a sad story they tell. Dylan Thomas is not the hero, and unfortunately he was not for all his life, nor the so-called "female fighter" of the pr spiel. Cillian is William of the movie. a man who leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore. His challenge to reconnect with this indifference is what really interests this film and the beautiful performance of that actor. I think this movie is underestimated because it was marketed so badly. Dylan Thomas fans will expect something more from their defective hero and get less, and well, that's how it was marketed. It's not a movie about Dylan Thomas and it's much more interesting to her.
