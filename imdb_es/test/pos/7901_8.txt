By winning 26 of the 28 awards for which he was nominated, there is no doubt that this film will remain one of the best of 2007. The fact that it was made with non-professionals trained to act and dance makes it much more special . <br /> <br /> It's not a Bollywood production, but it's about art. A girl of lower caste wants to sing and dance. She wants to advance in society, but there is a limit. Everyone can not be president in India, there is a caste system, and narrow minds will not allow it to break. <br /> <br /> Vanaja (Mamatha Bhukya) leaves school at age 15 and goes to work for the landlady (Urmila Dammannagari), who was once an accomplished dancer. After some time working the animals, they are taught to sing and dance. The film is surprisingly beautiful with a rich color. It is amazing what can be done with $ 20,000, since this movie was a master project for the writer director. <br /> <br /> The son of the owner of the land (Karan Singh) returns from the United States to run for office and the girl hits her. But, she is of a lower caste and can only be a vessel for her lust. Things are not better at home while your father drinks, eats and steals your money. She ends up pregnant and has to sell the baby to the landlady. <br /> <br /> In the end, he never rises above his caste, but the story was fascinating and the acting was really good.
