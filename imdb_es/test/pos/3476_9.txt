Good. You saw the movie and I saw the movie. True? If not, there are many plot summaries out there, and there's no reason for us to waste time on my weak attempts of mine to create another. <br /> <br /> The most surprising aspect of the film is, without doubt, the performances of the two young men and the young lady up front. His emotional honesty was as convincing, if not more, than any other performance I've seen in recent months. I discovered that I laughed, I cried and I shuddered along with them, and that is saying a lot because I am often called a jaded and cynical imbecile. <br /> <br /> As expected, the story is full of clich√©s. and I suppose that is the Achilles heel of the image. It's a story we've all seen many times before; We all know how it will end from the moment they introduce Rory. Although he does not know the exact mechanics, he knows that there will be a transforming friendship, a bittersweet romance and a heartbreaking conclusion. If it were not for the strong cast and direction, this film would be nothing more than the soporific blow that comprises eighty percent of the program programming of the Hallmark Channel.
