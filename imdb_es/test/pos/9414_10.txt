I use "Princess Raccoon" (to give the film a not very accurate English title) as a litmus test for my friends' sense of humor. Either it leaves them cold and bewildered, as other commentators clearly did on this site, or it results in duplicate laughter, immensely large smiles, and occasional gasps of admiration. <br /> <br /> Laughter comes from the movie. Exquisite mix of parodies in contemporary style. The objectives include a range of Japanese and Western classical theater forms, from Kabuki to late Shakespeare and the Christian fantasy of the Spanish Renaissance; the great emptiness of the modern American and European musical, as a witness to a large number of random tap and rap songs and some very funny banal lyrics, all choreographed with a "amateur" love cliche; Japanese anime and samurai live action clich√©s; portentous Buddhist ritual; and the overwhelming sweetness of the Viennese operetta. I have not laughed so much aloud in this kind of film since the scandalous musical deconstruction of Ken Russell in "The Boyfriend". <br /> <br /> The smiles come from the intelligent textual subversion of the Japanese legend. Traditional structure of 5 acts reminiscent of the works of the master Chikamatsu, the seventeenth century. As in his work, the narrative advances in a mixture of song, recitation, high-flying poetry and low relief of comedy: here, the roast of the incompetent ninja, Ostrich, by peasants under the illusion that he is a tanuki raccoon. human disguise All this somehow stays together, and even more remarkably manages to capture the emotions of the observer through the mixture of cultural references. <br /> <br /> Actually, "Princess Raccoon" wears her pan-cultural outfit with a seductive lightness. and that's where the gasps of amazement enter. Visually, again, as with Russell's masterpiece, the film is a delight, a tumult of color with its digitized backgrounds of classic Japanese images of screens and prints, exaggerated costumes and scenery. Sets, mixed with some impressive live action sequences in summer camps and coasts. He will love or detest it, but it does not make sense to punish chalk for being cheese; and "Princess Raccoon" stands out, above all, as a perversely amusing and affectionate humiliation of our contemporary cultural emptiness, both in the East and in the West. Bravo!
