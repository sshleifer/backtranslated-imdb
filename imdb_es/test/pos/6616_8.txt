I've seen this movie twice now on the cable. The first time I saw it, it surprised me. The skaters I was seeing were the ones we followed in the pages of the Skateboarder magazine in the late 70s. These were the guys we copied and tried to convert while we were skating. I'm glad that a movie has finally been made that gives an accurate explanation of how everything was formed. Now I am almost 40 years old and, nevertheless, I suppose he is a pretty tense guy with all the problems of life. This movie did a great job of taking me back. Back to empty pools, backyard halfpipes and road trips to Cherry Hill, NJ. I suspect that to really understand this movie and appreciate it, you had to live it. Otherwise, it probably does not affect you like me. But for those of you (and they know who they are), those who lived it, know exactly what I'm talking about! In any case, I do not care who you are, if you have the opportunity to see this movie ... do it! I thank the Z-Boys of Dogtown for the memories of my youth and thanks to Stacy for making this movie! WORK WELL DONE!
