I've seen this movie almost every night I was on HBO. It is my opinion that he could have succeeded in the theater, given that the announcement that took him was on a large scale. I was very impressed by the actress who played Nanny. She is an exceptional actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very discreet actor and deserves much more credit than he has received. The Ebony magazine made a good article about him, giving him some of his due proposals. Lakawanna Blue gave me an understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us. They were from a similar city "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" where they had to have fun in joke joints and so on. I also like to say that Mos Def is an incredible actor. He has found his vocation. I've seen him in several movies in which he has played various roles, from thug to doctor, and he has all that! In general, please, put Lakawanna Blues on video to rent.
