First I must say that this movie is much less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code. Sure, you have the problem of religion and science, but do not try to make a big statement about it. It's basically an action thriller that moves very well from one scene to another. One scene in particular (involving fire) I found extremely well made. <br /> <br /> Second, the changes from book to film. Although when I was following the development of the film I complained about the change of some characters and the complete elimination of others, I must admit that I was wrong. It was comforting that the film did not follow the book exactly the same way it was done in Da Vinci. However, if you are a purist of the book, some of them may bother you. However, the BIG TWIST is still there, so do not worry about that. Finally, I am glad that they have eliminated some silly plots and have not even tried to hint at the possibility of Langdon and Vittoria meeting. <br /> <br /> The performances are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. That's fine for a movie like this. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 9/10, mainly because it delivers what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment.
