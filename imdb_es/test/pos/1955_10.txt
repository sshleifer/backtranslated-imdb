IMDb forces reviewers to write a certain number of lines, but all I really want to say is: "This is an amazing movie, and you can not consider yourself a movie fan without having seen it." You should trust me in this and stop reading this review and get the movie and play. But I have to write something. So, let me point out the following: <br /> <br /> (1) River's Edge contains what can still qualify as the best and funniest performance of all time by Crispin Glover in a movie, and if he has been following Crispin Glover at all, you know that justifies just giving him 10. A lot of funny lines. <br /> <br /> (2) River's Edge contains the second most memorable presentation of the career of Dennis Hopper (apart from the Blue Velvet), and is really excellent. Dennis Hopper is really funny. <br /> <br /> (3) River's Edge contains the best race performance of Keanu Reeves, and it is excellent. It was the role that was born to play. It has many good lines, but one in particular is really fun. Listen carefully when your character and stepfather talk to each other. <br /> <br /> Still, it's the best stoner movie, it's much more than that. It tends to appear in the dramatic sections of movie rental stores, but if it's a drama, it's the funniest drama of all time.
