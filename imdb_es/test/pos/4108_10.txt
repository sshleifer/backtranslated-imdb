I do not see much evil with this movie. Of course, the lead singers may not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they certainly can carry a melody. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented composers and I love their songs, especially "The world is a circle", "Things I'm not going to miss" and "Question Me An Answer". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is appalling and that the sets of snowy mountains look as if they were made of plastic; I do not agree on both aspects. I have seen powder snow before and the snow in those mountain scenes seemed realistic to me. And, above all, in the defense of this film, it is appropriate for a family audience (at least I remember that it was like that when I saw it on Christmas day a few years ago). With all the protest for sex and violence in the cinema. These days, I find it refreshing to note that this movie deserves its G rating and they do not say that bad word "F" every ten minutes like some movies I've seen. Thank God. So, although this film may not be everybody's cup of tea, it has a redemptive value and I give it ten out of ten possible points. That's my story and I stick to it.
