After watching Desperate Living, I was hooked on the John Waters films. I heard about Pink Flamingos and I had to see it and it's worth it! Believe what you hear, it's garbage! It is full of everything dirty that is really the main plot of this movie. It contains the following: incest, cannibalism, rape, chicken fighting, nudity (as you have never seen before, beware of the artists of the baby's birthday party), poop, arson, trailer trailer, perversion, transsexuality, egg fettish, dressing ... ... they give you the image. Above all, this is a definite need! Beware of the birthday party entertainer and Divine walking in the park!
