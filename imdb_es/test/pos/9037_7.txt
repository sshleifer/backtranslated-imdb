Check out those faces along the entrance to the jail. They are not the faces of hollywood extras. Someone in the production was really smart to take the film to Oxford, Mississippi, because you can not get that kind of authenticity from a background study. Walk the narrow dusty roads, the frozen ground below and the skeletal trees that just hang. It is not surprising that these faces look hard and implacable; they are only reflecting the soil from which they sprout. The old Lucas (Hernández) fears more for his life, but then it springs from that same hard ground. <br /> <br /> The film works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimentalizes, nor even has certain suspense. Old Lucas is not very nice. He is a victim and we sympathize, but he is also haughty and unfriendly. Wisely, the script refuses to sweeten it. In that way we are forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice even in the least understanding. The script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism as it tends to be predicative and less effective. Instead, it shows us how easily prejudices can condemn an ​​innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death. Therefore, it is through our common instinct to see that justice is done that the effects of racism are exposed, a much more effective way. It also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable, since they are otherwise part of the Jim Crow system. <br /> <br /> Notice how the film does not attack segregation. It is doubtful that old Lucas wanted to mix with whites anyway and there is no indication that even attorney Stevens (Brian) wants to cross the line of color, except to see justice done. No, the possibility of reconciliation is in the future as symbolized by the child (Jarman) whose head is not yet full of "notions". He is not exactly Lucas's friend, but he has glimpsed the common humanity of being a friend after falling into the frozen stream. The last line of dialogue also shows that he is on the side of his uncle, the lawyer, in place of his most hidden parents (the scene of the dinner table is important and easily overlooked). The lawyer could not join a future march for civil rights, but the child could do so. That is the realistic hopeful side of the movie. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of racial-themed films during this brief 3-year period, 1949-51, (The Well, No Out, Home of the Brave, Lost Boundaries). Even the famous MGM got into the mix with this little gem. Unfortunately, McCarthy's purges in Hollywood put an end to the "problematic" movies that might not serve the Cold War ends. Even so, it is worth catching up with each of them, not only because they are good movies, but because even with the passage of 60 years and Jim Crow, they are still relevant.
