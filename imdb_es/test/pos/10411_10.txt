One of the reasons why they call the 80s, "The Awesome 80's" is quality television. Programs such as Wonder Years, War of the Worlds (series), V, Amazing Stories and many more have always left an impression on each of the "lucky" that, over time, we will always find a way to wake up again. To top it off, here come the monsters! A unique series, and a theme completely dedicated to monsters. Let it be the good, the bad and the morbid. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror movies, this is absolutely for you. Whenever I can find this rare jewel. <br /> <br /> Even the newer generations will be amazed with some of the episodes with their resentment, their indiscriminate use of blood effects or their power and simplicity to tell stories. I guarantee you, because I'm 23 :) <br /> <br /> Make sure you DO NOT miss it! <br /> <br /> Although it is a show apparently forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember ...
