It is a telenovela based on an idea of ​​applied ethics. A film about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie. I was not thrilled, the ideas are not entirely new, the tension is lacking, it becomes tedious towards the second half, but towards the end I think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way. I mean you have this bald, middle-aged, paralyzed man who has more women than Don Juan. It seems that he does not suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for more than 28 years, he has no problems with God (and probably one would also expect it), the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves (I can not forget the screams and whispers of Bergman, similar to this in many ways, that simply explode into emotions, and not all are human, etc. This film is the perfect recipe for housewives looking for emotional emotions, but do not expect to be dragged. It is a pity to see the film among all the cynicism we received today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical problem without any desire to awaken the viewer, Amenabar does not rub your face and does not take sides, does not want to make us fanatics of a particular idea. I still have no idea why this movie was so well considered.
