Television presenter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her radical cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are in a nuclear power plant when a serious accident occurs. The plant managers minimize it, but Adams has filmed everything. Wells and Adams try to put it in the air, but the corporation that runs the plant prevents it. Plant executive Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) realizes there are serious problems and the evidence has been falsified. Try executives to believe him, only they know. Wells, Adams and Godell discover that all their lives are in danger. <br /> <br /> I saw him in a cinema in 1979. He was only 17 years old and that scared me. To make matters worse, the Three Mile Island accident happened around this time, making the movie more real. Seeing it more than 20 years later, it does not scare me, but it's still an excellent movie: it works like a mystery, an exciting drama and an exhibition about the nuclear energy industry. Fonda (with red hair) has one of his best roles as Wells: perfectly conveys the growing suspicion and horror of his character when he realizes that a nuclear disaster could occur. Lemmon is (as always) excellent. He begins to believe in his company and at work, and little by little he begins to fall apart when he begins to discover things. He was legitimately nominated for an Academy Award for this. Douglas is good, but he has a small part and is completely eclipsed by Lemmon and Fonda. <br /> <br /> A really great movie, one of the best of the 70s. Do not miss it!
