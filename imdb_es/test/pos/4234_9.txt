I once commented on this great Chucky, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I saw it for the first time on a large balcony in a large theater. The movie was very funny in the theater and my first Chucky movie in a theater, and it was a special moment for me, because I appreciate Chucky. The other terror villains are referenced with GRAN COOLNESS !!! And the gore was amazingly big! The scene in which the gay boy is caught by the truck was incredibly cheerful! That was a great gore scene !!!!! And the ending was so strange and shocking that it made me s *% @ my pants. The idea of ​​having the Seed of Chucky was very, very strange and shocking! When I left the theater I loved it and I could not believe it was real. The strange and different qualities of this installment of Child's Play for some reason made me mark it as the Jason Goes series To Hell of the Child's Play. I had that intensely striking, strange and different quality that reminded me of Jason Goes to Hell. A ***** sure of ***** This is how I classify the series: 1,4,2,3. I loved it, but not as much as Tom Holland's original Child's Play. I can not wait for the Seed of Chucky! Go ahead!
