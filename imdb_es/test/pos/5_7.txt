I just went to see this movie because I've always liked Kevin Costner. I felt that Ashton did a great job on the Butterfly Effect. Unfortunately, even though these two actors were capable of good or good acting moments, something of that was missing here. Some of the scenes were simply not credible and did not have enough support in the story line. <br /> <br /> Although the film claims the influence of Hurricane Katrina, there was very little (none) in that sense in the film. . <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the fact that the film presented something of what it means to save lives from a water perspective. <br /> <br /> The special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating I'm not sure I'm going back to fishing in deep water ... <br /> <br /> I was expecting a little more emotion in the movie of what was presented. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie that could 'I've been seen on DVD.
