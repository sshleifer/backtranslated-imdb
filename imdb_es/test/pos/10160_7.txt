Apparently a story about the boy Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. The child is kidnapped to keep his parents silent. They know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of a country without a name during a performance at the Albert Hall in London. <br /> <br /> The movie is rich in Hitchcock incidents. A friendly but opaque Frenchman seems to roast the innocent Stewart, an Indiana doctor, a little too intensely to be merely curious. Later, the Frenchman appears disguised as an Arab, with a knife in his back, and whispers some information about Stewart's murder plot. Stewart tells his wife, Doris Day, that she looks very shameless, but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk her son's life. <br /> <br /> Instead, the couple tries to track the murderers, buy them and get their son back, taking them from Morocco, where Hitchcock has given us his usual view of the tourists of the customs, places and food, to London. There is a hilarious wild goose chase that involves an arrangement between Stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop. The staff is more concerned with protecting their half-stuffed specimens than with anything else, and they crawl around in a protective manner holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish. In the course of the fight, Stewart manages to prevent his throat from being cut by the swordfish beak, but is bitten in the hand by a stuffed tiger, action driven by the bumptious score of Bernard Hermann. The scene ends with Stewart running through the door. Hitchcock ends it with a shot of the head of a lion open to the closed door. There is also a joke going on, well done, about some visitors waiting in the couple's hotel room in London, waiting for things to be explained. <br /> <br /> There are two serious problems that are mentioned lightly. One is the relationship between Stewart and Day, which is not as attractive as it should be, considered a bourgeois ideal. She has been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known. And he has given everything to marry a normal boy who turns out to be a doc. That's understandable in, say, a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman who is not an international star with a promising career in her own right. It is not delved into, but the nervousness is remarkable, since it was not in the original version. It reminds me a bit of an exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his then-wife Marilyn Monroe, who had just returned from receiving the troops in Korea. "Oh, Joe," she said, "did you ever see ten thousand people standing up and cheering?" "Seventy thousand," muttered Joe, a former hero of the New York Yankees. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one of loyalty. Who has the greatest social value? The own son of one? Or an unknown ambassador. Do we risk ourselves or our loved ones for national stability? Day faces this dilemma in its hardest way in the climax at the Albert Hall. His solution opts for loyalty to political stability, although his motives are problematic. Does she scream to save the life of the ambassador, or does it only to release the anxiety that overwhelms her? (Cf: Alec Guiness falling on the detonator at the end of "The Bridge over the River Kwai.") The picture is extremely good and the setting can be threatening, even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of London. It's midday, and Stewart is alone and determined, but also scared. There are steps that echo on someone's Gulliver Street, somewhere. Are you being followed? Is your life in danger? And where the hell are everyone who lives on this street? Hitchcock pays so much attention to the details of location that we can distinguish the union of the garden wall from the bricks next to it. <br /> <br /> The director had a rare disagreement with Francois Truffaut while being interviewed for Truffaut's otherwise complimentary book. Truffaut argued that the previous version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" lacked the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied: "I think you want me to make films for the audience of the art house," but finally agreed that the 1930 version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional. There is no argument there. <br /> <br /> This is Hitchcock quite close to its zenith.
