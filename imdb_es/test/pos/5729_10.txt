Ladies and gentlemen, the show begins with this documentary. It is structured in three chapters, each ordered chronologically. The first presents classical physics and links to Einstein. The second studies in depth quantum physics and enters the theory of strings. The latter reveals the theory of Everything ... The difficult concepts used here are introduced in a very simple way, with everyday objects; although you must believe them without checking for yourself, if you are not a scientist, (and even if you are a scientist!). The film is not a masterpiece because of its fabulous technique or the way it is produced; What really matters is the story, and what a story!
