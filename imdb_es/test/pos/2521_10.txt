The first time I saw this masterpiece on VHS 10 years ago, and the powerful interpretation of the established society of children angry with pain against the established one has remained in my heart ever since. The director HÃ©ctor Babenco is such a good humanity, that he finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how urbanity kills the childhood of children of the poverty class. Even marginalized children have their beautiful and innocent dreams. But the corrupt reality never gives an opportunity ... <br /> <br /> Thanks to the editors for the recent release of the DVD, now I can keep this great movie in my favorite collection.
