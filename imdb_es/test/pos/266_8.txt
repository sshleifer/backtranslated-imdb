He inherited this from my X's DVD collection when he left with my best friend (enough said), saw him one night when there was nothing on TV (nothing new there then) and received a pleasant surprise. Very British (no budget, no faces you know or have seen before), the accents were a little thick for my taste, but after a worrying start (a little too close to home in my case) it started to grow. about me. Apart from the unnecessary cut of jokey that really did not add anything, I found that the film was very encouraging, very real and natural representations that left me wanting more of an ending that came suddenly too soon. Highly recommended!
