1931 also presented "an American tragedy", the original story of "who you will face, poor girl or rich". This was a really entertaining movie. Babs stanwyck was as pretty as she could be, the same as Sally Blane. Monroe Owsley played relentlessly Babs' husband. I had never heard of him, but I thought he had a good physical resemblance to Bing Crosby's "the big broadcast" ('32), even a line of receding hair and shrill ears. Ricardo Cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold. A true pioneer of the movie will come wayyy. The dilemma was resolved in the end, to the tensions of the title and I think Annette Hanshaw had the recording of success, although the off-screen voice did very well. I also enjoyed the scenes of the ballroom. I'm sure they were authentic; The band, leader of the time was excellent. Good job, Lionel Barrymore !!!!
