"Balance of Terror" is still one of the best episodes of Star Trek ever made. He was inspired by the film "Enemy Below" (starring Robert Mitchum), a film about a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play a similar game with a Romulan ship. This is the program that presents the war-hungry Romulans, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. It is an incredibly suspenseful episode, hermetically constructed to achieve the maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as Captain Romulan (he will later play the father of Ambassador Sarek of Spock). An episode that must be seen!
