Very memorable comedy. It is fun to see how many situations develop and finally converge after a long journey in the largest collection of eclectic humanity (and the largest in the world), the great American highway. Like "... crazy and crazy world", he has a lot of contemporary talent, old politics, good comic action and dialogue. Unlike that, the objective is what you are looking for, not the involuntary seekers: they have no idea what they really want as they move along the great path of the United States. Nor does it have the weight of having a great fallen boy who is saved only at the end by a great laugh. But the final trick sequence is spectacular, with excellent film editing, humor and rhythm, and the scene of the big city bank is hilarious with the very original acting of a very talented character in particular. The total poise of the inhabitants of the city against chaos leaves a sensation like the proverbial fly on the roof. The slapstick is fun, but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and watched closely because it is surprisingly charged with nuances and reactions of characters that are easily overlooked. In general, it is a very funny reflection of who we were and are, good or bad, and the silly situations in which we find ourselves. I was destined to be FUN and it is!
