The weakness of this comes from the confusing narrative, the arguments that often arise from nothing. But it did not really matter because I still enjoyed it to its fullest extent. Once you really accept that these films are not taken too seriously, you will enjoy them even more. It's basically a love story, at first confusing, but as it evolves, it's really worth it. Of course it has been done many times before, but the complicated version of this is quite inspiring and moving. <br /> <br /> Fantasy and CGI in general were overwhelming at first, but I still enjoyed their purpose. And people stopped whining about how they borrowed from other movies !! Guess what we know! And it really does not matter because its purpose was to entertain and entertain. Sometimes people have to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start talking. Comparing this with Hollywood standards is completely stupid and ignorant, it's a completely different style and target audience. As far as I'm concerned, some of the best films I've seen are from producers and oriental directors. There is history 4 of the Police, shaolin football, the bustle of kung fu, the door of the dragon tiger, the fist of the legend, the hero, the crouched tiger, etc. I will always be interested in this type of movies. Now, try to judge my perception, but I warn you that I see things from the point of view of those 5 countries in which I have lived. So you better have experience and be so open.
