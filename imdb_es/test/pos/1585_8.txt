After the death of all senior officers, Commander Craig-Scott of the Laundry and Moral Corps is promoted to the command of an intergalactic spacecraft owned by Starcups Corporation. Its main mission is to look for habitable planets and, of course, long-term coffee markets. <br /> <br /> Craig-Scott and his second in command, Chief Blather, are ill-equipped for command, except insofar as they are fully capable of keeping the crew's undergarments clean, This does not mean diminishing the importance of clean intimate garments, especially when incompetent commanders make those same garments dirty on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> The episodes are presented as a series of brief reports of 2 to 3 minutes by the Commander to Earth. Humor is a mixture of irony and extravagant physical comedy. Think yes. The minister meets the red dwarf, but with a limited budget. Here are all the usual devices of science fiction: aliens, nuclear weapons, computer malfunction, but each is enhanced by the fresh lemon scent of high quality laundry detergent. <br /> <br /> The Commandant's Record is definitely low budget, but the somewhat kitschy and accessory effects fit into the absurd premise of the show. Remember those funny hockey helmets they used on the old Battlestar Galactica? With the "Jofa" brand still visible? Okay, there's a lot of that in the Commander's Record, but it's nice. <br /> <br /> The Commander's Record is not a high art, but that is not what it is trying to be. It's just a bit of off-center fun. It does a good job of being that.
