Cardiff, Wales. A group of 5 classmates are deeply bored in this city. There's Jip who works in a clothing store. Coop, a simple DJ. Nina, inseparable from her best friend Lulu and Moff. The week is hell for them and they only expect one thing: the weekend. At this moment, they went out to a nightclub and to the sound of technology without music, they experienced different drugs, particularly ecstasy. Then, they usually continue the party with a friend. At the end of this very good moment on Sunday, the feelings are the following: tiredness, melancholy, just the memory of a crazy night ... <br /> <br /> Sailing in the wave of the notorious success of "Trainspotting" ( 1996), this debut film written and directed by Justin Kerrigan contributes and develops a new variation on the notion of hedonism. It means: how to have as much fun as possible and know that you have a shorter time span. In fact, as I have written previously, for the 5 main characters of the film, the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and spend a wild time without a single pressure (in addition, Jip in a sequence speaks of the positive aspects of shooting yourself: you are asleep, you do not feel any pressure, you are like an astronaut in orbit on the earth, Kerrigan's implacable managerial style expresses very well the spirit of libertinism and care of the 5 protagonists He only lives to make the most of the weekend of a hedonist, and to further enliven the festive atmosphere in which his film is bathed, Kerrigan is not afraid to include dream sequences that represent the fantasy or hot flashes of his characters Then, "Human Traffic" (1999) also has a particularly spirited soundtrack, the amount? A perfect symbiosis between sound and music. euphoria allows momentarily put aside and usual image of popular social classes, British cinema has studied a lot. <br /> <br /> However, when a film (conscientious or otherwise) exploits the fame of another celebrity, it rarely matches the brightness of its predecessor. "Human trafficking" is in this condition. There is little inventiveness at the level of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and one can write down some useless digressions (Jip, who, in the nightclub, goes to the manager's office and tells him a story about roosters and bulls to enable Moff to enter the club, but it does not help because the latter manages to come without problems). You can also blame Kerrigan for ignoring the dramatic aspects that the story might have involved. His film can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole are not practically explored. It is a pity! It could have conveyed the following message: even in the happiest moments, there may be something terrible that can be prepared. The same comment could also be said when Coop has a fit of jealousy because Nina confronts a boy. <br /> <br /> It may not be the last great movie of the nineties, since it is included in the cover of the DVD, but "Human Trafficking should be taken as a good and incisive small film that conveys the styles and the fashions of the late twentieth century, a desire to have fun without further reasons or problems, an ideal movie to start any party or before going to a club.
