What was the appointment of Archbishop Tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this movie was very disturbing to see in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years I am ashamed <br /> <br /> they are all human and everyone has the right to live your life in peace and harmony <br /> <br /> live and let live <br /> <br /> if someone knows the appointment, let me know Thank you <br /> <br /> this movie should be shown All The world should know much more publicly than events as horrific as those shown in the film, in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.
