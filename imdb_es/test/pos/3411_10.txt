Several weeks ago I lost my dear friend and friend of fourteen years, a golden retriever named Sasha. When I arrived home from the animal hospital, alone, after having made one of the most painful decisions of my life, my teenage daughter sat next to me. . And we're talking about this episode of the Twilight Zone. I could be wrong, but I remember a phrase that Arthur Hunnicutt said, when Satan was trying to trick him into going to hell, but his dog could not go with him. . and his dog, in turn, growled in defiance of the porter trying to trick the old hunter into "entering." . That it would be "a hell of heaven if dogs were not allowed", and the spirit of the old mountaineer and his dog decided to get away from the door (what they had thought was heaven, to wander alone for eternity). What a moment of tears when they meet a "good country boy" on that eternal road, only to discover that he is an angel, sent to look for them, and "clear neighbor, of course, dogs are allowed to enter heaven". <br /> <br /> I will confess that I cried while talking about this with my daughter while we mourned the passing of our beloved Golden. Rod Serling was really a genius, a voice that in the early sixties came out against racism, hatred, "knowing nothing" and deeply inspired me to become a writer. This episode, for forty-five years, conveyed a message of consolation to all of us who have lost a dear friend. I urge you to get a copy the next time it's one of the Twilight Zone marathons or buy it. There will be some tears, but also consolation. As always, thanks Rod, for everything you've taught us. . .even now.
