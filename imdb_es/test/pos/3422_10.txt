I have not seen a movie in a long time that moved me and grabbed me in such a way; I could not take my eyes off the screen. I was fighting for the bathroom; and I did not even want to pause because they attracted me. Emotive; powerful; very moving; Horrible and heartbreaking. It gives you an incredible view of South Africa; Their struggles and their lives. The performance of the drivers was amazing and the script was incredible. In spite of the terrible events that take place in this film and how horrible the story is; It captivated me. I do not even want to try to explain the story; It's too complex and it would not do it justice. Please see this; You will understand why when you do it. Greetings, Hol
