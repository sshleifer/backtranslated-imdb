It is out of the question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT the Princess Anastasia. Apart from the very distinctive differences in physical appearance (Anderson's eyes are noticeably larger, thicker lips, bigger nose and turned towards the end ... etc), Anderson's inability to speak in Russian was a ridiculous warning ... that's why I hate Anna Anderson as much as her classmates. Not many scammers have the audacity and resistance to cheat for more than 60 years with such a blatantly unsustainable plan. <br /> <br /> However, to some extent I feel sympathy for Anna Anderson. Life must have been difficult for a young Polish peasant in those days. And impersonating another woman for more than 60 years is an arduous task for anyone. She had to repress her full lips all the time to imitate Anastasia's thin lips, and had to go crazy to make people believe that all her chaotic memory was simply the result of a mental problem. <br /> <br /> Anna Anderson was an incredible woman on the wrong path. If she had made use of her good looks, learned elegance, endurance and acting skills, she could have made a first-class actress. <br /> <br /> On a side note: Some main characters in this two-part game seem to be slightly based on real figures. Prince Erich could be a mixture of Gleb Botkin (believed by many the most possible brain behind the scheme), Duke George and Dmitri of Leuchtenberg, and several other figures. And Darya Romanoff seems to be based on the beautiful princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova. But unlike the real companions, Prince Erich had no reason for this show and supported Anna for her love and sincere belief in her, which is touching. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great show. Fictionalized a bit but remains true to reality. The power of Amy Irving's performance is that she successfully represented Anderson's self-confidence, the mixture of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing. As Princess Xenia said about Anderson: "She was herself at all times and never gave the slightest impression of being a part". Highly recommended
