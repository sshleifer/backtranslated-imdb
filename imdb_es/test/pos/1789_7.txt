What kind do I say about this movie? Well, to begin with, I thought that this movie was fine, not the best or the worst. I said this because I thought the script was great and original, really different and refreshing. Now I would not say it's the best movie I've seen cause of acting. The actors who played each role, seem to have played them without emotion, as if they were taking their lives. When the wife laughed or cried, this did not seem real for some reason, that's just an example, but honestly all the characters did not really act. I'd like to be able to say more positive things about this movie so that you can see it at least once, but how can I do that because I know I'm not going to see this movie again? I rented this movie in my school library, without hearing anything about the film itself or the director. I took a risk because the story described in the back sounded very interesting and it really was.
