This masterpiece, almost ignored, is that the Monkees realize that they are fictional characters in a movie (Head), and that everything they do or say has already been written in a script (invisible) that they seem to be following. Head was written by Jack Nicholson, Rafelson and Peter Tork during a three-day LSD trip in an expensive hotel suite in Hollywood. The other three Monkees only acted on him. <br /> <br /> They fight in this way in everything they can do things that are not in the script. They deliberately get rid of their lines, they move away from the scenarios, they break landscapes, they hit other actors without any reason; And ultimately, commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. <br /> <br /> For example, in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene, if you look frame by frame, you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and the cameraman, shooting deliberately at the mirror. It reveals that the party is really false and is being filmed in a studio with actors who suddenly abandon the character and move away in the middle of a conversation when the Director shouts "Cut!" <br /> <br /> However, Monkees never abandons the character because those characters are also who they really are. That ends up being the core of Revelation shortly. <br /> <br /> At every step, they realize that their increasingly strange actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted movie they can not help but be. You say they went crazy and walked through the sky (what turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the back of the stage)? No problem! Hey, hey, they're the Monkees, and those extravagant guys just keep kidding! <br /> <br /> In the end, even their deaths did not release them. That's how the movie was supposed to end, and their flooded and immobile bodies are taken out of the river, put in another box and stacked in the warehouse of a movie studio until the characters are needed again for another studio production . <br /> <br /> This is made even more poignant by the fact that the Monkees really ARE fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world. They did it through the power of their music. <br /> <br /> Ironically, near the end, Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as a very profound revelation that solves his problem, but unfortunately, no one listens. <br /> <br /> Peter realizes: "It does not matter if we're in the box (the movie)." It means that it does not matter if the will is free or illusory, and that "the only important thing is that you let the present moment happen and that it happens ... You need to let" now "happen, as it happens." , without analyzing, evaluating or judging if the experience is "valid" according to an abstract definition. <br /> <br /> When you can not even tell the difference, be free or not, it does not matter, tie up to find out if you're the "real" you're just a useless waste of time. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at a very important moment in my life. I was trying to figure out how to escape from being just "that geeky, spooky nerd girl" thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun (ie, sex) like everyone else did. But the revelation in Head broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork will know. <br /> <br /> For decades, I've seen "Head" and I wish I could thank Pete. <br /> <br /> Was this a good movie? <br /> <br /> Uhh, how about, like ... <br /> <br /> == <YES> ==
