This sequel shows that Tim Burton was, for all intents and purposes, the best option to direct a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman facing three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (furtive Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the excellent Christopher Walken). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best entry in the series has everything: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that really stands out. The cast is simply wonderful, although the most prominent feature is DeVito as the multi-layered penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, sad, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still makes my back shudder. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and everyone turns into top-level performances. <br /> <br /> I do not hesitate to say that "Batman Returns" is my favorite of all the Batmans released (sorry, Fans of Dark Knight). If you want a superhero movie that has something more to offer besides eye-catching effects and large-scale action, please take a look at this highly underestimated film. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, it is at least the best movie that Tim Burton has ever made.
