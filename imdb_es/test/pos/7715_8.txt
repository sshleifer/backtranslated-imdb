This is one of the anime movies in the Animatrix collection, one of nine, the only one made in black and white and the only one that presents Trinity. With a rich texture and beautifully represented in every way, and the animated version of Trinity definitely does it justice. If you are a fan of The Matrix, you should put this on your short list.
