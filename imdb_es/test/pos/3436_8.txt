In December 1945, a train leaves the central station of Stockholm towards Berlin. There is not much left when it arrives. Not the train and not some passengers. <br /> <br /> This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and he acted like they used to act in the 40s and he also photographed (in b / w) as he used to. during this period. The actors must have had a lot of fun doing it. There are not many of the characters, as if they were not in the 40s, but the story is well told and everyone has time. <br /> <br /> A black and funny movie. Look at it, if you did not think the Swedes were capable of humor.
