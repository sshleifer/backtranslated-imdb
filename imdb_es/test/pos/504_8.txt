However, close up the movie is for comics, it does not matter. This film is radically away from the boredom of "Interview with the vampire" (although his performance was good) and slides into the wonderful action scenes. I am very convincing and interesting story with a surprisingly good performance of all. Disadvantage - poor graphics. Does it matter? Do not
