I really like the wind and the lion. It was a good movie. I thought that since I am young and it was done so long ago, I would not like it to be so good, but after seeing it, I was surprised at how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone I showed them liked it. I liked it because it showed how Arabs and people in Morocco were treated in the early 1900s, by Germans, French and even Americans. If I were a high school history teacher, I would definitely show it to a High School student's point of view. I give this movie a good 10 out of 10. My grandparents liked it so much that they bought it for themselves. My little 3-year-old cousins ​​even sit and look at him. <br /> <br /> Systemoffell
