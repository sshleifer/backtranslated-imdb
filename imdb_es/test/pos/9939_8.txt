Finally I managed to get a copy of the Opera of Dario Argento, and I tell you ... it was about time! It was Argento's last film that I had not seen yet and I'm a fan of most of his work. I recognize that most of his work is extremely important for the horror genre, but some of his films tend to disappoint (like Phenomena). But the idea of ​​Opera's plot always appealed to me and it turned out that he was right! I enjoyed every shot at Opera and I was fascinated by this film from the first minute to the last. Of all the Argento films, Opera went straight to number one and I hope to encourage as many people as possible to see this one too. <br /> <br /> The script and the plot of Opera are quite simple. Especially compared to Phenomena, Argento's previous film, which had too many ideas and ended up being a disaster. The plot of Opera is chilling and chilling, but at the same time it is an excellent satirical commentary, almost a parody, towards the opponents of explicit violence. *** SPOILERS *** A young opera singer (the beautiful Cristina Marsillach) is being harassed by a horribly sadistic killer. During each slaughter she commits, she forces Betty to observe her actions with her eyes wide open. There are needles attached to your eyelids and when you close them, they tear. *** FINAL SPOILERS ***. To this simple but effective idea, Argento adds a lot of horrible elements like the crows, the classic piece (and the curse) of MacBeth and the entire atmospheric location of the opera and music building. Especially the presence of the spooky crows is an extra value. Old Masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew that these black birds have a lot of mystery that surrounds them, and Dario Argento knows it too. <br /> <br /> Violence and blood are very well presented at Opera and that is what makes this a true image of Argento. His best in my opinion with Profondo Rosso as second place. Surely I hope to recommend this movie to many people among you. Especially for fans of the terror business (Italian), this is an absolute necessity! Favorite scene of "Rewind": Argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene in which Betty's friend is shot in the eye while trying to see who is in front of the door.
