Fame was launched in the United States a year before I was born; I was too young to remember the original version of Fame, and yet I listened and read many things about it. Like the fact that it generated a television series and that its soundtrack was directed by Irene Cara, the success of Giogio Moroder, 'Fame'. <br /> <br /> Fame was possibly the first of its kind to portray and showcase the World of Performing Arts in the form of a feature film. The lives, the struggles, the obstacles faced by the students and some of the teachers were in full view of the spectators. <br /> <br /> The performances were excellent, but one of the ones that caught my attention was Gene Anthony Ray. , who played the problematic but promising Leroy. Angry, frustrated and initially rude, his character became less angry and frustrated and more committed to his studies, not only with the practical performance but also the theoretical. Irene Cara was as good as Coco, since the scene with her removed her blouse while filmed by a perverted director was quite uncomfortable to watch, as well as Paul McCrane for his incredible portrayal of a vulnerable but closed homosexual who tried to deal with life and violence. he enrolled in a performing arts school in New York, after he was expelled from the army when he told them he was gay. Ralph, played by Barry Miller, was interesting, but sometimes, his character irritated my nerves. <br /> <br /> The choreography was excellent, there were some good dance numbers involved and the "hot lunch" scene in the cafeteria was worth seeing. Another scene that was great was when the song 'Fame' was played and all the children started running through the streets of New York and danced wildly and without any worries in the world. It was a street jam like no other. <br /> <br /> In the long run, the only star that really benefited from this was, and it's Debbie Allen, she later became a producer, director and star, although she worked mainly behind the scenes in shows like Everybody Hates Chris and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Paul McCrane later starred with Peter Weller in the film, 'Robocop', where he played a villain and ER as the critic and detestable Dr. Roman. <br /> <br /> British director Alan Parker filmed this really well. It allowed the artists to dance, act, sing to the maximum their content without wanting to interfere and affect their styles. <br /> <br /> Throughout the duration of the film, we see the various stages that students encounter during their 4 years, from their auditions to the first year, up to the graduation in High School For The Arts of New York <br /> <br /> Fame is one of those movies that caters to or is directed to a particular audience that is not. It's not necessarily the general community of movie lovers, it's definitely not for everyone. <br /> <br /> For my part, I enjoyed it because I have an interest in the arts, not technically in terms of being an interpreter because I am not one but as someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be ch Through hard work, commitment and passion for what you do with your talents. Therefore, if you are an aspiring dancer, actor or simply creative, you might be interested in a movie like this, although the events at Fame are similar to what it is at a performing arts school / school in reality. Life, then that is a completely different matter. <br /> <br /> The new 2009 version of this movie was released recently and, frankly, it practically pales in comparison. <br /> <br /> As for the original Fame, almost 30 years later, yes, it's a little outdated, but it's still a great movie, though. <br /> <br /> It's not an absolute classic, but as an 80s cult classic, in line with other hit 80s movies, such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame hits the nail on the head. Is not it a coincidence that all those dance films start with the letter 'F'? <br /> <br /> Gritty, touching and intriguing, this is worth a watch.
