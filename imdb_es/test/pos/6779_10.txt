The game was made in 1996, but it's still good today. The graphics are not so attractive and the actors are not worthy of Oscar, but the plot is twisted, devilish and very nice. The dark story is convincing from the first film and continues throughout the work. We played several people together for several reasons: 1) to use all our minds together. 2) Do not be so afraid <br /> <br /> Play this game and you will not regret this, just do not try to find an earthquake engine there.
