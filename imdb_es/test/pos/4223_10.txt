The success of SCREAM gave rise to a new wave of horror films. I'm happy with that, like a big horror fan, and I liked most of those new horror movies. BOC is a great horror package. Colorful, fast and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) as it appears with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the doll-little boy relationship, here we have a twisted movie about couples. We have sweet young lovers in contrast to crazy lovers the size of a killer doll. Very inventive!
