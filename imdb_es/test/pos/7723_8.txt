This film is a fairly fair adaptation of the novel by Prosper Merimeé. In the novel, Merimeé himself is a character, Don José is from Navarra (northern Spain and, historically, an area of ​​the Basque Country, can speak Basque). They are in Seville (Andalusia, southern Spain) and only speak Spanish with an Andalusian accent, in no way do they speak Basque, but Carmen explains to Don José that she was living in Navarra. You can believe it or not, anyway, this is the version of the book, so you can not be critical of the movie about this, be with the book! It should be noted that the novel by Merimeé and Bizet's opera are different, and this film is an adaptation of the novel, anyway, in the opera, Don José is still Spanish from Navarre, he is never French. Why do so many people still think that Don José is French? I do not know, but I guess because the novel and the opera are in French, although they're supposed to be in Spanish. <br /> <br /> The only important difference between the film and the novel is that in the film Don José also kills Carmen's "bullfighter" lover and in the novel he does not (nor in the opera). I guess they wanted to keep the movie a little more gore! I think the movie is pretty good, anyway.
