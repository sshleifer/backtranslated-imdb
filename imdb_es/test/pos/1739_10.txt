I remember being so excited on Saturday nights as a child, waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then, I grew up, Dr. Who got out of the air, and no one I knew had heard about that. Then I discovered that there was going to be a new series. I was a little nervous about that. Was she going to live up to the expectations she had had since she was a child? Would they ruin it? Would it be the Dr. suck? Would his assistant suck? Would they create a more intimate relationship with Dr. and his assistant? YES, NO, NO, NO, NO !!! This show is wonderful! I love the new Dr. I love your assistant. I love the show And I feel excited on Friday nights, waiting for the "new" episode. Right now I'm watching episodes of 2005, how I live in the United States, so I'm a bit behind the rest of you. I hope the next Dr. is as good as this one!
