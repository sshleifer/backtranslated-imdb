In my opinion, the army of dads is the best British comedy of all time. I think if you only watch one episode of the show, you can not judge it completely in that episode, (this includes the movie) At least you should see a series of this program, enter the characters, familiarize yourself with the environment and the situations in which you find. When you become familiar with the program, it will begin to look attractive to you. Now the movie has some changes in the series that is a bit disappointing, but it still works. Look at a series or two in the series before seeing this. You will not be disappointed. Good episode to watch is "No Spring for Frazer"
