I can not hate in the program. When the old (and better) television technology had to hit the bricks, the channel was reformatted and new programs intervened. "Attack of the Show" is the replacement of the Screen Savers, with 3 co-presenters at the beginning. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran became a co-host as well, but mostly made pre-recorded pieces for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the program, and finally there was a contest to see who would be the third presenter, but that did not succeed for some reason. <br /> <br /> Eventually (I just found out about this IMDb message board) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran went ahead because (hey, this is what I read) the two got married. That was a great secret for me! Now there's a new co-host, Olivia Munn, who is not so good (my opinion). She is hiding something in those blouses she wears, while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and was not afraid to show it. <br /> <br /> AHEM! Sorry. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Show" deals with everything young people want to know. It's music, movies, comics, internet and television. This is what is great about the show. If you do not want to bother searching the net or waste time watching MTV, you can get everything you want in AOTS. Some segments and bits that they make are fun. They have regular guests and collaborators who are in the industry, as well as guests ranging from insignificant Internet stars to big real names. <br /> <br /> Even though the hosts are not as geeky as I would like. To be, I still find that "Attack of the Show" is entertaining, even with its latest line-up.
