I LOVE Dr. WHAT! I think David Tennant is the best Dr. who has had the program and Billie Piper the Best partner! I liked the way Dr and Rose had such a connection and a great relationship, and the Dr approached several times to express their love for Rose! Unfortunately it ended after only 2 seasons. I'll miss seeing lots of roses and I'll think the show will not be the same without Rose. But David is still there to make me laugh and I'm glad to see him play this fantastic role! I rate this show 110% is FANTASTIC! The graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and each story is different but somewhat connected and in fact, I have learned some things about the love, the world and the relationships of this show. That's why it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time!
