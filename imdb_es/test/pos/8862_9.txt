Antarctica, winter 1982. A group of crazed Norwegians surprise the team at an American research base that is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill him. All Norwegians are killed and Americans are left with nothing but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That is the beginning of the best horror / suspense movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, you feel the tense and paranoid mood. Helpless and alone in no man's land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I do not know because, from what I see, your score is simple, scary and very good. It really puts you in a good mood. <br /> <br /> The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog that is simply amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs, I can not say anything less. <br /> <br /> Can you think that 1982 and the special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You have not seen everything until you've seen this. Bodyparts falling and creatures changing shape ... Rob Bottin has done a great job that today is a milestone in special effects makeup. <br /> <br /> The film did not get a great response when it first came to the big screen due to other alien films of the time and that is why it is not very well known. In fact, you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked has heard about that. However, the film has managed to survive for more than twenty years as a cult movie on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and, except for the haircut, the film is quite updated. This movie should be considered a classic. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely one of my, if not my favorite. I have seen it several times, but it is as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian, the only thing I do not like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegian Swedes.
