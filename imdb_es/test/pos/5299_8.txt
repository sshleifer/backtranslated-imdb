I have recently seen this movie and I have decided to comment on it. <br /> <br /> The best way to see this movie is not to wait for what you have seen in the past by Miyazaki. Miyazaki is well known for his work on Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. Good for western viewers anyway. Both films were similar to each other but at the same time completely different. However, Ponyo is a completely different kind of story and animation. <br /> <br /> The story follows "Ponyo", a fish that has the face of a girl. After Ponyo escapes from her house at the bottom of the sea, finds a new world that she never knew was there, and also new problems, when she was almost caught by a fishing boat, she was rescued by a five-year-old boy. boy known as Sousuke. <br /> <br /> The story follows the two and the pure friendship between a child and a fish. Can Ponyo really stay with Sousuke forever? <br /> <br /> I feel that the movie is inspired by "The Little Mermaid" and at the same time it is similar to "Tonari no Totoro" <br /> <br /> The movie is very short and you have very little It's time to learn about the characters in this movie. But the characters are a fish and a small child. How much do you expect to learn about them? The movie is about what seems to be 3 days, I think that's why the movie is so short. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope everyone enjoys this movie too
