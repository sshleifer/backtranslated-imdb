A man named Joseph Samuels is brutally murdered in his apartment. It seems that Samuels was visited by a group of drunken soldiers the night before, and with one of them apparently missing, the evidence certainly implicates the missing soldier. But as Detective Finlay digs deeper into the case, he discovers that they may be barking at the wrong tree, and that this crime is about something desperately sad and vile, anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> The Crossfire was born from the novel written by Richard Brooks, adapted by John Paxton and directed by the excellent Edward Dmtryk, Crossfire (originally titled Cradle Of Fear) is a tense and exciting image that boldly addresses the anti-Semitism Although the creators were forced to attenuate the story of the original source, the novel is about hatred of homosexuals and not anti-Semitism, which is due, in large part to the supremo of RKO Dore Schary and producer Adrian Scott, is a kind of disquieting restlessness that drips with the Noirish style. <br /> <br /> The cast includes three of Bob, Young, Mitchum and Ryan, with beloved Noir Gloria Grahame adding the emotional female heart. Although only the third was billed, it is the image of Robert Ryan in its entirety, its representation as intimidation, Montgomery's connivance comes from the top draw and perfectly shows the talent he had in abundance. Ryan had a good reason to give Montgomery some of his best work, since he had served in the Marine with the same Richard Brooks, since both men had discussed the possibility that if the novel was to become a movie, then Ryan I wanted to go in and play. Montgomery, that's how the genesis of Ryan's career was born as weasel types. Gloria Grahame also takes a wonderful and sincere turn, which is even more remarkable since at that time she was being harassed by her abusive husband. It was known that Stanley Clements was violent with her and his constant presence around the set irritated others in the cast, but Grahame, probably channeling the emotion of real life, became the character of Ginny and really shone. Bob Mitchum and Bob Young are also very skilled, to really seal the deal in what really is a Crossfire image with intelligent acting. <br /> <br /> Tho Crossfire was launched before the other anti-Semitic image of 1947, Gentlemen's Agreement, and with more than a million and a quarter dollars at the box office, part of its thunder was stolen by the winning image of the Fox Studio Academy Award. Nominated for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor {Ryan}, Best Supporting Actress {Grahame}, Best Director and Best Screenplay, won nothing, but critics of the time called it a brilliant change in American cinema, and today it stands out. Proud and dark as a daring and excellent work. 8.5 / 10
