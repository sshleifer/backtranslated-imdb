I saw it last night at the London Film Festival, apparently the shortest version. James McNally's summary of the film's content is very good. Nossiter very skilfully combines his research into the wine business with broader concerns about globalization, homogenization, the effect of the media, the power of capital and the need for diversity. <br /> <br /> The movie is hand-filmed that held the DV that some might find offensive, but that allows Nossiter to catch people off guard several times, which probably would not have been possible with the use of more conventional equipment. <br /> <br /> Despite the feeling of the movie. The editing is very clear, not only gives us a parade of the dogs of the world, but also underestimates the comments of several interviewees with somewhat contradictory visual images and gives others enough rope to hang. To a certain extent, this evokes the recent work of Michael Moore (although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but probably the roots of the film go back to Marcel Ophuls's "The Sorrow and the Pity", both in the way the film is built as In the emergence of 'salt of the earth' the French peasants as the stars. De Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF selection and answered questions later. In fact, we all need a little mess: bravo Hubert! <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent film with implications that go beyond the world of wine in the way we build ourselves as people and organize our world.
