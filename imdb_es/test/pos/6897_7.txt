SOLD THE DEAD (2009) ** 1/2 Dominic Monaghan, Larry Fessenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scrimm, John Speredakos, Eileen Colgan, Brenda Cooney. Unequal mixture of horror and comedy that is presented as a lover of horror films of the 60's by Roger Corman and Hammer Studios, with two cretinous tomb robbers (Monaghan and Fessenden) who face the ultimate punishment for crimes through The guillotine, but not before your Hidden stories can be retrieved in flashbacks. Fun and some shakes well splashed, but really a mess of a B-movie that tried to be a cult classic in large part thanks to the casting of gender veterans Perlman and Scrimm in vain; A good rental for Halloween.
