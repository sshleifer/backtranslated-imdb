The brilliant thriller by John Carpenter is a great fusion of science fiction and horror, adopting the classic theme of body exchange and taking it to the extreme. Carpenter, a remake of the Howard Hawks, originally produced in 1951, keeps the Cold War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop for the extraterrestrial takeover and impending doom in the midst of insanity and isolation. Antarctic scenario. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent, as his camera slides through the solitary world of the characters whose habitable surroundings are about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of taking the body. But here, and like the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter does not stop the incident, because through some fantastic special effects, we witness some moments of surreal madness. However, he never loses contact with the human side of the story, because in the face of all the impact that happens in front of us, we are left with the perceived notions of trust and suspicion. <br /> <br /> 9/10
