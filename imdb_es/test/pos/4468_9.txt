As far as I know, I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are now appearing on DVD, and I must say that this was his best "pre-zombie" offer. In fact, it surpasses his latest films. This is a story of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian city in the middle of nowhere, where young people die mysteriously. It is not a mystery how they died, I suppose, it is more who is doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch? Is she a young woman who lives in a modern and elegant house on the outskirts of the city, who used to consume many drugs? Is he the town idiot, who is attacked early for being in the wrong place at the wrong time? You will only know if you look, and observe what you should, since this is a first class mystery thriller, or should I say, a "giallo". I've seen this before, but it's been a long time and a second time I saw it was as powerful as the first time. For those of you who only know Lucio Fulci for his zombie movies, open their minds to this because it's worth seeing and while the "monsters" in this are human, they are just as unpleasant as anything else you've seen in his latest movies. . 9 out of 10 stars, see it! Please....
