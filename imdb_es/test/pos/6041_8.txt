Jack Webb finally gives more than his usual Indian interpretation in wood. He played the epitome of the jug head, brainwashing, assaulting the beaches, semper fi, hard-headed military idiot. The Body above all, including humanity. This great movie showed the idiosity of Boot Camp to the fullest. 4 stars.
