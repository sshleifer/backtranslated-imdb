ccmovieman-1 should be, like the critic in the New York Times who preferred the album Janis Joplin Big Brother and Holding Company to the newly released album "White" by the Beatles, it was called evil or insane. National Velvet is a great movie. The performance of Elizabeth Taylor is fantastic, and I can not discern a trace of accent, much less one. His performance is very natural, authentic and incredibly charming. The rest of the cast is excellent, especially Rooney and Revere. <br /> <br /> When it comes to dialogue as hokey or sentimental, I suggest that you have dined during a diet of irony and have lost the ability to discern genuine emotion and human interaction. There was a time when people really thought and talked like that. It is not that this film does not have a slight hint of magical impregnation through it. That is the reason to tell the story. One could also criticize the Wizard of Oz, King Kong, the Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, the Black Stallion (the other great horse movie) or another thousand films for having action and dialogues that seem richer than real life. No, my friend, National Velvet endures because of her belief firmly in herself, with her tongue firmly not on her cheek. Something that today jaded filmmakers find almost impossible to recreate.
