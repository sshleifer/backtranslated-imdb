Murder by Numbers is a pretty good movie. Although the plot develops at full speed, as the character of Sandra Bullock is mixed with his partner and the film goes back to a previous traumatic situation in which he was, manages to keep the viewer involved in the film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I think it does a good job of establishing that kind of "who did it" type environment. It keeps you guessing which of the guys was really behind the murder, if not both. I think Ryan Gosling and that other child (lol) do a good job selling that bully against fool relationship. I'm not sure Gosling plays a bad boy, but for a guy who would later star in a movie like The Notebook, he did a good job. However, once the movie starts rolling, I really found myself involved in the story and I asked myself, "Oh, my God, what would I do if I were in that situation?" Like I said, a good CSI type movie, maybe not for the addict of the EXTREME crime drama film, but a good movie for everyone. <br /> <br /> 8 outta 10
