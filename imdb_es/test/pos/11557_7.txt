Sometimes I really wonder? When I look at the comments here, it seems that most people have seen a completely different movie than I have seen. I just saw it ... and I liked it. Not the way he made me happy, but having seen a good movie! <br /> <br /> The movie needs some patience, yes. And yes, the main character is REALLY annoying, but I'm sure it's by intention. <br /> <br /> Maybe it really makes a difference if you see this movie in a movie theater or at home. Most people watch movies at home as if they were listening to elevator music. This movie definitely does not fit like background noise. <br /> <br /> And no. Good direction does not mean having five laughs or explosions per second. A good direction means to follow your theme and keep the story and the actors together. And although that does not work perfectly, at least I think it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> I liked the photography and the sets, even if they sometimes arise from the surreal. The opening scene is really special. <br /> <br /> I also liked the performance? Guillaume Depardieu is NOT playing Pierre. He is playing the role of a Pierre who himself is playing a role! Pierre is not the romantic hero who tries to be so hard, he's a presumptuous and honest idiot, a skinny skinny who hurts all the people he claims to protect. That even his love for the truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his constant lie and not even once he asks questions or explains himself. <br /> <br /> People wonder where this or that person came from and other things: Not the character that is seen during more than two scenes is left unexplained, there is enough information scattered throughout the film at all. <br /> <br /> And even the strange building starts to make sense as soon as you see the objective of the practice: Remember that Isabelle fled from a war zone and, obviously, this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war, most likely in Bosnia (which was still happening when the film was produced). At least, that is what is insinuated in the story that Isabelle tells Pierre when she meets him for the first time and in the later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with his father on the cover, which is surrounded by books about Bosnia
