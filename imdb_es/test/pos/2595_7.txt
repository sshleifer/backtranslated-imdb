... And there were some of these <br /> <br /> I do not like this caricature like so many others, partly because it was done in its time. I prefer cartoons with Daffy and Bugs, which are about fifteen years before. Many people will like this, particularly people who always find violence funny, with cartoons or not. <br /> <br /> The basic plot is pretty well-known for Looney Tunes: Elmer goes out to hunt, Daffy takes him to Bugs and Daffy ends up being shot in his place. Also quite clever and very entertaining jokes were inserted (some do not improve the episode), shots and ugly animations that are a little mediocre. The plot is mainly oriented by jokes: each joke keeps the episode going. This way of making frames is not so unusual in Looney Tunes (of course, if you are a boffin of Looney Tunes, or an anxious one, like me, then you will already know). <br /> <br /> For people who love everything about Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck and like the sound of what I've said about it, enjoy "Rabbit Seasoning"! <br /> <br /> 7 and a half out of ten.
