There is not much to say other than that it is simply a masterpiece. This movie contains a lot of messages that everyone should take seriously. especially, women do not crush their man's dreams, honor them, that's why they loved him in the first place! Those who plan death will live in the grave. Those who carpe diem will awaken those who live in fear. Even our Lord spoke of this when he rebuked the one who buried his talent for fear of making a mistake and displeasing the Master. Take a risk, get out of the boat and walk on the water. Life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our minds and souls.
