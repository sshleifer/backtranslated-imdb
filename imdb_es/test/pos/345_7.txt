Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a cult who lives in the desert and tries to resurrect one of his own, just to have a heart attack! He ends up dying on an operating table, and for the sake of revenge, his spirit seizes the body of the main character (Jill Jacobson), who then proceeds to hack and cut until his fellow nurses learn what needs to be done. to exorcise the demon. <br /> <br /> While I know enough about the filmography of the directors to know that it consists mainly of a stupid, "Nurse Sherri" is not really that bad. Of course, it is clear that it was a very low budget topic, but all I found very annoying about it were the visual effects. The performance is not as bad as you might expect. <br /> <br /> There are two different versions available on DVD. A much more sex-oriented version with abundant amounts of T & A is the original cut, with vignettes as fun as the victim and his love interest sharing his "strangest sex" moments, including one related to fellatio during a conference at the university! br /> <br /> The film would then be cut again for the theatrical version with the elements of horror emphasized with greater force. Some scenes are eliminated with new ones added (with Stevens, the role played by J.C. Wells, expanded). The most memorable sequence of the films in this cut is a scene in a foundry, and it works quite well. This cut of the movie is more interesting in general; I would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare them. <br /> <br /> Both versions reach their rhythm in the last third, and benefit from a wonderful performance by Bill Roy as the crazy Reanhauer, and a capricious climax located in a cemetery (although it was actually filmed in the Adamsons backyard!). It is also worth mentioning Marilyn Joi as the cute nurse who is attracted to the footballer Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), who lost his eyes in a car accident and, by the way, is key to solving the story with his knowledge of the rituals of voodoo. The film also makes a fun use of music from the personal collection of composer Harry Lubins, which includes compositions for television series such as 'One Step Beyond' and 'The Outer Limits'. <br /> <br /> "Nurse Sherri" (known for more alternative titles (including "Beyond the Living" and "Hospital of Terror") than any other Adamson movie) are actually quite entertaining and economical. I ended up having a good time watching him. <br /> <br /> 7/10
