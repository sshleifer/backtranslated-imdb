This British film version of the play I AM A CAMERA is based on the "Stories of Berlin" by Christopher Isherwood. This is the source of material from the famous musical CABARET. <br /> <br /> Julie Harris, one of the most important theater actresses of her time, resumes her role as Sally Bowles in 1951, winner of the Tony Award. She is far from the character of Liza Minnelli, but the basic "Sally" is here despite the various movie codes that would have prevented this story from being filmed in Hollywood. Harris is maybe stagy but she's also pretty good like crazy and maddening Sally. Her singer number is obviously doubled (by Marlene Dietrich no less), although Harris apparently sings to herself at other times. <br /> <br /> Laurence Harvey (with very ugly hair) plays Isherwood without charm and can not even make the character interesting. Shelley Winters recently played the role of Natalia (Marian Winters won a supporting Tony for the play), and Anton Diffring is fine as Fritz. Ron Randell plays the Clive caddy but it seems a bit noisy. Lee Seidl is funny like the housewife. <br /> <br /> However, despite the general stupidity and the cheap aspect, Harris is the protagonist and she is amazing. This film debuted the same year as EAST OF EDEN, in which Harris offers a brilliant performance as Abra. The comparison of the two presentations gives a good look at the talent that Miss Harris has. These two characters could not be more unequal. Sally, of Harris, gets angry, mocks and lets out a lascivious laugh. She also acts in circles around the bored Harvey. <br /> <br /> Without the music and with a family history, many viewers may find little here to recommend this film, but it is a great opportunity to see the great Julie Harris repeating what happens. It was probably a very shocking role in 1951.
