Clearly, my rating for this is not to suggest that it compares to the class horrors of Argento's tastes, but to the low budget of another 70, to handle the rates and in that department really is a classic. The lack of money proves, (Does anyone care too much?) The performance is more appropriate than professional, (does that make it more realistic?), But unlike many other films, and not just low budget, this does not it lengthens just a moment. The shit can be, but non-stop, in your face, and although sometimes it's a bit corny, this is a must-see for anyone who has any idea what I'm talking about. Sometimes, quite delirious, this little crazy movie full of crazy characters is clearly made for fun and, in fact, is to see it.
