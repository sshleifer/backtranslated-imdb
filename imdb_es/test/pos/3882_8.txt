In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) walk down a street in a neighborhood in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, arguing angrily in French on a cell phone, passes by, prompting James says: "There is nothing hotter than an angry French woman." A few blocks later, they pass by an elderly Filipina woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca comments, for the referential effect, "There's nothing hotter than an angry Filipino old woman." <br /> <br /> The humor in Jeff Garlin's I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is best characterized by the word everyday. The movie is a conversation. We could also be listening. Instead of doing antics, the film is based on defects of character and human curiosity to deliver laughter. While it is not innovative, it is far from banal, and even if James sees himself as quite a jejun, we know he is quite average, and this makes him want to. <br /> <br /> Self-improvement is the main theme of the film. Sarah Silverman, who plays Beth, is excellent as the catalyst for change; She revitalizes James, and that's why she reminds him to live a better life. Even so, achieving an idyllic dream is not the end of these characters, but something simpler: that they can pick up the pieces of life they love, only to maintain themselves enough to continue. <Br /> <br /> A movie about life lessons can be overrun, as you can forget about connecting with your audience. I want someone with whom I eat cheese to be subtle and attractive, and while their morale may not be inspiring, it's still resonant. This is a low profile comedy, but it will stay with you.
