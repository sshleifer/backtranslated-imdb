I saw this movie on my flight from Philadelphia to Denver. The screen had three rows in front of me and approximately 12 "x 10". So I really was not going to see it. But I like Malcolm in the middle, so I thought I would see him only for a few minutes. The next thing I know is that I felt attracted, having a great time, and was pleased with how good it was and how fast it seemed to make time go by. I agree that the performance is very good for this level of entertainment. Being one of the oldest baby boomers, I was also pleased to see Lee Majors with a role in the film, as with a couple of other actors who were famous (Jamiel?) "Yesterday" but who are now out of the spotlight mocking themselves. <br /> <br /> It's your basic "the child is mistreated, the child equals (and then some), and everyone has fun in the process." Without heavy thoughts, you do not need a big analysis. Just a fun way to spend time. <br /> <br /> 3.5 out of 5
