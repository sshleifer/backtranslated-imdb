Tabloid film about making movies. It shows the intense and strange relationships that can develop between the directors and their actors; Manipulation and mental games; The selfishness of artists. As in any workplace, sexuality complicates things, but here in the ninth grade, since they are filming a sex scene. <br /> <br /> Absolutely fantastic shows by Gregoire Colin as the fragile male protagonist, aspiring male, and, above all, Anne Parillaud as the director's self-portrait. The image of her laughing and eating a banana at the end, after having finally got what she wants from her puppets, is a delight.
