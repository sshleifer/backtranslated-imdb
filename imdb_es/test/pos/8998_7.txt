First, let's call this movie what it is: <br /> <br /> 1. It's a movie to feel good about with a message. <br /> <br /> 2. The performance is fine, the dialogue is slightly better, the production value is quite good. <br /> <br /> 3. Rugby scenes ... barely passable. <br /> <br /> But here's the trick: this is not something created by Hollywood, and it does not try to be a fiercely accurate representation of this sport. Instead, it's a pretty good representation of mostly real people, in real circumstances, and a real story. Sure, they could have done a better job in reality by repeating the sport, but my vote: they do a good job in what they intend to do. <br /> <br /> (And fwiw, I can not think of a lot of football, baseball, hockey or soccer movies that are also loyal to the sport. Come on, Bull Durham? <br /> <br /> No I am a rugby player (I was a fighter) but I graduated from Highland, attended '86 -'90 and occasionally trained with Rugby players, however my brother-in-law David was one of the original founding members of Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (His younger brother, Billy, played the following year, as I recall.) If interested, there is a Highland Rugby site at highlandrugby.net that discusses the history of the team. <br /> <br / > By the time I was there, the club had existed for about a decade and had long built a reputation for excellence, it's a fact that they focused on "broad" training topics: devotion, honor, discipline, effort, not tactics I thought the rugby guys I knew were a little 'off' in the head za, but I think I could have been a little jealous. They were dedicated to the belief system that Gelwix promoted. <br /> <br /> Regarding the problems of "cultural mix" that have been raised, it might be interesting to note that while I was there in the 1980s, one of the largest schools in the city was closed, South High School, and its students were distributed among the other 3 SLC elementary schools. To be honest, Highland pre-80's was pretty white bread ... I have a photo of the team since (I think) in 1977 that shows a * club * of all whites. South High, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before it closed: I had a couple of southern friends who joined the team, a Tongan, a Samoan and, as I recall, there was a group of island-nations. Players who joined '88 -'90. I do not think anyone questioned the credibility of the team in adopting Maori traditions (or other cultural traditions): if there was something that was obvious in these guys, it was that they walked on the walk. <br /> <br /> And as for the strength of the team compared to the best high school teams in the world: yes, it is true that the US Rugby. In general, when taken together, it does not represent particularly good against the best in other places. There are exceptions, but hey, it is a simple fact that Rugby does not have the prominence or exposure necessary to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the United States that arise in other countries. <br /> <br /> That said, it judges Highland on its merits: <br /> <br /> - the only * team that qualifies for the US National Rugby Championship. UU every year of the organization's 25-year history. <br /> <br /> - a record victory of 392 wins, 9 losses. Read that again ... the most winning coach in any sport in the United States in history. <br /> <br /> - regular international tours. <br /> <br /> - some convincing victories against some legitimate international teams. <br /> <br /> Are they the best in the world? Maybe some years, probably not the majority ... but they are pretty good on a consistent basis. And it is disrespectful for the game to leave them, when Highland Rugby can be the best ambassador of this sport in the United States.
