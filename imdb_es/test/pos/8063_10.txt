Over the years, I have been very interested in the life of this teenager who left a mark so deep and indelible in the world. My fascination has also been born of fear, as in the case of this happening again. <br /> <br /> And throughout the following years, yes, I am afraid that "it continues" happening around us and, of course, "it was". happening long before Anne. Of course, can a so-called civilized society go back on its own or in an innocent country / race / continent and murder citizens in cold blood with the slightest of excuses? I leave that question out there. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader Adolf Hitler in the sense that the profound fact of Hitler that was never mentioned was that he was democratically elected and all One of the atrocities committed was carried out as a result of a propaganda of poodles and propaganda of fear that was heard again and again for a docile population. <br /> <br /> One of the atrocities was Anne Frank, who put on a face. to the extermination camps for the miracle of the survival of his diary. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Brannagh does a wonderful job in commenting and interviewing, he has that rare gift of minimizing his own person by allowing subjects to speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Many new data and people who have never been interviewed come to life in this meticulous research, which I will not analyze here as they add immeasurably to reality and the heartbreaking pain of the film. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close reads newspaper selections and she The voice is perfect for the part, brings a naivety and freshness to the paper. <br /> <br /> Anne de Anne's old friends are interviewed extensively and their last days before death are well recorded and witnessed along with their vibrant and malicious Personality. <br /> <br /> This is not to be missed. A wonderful and respectful film about the rarely seen Anne. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
