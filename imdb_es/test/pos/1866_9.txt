I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly play Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggle through the editorial and decision to publish "Origin of Species." Your consideration of the ramifications you can have for your family and the future of humanity are transmitted in such a way that you suspect that only a couple off the screen could achieve. <br /> <br /> Jon Amiel (who gave a heart) A heartfelt introduction) and John Collee do an excellent job to bring to life the biography of Randal Keynes. They created some very moving and human moments, a great cinematography and scenes and a generous help in joke about the still divisive theory of evolution. <br /> <br /> The surprise star is Martha West, who plays Annie Darwin. The character around which a large part of the story unfolds. She plays the precocious girl to a shirt. If this performance has something to do, your star should be increasing. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a great movie, and although it is a period drama, the themes that drive it are still very much alive today.
