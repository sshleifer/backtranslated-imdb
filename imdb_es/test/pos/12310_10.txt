I have been waiting for years for THE DEAD to appear on video, since I have almost worn out my VHS copy in fragments. This is one of the most beautiful movies that have been made for the holidays. It takes place at the Feast of the Epiphany (Twelfth Night) and is a simple and moving vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three women from Dublin. At the center of the story is a couple who are quite lacking in love, a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife, but feels incapable. All the performances are impressive, and the script is beautifully interwoven between the different characters of the dinner. Of course, its original material is the story of the same title by James Joyce, and much of its narrative structure remains completely intact. John Huston's long career as one of the best Hollywood filmmakers had a truly fitting end to this film, which was written by his son, Tony Huston; stars of his daughter, Anjelica Huston; And he dedicates himself to his wife, Maricella. Thanks to Lions Gate for acquiring the rights to this film and releasing it on DVD. For lovers of all things Irish or for people looking for a literate Christmas movie, subtle but incredibly moving, this is a real gem.
