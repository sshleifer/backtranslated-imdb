This is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. While it is not in the same class as some of the best-known films of its time, it is still extremely visible and memorable. The scene in which Zachary Scott, sitting on a bus, accidentally steals the aviator pin from the lapel of a coat thrown on the seat next to him, is great. Define your character perfectly: a guy so low, he will steal something of inestimable value to a war veteran, to use as support in their various charades. He lies easily when the situation calls for it, and captivates the women in the Fenchurch house with his irresistible charm and that murderous smile. <br /> <br /> I could not help but wonder if this movie was made to capitalize on success. by Mildred Pierce. Scott and Bruce Bennett came together again, and Faye Emerson bears some resemblance to Joan Crawford, with her structure of facial bones and large eyes. In addition, the character of Mona Freeman is not very different from the odious Veda in Mildred Pierce. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous comment that the end of the film was too easy, with the convenient fall on a cliff for "Ronnie Mason", character of Zachary Scott. In addition, in one of the final scenes, we see the spoiled Mona Freeman meeting with the boyfriend who had previously despised in favor of Zachary Scott, the biggest and softest. I think the script should have asked her to punish her for her behavior and for her cruelty towards her sister, instead of treating it as a typical episode of a teenager. But these are minor flaws in a nice and well made movie.
