In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of garbage carrier Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a man twenty-six years younger, Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and plans with Seki to kill him. They strangle Gisaburo and throw his body into a well in the forest, and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, the locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki is persecuted by his ghost. The situation becomes unbearable for Seki and Toyiji when a police authority arrives in the village to investigate the disappearance of Gisaburo. <br /> <br /> "Ai no Borei" is a surreal and supernatural love story. Seki's remorse and guilt make her see the ghost of her murdered husband, spoiling the perfect plot of his lover. The cinematography is in danger due to the quality of the VHS released in Brazil, but there are very beautiful scenes, like "Ringu" and the new American version "The Ring", that use the view of the well from inside in the same angle. The performances and direction are excellent, which makes "Ai no Borei" in a great movie. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Império da Paixão" ("The Empire of the Passion")
