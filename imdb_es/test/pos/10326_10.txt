The whole civilized world already knows that this is where Emil Sitka says his immortal "Take your hands, love." But Shemp Howard, a music teacher, steals the show. Watch him teaching Dee Green as she fractures the "Voices of Spring." Look at Shemp as she shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a rope. Watch him while Christine McIntyre knocks him down. Look at it, and you will laugh and learn. Moe is not left behind either. Watch him while trying to induce a woman to sit in a bear trap. Larry, as always, is the Zen master of reaction. In short, one of the best Stooge shorts. You will not find a weak moment.
