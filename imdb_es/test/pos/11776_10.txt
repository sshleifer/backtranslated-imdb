<br /> <br /> Fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid. This short parody is at least part of the Star Wars saga as Phantom Menace, and much more entertaining, if you ask me. Hardware Wars was the first in a long list of SW parodies that make up their own subgenre these days. I hate to describe it too much. It is so brief that the premise is just about everything. Suffice to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of Star Wars are very funny. Household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners representing spaceships and robots, the Princess Anne-Droid character carries real bread rolls in her head instead of the famous braided hair curls, and Fluke Starbucker is even dumber than its original, if it is possible Ernie Fosselius is crazy crazy, is also the source of Porklips Now, the parody of Apocalypse Now.
