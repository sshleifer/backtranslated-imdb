I have to agree with all the previous commentators: this is simply the best of all the frothy comedies, with Bardot as sexy as Marilyn Monroe was always, and definitely with a prettier face (maybe there is less mystique, but look how Marilyn paid for that).) I do not think I've ever seen a woman so succulent on the screen, so perfect that even a gay man like me was moved by her, and not just for purely aesthetic reasons (if the evangelical idiots really want to to make your 'convert-a-queer' number, you really need to meet their standards, since church mice should not apply here ...) Your breasts, the rest of your figure, your adorable voice, the shape hilarious. she trembles as she walks through a room ... just to get in front of a man, breasts literally pointed like in an exquisite confrontation ... <br /> <br /> I think Boyer is one of the best leading men in the whole history of cinema. Nobody played against bigger female stars than him: Garbo, Dietrich, K. Hepburn, Colbert, and here Bardot, among many others. And she was also in 'Fanny' with Leslie Caron, and she had small roles in 'How to Steal a Million' with A. Hepburn, as well as being in Deneuve's 'The April Fools' (though not in front of her). The only thing I could disagree with in the comments is that even loud and unpleasant music about opening credits is appropriate. I mean, Bardot must not be subtle above all else, and his essential volume (I do not mean his voice) is part of his irresistible and, one might even say, exemplary charm. <br /> <br /> Vidal is completely beautiful, even if Brigitte says at the beginning: "I do not know why I'm in love with you, you're not even handsome. <br /> <br /> Dear, dear Bardot! Truly one of the wonders of the twentieth century, not to mention the joy that she is still with us, when many of the real characters are disappearing so quickly, in all their eccentric glory.
