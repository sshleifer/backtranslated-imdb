The pace of the movie is heavily slow in parts, but if you can tune in to its languid speed and long silences, then it is a satisfying piece of polite intrigue. The story of China's first emperor, his girlfriend from childhood and the personal cost of power. The film is very atmospheric, the ceremony and polite ritual extremely polite and polite contrast with sudden brutal violence. Filmed in a way that evokes shadows and cold spaces. The battle scenes are rare and short, the focus is on the battle within the individual about what is right to do and if the ends justify the means. The Emperor's journey from the idealistic pacifier to the ruthless tyrant pretends to be subtle, but offers little background or a compelling vision of the emperor's motivation, in fact, his actions and objectives do not really change at all, only the attitudes of Gong are modified Li to him. The most interesting performances are Gong Li and the titular Assassin, as they reevaluate when to fight, when to retreat, when to kill. The most expensive film ever made in China at that time, the Emperor and the Assassin, is not based on hysterical emotion or great battles, but in an atmosphere of menacing and inevitably unavoidable. Gong Li fans will not be surprised to hear that she is as incredibly beautiful as ever, giving a discreet performance.
