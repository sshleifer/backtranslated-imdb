This black and white film came to the Spartan movie theater in my town in Friesland approximately 18 months after its release. In those days, much of our long-running comedy came from Denmark (Nils Poppe someone?), So this movie struck like a thunderbolt: it made me cry with helpless joy, ROTFL as we would have put it now. Well, then some of the visual gags were actually recycled 'schtick' vaudeville, but how was this 'barefoot boy with bronze cheeks' to know that at that time? In any case, my favorite scenes had the unique brand of Jerry's frenzied clowns, like that boxing match in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing "Sailor Beware" again fifty years later, I still laughed out loud. Of course, without the component of nostalgia it would probably be just another fair comedy. But then, another movie that once made me sew even more helplessly, the departure of Spike Jones "Fireman Save My Child", now seems outdated and with some fragments of the orchestra and Doodles Weaver scenes. There must be some special ingredient that makes Martin & Lewis products stay fresh longer. For me this at least values ​​eight out of ten.
