Highly recommended for all those who appreciate watching movies. Good acting, perfectly surreal uncomfortable mood, sh-t prison requirement, accurate representation of the male condition. The music is also spot on. I think the artist is "Dip" but he's not sure. The short loop of the title credit song on the DVD menu is timely, and it sounds like Slint. (One thing that should be known is that IMDb maintains a ridiculous policy of MINIMUM length of comments based on, not on CHARACTERS, not on WORDS, but on LINES: Measurement of quality and quantity of publications based on LINES in the audacious era of UNICODE and flexible, web-based typography, is like smoking poles.)! Your comment does not contain enough lines: the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text. Please, check the guidelines. Attempts to fill in the comment with unwanted words can cause your account to be blocked for future shipments.
