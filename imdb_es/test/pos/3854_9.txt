This movie is great, I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a mother cat named Dutchess and her 3 kittens. The Dutch and the kittens love music. They have to practice the piano every day. But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and his kittens, he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. The Dutch meet a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats are singing. With the song everyone wants to be a cat. Thomas comes to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess like each other very much. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and I like cats!
