This was the first movie I saw alone in the theater. I was 7 years old, and to this day it is one of my favorite movies. It's pure smarmy cheese. The cartoon was marketed for young girls, selling dolls with soft bodies and large plastic heads, one for each color of the rainbow, with their own special animals, "sprites" and even a rainbow horse that spoke. Typical of the time period, each show was about how hope, union and magic can make 'everything better'. <br /> <br /> The film is about the arrival of spring, when all the light and color come back to the world. , but this time it just is not happening for our lovely hero. A spoiled princess plans to surpass the soul-granting light (and implicit life giver) of the universe, which is a giant diamond, for her own purposes, without consideration for reality, and now Rainbow and her new friends Orin, Onyx and Chris It must save the universe. As I said before, it's corny, but it's cute, and it's exactly like all the other cartoons of that period, like the CareBear movies, Strawberry Shortcake, Rose Petal and the Smurfs. All the films created to sell dolls to children. And works. :)
