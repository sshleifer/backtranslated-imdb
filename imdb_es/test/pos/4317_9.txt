Watching the last 2 episodes I remembered a television ad from my childhood. It showed the wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small room, a man enters the bar / lounge, is very thirsty, with chapped lips, etc., just walked through the Nevada Desert and has not Do not drink water during days. He sings to the waiter "Give me a package of fries" While he eats it, we can feel how much more thirsty he is, we hear a voice in the background that says ... "Keep accumulating that thirst, build it until you can not. ............. then take it out with TEAM "The man drinks TEAM (a soda) It feels like a few dozen bags of potato chips, the thirst is so intense that I can not take it anymore, the season 2 has even more twists and turns then season 1. The end answers many questions but asks many more questions, hopefully, we will know the answer in season 3, but I doubt it because I feel that LOST has the impulse goes far beyond the 3 seasons, if the people behind the camera continue with their good work. <br /> <br /> I, for my part, will continue to observe. <br /> <br /> From Pakistan with love
