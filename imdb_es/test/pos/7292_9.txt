I do not understand why critics would hit this movie. It's a movie for teenagers that is really serious, which is a rarity. I admit there are times that are tremendously sappy, but come on, it's about young love, it must be sappy to be valid. My biggest complaint is Chris Klein. Although it was fun in American Pie, apparently he is not yet ready for the change at a more dramatic rate, he looks very uncomfortable in some of his "mommy stuff". Hartnett and Sobieski, on the other hand, demonstrate a great deal of depth and credibility, just like parents. Although the script is strongly clicheado with lovers spitting poetry, the actor makes it work. The sports management shows some powerful images on the screen. Beautiful cinematography, good music, great young actors, impressed me and I am a tired critic when it comes to movies for teenagers.
