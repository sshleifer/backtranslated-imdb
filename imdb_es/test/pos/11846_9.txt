I really liked that movie. It's a lot of laughs. The acting is good and the writing is really sharp. I prefer to see a hundred films like this THREE LORD OF THE RINGS repeating and repeating themselves. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget issue and it seems that it was recorded in DV but it looks good and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are very good together. Why do you have a minimum of ten lines? I am not a critic, just a boss. <br /> <br /> I very much doubt that Quentin Tarantino could write such a funny image without filling it with gratuitous masturbatory violence. This movie should be seen on more screens than just one. I laughed from beginning to end. >
