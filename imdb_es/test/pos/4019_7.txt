Just like the first movie in this series (SLAUGHTER, 1972), I think it would be a mistake to simply label this as a "blax-exploitation movie". Of course, Slaughter is a hard black man with many weapons, but it is more an action image regardless of the color of the main man or the bad guys, and it is a very good action image. <br /> <br /> For the second and last time, Jim Brown plays the title character. The movie starts with one of the dumbest scenes I can remember in a movie. While Slaughter and his friends enjoy an outdoor party, a biplane arrives and starts spraying the group with machine-gun fire! No, Slaughter is not so hard that he then shoots the plane with his .357! But Slaughter is marked and no one is sure why this hit happened, however, Slaughter will hit bottom! Well, it turns out that the coup was tried in retribution for the last movie. In it, Slaughter confronts the mafia and kicks a lot in Mexico. Now, in a horrible and clumsy attempt, the boys on the plane kill and injure many people, but they miss Slaughter. And, because the job was so ruined, the mafia boss (Ed MacMahon!) Ordered the pilot and the gunman murdered by his brutal killer (Don Stroud, in a very typical type of role for him). Stroud is great, scary and nasty to the core, but Ed MacMahon is the boss. Wow, that's an interesting twist! <br /> <br /> The killing is now perplexed. He discovered who the two guys were on the plane, but when he got to them, they were dead. Then, to help him in his own private revenge, Brock Peters (who plays a cop) tells him who the gangsters ordered the coup and got Slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal undercover work. Then Slaughter and his cool friend break into the mafia's mansion and steal a list of payments from key government and police officials. And, of course, there are many shots and bloodshed in the process. <br /> <br /> Stroud is not going to let Slaughter have his way and kidnap Slaughter's girlfriend. Now it's a confrontation: Slaughter has the list, but if he does not return it, the lady is dead. Being a tough but gallant man, you may be able to guess what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The action is very good in the movie and Jim Brown is menacing and tough. The only negative thing I noticed was that, while I had MacMahon playing with this nasty boss, in the end, he just retired, and too fast. When Slaughter reaches him, MacMahon becomes a puny and all the previous evil disappears, and this is too cliche and inconsistent. Still, despite this small objection, it is an attractive movie that is NOT for children because of all the violence and tits.
