A sentimental and moving family film, set in England in the 1920s. A young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter him in the Grand National; Luckily, ex-jockey Mickey Rooney is around to help Liz. The director Clarence Brown shows remarkable control with material that could have been excessively maudlin in the hands of another person. He and the screenwriters Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves are very careful in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally. It is true that there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced, but in general it is quite impressive, and they are magnificently filmed in Technicolor. The race itself is quite exciting, and like many great classics, there is a wonderful fading of three handkerchiefs at the end. Liz shows that she was a true soldier from the beginning, and Rooney, whom I usually find quite annoying, is surprisingly moderate and really very good. Donald Crisp is terrible as the rough father of Liz and Angela Lansbury is a delight as his older sister, crazy for children. However, most of the applause of the performance belongs to Anne Revere, who won a supporting actress, deservedly deserved, playing the wise and loving mother of Liz.
