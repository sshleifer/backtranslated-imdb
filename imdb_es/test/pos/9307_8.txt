We watched this movie in my chemistry class, so obviously it had educational value. I thought the film did a very good job of interweaving the science issues, the moral issues and the personal experiences of the Manhattan project, but it was not exactly focused on strong acting. I would recommend this movie for those with scientific inclinations or those interested in the moral problems behind Fat Man and Little Boy, but if the issue of nuclear bombs bores you, do not see it.
