While the film has its flaws, it brings to light some of the problems that arise from living in a country that does not have democracy. It makes you feel empathy with people under such a government and it makes you want to learn more about their lives, their struggles and a potential leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. It makes one wonder why our government will interfere in places where we are not wanted, but we will ignore those who ask us for help.
