Piper, Prue and Phoebe take Dr. Griffiths to the mansion to try to save him from The Source's personal killer, Shax. While Phoebe searches the Book of Shadows for a spell to defeat Shax, Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chase him into the street. Without the knowledge of Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a reporter and their cameraman using their powers and broadcast live on national television. With Phoebe in the underworld, Prue, Piper and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage caused. Leo drops Phoebe and tells him that the Charmed Ones have been exposed as witches. On the surface, Piper is shot by a maniac witch, and Prue has to take her to the hospital. The problem here is that the crowds are blocking the way in. So Prue has to use her magic in the crowd, and they go to the hospital. Piper is declared dead, and a SWAT team moves. Leo finds out about Piper's death and goes down to tell Phoebe. Cole is asked to ask The Source to restore time, and The Source agrees; Only if Phoebe turns to the dark side. Phoebe agrees, but the deal will destroy them. On the surface, Prue and Piper are fighting Shax. Prue screams for Phoebe, who unknowingly is in the underworld. Shax shoots Piper and Prue through a wall, and Dr. Griffiths through the window. Prue is not pronounced dead until the premiere episode of season 4, "Charmed Again, Part One." <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is an exciting episode, and it made me sit on the edge of my seat. It's sad that Prue is dead, but happy that there are five more seasons of Charmed. My vote; 10 of 10. EXCELLENT
