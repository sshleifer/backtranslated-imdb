Thank God for this movie. It is a document of talent that, three decades later, seems even more unique and rare in retrospect. <br /> <br /> The music is simply extraordinary, with so much talent in writing, interpretation, arrangement and production that it is absolutely infectious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances of underestimated talents such as Nell Carter and Ren Woods raise my spirit every time I listen to them. While the film may be different from the stage version, I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album, which I find truly challenging and underdeveloped. Here the arrangements are completed and expanded into dynamic pieces that could not have been produced in a scenario. <br /> <br /> But music is not the only extraordinary thing about this movie. The juxtaposition of almost hyper-realistic dialogue scenes (reminds me of Altman's films) interspersed with exuberant music and dance numbers, really works. All the talent in this film (direction, writing, photography, editing, music, choreography, casting, acting, costumes, art direction) merges perfectly into one of the best musical films I've seen. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how much we know about the "Hair" characters, based on very little information or argument. They are not drawn as cartoons, but as realistic and very human persons. We see small glimpses of where they come from, but the portrait is completed with vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through acting, direction and editing. There is an underlying theme of the misogyny of Berger and Hud that colors their characters by exposing their reckless sexist-hippie ideology. The scene of Berger's home life reveals important details about his psychology, and the brief look at Claude's house tells us a lot about his background through the simple, realistic and genuine interaction between Claude and (presumably) his father. <br /> <br /> I love fashion in this movie. Mix defiantly the ideas of the sixties with the appearance of VERY seventy (one has to ignore Treat Williams hair extensions ...). It is a chic document that was most of the last years of the seventies, contrary to the conventional belief that the era was all about bad taste. Claude's beige knit tie was a fashionable trend in 1979, and the hair and clothing of singers and dancers (particularly those in white during the Central Park scene) mix the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of musical themes. These elements combine with the unique cutting-edge choreography of Twyla Tharpe in a way that enhances the art of both. <br /> <br /> "Hair" is not a movie that rewards cynicism. If you get to it with expectations, it is most likely that you will be held captive by artists who are not subject to your rules. For me, it opened my eyes, ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialogue about war, friendship and family that transcends time and is still significant and relevant to me to this day.
