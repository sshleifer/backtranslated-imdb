Lotsa action, corny love story, unexpected actors and, in general, great fun. The special effects are acceptable / decent, some of the combats are quite ordered with some interesting acrobatic movements. The general story moves forward, and it's corny enough for you to wonder when the inevitable will happen, although there's a small twist (just a small one). The general naivet√© of the film makes it quite capricious at times. Nice enough girls too, what more could you want? P.S. If you are going to review a movie like this, try to review it in terms of the category in which the movie will fall (not necessarily in the place where it was meant to fall). That is, do not bomb good cheese movies!
