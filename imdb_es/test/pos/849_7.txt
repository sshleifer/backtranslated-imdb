Earth Final Conflict began as a new world, a new vision of the creator of Star Trek, something fresh and unique full of great elements. A very good cast with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner like William Boone, a good ex-cop starts working as a guard of some kind of ambassador for a mysterious alien race (Talons), after the death of his wife in strange circumstances. But soon, the character of Kilner joins a group with the mission of discovering what the true intentions of the aliens are, why they seem to be so kind and care about the human race. Soon, this resistance group begins to discover the sinister plans of the claws that use humans in their own problems to survive and in their own destruction. As I said before, the show started very well, everything was almost perfect, including characters like Da'an, the original Da'an was a great mystery because it seems to be a good creature but at the same time has its own evil plans. manipulating some people on earth. Zo'or soon arrived, which was not bad, but ... marks the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first great enemy of humans, the embodiment of evil, killing what could be something bigger in Da'an. The first seasons end excellently with the dead of Boone and the second shows a new main character (Liam), a hybrid being of humans and Kimera (another alien race) with some very interesting powers. He replaced Kilner's character in a good way for other stories to improve, including the conflict with the Jaridians and the Atavus. But as I said, the lines before the evil of Zo'or begin to take more importance, reason why the new conflicts were less realistic than the same claws. With time, all the great history of the alien roots of Liam was almost completely erased with other things from the previous seasons. So when the final season began, the original Earth End conflict was just an almost forgotten dream, all the magic was missing, just to leave some vain attempts to keep the show alive, including the return of Kilner and Liam for some episodes The final episode was just the evidence of how bad the program was with so many negative changes (thinking that the writers of some episodes knew nothing about the first stories), was one of the worst endings I've seen in a television program. A real shame because Earth Final Conflict started as something unique, fresh, the stories of the cast, after seeing so many shows from the United States, something from Canada from the mind of the creator of Star Trek was wonderful, but in the end everything got worse. I hope someday someone will make a new version of this program, of course not use anything from the fourth and fifth season (except the cast, they were all perfect in their work). I can still dream of better things.
