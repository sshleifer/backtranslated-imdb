Maybe my rating should have been a 9, but the movie absolutely surprised me when I saw it for the first time and my last visualization confirmed my initial belief. Elegant yes, each scene has created scope views, fabulous angles with a perfect sound that accompanies them. <br /> <br /> Put in first place the great performance of Toni Servillo, meet her with one of the most beautiful and charming women of Olivia Magnani, and a good plot, and you will end up seeing this little masterpiece over and over time. <br /> <br /> Paulo Sorrentinos' upcoming film "L'Amico De Famiglia", which competes at this year's Cannes Film Festival. It will be awaited with impatience.
