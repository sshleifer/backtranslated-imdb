The Reader is a perfect example of what a short film should be. A moving story, told simply through a well-written dialogue, beautifully painted images, a score that weaves its way through the narrative perfectly, and characters portrayed with kindness and grace. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at a festival where other interesting films and ideas were screened. But none of the other shorts had all the elements of a great filmmaking that came together in a movie like The Reader did. The reader caught the attention of everyone attending the festivals in the room and for 10 minutes took us to the emotional life of the characters. <br /> <br /> Duncan Rogers has created a beautiful movie and I hope to see more of this. Director, whether shorter or perhaps a feature film.
