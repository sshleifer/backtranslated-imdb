Korean cinema has the ability to change genres and the latest from the famous director Chan-wook Park is the story of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire. Add a temptress who misses it and a cast of eccentrics and you'll have a wonderful recipe. <br /> <br /> Directed in part in a style similar to the trilogy "Sympathy" is as sumptuous as it is dark. Moving away from the clich√©, offers some new tricks in the genre of exaggerated vampires. It is an existential film that tries to capture the moral enigma of exactly how a person has to choose to live with their conditions instead of reveling in the thirst for blood. However, the film does not take itself too seriously and there is boundless humor everywhere. <br /> <br /> Our potential clients play their roles perfectly, play with our emotions and delight in dark humor. There are moments of reflection on all the moral enigmas involved in the film, but they are never preached. Some may find it too long and may calm down at some points, but it's worth giving it a try until the end. <br /> <br /> If you like the left field films, there are less better than this in recent times. Dark and absorbing, it will attract a crowd. One that I recommend you try.
