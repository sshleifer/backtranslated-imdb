To say that this is a good show is to say nothing at all. After all, this show is performed by the same team responsible for Airplane and other fun and funny movies. The writing is excellent. Although the program is based on single-line comments, they do not become overwhelming or annoying. Leslie Nielsen is flexing the muscle of her comedy in its entirety as if to say: You have not seen anything yet. The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun. When watching these movies, notice how many schemes are taken from the television show. The bright part is that they do not have to be changed too much. The show was really a testing ground for bigger and better versions that will come later.
