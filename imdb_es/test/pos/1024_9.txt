Postwar England, the dawn of the "atomic age". However, the concerns of a young schoolboy who yearns to experience his first "kiss" can not be derailed by something as inconsequential as THE PUMP. This was a charming, if not educational, look at young love from the point of view of an adolescent male and his world of the 1940s. Free from political correctness and preaching messages, this film exposes the viewer to the world that only The mind (and <br /> <br /> hormones) of a young teenager can create. The wonderful subplots <br /> <br /> maintain the interest of the characters in "Gregory's Girl", and a lot of well-blocked shots help to maintain the images of this era. This is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who has ever been in love, or who has wanted to be. Have you ever got your wish? Look at it and look.
