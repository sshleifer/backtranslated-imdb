It's not your Tom and Jerry diary short for many reasons. One, there's a voice-over narration from Jerry, which is strange, because Tom and Jerry rarely speak. Two, both are friends, which was also rare and rarely works as well as the more adverse shorts do. Third, and most importantly, the cartoon is rarely humorous (by design) and the jokes here are dry laughter with a little cough and a bloody bubble at the end. Think of a Tom and Jerry caricature directed by Tim Burton. Not entirely successful, but to a large extent it works. The most spooky ending to an MGM short that I can remember. Not for everyone and a proof that these shorts were never designed solely with children as a target audience. Well worth seeing. Recommended with the previous warnings.
