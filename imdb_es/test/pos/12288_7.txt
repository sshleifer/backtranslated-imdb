This is not a movie, it is an intelligent, witty and often moving film. It is a retrospective of a failed relationship between Michael Connor (Michael Leydon Campbell) and his estranged Irish girlfriend Grace Mckenna. Michael of bad luck decides to make a documentary that repeats all their relationship and what went wrong. Exploits his friendship with an actor he met in the gym Nadia (Nadia Dajani) who plays Grace. The concept of this movie is very original. Michaels relationship is shown from each point, either high or low. Michael Leydon Campbell performs a fantastic performance that makes you want to help him find Grace. In fact, most of the characters achieve great performances, except the puzzle. The puzzle is necessary to move the plot, but it seems too surreal to exist in a cafeteria. His monologues are often overdrawn and meaningless. This is demonstrated when he says: "Out of this chaos, we are all trying to create an order, and outside of order, that is, but in reality there is no such thing as a meaning, something only has a meaning if we make it have a meaning. " . "<br /> <br /> The comment saves this movie, the comment is made in vain in This is Spinal Tap and Michael and his brother explain the problems they had when making the movie.Michael offers a very funny self-conscious comment that provokes good laughs. <br /> <br /> In general, I would give this movie a 7/10.
