** SPOILERS ** Surprising but true story of the horror that overtook the border city of Alabama / Georgia, Phenix, when it was taken by a gang of organized thugs that make it the Southern Sin City. <br /> <br /> With the crime shooting and no one to turn to a group of concerned citizens, Phenix lawyer Albert Patterson, John McIntire, is respected for running for the State District Attorney's office. With the criminal element of Phenix doing everything from intimidation to outright murder, so that voters do not get Patterson to win the nomination he still wins with the other 86 counties in the state, not including Phenix's Russell County, which he gives his approval for more than 1,000. votes. <br /> <br /> Terrified by what Patterson would do when he takes over as Phenix boss Mob Rett Tanner, Edward Andrews, has a knock on him. Patterson is shot to death while driving to his office, but his killers are seen by Ellie Rhodes, Kathryn Grant, who soon becomes, through an informant in Patterson's office, the next person in the Tanner line to be murder target. What Tanner & Co. did not expect is that Albert Patterson's son, John Kiley, received the news from Ellie about his father's murder before his children could shut her up. That great error of calculation on the part of Tanner will end up ending both his criminal organization and his freedom! <br /> <br /> A powerful documentary-style criminal film with the real people involved in the events that take about 15 minutes. At the beginning of the movie, to tell their stories. Despite the fact that they were still in danger of being killed by the Tanner Mafia who was still at liberty at the time their interviews were filmed! <br /> <br /> Finishing what his brave father started, John Patterson only brought the Phenix City story appeared on the front pages of state and national newspapers, which gave Tanner the very negative publicity he tried avoid. With the now Alabama National Guard flooding the bloodthirsty, gutsless city of Phenix, unwilling to face people with weapons in their hands, Tanner Mob evaporated out of sight like a morning mist after that sunlight hits her! And with John Patterson now taking the place of his murdered father as the new Attorney General of the state of Alabama, you can be sure that the Patterson mafia has seen its last days of persuading people and murdering them. The only thing they will see now in the future are the walls and gray bars of the prison that will be their sweet home home for the rest of their lives in disrepair and miserable! <br /> <br /> Most likely the most graphically violent The movie that came out of Hollywood until then, "The Phenix City Story" made no effort to show how a group of powerful and lawless criminals can convert a city Pretty American in one hell for everyone. No one was separated from these ruthless gangsters who did not even think twice about trying to kill even women and children if that was what was needed to keep them in power! As for the Phenix City Police Department, they had something better to do than enforce the law they had sworn and paid to defend. They went out for coffee and donuts while the gangsters like Tanner, who had them in their hip pockets, burned them in their city!
