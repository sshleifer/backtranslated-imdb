Awww, I love this! The story of the cat and the moon really does not need a synopsis, since that is what it is ... the cat chasing the moon, a Spanish poem. It is art that is interesting. In fact, there was an animated short called Fan and the Flower that won the Academy Award last year (2005) ... yes, almost the same thing, which leads me to believe that it could be a scam. <Br /> <br /> But this is a really good short, with black and white shapes that change and turn into beautiful movements and poetic seduction ... If you think cats are poetry in motion, look at this and what you will believe more. <br /> <br /> Also, it has such a touching end. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
