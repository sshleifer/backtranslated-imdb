I do not know what the critics saw when this movie was released, but it went unnoticed. It is well written, it is witty, satirical and completely pleasant. It's like a video game that comes alive. You never know who is behind the door or what will happen next. Violence is not gratuitous or exaggerated due to the splash effect. <br /> <br /> One last word: for you, Mickey Rourke fans ... Mickster is back and at his best in the cameo performance at the end.
