"The Last American Virgin", along with "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" is one of the last great movies for teenagers that have been made. It is a tender history of envy and unrequited love that develops in the early eighties. Highly criticized by critics as a banal and sophisticated attempt to recreate the magic of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," these same critics do not recognize that the two films were filmed simultaneously in late 1981 and released at slight intervals from each other. Either way, the studies would never allow such a bold and intransigent portrait of the problems that many male adolescents face when they reach sexual maturity. Especially considering the heartbreaking discovery of the protagonist, Gary faces the end. American Pie this is not. The story revolves around a trio of male adolescents and their sexual activities mostly unsuccessful. Gary is the least successful of the group, hence the LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN slogan. Secretly, Gary wants Karen, who is involved with Rick, his best friend. Rick and Karen begin having sex, and Karen becomes pregnant, only to be abandoned by Rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility that lies before him. Gary slips to help Karen, which leads to the unexpected conclusion mentioned above. In general, as a film, I think it was very successful as a comedy, as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men, and as a remarkable account of coming of age that deals with issues such as envy, unrequited love and abortion , which are as relevant today as they were more than twenty years ago. In addition, it has one of the rockiest soundtracks ever made!
