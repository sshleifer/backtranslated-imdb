Well, here we go, probably you have read in previous reviews of this movie that is horrible, badly acted, avoid it at all costs. Well, I guess somehow this is true, it's fair to say that you can not write a spoiler in this comment since there is no plot to ruin. However, there is a fine line between simply horrible and absolutely hilarious and believe me that this movie is the last. The acting is so bad, the argument so nonexistent and the ending so disconcerting that it will make you laugh all the way. There are scenes in this film that take comedy to a new level. Do not expect an Oscar winner, but believe me for the small price you will pay for this disaster, it is worth every penny.
