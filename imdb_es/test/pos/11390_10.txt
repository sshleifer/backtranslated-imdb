A child from a small city who works in a big city becomes a big star and then gets out of control. It shows you the rise to fame and then falls of fame and returns to a small ascent. Great cast of actors, and a great director = a great big movie called Boogie Nights. <br /> <br /> P.T Anderson. An amazing director who made Boogie Nights amazing. From the moment the movie begins until the moment it ends, you can feel how beautiful this movie is. Some scenes are impressive, literally. A great story, a great movie. Mark Whalberg was fantastic, Philip Seymour Hoffman was wonderful as he is in everything. Thomas Jane was also magnificent and, although he had only a small part, he interpreted it perfectly. There is a scene in this film that I can not forget, "The Drug Deal Gone Bad Scene" was amazing, the musical performance and the cinematography combined to make it incredible. I had not seen Boogie Nights and, thank God, I did, it's very complete and now I'm a HUGE PTA fan (Paul Thomas Anderson). <br /> <br /> Do what you have to do and watch this movie.
