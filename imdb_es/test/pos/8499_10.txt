My wife wanted to see this movie and I followed reluctantly. I have never been a big fan of the biographical film, since I believe that the cinema is more exciting when it is not structured in nonfiction. Beyond that, although I like the music of Ray Charles, I do not consider myself a fan of him or his music. <br /> <br /> I expected to suffer or overlook this movie. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is an attractive story told in a classic cinematic style. Realism is in the nuances: the tilt of a character's head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes as they sing. Literally, I discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of visualization. <br /> <br /> Jaime Foxx, of whom much has been said, heads a cast of immaculate re-creators of not just a time, but an ERA, a LIFE that never really existed for those of us under forty. This film plunges the audience in time without the tricks and great panoramas of the Titanic or other pieces of the time. This movie does not present the music scene of the 50s and 60s, it takes you there. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about Ray Charles, but your appreciation of it should not be limited to his story. lifetime. This is the kind of movie, like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List, which does what a movie should do: take you somewhere else, another time.
