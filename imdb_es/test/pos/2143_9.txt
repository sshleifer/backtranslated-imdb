The first time I saw this movie was in 1980. According to other sources, I learned that the only 219-minute cut was in New York City, after which it was reduced to 149 minutes. So, I think I first saw the short version that, at the time, I thought, was a very interesting anti-Western, though a bit confusing ... <br /> <br /> So, it was even more interesting. I finally got a DVD of the full version. I'm glad I did it because this second visualization has confirmed that the film is a true classic, and that vitriol criticism about Michael Cimino was unjustified, at least. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a long movie, but that's how many others have been like that. For example: Once upon a time in America (1984) at 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; The Ten Commandments (1956) at 220 minutes; Spartacus {restored version} (1960) at 198 minutes; What the wind took (1939) at 222 minutes and others. Therefore, it can not be the fact that the execution time has so much foam in the mouth since Heaven's Gate appeared. <br /> <br /> But keep this in mind: all the previous films have everything to do with reinforcing the myths about history and heroes. <br /> <br /> Not so the Door of Heaven: in this narrative, the American West is shown in all its harsh and implacable severity, injustice and poverty. And that's probably the first reason why many disliked this movie: they exposed the circumstances of the 1892 Johnson County War in Wyoming, showing how the Wyoming Producers Association hired 50 assassins to hunt and kill a large group of European immigrants accused of cattle rustling; and all with the help and complicity of the authorities, even the President of the United States. For an essay on that war, with the background and what happened, there is a link in Wikipedia under the Johnson County War. <br /> <br /> Very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in the history of their country, and that they fly in front of what is supposed to be the country. If it had been a documentary, it would have been barely acceptable to the majority; as entertainment, I was almost forced to fail commercially and to be destroyed by the sharp and infamous. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the sociopolitical diatribe, for a moment, that Cimino launched here, what about the narrative? ?? The story of the three main characters? Well, it was probably not unusual for men of that era to fall in love with a local prostitute, just as it is probably not unusual now. It is a fairly standard love triangle by which She must choose between the two men and, finally, decides on the younger man, Nathan, who, although not resorting to cold-blooded murder when it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment than the James Major. (or Jim, as most people in the movie say). For some, that part of the story is linked too slowly, perhaps; In the context of the broader narrative about war, however, I think it is entirely appropriate. <br /> <br /> And that war is represented graphically, cruelly and cruelly with scenes of butchery that are exquisitely organized and edited. impeccably? Although in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants, I am sure that some scenes of shattered cars are repeated. A minor point and perhaps provoked when the 219-minute cut was restored? However, from any point of view, it hits your face with the noise, dust, chaos and confusion of the war ... <br /> <br /> Which brings me to another criticism of others: the Noise and dust is such that it is often difficult to hear the dialogue and even see clearly what is happening. I admit that at first I found it a bit annoying, even to go back to reproduce parts to try to capture the image or the words? until I realized that it really was not necessary if I accepted the director's intention: life is chaotic, it is difficult to listen and see in situations of many people and, in war, is the sine qua non of this staging. In short, it's as if you were really present inside and inside the scenes ... <br /> <br /> And what about the title? Since Shakespeare, it refers to a figurative closeness to God and, therefore, if you compare God with the natural world, the impressive scenery that permeates the film? And is it impressive, disturbingly the same as that of Dr. Zhivago by David Lean (1965)? It is a useful metaphor. However, I tend to think that Cimino had something else to say, namely, the idea of ​​courageous immigrants? God's fearful salt of the earth? they were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life on earth that advocates being the champion of freedom. <br /> <br /> Was that Cimino's intention? To destroy the myth of the American West? To show how, in the United States, only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred, in one way or another, throughout history. Is that something new? Not really, as we all know. However, where it really hurts is to show how the United States was not and, by implication, it is not the land of the free and the home of the brave. Instead, after absorbing this narrative, we are left with the impression that the foundations of America have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for bakers ...
