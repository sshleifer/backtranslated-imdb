The Battleship Potemkin is now the oldest film I've seen and it's also the first silent film I've seen. I heard a lot of good things about this movie, so I took out the tape at home and I saw it. When it was over, I thought it was a classic masterpiece. The story is based on the Russian battleship Potemkin of real life. You would not think about it, but some of that was sad and disgusting. Sad because the mother dies and the stroller rolls down the stairs and disgusting because they have to eat rotten meat with worms. <br /> <br /> Today it is still considered one of the best silent and Russian films. It has never been done. I think everyone should see it (if they can find it). At this moment you will be surprised at how good it is. It is a classic that must be seen. 5/5
