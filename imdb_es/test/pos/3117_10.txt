What can you say about a short short movie with secondary actors and without "stars", without any misunderstanding, without a line of dialogue badly communicated, and with cold violence, on the one hand, balanced by the warm "heart" of The protagonists in the story? <br /> <br /> It is a jewel, a diamond, a precious little jewel of a western that evokes the spirit and the legend of the American West. A west not solved by great heroes like Hickock or Cody or Masterson or Earp, but by the spread of the everyday man and woman, farmers and ranchers, merchants and miners and loggers, whores and waiters and artists of the day, some looking for riches, some for peace and tranquility, others for religious freedom. <br /> <br /> It is, perhaps, a very spiritual story, although it does not promote any particular religion, since even the non-Mormon cowboys presented by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. act in a kind and noble way towards all in the world. The story, regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs, and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train reaches people stranded in medicine. And true biblical style, like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines, are the guardian angels sent to the train of wagons that eventually have to face the evil Clegg clan, comparing them to the serpent in the Garden of Eden, and lamenting what it is what they have to do next. It is a sweet folk tale of the West that hits all the targets to which John Ford points. <br /> <br /> Today I have a Western Santa Claus whose red outfit is covered with a denver drover coat, whose red cap is replaced by a brown Stetson, which carries a burlap bag of gifts and a roll of rope . To my Santa I added a Winchester rifle with a harness to put one of his shoulders and a Colt revolver to get in the waist. When the people in the office ask why my Santa has to carry arms, I simply reply: "Snakes!" After all, is not the spirit of the holiday season one where everyone should get what they deserve? <br /> <br /> Fifty-five years later, especially after 911, the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and the story of this film are still as relevant today as they were at the time.
