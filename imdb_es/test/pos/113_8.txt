This was a daring movie to get to Indian theaters when it was released. The first film that may openly describe lesbian tendencies among Indian women. The leading actress of Indian cinema Shabana Azmi added substance to the film with her passionate scenes with Nandita Das. <br /> <br /> The film was overflowing with sexuality and the director used sex in the best possible way. Sex had no erotic purposes, but was in the context of the movie. The scene in which Nandita Das loses her virginity with her husband was undoubtedly the first of its kind in Indian theaters. <br /> <br /> Good acting by all the actors, especially Nandita Das, amid criticism from the Indian public.
