I think this movie is really entertaining, although it lacks some essential features for this type of movie. First of all, when Doug and Chappy begin their mission, they take off with F-16B, and during combat scenes, they are piloting F-16A. The second thing I do not like about this film is the F-16 that repeats itself continuously and moves to its right to escape the missiles ... why have not the straw and the flares been shown in any film? Third, once you see the F-16 almost empty of ammunition, it appears again a lot of missiles ... the models used to simulate the destroyed aircraft are not good either. However, I think that using IAI Kfir as opposing planes was really good, much better than the F-5 shown in Top Gun (but this movie is not as good as that masterpiece). <br /> <br /> A funny movie, I love airplanes and I've seen it more than 3 times.
