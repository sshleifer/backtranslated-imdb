A ham actor without a penny. Who better than Michael Caine to play such a character? He is totally and absolutely hilarious but, as in most of Caine's performances, he really does. The film seems to be a sample of Dylan Moran and is splendid in his double act with Caine. Here, however, is where the script fails. Imitations of Moran should have been incorporated in a more organic way. They are too much of an act by themselves and make the potential plausibility of the plot fly through the window. No matter. Get it if you can find it. There is enough in this to make it a pleasant trip.
