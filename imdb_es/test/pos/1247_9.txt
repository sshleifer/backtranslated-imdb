This is one of the most underestimated films of Bruce, in my opinion, it is an amazing and comforting film, with a good story and an incredible performance by Bruce Willis. All the characters are great, and I thought that Willis and Spencer Breslin were amazing together, and Bruce Willis is just amazing in this. Definitely, this is one of the best comedy performances of Bruce (The waaaaaaaaaamabulance thing was great) and I thought it was very well written and done too, besides, the ending is especially great! He's good-natured and it was great to see how Russell's character (Willis) changes throughout the film. also the ending was pretty good. I think this should be higher than 6.0 and it's one of the best Disney movies I've seen! It also has many amazing moments throughout. All the characters are very nice, and also has a nice angle of love story, in addition, Bruce and Spencer Breslin had very funny lines (Holy Smokes!). This is one of the most underestimated films of Bruce, in my opinion, it is a moving and surprising film, with a good story and an incredible performance by Bruce Willis, and I say it is a must. The address is great! Jon Turteltaub does a great job here with a very good camera work, and just keeping the movie at a very fast pace. The acting is excellent! Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he offers one of his best comedy performances, he has a wonderful chemistry with Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, he had some funny phrases and he was present throughout the film, it was one of the main reasons I I really liked this movie! (Willis rules !!!!!!!). Spencer Breslin is fantastic as the youngest version of Russell, it was very funny and once did not bother me, he is one of the best children actors there is! Emily Mortimer is good like Amy and she was very pretty. I liked it, I had good chemistry with Bruce too. Lily Tomlin is funny because I liked Janet a lot. Jean Smart is good with what he had to do, which was not much. The rest of the cast does it well. In general, you have to see! **** out on pf 5
