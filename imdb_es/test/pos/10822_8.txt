Even if it does not give one more than the previous posts here (like the very good one by Ruby Liang) I wanted to share my own point of view. I hope my English is understandable. <br /> <br /> Bon voyage is a rhythmic, light but profound presentation of the disorganized fall of the French, but also of value and charm. Throughout a France of 1940 brilliantly reconstituted with many details (from the luxurious hotel in Bordeaux occupied by the seat of the Government and attacked by the useless high class Frenchmen, to the Parisian cafes near Le Pantheon / rue Mouffetard and the cars of the 30s) Gérard Depardieu and Yvan Attal give their second paper. a bright taste;) Isabelle Adjani and Virgnie Ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles, and Grégori Derangère does a spellbinding performance :) <br /> <br /> Much lighter than average (eg, American) movies wartime, and focused on civilians, Bon voyage shows many things about French subjects (even for a Frenchman like me), some of them quite deep.
