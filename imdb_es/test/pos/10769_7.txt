Oddly enough, the Independent Film Channel showed this movie a week AFTER it showed KARATE BEAR FIGHTER, although the bear movie was the second in the trilogy and this was the first! What were you thinking ?! While these three films are supposedly based on the life of this great master of Kyokushin Karate, you can not help but think that they MUST have embellished the story, especially in this first film. Sure, the guy evidently DID fight and kill a bull and then a bear (in fact, he fought and killed many bulls during his career), but in this movie set in the early 50s, at the end of the movie, the hero actually fights with about 60 men and kills many of them brutally. I just can not imagine that this really happened. So I did some checks and found out that, while many of the details are correct, a part of this movie is pure bunk! Yes, he killed a man in self-defense and YES, he followed the widow and his son and spent a year working for them, trying to be forgiven. But the end of the movie is great to watch, but silly. Seeing one of his opponents get a personal blow to his head and all the other bloody details could not have happened or the Japanese government would have locked Oyama up to protect society! The movie is entertaining and the fight is excellent. There are no complaints about the action or performance. The only minor complaint is the work with the camera, which is a bit neglected during some of the fight scenes. Despite this little complaint, this is a very nice movie. In many ways, the main theme of the wandering Karate is quite reminiscent of Zatoichi's films, which are also very fun to watch, but many of the feats are really impossible. <br /> <br /> FYI - There is an English version of this movie titled "Champion of Death" and I saw it too. It's not a bad dub and it was written in a box (a big advantage), but I still prefer the subtitled version.
