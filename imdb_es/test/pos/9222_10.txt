When I was a kid this was the movie I saw. I think it's a great movie for children to see and parents should not fear violence or obscene images. Rainbow Brite is a cheerful young woman and is trying to make winter disappear. She finds that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it to themselves. I love this movie and I think even adults can enjoy this movie.
