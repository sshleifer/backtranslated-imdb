I really enjoyed the North and the South a lot. I think it's one of the best and most luxurious television series I've seen. The caliber of the cast is incredible, you have actors from the "golden age of cinema", people like James Stewart, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80s like Patrick Swayze. , James Read, Jonathan Frakes, Genie Francis, Philip Casnoff and Lesley-Anne Down. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men, is Orry Main (Patrick Swayze) who is from the south and George Hazard (James Read) who is from the north. Throughout the series, their friendship is continually threatened with differences in their backgrounds, particularly about the treatment of slaves in the south (especially on the Orry plantation), but when each one needs the other, they will forget arguments and they will go to help your friend. I really liked the chemistry between the two men and I was very interested to see if their friendship could survive the war. <br /> <br /> I liked how the series showed what life was like before the war so that the audience could see what was happening. were the factors that led to the war, what was happening at that time, then the devastation of a nation that was being torn apart and then the nation had to rebuild the country again. The war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic for me. <br /> <br /> I think what is good is that it has many elements, romance, history, battles that would interest the majority of the audience, there is something for everyone. I especially enjoyed the romance between Brett (Genie Francis) and Billy (Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell), especially when he confronted his sister Ashton for the first time. The other romances were interesting, since they were not all the same, each had something different from the others, which kept me particularly watching the story thread of Madeline and Orry to see if they would be together at the end. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best American mini-series I've seen, the story had the right balance of romance and the most serious side of the story that was happening in the country at the time, but it develops to The perfection. The characters are very visible and the places are beautiful and the music, especially at the beginning and end of the episode, is so good to play and works with the mood of the story.
