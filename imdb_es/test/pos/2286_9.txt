* Minor spoilers * I just wanted to say that for anyone who likes to entertain baseball movies, this is definitely among my top three. Only Little Big League and Major League can compete with this in my mind. I would also like to congratulate the writers of this film for creating such a nice dialogue! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very suitable for each character. Apparently, Tom Selleck had no problem creating a realistic character as a ball player. His animosity for playing abroad in Japan sets the tone for comic, but significant interactions with his new team, the Dragons. He must adapt to life in Japan ("First you wash, then you bathe!") Eventually he comes face to face with his coach and sets his goals to have that last season of greatness, although in a very different environment from him . imagined So for any baseball fan, or anyone who wants to see a good baseball movie, Mr. Baseball will not disappoint him!
