Maybe people like to have the devil more than God. Maybe we like that safety net of a reason; committing an error only to blame the devil for the pain and suffering in the world. There are so many difficulties, spilling over into the masses, that it is hard not to see the sadness in the faces of all those who pass by. Leland P. Fitzgerald understands all this; He knows that maybe not everything will be all right, and maybe helping someone to leave this Earth to avoid the pain that awaits them in their life is a risk that they should take for someone they love. The credit goes to screenwriter / director Matthew Ryan Hoge for creating lyrical prose about two suburban families who have come together in good and bad times. The mere fact of seeing the cast of almost all the actors on the A and B list shows that the material really resonates with their audience. Emotions do not need to be used in the manga to exist. Sometimes, all we want to do is put an end to suffering. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling brings to the table a discreet representation that encompasses the inner part of Leland's emotions of his character. He is a very passionate and intelligent young man, who works his way through life, knows what he sees and accepts the worst with the best. The film is a catharsis for the souls of those affected by the horrific event that Leland killed the mentally ill brother of his ex-girlfriend. In the confused mind of this teenager, enters the incident knowing very well what he was going to do, was going to stop the pain he sees everywhere, but especially in the face of young Ryan Pollard. Almost immediately, he realizes that he has made a mistake, that maybe playing with God is not a job for which he has been put on Earth. Whether this is true or not, it will soon be debated when the assassination begins a chain of events, which will finally bring meaning to the lives of many people as they awaken to the tangential fragility of life. This child has opened his eyes to pain and rebirth. <br /> <br /> With disturbing ballads sung by the former leader of Sunny Day Real Estate, Jeremy Enigk, the film goes through a journey of small vignettes of the lives of two families in the aftermath of the tragedy. The performance is excellent in everything with special mention to a few. For someone who plays with the naive advantage in most films, Chris Klein actually does well with almost the same material here, but also with an evolution towards a man of purpose. His distant attitude is effective when used in the right part, similar to his success in the election, and I'm interested to see if the directors will allow him to expand his talent and sink his teeth into something more substantial. Jena Malone is also very effective in the same effect, playing the role of a young girl with problems as she has done in Donnie Darko and Life as a House; Don Cheadle is an unconditional professionalism that gives us a different opinion about the compassionate therapist than he did in Manic; and Martin Donovan is brilliant as the afflicted father who tries to keep the wit and finally realizes that he must also prevent his family from falling apart. Also, it's great to see the beautiful Sherilyn Fenn in a small but important role. <br /> <br /> When tragedy strikes, people come together to overcome everything. As Leland points cunningly at one point, you see men and women helping others and hugging them when they see the pain and suffering that surrounds them, but after a couple of days everything goes back to normal. The character of Cheadle extrapolates the optimistic view that, at least, we can glimpse the true nature of people wanting to help and be good to each other, only to be returned with the reply, "well, at least we do it during the tragedy". We may not want to think that we are of good character because it makes us feel that we should be good all the time, and that, when we are bad, they should have the purpose of being that way. Being defective we allow ourselves to bounce and try again. Leland's mistake allows him to see the love he had for those around him, as well as open the eyes of others to wake up and not let their loved ones get away from them. One can not focus on the sadness of others when they must first confront theirs. Hoge has created a parable for this and a really effective piece of film, and we hope there are many more to come.
