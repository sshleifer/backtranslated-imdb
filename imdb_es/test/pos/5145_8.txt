It's great to see a movie starring children whose idea of ​​"acting like an adult" is not engaging in sensuality. Instead, these children see a problem in their community and assume the responsibility to help solve it. Hoot is a film directed directly to families looking for a fun day at the movies. The production values ​​are good, especially the shots of Montana and Florida. The Jimmy Buffet soundtrack is a perfect fit. The young actors are energetic and refreshing. <br /> <br /> The plot, about a trio of children working together to save some early bird owls from death by an unscrupulous pancake empire builder, will attract children. Many movies make children seem helpless, it's good to see a movie that shows children working hard to make a difference. And although the parents are absent or temporarily distracted, it was nice to see the children who want to follow in their parents' footsteps and try to correct the injustices. <br /> <br /> If you're tired of the whole self-indulgent story. The lines about children that fill the cinema give Hoot a chance. Then, take some time to talk with your children about the adventure of serving others and caring about the world in which they live. A positive message from a positive movie.
