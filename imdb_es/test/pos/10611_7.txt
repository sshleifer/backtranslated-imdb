I saw Marigold in a preview that was shown a few days ago, and I discovered that it was a completely fascinating and fun movie. The film is about a not so successful American actress who goes to India to act in a low budget movie, only to get stuck there when she discovers that the financing of the film has disappeared, along with the producers and investors. A casual encounter with an Indian movie that was filmed nearby leads her to be hired for a small role as a dancer. Since Indian films incorporate a significant amount of singing and dancing, this is a problem for Marigold, who has two left feet, not to mention a personality so tense and thorny that he can barely hear the music, let alone feel it. as Prem, the choreographer of the film, advises him to do so. <br /> <br /> But "prem" - the word, not the person - means "love", and Prem - the person, not the word - seems to embody that emotion in the way it deals with everything that surrounds, be it their production assistants, those who introduced Marigold to the shoot, the narcissistic and arrogant protagonists of the film, or the evil and tense Marigold. Soon, under her expert tutelage and her endearing deal, Marigold finds her feet, literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> I must say a word for those who are not familiar with the use of song and dance in Indian films. Unlike American musicals, the story progresses through these dance numbers, as plot developments unfold, and the transformations of the characters occur in parallel with the dance. It should also be noted that Indian dance is much more than a simple movement. An essential part of this is the representation of the dancer's feelings and emotions while telling the story of the dance. This is the main purpose of the dance and the dancer. <br /> <br /> That Marigold reaches this stage of achievement is demonstrated in an impressive dance number halfway, when Marigold, while performing the dance, must do so. for the film within the film, he also expresses his love for Prem. It is an incredible performance by Ali Larter, especially when he considers that he is not used to dancing in his films, or to thrill the feelings of his character through dance. It shows her ability as an actress, as well as the hard work she has put on paper. <br /> <br /> Of course, no romantic movie can work without a credible Charming Prince. Salman Khan, who plays the role of Prem, fits the role of a T. Even when it turns out that he is a Prince who is not so charming, he does not lose the sympathy of the audience. Salman has ruled the Hindi cinema (sometimes called Bollywood) for many years, and it is worth remembering that his first main role was also like Prem. He is completely charming, sweet, adorable, sexy and vulnerable. For those who have never found it on the screen, prepare to receive mega doses of pure magnetism! He and Ali Larter form a lovely couple, and are as similar in their performance as in their appearance. <br /> <br /> Will they be able to solve their problems? It does not seem possible when we listen to the last song in the movie, a lovely mix of reality and fantasy, reality and metaphor. The end certainly took something from the audience with which I saw it by surprise, but they were satisfied. The songs are used very intelligently. They are in Hindi, untitled, for the film sequences within the film, and in English for other occasions. But its meaning is always clear in the context and choreography. <br /> <br /> Marigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy, yes, there is also plenty of humor. The places and costumes of India give it a fairy tale quality, according to a story that can be compared to a modern fairy tale. <br /> <br /> If you have or have been curious about Indian cinema, but hesitated to try it. , this is an excellent introduction. It captures the color and vitality of Indian films, not only in costumes and jewelry (which are quite impressive), but also in animated dances and world-wide sound music. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Ali. Also, you should see him for his excellent acting when portraying a selfish and demanding woman of "high maintenance" who, however, has an inner attraction that inspires the love of two men. If you are a girl, you will enjoy admiring Ali's charming costumes and eating with the eyes of his protagonist. If you are a boy, you can not only admire Ali with his sensual disguises, but you can also learn from Salman Khan what it takes to get the loving heart even from someone as nervous as Marigold.
