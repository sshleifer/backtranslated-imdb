'Ray' lives in <br /> <br /> Ray Dir: Taylor Hackford Cast Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Regina King, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong and Sharon Warren. Written by Taylor Hackford and James L. White. Rating- *** <br /> <br /> "Hit the road Jack, and do not come back, no more, no more, no more, NO MORE!" Who would have thought that this immortal line that has almost become a remedial mantra for broken relationships in popular culture was conceived on a lovers' quarrel! Ray Charles was a genius. And if there was one thing he knew, he breathed and lived; it was music So in a life that included acute poverty, a desperate struggle with darkness, guilt, drugs and painful issues; Ray still found moments when inspiration hit him from nothing and words and notes took their own form to form an instant eternal classic! <br /> <br /> There are some lives that deserve to be transformed on the silver screen. The life of Ray Charles was one of them. It is almost surprising to know that this project did not have study support until it was completed! And that support probably came after the initial projections in which Jamie Foxx's performance was praised and predicted as a sure Oscar winner in a low voice. Jamie Foxx, like Ray, almost convinces us that Ray Charles is showing up on the screen and not an actor posing as a character! From the twisted omniscient smile to the twisted gait of not so much a disabled person but a man who dances through his demons, Foxx captures all the essences of the real Ray Charles. Ray was a complicated man. He never demanded sympathy and very rarely showed it himself. A shrewd businessman assured his success at any cost, sometimes at the cost of losing his loved ones. He never apologized for his ways of being fixed and always maintained that he loved his family, which we are convinced he did. He liked sex; It was as simple as that! But below all, there was also a ray that feared darkness. Imagine the horrors of a blind man scared of the dark! His fear was due to his fault. Ray was convinced that he was the reason for his brother's death and that his whole life was spent trying to redeem himself. Ray was a nonconformist who fused gospel with jazz, a blasphemous practice unheard of in the 50s. But his intentions were not to instigate. He was just practicing the only way he knew how to approach God! <br /> <br /> It's hard to capture a life as eventful as Ray's, and maybe that's where the movie fails. We are never really allowed to approach Ray as a person. We know it as much as we see it. Their relationships, especially with Margie Hendricks (Regina King), are not explored in detail. And the script barely passes over Della Bea (Kerry Washington), Ray's wife, who everyone knows was a rock by her side. And the biggest mistake of all is the hurried, almost abrupt climax. It's as if the director suddenly realized he was exhausted and asked for a package! However, 'Ray' is definitely recommended for Jamie Foxx's impeccable performance and a capable star set. The songs and the age create a feeling of nostalgia, and we have the genuine feeling that the film is made with sincerity. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Note: 'Ray' is nominated in six categories at this year's Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (Jamie Foxx). <br /> <br /> Rating- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> February 19, 2005
