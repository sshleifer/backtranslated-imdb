A great combination: - The humor of Chabat - The world and the characters of Uderzo / Goscinny - The limited presence of Christian Clavier <br /> <br /> The original comics were great - one of the best of a great series in general - and Alain Chabat, one of the funniest member of the famous French group Les Nuls, was able to film, replicate and complement the great work done by goscinny and uderzo through the intelligent execution of the story, giving Djamel Debouze his best role (in the end, a bit far from its usual repeatable part), bringing together a group of great actors (Gerard Darmon is wonderful, since Chabat himself is often a great Caesar). <br /> <br /> In addition, although he is forced to continue with Christian Clavier as Asterix, Chabat ingeniously honed his role in the film to give prominence to Darmon and Debouze ... which is always a good idea! <br /> <br /> => Great atmosphere, great stage, great director, great actors, great humor, the beautiful Cleopatra ... This film would have deserved a 10 if Clavier had not been involved
