NOT TORTURING A PATTERN is one of the previous films (and, honestly, in terms of history, better ...) of Fulci, and although it is not the typical "bloodbath" for which Fulci is known, it is still a very unique subject. nice movie. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds a small town where a series of murders of children take place. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations, either as suspects or "helping" the investigation (or in some cases both) include the police force of the cities, a small-time reporter, a beautiful drug addict and rich, a young priest and his mother, an old man who practices witchcraft and his protected wife, a man with a mental disability and a deaf-mute girl. All these people are intertwined in the plot to create several twists and turns, until it is revealed to the real killer ... <br /> <br /> NOT TORTURING A PATADO is not a "classic" giallo or a typical Fulci movie gore . Although it contains elements of both, it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with darker themes and some scenes of graphic violence (though nothing as strong as some of Fulci's later works). This is a well written film with many twists that made me guess until the end. Recommended for giallo / murder-mystery fans, or anyone looking to watch some of Fulci's splash-free movies, but do not despair, DO NOT TORTURE still has more than a fair amount of violence and sleaze. Some may be discouraged by the issue of child murders, and a female main character has the strange habit of hitting very young children, which is also disconcerting, but if that kind of material does not bother you, definitely take a look to this. 8.5 / 10
