First of all, I'm American. I have not seen any comments in IMDb about this series from an EE viewer. UU Second, I work in the business of developing television. So I turn around in a lot of the mud that comes out of the US broadcast programming. "Unit One" is an example of television that is a throwback to what I would attribute to the style scripts of the 70s, in terms of features. That is, those films made by young authors who had free rein to make the dramas feel more realistic and to allow the development of organic character. Tachea further along the lines of British star dramas such as "Cracker" and "Prime Suspect", as well as the brilliant "Underbelly" of Australia. "Unit One" presents independent cases that are confirmed and then resolved each week. The mysteries are not extraordinary or particularly Byzantine. Usually, they are centered around a single turn, generally within 40 minutes, and the resolution is carefully adjusted within 15 minutes. What makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it presents the main characters you're hooked to and that you can find in episode 2. These are real characters, alive, alive who have personal luggage, but not It's a kind of talented baggage. American remains, such as "Gray's Anatomy" or "Desperate Housewives" are overturned. These are realistic individuals whose background stories unfold peacefully throughout the series, as if they worked with them daily. After the nonsensical decade of "CSI's," "NCIS's" and "Criminal Minds," along with their subsequent spawn, it's comforting to sit down to see the friends you want to spend time with, such as "Unit One " "The mocking joke, the impassive dialogue of wood and the excessive risk that the American series I mentioned bother us every week are absurd compared to the nuance and silent resonance you get with this extraordinary Danish series. 7 of the first season, but I've already bought the four seasons and I'm in the long term, if you need explosions and testosterone, with music from The Who, and action of neon action paralysis, with neon and trembling lights, with characters Main similar to the key as your main diet for television drama, I suggest you stay away from this series.If you are an adult hungry for procedural criminal dramas subtle, moving, reflective and, yes, sometimes direct, I urge you to consult this program.
