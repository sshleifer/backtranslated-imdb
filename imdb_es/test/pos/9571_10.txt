This movie should be one of the funniest movies in history. His cousins ​​A great wind, Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman are great in their own right, but Best in Show takes the cake. <br /> <br /> A film about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners who show their dogs competitively, are the complexities of the characters that make it so good. After watching the movie about 75 times, I came to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this movie. There is very little interaction between any of the "groups" of characters, but that only seems to increase the beauty of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and you do not find it as funny as I am billing it, look again. The first time I saw it, I thought it was useful, but not too hilarious. It is a movie that grows on you. Definitely a movie that you'll find yourself quoting frequently. <br /> <br /> Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: A + if you get the DVD, check how these characters were "born", it's amazing that these two can hit him in the head. And to discover that they did not really follow a script and they invented themselves as they went along. <br /> <br /> Gerry and Cookie Guggleman: a Cookie is especially fun and does a fantastic job selling the Cookie character. Gerry (Eugene Levy) offers his standard stellar performance of the weakest half of the funnily discombobulated type. <br /> <br /> Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan- A + Find me a funnier character than Scott Donalan, I WILL GIVE! He will always be typecast as this character for me, since he was so natural and did not seem forced at any time. Stefan (Micheal McKean) was also very good and here they interact (and a brief appearance with the Gugglemans) demonstrates why he is always in these movies. A great actor with a knife like wit. <br /> <br /> Harlan Pepper- B +, I do not want it to look like it's not funny, I'm sure it's the only "Solo" that can not be as funny as the others on it. He uses the dog more than others and has other idiosyncrasies in his favor. <br /> <br /> The rest is also great, there is no weak character. Watch this movie at least twice. Buy it, you will not regret it.
