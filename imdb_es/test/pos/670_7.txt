Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by the crazy Robert Ryan in "Beware, My Lovely," a 1952 film by RKO. Lupino and Ryan made three movies together and worked well as a team, being consummate professionals with a great performance. In this film, based on a Broadway play called "The Man", Lupino is a widow from World War I who rents a room in her house. She is very active and very loved in her community and, although her husband died two years ago, she is not ready to move on. The man who rents her room goes on vacation, and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help her clean the house. It is friendly enough to start, but then it terrifies her, it locks her up in the house and does not allow her to answer the phone or the door, since it becomes violent and is more out of touch with reality. <br /> <br /> The character played by Ryan is shown at the beginning of the movie that escapes when he discovers a corpse in another house where he is working. It is unclear if he is the murderer or not, as he seems surprised to see the body. It may be that he has a divided personality, because when his personality becomes ugly towards Lupino, he seems to have no memory of his activities when he leaves it. He does not know he has the keys to Lupino's house in his pocket and he does not know why he has tickets for a party he bought from small children who came to the door. <br /> <br /> "Careful, My Lovely," is a very entertaining movie, and the two protagonists give excellent performances. The tension increases to a very high level and ends in a way that you are not waiting for.
