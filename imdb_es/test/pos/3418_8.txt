... and I usually do not like surprises! Watch this movie by chance in a motel in South Africa, the second week of a three-month motorcycle vacation in ZA. Besides being well prepared and acting, it helped me to understand the problems of the countries enormously. I just saw the "Million Dollar Baby" and I had to look for Hillary Swank since the name sounded somewhat familiar and her performance was excellent. I did not realize that she was the lawyer in the "Red Dust". Well, now I'm not worried about her disappearing like so many other Clint cronies before ... Now they're asking me to write ten complete lines of comments, which is pretty ridiculous, since I've written what I wanted to write. Well, here goes: I think if you are from a Western country, especially from Europe, seeing it will help you understand a little better why what is happening is happening there. So hopefully this will fill ten lines.
