I would like to know about the director, Barbet Schroeder, why he decided to make More his first film and, more specifically, what was his interest in hippies (or rather this form of Euro-hippie paradise) and his disappearance. The film is, at least, true enough to keep one interested, but in its own kind of truth it is strange, biased. It is a given heroine (also known as "Horse") is something horrible, rotten, the conclusion for many users of drugs that they think is the most important, because basically it is: after that, everything else stops. , that becomes life, and it is a continuous race for more of the same or death. More begins as something related to a romance between a New York girl and a German man, but becomes something else, for better or for worse (sometimes, both in the same scene). <br /> <br /> It is basically two "young people", Estelle and Stefan, who are in a city where Stefan has come as a kind of vagrant far from his home country. She's also wandering, something like, and maybe she's too friendly with a big pusher named Wolf. They end up on a remote island somewhere nearby and, after a daring attack by some "horse" of Estelle, they also find a platform in the form of a seemingly more remote house along the seashore. Schroeder's comment about youth and sex and drugs is not too simplistic, which makes the film really lucid and intelligent many years later. It is direct and subtle, more about the characters and then about the fact that what they are representing could, in other hands, be simply a propaganda image of the hippie exploitation. Perhaps the most enjoyable, and this is just an assumption, Schroeder uses as inspiration the long sequence type of Bergman's Summer with Monika: two children in an inexorable connection, some good definitely not so good, faced (too?) To landscapes perfectly take two . <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I must mention that there are problems, some big ones in fact. The performances are not very convincing at all times; A few scenes reach a certain power or have the actors in a good connection with each other, but Klaus Grumberg exaggerates himself even if he is a naturally grumpy German (in that case he would have preferred Klaus Kinski in the part to make him more insane but deep enough for the subject) as Farmer does in his own degree. And there are gaps of ingenuity in the script that keep it from being as deep as you really think it is. On the other hand, there are two important things: Nestor Almendros, the great director of photography (that is, Days of Heaven) is DP and it is a great impulse for a director for the first time as Schroeder. Almost all the images are seen with a purpose or amazing art, be it a photo of the cliffs by the sea or the sun or something as simple as the apparently natural light of a room. <br /> <br /> The other thing is Pink Floyd, probably the main reason why I and many others have heard about the movie in the first place (years before I really knew who Schroeder was, I saw the soundtrack of "More" every time I looked at the Pink Floyd albums). It is very good music at all times, sometimes the amazing variety that gives them the reputation they deserve. Some of that, too, is a bit tedious, even because it's a movie about free love and lots of drugs and, sometimes, both at the same time. I would not place it anywhere as high as Meddle or Animals, certainly not Dark Side, but it also helps raise the issue to another category, especially when you expect it less or in low tones or floating in and out of buildings. Like Stefan or other walks in the streets. It's an almost better environment than the film itself deserves, but in general, it's worth seeing as a dated piece, but powerful, like a less ambitious but more substantial Zabriskie Point.
