This could be my favorite, so bad that it is the awesome movie of all time. Like many preadolescent children of the 80s, the repetition of the revenge of the ninja engendered a phase of ninja in my childhood. Man that I thought Sho k. It was rough then. Jet Li could hit him with both legs in a plaster! This movie has incredible crosses that include flashdance, the exorcist and the TV show Lee Van Cleef Ninja. ugh but as a friend of mine says that anyone can get a good movie made. It takes a real genius to make a movie that starts with a ninja who survives 17 shots of the shotgun long enough to take over the body of arobial instructors for revenge. Wow. While previous commentators have mentioned the sword that flies out of the closet on the rope, no one has yet mentioned the powerful love scene. Where the sexy main cop takes off his shirt to reveal a backhair mane. The fun never ends. Rent this !!!
