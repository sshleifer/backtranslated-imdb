He saw this movie when it was an entry in the Santa Fe Film Festival. Heavy movie! The description of a completely dysfunctional family taken to another extreme level, could have left me depressed to the maximum, had it not been for jokes and dialogues along the way that lightened the overall tone of the film. The relatively "uplifting" ending gave hope to those affected by the initial tragedy. However, I did not leave the theater ready to go to a fun party. The movie stayed with me for several days. <br /> <br /> It brought back memories of "Ordinary People", but with humor mixed with tragedy. I think the performance was excellent, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hirsh. The way in which each character dealt with the tragedy was sometimes sad, counterproductive, but also sometimes hilarious. Intelligent dialogue, and situations.
