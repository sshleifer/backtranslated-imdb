I missed the beginning of the movie. I entered when the partisans were in the farm house. I can honestly say that it was horrible. The moral ramifications are amazing. <br /> <br /> My fear of pain and torture leaves me unable to see myself more than a coward. I see the capacity similar to that of Christ who was represented by the brave patriot, and I can only pray that he may or may have the moral baseness to follow his example. <br /> <br /> I see that the main theme of the film is to show the weakness / strength of the tortured, but what a sad decision to face. All because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that the pain and suffering that is exerted on a human being is somehow satisfactory. Be it mental or physical. <br /> <br /> I found the film very stimulating.
