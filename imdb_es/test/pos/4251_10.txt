This movie improved over time. I can not believe that forty years have passed since I saw this at the age of 15 years. Yes it's correct. Film ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could enter any movie. Imagine how it was for a boy of my age to see Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King were just killed, but the next summer there was a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the opportunity for the Woodstock nation to hit man. You'll see where Robert Downey, Jr. got his sardonic brilliance. His father was an instant hero for children like me. In this classic no punches are thrown, and the aged hippies will rejoice when they revive this era. With luck, the new children of the flowers will be emboldened by her, and this current era of fascism will be under the same scrutiny to which my era was subjected.
