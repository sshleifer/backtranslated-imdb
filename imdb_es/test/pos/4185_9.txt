Shame on the monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (what they were) or they were nothing more than an imitation of the Beatles (again, what they were), but for the children of the time when they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. . Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common in school playgrounds, but critics, well, never accepted it. Despite recording some classic and catchy pop songs, The Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums. Unfortunately, his movie vehicle found a similar fate despite the fact that it is the best movie in history. Beatle fans can argue that "Hard Days Night" was better and I'm sure many of the kids think that "8 Mile" was superior, but none of these movies was as bold and inventive as "Head" and that's probably the reason why he failed. <br /> <br /> If Head had told a direct A to B story, he might have attracted young fans of the band, but by pushing the envelope and using the film's opportunity to make fun of his own image, they really sabotaged the film with their fans. Can you imagine Eminem going to the camera and really talking about how sad it is that he's the best-selling guy in a genre where only 5% (and I'm being generous) of the acts are white? If you can imagine that, you have an idea of ​​how daring it was for the Monkess to sing "Hello, we are the Monkees, you know we like to please, a fabricated image, without philosophy". When you have a movie in which Frank Zappa tells Davy that he should focus less on dancing, and more on music, it is clear that there is much more than you expected. <br /> <br /> The story, what there is, refers to the guys who try to run away from their manager, who at one point forces them to play dandruff in a commercial, but every time they run they end up inside a box . I do not think you need to be Fellini to discover the symbolism of that bit. They follow some small fragments of comedy with Davy as a boxer who has to stop playing the violin to immerse himself in the big game and Peter refuses to throw an ice cream he does not want because there are hungry children, so it's wrong. He wasted the food, but The real selling point of this film is music and it is one of the best prints of the band. Even if history discourages you, you can sit down and enjoy some fantastic music. <br /> <br /> Any movie that starts and ends with Mickey trying to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge (in the end, the band continues) He) will never be a classic, but if you are a fan of the band or experimental cinema of the time, you will enjoy this movie.
