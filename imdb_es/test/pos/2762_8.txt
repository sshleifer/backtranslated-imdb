I have seen so many negative reviews on Survivors of the Andes that I felt obliged to accept it (or at least I will try). First of all, of course it seems outdated, it was made in the seventies with a very low budget, but that is part of its charm. I like contemporary films, but I also like old ones for what they are worth. I'm not the one who feels the need to see or like movies with modern treatments and effects; In addition, almost all movie buffs like old movies (who does not like El Santo movies or Plan 9 from outer space, regardless of their overall quality?). In the aspect of rhythm, it is only a tool to cover (again) its low cost, and I believe that the constant dialogues are in order for a better development of the situations and the characters. Sure, Alive has better FX, but I will not despise the previous one just for that, and I do not feel very attracted by the English speakers in an event in which people from Uruguay participate and for me, that gives the Survivors of the Andes a plus. . It's like, even if Canoa, from the seventies and based on a real event too, had a better remake now due to the advancement of technology, but I think I would take care of that based on the emotions it offers regardless of its production date . . <br /> <br /> All this is based on the impact I had on me because the first time I saw it was on television, and today I do not think it has lost part of its primordial strength. Of course, a lot of time has passed and I have seen tons of better films in all aspects of cinema, but that does not diminish its true value. It's not a bad movie, and I place it above Alive without hesitation. Just give him a break.
