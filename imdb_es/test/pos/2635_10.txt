This movie is a good example of the greatness that is the entertainment of the 80s. Oh, do not get me wrong, most of the music back then sucked. I just liked the metal bands of the 80s. Bands that had some balls. Forget about that keyboard shit and everything that "life is horrible and I want to die", trash. But the films of the 80s are the best. They were all nonsense and they just had a good time. This movie exemplifies that! Match! Undressing Fornicar! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!
