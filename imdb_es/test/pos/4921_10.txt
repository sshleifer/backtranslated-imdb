This is a classic animated movie from the cartoon series! Most of the main characters get a lot of screen time in addition to additional characters too! The focus of the film is on the holidays of superstar characters and everyone has their unique summer fun. It's very fun from start to finish! It has excellent color, great music and, believe it or not, I've seen it more than any movie. It's so big and in my opinion it's perfect!
