The film is a new version of a 1956 BBC series called "My Friend Charles", and as such gallops through the material in a relatively short time. I found it fast, nice and unpretentious. Someone else noticed the scenes, towards the end, where was John Mills gassing? - the producers obviously decided to omit the scenes, maybe censorship ?, but note that when sitting next to the floor window, take a deep breath followed by similar scenes with the car window open. The series of Francis Durbridge seemed to inhabit the same universe, that of inexplicable events, people are not what they seem and the villain is someone close to the hero / victim. A universe predictable in some way, but one with its own rules and regulations.
