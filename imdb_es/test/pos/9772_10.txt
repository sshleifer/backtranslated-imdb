I never sat down for six hours in a row to watch a miniseries, but Changi changed that. I'm not going to lie, I know that some Australian films can be pathetic and boring (actually, I like Australian films, but maybe it's partial), but Changi is in a completely different lane. Although it is not historically accurate, as we are continually reminded, the program combines excellent acting, an excellent script and the addition of humor to give us an entertaining and emotional perception of life in a prisoner of war camp in World War II. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that the program should not be a documentary, so do not let mistakes make you disappointed. <br /> <br /> This series exposes the creative writing of John Doyle (also known as Roy Slaven), who is more known for his comedy than for anything else, and an excellent director and actors bring this creativity to perfection . If you want to see how much hard work this series did, visit the official website, it is very interesting and you will learn a lot about the real changi accounts. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Changi yet, make sure you do not do anything for a whole day because you want to see the series in its entirety.
