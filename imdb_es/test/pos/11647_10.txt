Dead Man Walking, absolutely brilliant, in tears at the end! You can not see this movie and not think about the problems it poses; How can you justify murder (either murder or the death penalty) and to what extent is forgiveness possible (not just in a spiritual way)? Do not watch this movie when it's down! But look at it !!!
