I saw this (video 2000) years ago and would love to see it on DVD. A good movie, but I would have loved it even more if I had included the legacy of The Beatles and The Hollies, etc. <br /> <br /> I also do not know exactly how true the story is, if there were any changes. Done to dramatize the story? <br /> <br /> I was only 3 years old when Buddy crashed, and I did not wake up to his music until the late 70's. Much later, I discovered that our family moved to our new house on February 3, 1959. <br /> <br /> Well, little things that you say and do ... Your songs will always be remembered, always ... .
