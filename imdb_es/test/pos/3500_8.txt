By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally inadequate Ali G as a candidate for Staines in local elections, the unpleasant Chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit the current leader of his party, allowing him to take power. To his surprise, however, the plan failed, Ali is embraced by the nation and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try to secure his political future. <br /> <br /> Puerile, crude, misogynist, and always scandalous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen premiere for the middle class Berkshire gangsta of Sascha Baron Cohen, is all these things and much more, what It means it's my kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously, there are those who simply are not going to get the joke, and there will definitely be people who find risky jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, recreational drug use, hardcore pornography and the regions Extremes of the offensive Queen at the end (needless to say that it should be far away!), but if you think youthful humor is so funny, if you're a Baron Cohen fan in general, or just want to see the sexy Rhona Mitra in her underwear (and you're scared, because she's fine!), So I recommend spending an hour and a half in the company of Ali G and West S Taines Massive. <br /> <br /> They are evil!
