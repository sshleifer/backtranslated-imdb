Watching this movie caused a very emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are about. It is refreshing to see something so personal, honest and real. The thoughts, opinions and revelations of Mr. Block are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It is a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This movie is very careful and quite successful. <br /> <br /> One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple does not meet the expectations of society would lead to pessimism ... but it is not so. On the contrary: it made me feel good. I feel like I know more about marriage now ... about women. <br /> <br /> Definitely, check this, it will make you think, exactly for what a good documentary should be designed.
