In 1952, Hollywood decided to remake the classic that spoke for the first time of Al Jolson. <br /> <br /> This time, Cantor's son was played by Danny Thomas. Upon returning home from the army, he is expected to follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives by becoming a singer. However, the young Mr. Golding has a lot of enthusiasm for show business. <br /> <br /> At this time, meet Peggy Lee, an aspiring singer. She acts very well and her interpretation of her favorite song, Lover, is remarkable. The writers of the film were smart not to cover the obvious relationship between a Jew and a non-Jewish bride. In any case, this is overlooked. In his anger, for betraying his promise to become a singer, his father makes the traditional Jewish sign indicative of a loss in the family. This would not be done in circumstances of breaking a promise, it would be done if an interfaith marriage were celebrated among the Orthodox. <br /> <br /> Thomas does a very good job playing the singer's son. His singing is on par as the film ends on a positive note. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the technical advisers have not realized that women do not carry purses in the synagogue on Saturday or anything at all during that period.
