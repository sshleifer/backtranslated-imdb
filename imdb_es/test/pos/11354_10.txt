In the 60s in Hong Kong, a man and a woman move the same day to adjacent apartments with their respective wives. They soon suspect that their spouses always absent have a mutual affair. A strange bond emerges between the man and the woman as they face their sadness taking turns playing the other's spouse, before a more complex bond emerges ... <br /> <br /> No summary can do it justice, for Hong Kong "In the Mood for Love" by the author Wong Kar-Wai is nothing short of a miracle. A story about the sadness that manages to be moving and, at times, funny. A romance that never feels forced or false. Without a doubt, the director's method has a lot to do with that. <br /> <br /> Directed from a nonexistent script (although the concept is derived largely from a Japanese story) to favor improvisation, the film is immediately set apart by the freshness of its performances. The whole movie revolves around that and the rest is pure improvement. At the core of the film there are two characters that will fit in your heart and remain there long after the final credits roll: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are simply amazing and no language barrier undermines a single fragment of immediacy and truth that show The additional material is also top-notch: the films are magnificent for the eye (partly with Christopher Doyle's "Hero" lens) and the music is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is something that everyone should see, if only because it is by far the most sincere, mature and authentic "love story" that exists.
