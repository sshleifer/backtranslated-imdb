If you take Huxtable's parents and combine them with Kyle's, you get the perfect combination of superior and inferior parenting that you may want for your own family parenting skills. The best part of each program is that the parents do not give up, since the pompous of the upper class, wise, know everything, but at the same time they are not the stereotyped parents with little education who are constantly deceived and not respected by their parents. children. My children are 20, 16 and 6; Almost the same ages as Kyle's children and I see many of their situations that reflect my own experiences with my family. The stupidity with which they surrender alone shows that when you have love in your family, you do not have to take yourself too seriously to keep your family together and have fun with your children.
