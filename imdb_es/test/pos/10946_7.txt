This film, as my Chinese girlfriend informed me, features two well-known pop stars from Hong Kong. While this may make the movie a simple marketing gimmick, I found the acting acceptable, and both are cute. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty bad in general. The vampiric traits and weaknesses, however, are used in a humorous way and created some bits of unique entertainment. The fight between the two girls made me laugh, and this gave a good balance along with well-executed action scenes to create an entertaining movie.
