I really enjoyed this movie, and I'm not a fan of classical music. The story of the hard street child who discovered classical music and changed the way he saw it was great to see, without being sentimental or too incredible, although some details made me scratch my head (Frankie and his dog can live in the basement of the school without any of them). Did the students or teachers discover it? Where did he eat? Took a bath? Did you ever change your clothes? What did you feed your dog? The school owner did not think it was important to notify the police about the search for a missing Chico, but let him live in the basement indefinitely? :-)). But we can let those unrealistic details slide and just enjoy the poignant, funny and slightly entertaining story (for me, at least) and the wonderfully talented kids. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene with the mothers standing shoulder to shoulder. on the steps that prevent policemen from entering the school: I doubt they will get away with it today. And I liked the good touch of the guy that Frankie stole when he went around the tables (although that never went anywhere), and Frankie's friends who helped him in the end. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie for everyone!
