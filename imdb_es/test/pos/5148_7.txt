I saw it at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. There are some wonderful descriptions of this movie from other commentators here and they seemed to have enjoyed it a lot, so I'm not going to give a synopsis, but you can see a bit of Woody Allen and maybe A little of Federico Fellini in this Collection of the film of about 50 short sketches or vignettes joined without a real singular plot. However, some of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plotting lines, and a corner bar is often used as a central scene in which they are always giving the last call. The opening and ending scenes also have a common theme that limits the film. It took him three years to film this and much of the time he must have been dedicated to finding the simplest and most welcoming people in all of Sweden to do the cast. This is the official presentation of Sweden for Best Foreign Language Film for the 2007 Academy Awards. It's a good movie, but it hardly deserves an official presentation for the best foreign film. Last year, the official presentation of Sweden was Farväl Falkenberg, very weak, and the previous year it looked expensive but boring ZoZo, so, once again, Sweden will not have any chance of winning the Oscar. This film has its moments and it would have made a good short film of 20 to 25 minutes, but it gets a bit old and cold for a feature film. Roy Andersson directs. Gustav Danielsson is the director of photography. The editor Anna Märta Waern deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have done. Benny Andersson from ABBA fame offers entertaining music music. It's an interesting movie with a lot of dry humor and I liked it, but it's nothing really special and I could only give it a 7.0 out of 10.
