I'm trying to find a place to buy a DVD / VHS copy of the movie "Is not it shocking?" I was 7 when I saw this movie and I lived in the city where it was filmed. A couple of items from my family were used in the film as accessories and a couple of my friend's houses were used in a couple of scenes. Filming took place quite well in the city and in the surrounding community. I only saw the film once originally and I would like a copy to show the film to my family. I've done exhaustive searches online without luck and I was wondering if anyone would have any idea to try and get a copy of this movie.
