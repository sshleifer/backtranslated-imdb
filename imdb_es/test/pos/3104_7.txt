I have this movie in a collection of inexpensive movies. It is not restored, in fact, the audio was difficult to discern during the first minutes. <br /> <br /> At first, it looked like a typical haunted house movie, and it looks a lot like Clue's predecessor, Murder for Death, House on Haunted Hill, etc. <br /> <br /> Approximately half an hour after the movie, the story takes a really interesting turn, and goes from being a clich√© melodrama to something completely different, and much more. more entertaining than I had initially thought. <br /> <br /> Look at it, it's very funny, even if the long clips and wider shots (and almost the lack of music) make it feel a little creaky. The standards of today.
