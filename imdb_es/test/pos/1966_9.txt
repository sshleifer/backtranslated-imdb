The river's edge is not a NICE movie to watch, but it's an amazing movie. After having seen it many years ago, I really believe that it would still have the ability to impact if it were relaunched or remade or something like that. Perhaps no film made has captured the essence of the inertia of the young suburbs like this terrifying and disconcerting film. Since this is based on a true story, it is even more disturbing. Very well acted and simply UNPLAWNED many times to see, but also a little-known masterpiece and a truly important film. It must be mandatory to see it throughout the country in all high schools. Fantastic.
