Hair is one of my favorite movies of all time. Even not being part of my generation, I've seen this movie 9 times and I can not get enough with the beautiful message of understanding, passion, beauty and love. This film is against the Vietnam War and shows how people should unite independently of color, origins, religions and classes. I love the Berger and Woof characters and I think Central Park of the 70's is one of the most beautiful places I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I still have this music in mind: <br /> <br /> When the moon is in the Seventh House And Jupiter aligns with Mars Then peace will guide the planets And love will direct the stars <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the age of Aquarius. Age of Aquarius Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> Harmony and understanding Sympathy and trust abound No more falsehoods or decisions Golden dreams of visions Mystical crystal revelation And the true liberation of the mind, Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> ps: I'm surprised to see that the director of this film is the same director of AMADEUS. I love the two movies!
