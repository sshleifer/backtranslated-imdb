Seeing that this movie was in IMDB Bottom 20, I simply had to rent it. <br /> <br /> SURPRISE! SURPRISE I do not regret having seen this movie at all. In fact, I really enjoyed it. There is a camp level in this movie that highlights the cult classics of the 80s. Is it stupid? Yes, but Jim Wynorski shows that, after all, stupidity is not necessarily bad. <br /> <br /> Rent it for a laugh that seems involuntary but is really meant to be fun. Wynorski is a genius. I hope he directs the next ninja turtle movie.
