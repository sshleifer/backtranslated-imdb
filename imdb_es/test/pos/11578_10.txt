I've seen 'The Sea Within' today and I loved it. The actors in the film are wonderful (especially Javier Bardem, of course), but I thought that Belén Rueda would have a better role. Lola Dueñas, Clara Segura and, especially, Mabel Rivera interpret excellent performances. And I can not forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist). <br /> <br /> There are two technical aspects that I loved: the photography of Aguirresarobe and the score of the own Amenábar. I liked the song 'Negra sombra' ('Dark Shadow'), by Luz Casal with music by Carlos Núñez. <br /> <br /> In summary, I think the Spanish Academy should choose 'The Sea Within' to compete in the Oscars. I liked other Spanish productions, like 'Bad Education' by Almodóvar, but Amenábar's film is much better than them. 'The Sea Within' deserves all the prizes.
