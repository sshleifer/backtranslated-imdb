I did not know what to expect. I only saw it on a rainy afternoon on pay television. From the beginning it attracted me. The music and the stages and the characters were excellent. I had not heard of any of the actors, but they were all exceptional. A wonderful thriller. <br /> <br /> Now that I have read other comments about this movie that relate to previous versions and to the book, I will strive to get more information about this great movie.
