This movie was well made, but it also made me feel very bad sometimes. For anyone considering a show business, it is a must, as it shows the raw treatment in what happens for these workers with difficulties. The soundtrack was definitely great and the acting and dancing complemented it very well. Some of the attitudes of the students could have been a bit far-fetched, like Leroy's, especially because I'm sure someone like that would have been immediately expelled for refusing to read and that if it were the real High School of Performing Arts. The test of the Coco screen is difficult to observe for people with weak stomachs, please pay attention to my warning. While it is very important, I know that is the truth about what happens, so in this respect the film is correct. In general, it is entertaining and, although some parts drag most of the time, they are very fast. <br /> <br /> Final Grouping: <br /> <br /> Movies: This has probably been skipped. <br /> <br /> Buy DVD: It's not something you need to watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> Rent: It's worth renting at least once in your life!
