As a movie buff, I had obviously read all the unbearable reviews and funny and sarcastic comments about this movie (my favorite is Woody Allen's joke: "If I had my life to live again, I would not change anything ... except to see "The Lost Horizon musical remake.") So, I've never been able to see it without smiling with the choreography / set / songs, etc. Recently, I found a widescreen DVD and saw it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the movie, reputation, he enjoyed it a lot and, after trying to block all the negative prejudices that he obviously had about the movie, so do I. There is nothing particularly bad about Lost Horizon, and it is much more pleasant and visible that many other movies of the early 70s. It is not even especially the camp.The lyrics of some of the songs are quite repetitive and simplistic, but this is not really obvious when you first listen to them or when they are pointed out to you in advance, so you're ready to make fun of them. As for all the critics who claimed that the cast can not sing in tune, this critique falls apart since Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were dubbed (brilliantly, since the voices match perfectly with their voices), and Sally Kellerman It has a very beautiful and a totally unique singing style. Vocally, Kellerman's duo with Olivia Hussey in "The things I will not miss" is excellent. Special mention should be made of the brilliant performance of legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer as the High Lama, and his comments about the destruction of humanity are overwhelming for today's fractured world. I would not say for a second that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece (the things I would not be surprised are the uninspired choreography and the number of "Question Me An Answer" by Bobby Van, which could have been easily cut), but not even You have seen Lost Horizon, or you have not seen it for a while, try to see without that attitude of "Oh, let's laugh at this pile of garbage," and you'll be surprised how nice it really is.
