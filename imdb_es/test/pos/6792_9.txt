This is a lovely movie. Elizabeth Taylor does a wonderful job, just like Mickey Rooney. The movie makes you feel happy. It's inspiring, and although some parts are too sentimental, that's easy to forgive. I could watch this movie again and again. The race at the end is exciting every time I see her. I highly recommend this movie.
