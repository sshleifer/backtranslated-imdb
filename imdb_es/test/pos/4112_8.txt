I was 19 or 20 years old, I lived in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new domed theater, called the 21st century. Back-up chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and a huge open space between the screen and the theater crowded. We feel all the emotion of a new preview of a movie. Given the given day given ... I can still hear the music of the trumpet and the noise of the cymbals. I loved the interaction of the characters and the filmed views. I know that Peter Finch and Luv and Sally had some problems with the lip sink, but hey, this was a feeling of well-being, feel better about the things in the movies. What I regret is the way they cut the significant heart, they showed the cut version and then called it a failure. I saw the cropped version and I can see that he lost his vision of the vision he had in the preliminary edition. Yes, I shudder a little at Peter's effort to make love through music, but you know I did not see it that way when I left the theater. When they examined us while we were leaving, I regret any comments I have made that may have altered the original. I liked it then and I still see it while I listen to the music on my LP. Most of my family has heard me sing a lot of the soundtrack and I can use the movie monologues in our "what movie is this" games. I wish a cut of DVD director was available. It's available on VHS but it's not exactly the same. I would particularly like a serious and complete commentary on the style of the Lord of the Rings about his origins, struggles and triumphs. Demanding people should leave things quite well in peace. Bring it back !!!!
