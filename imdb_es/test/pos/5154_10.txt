I laughed several times during this movie, although give it a superficial look and you would think it was something completely different. I love the rhythm and the way it slowly burns in you as these beautiful and daring paintings present you. Andersson gives us something more here. He shows us something he has not seen since his last movie. He is exceptionally compositional and, through his method of fixing the camera and allowing the action to take place before us, opens the door to humanity and we peer into a place that reflects our own lives, our little lives. It is very powerful. It is the simplicity with which it allows events to take place that creates the opposite feeling of complexity. Everything in front of the camera is anything but simple. Andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. I think most of the scenes, if not all, are sets built from scratch according to their designs. I can not recommend this movie enough. For me, he took me to a place and I left him, having witnessed a torn and beautiful world, starched and aching, sterile and splendid. At the same time foreign and familiar. This movie is brilliant and affirming. I know because I left smiling feeling wonderful. It has taken him seven years to do this. If I only made this movie, I would still be there with the greats.
