The low budget, but memorable, could be a shock that emerges as a theater of the strange. The sick and naive nurse Charlotte Beale goes to an isolated psychiatric hospital and completely unaware that the only healthy people have been killed, despite the red flags constantly rising around her. <br /> <br /> The lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to continue than a sense of style, as well as a cast of extravagant characters. The pleasures of this film do not come from the commotions of the film, which are quite tame, but from the strange environment. First we have the delirious woman who thinks that her doll is real. There is also a judge who murders an ax, a war veteran, and old Mrs. Callahan is like the old grandmother of the whole world who has gone mad. A young patient named Allyson gives a new meaning to the term "nympho". A big guy named Sam is a little slow after a failed lobotomy, and Jennifer jumps suddenly between catatonia and violent outbursts. The only other sensitive person in the place seems to be Dr. Masters, but does she have a secret? <br /> <br /> "Do not Look in the Basement" is a great example of low budget exploitation films. There is not much plot, but the cheap works for the movie. Several cast members become memorable performances, particularly Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick, and the way the director adds strange little details to the film can really stay with you. <br /> <br /> The scene between Allyson and "the man on the phone" "is a classic for all time, and especially delicious are the facial expressions of Dr. Masters when she begins to exceed the limit near the end of Brownrigg also makes great use of the cheap soundtrack, with several musical tracks that really evoke the accompanying characters.My favorite signal is the "crazy" signal, a sitar that rings every time one of the patients It does something pathological. <br /> <br /> It's also wonderful how Charlotte plunges into hysteria at the climax, and patients reveal that Dr. Masters is just another inmate, and then suggests that CHARLOTTE is also a patient who is allowed to represent her delusions (she certainly has a tenuous grip on reality, why else would she not question the sinister lack of telephone service or external contact?) The scene in which Charlotte succeeds Bar with the little alive Dr. Stephens with a toy boat has to be one of the best moments in the horror of low budget. Yes, "Do not look in the basement" could very well be the "American beauty" of Z-grade garbage.
