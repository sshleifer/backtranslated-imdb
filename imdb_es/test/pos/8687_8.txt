This is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. To start, there are outstanding performances by the lovely Debra Paget as a princess / dancer, Michael Rennie as the villain, the handsome young Jeffrey Hunter investigating the crime in his city / state and others. The film is an unusually colorful adventure, and we even see the princess rehearsing the dance she then plays (for once). She manages to skewer Hunter before he knows he is on his side; Also the photography, the costumes of Travilla, the music of Lionel Newman and the style of the film are unusually good. Add to this incessant action, an intelligent characterization and a good direction of the veteran Harmon Jones from a script by Gerald Drayson Adams established in 1249 AD, and has the ingredients of a nice Greek Near East. But there is much to praise about the unusual and well-developed story here, as there is much more to be praised besides the film's fast pace, well-managed physical action sequences and superior technical aspects. Classically trained actors such as Michael Ansara, Edgar Barrier, Wally Cassell, Jack Elam and Dona Drake are not commonly found in a "B" movie; There are also fascinating sets, a variety of places and a quality mystery that is provided here. One way to evaluate a film is: "If I had the guarantee of living the experience, would I choose to submit to these events and perform these actions?" As my answer is a resounding "yes" in this case, this film is still one of my choices as a favorite and much underestimated cinematographic work. Could it be that the frequent contempt of American critics for women as warriors and thinkers, as in so many other cases, has caused closed minds to mistakenly consider the obvious qualities of anti-pugnacity and pro-entertainment of this film?
