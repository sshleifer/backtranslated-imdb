Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson's latest film, You, the Living, is not easy to review. One of the reasons is that, according to his own words, he has broken with the Anglo-Saxon tradition of telling stories, essentially the template of the majority of western film productions. Another reason could be that, although Roy Andersson is somewhat heavy on the symbolisms, his, unlike those of, for example, Andrei Tarkovsky, are of a more elusive nature. It took 3 years to complete this 86-minute film and it was not because he was forced to have long breaks between filming due to financial problems or problems with the actors. The film consists of 57 vignettes taken mostly by a camera, and it was the careful design of each of these scenes that required a lot of time. The image of this film that is closely related to the director's previous film, Songs from the Second Floor, is very important for the story, so this story is told in large part by the environment and the environment in which they live. the characters of the universe of Andersson. and interact. Before each scene was filmed, there would have been no less than 10 different test sessions with different actors, colors, dialogues, etc. The result is a dream version of the surrounding world that most of us would recognize and if the scenario is like a Dream, why do not you dream a little? As in The Discreet Charm of the Bunuel Bourgeoisie, when someone says "I had a dream last night", you can see it. But, again, what is perceived here as reality is not very different from dreams. <br /> <br /> Although the film lacks an argument in the traditional sense of the word and there are no main characters as well, the different characters that appear and reappear in different scenes are still found and their stories are they inevitably intertwine. What most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people. The trailer of the garbage chain smokes and drinks in excess to the woman who dreams of having a motorcycle to escape "all this shit", his corpulent and mostly silent boyfriend and his mother fragile and apparently gentle but quite distracted, members of a music band whose ability to improve efforts at home is not receiving a favorable reception from either their families or their neighbors, the depressed hairdresser from the Middle East and his arrogant client on his way to "a very important business meeting ", an old man who has a nightmare about the bombers in the sky, a young girl who dreams of marrying the young rock star she is so madly in love with. It is about dreams and nightmares versus reality, but it works as much as an affirmation in support of the claims of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that "all human communication is a lack of communication". People talk to each other, but it's as if they talk to each other. They try to approach others, but exclude others when they try to reach them. <br /> <br /> You, The Living is a poetic film set in Stockholm physically but of universal application. The society he portrays is Sweden, its artistic language and the people shown are, in general, unequivocally Nordic. However, the subject that deals, namely, the misery of humanity in a selfish world, goes beyond this hemisphere. Despite the seriousness of his subject, the film itself seems much more cheerful and full of humor than one might have expected. But in the words of the director himself, "living is so complicated for each one of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor". Therefore, this film is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on their sensibilities, and not a depressing journey of black reality of human nature. It is unusual in its language and structure, but if you can think outside the box and enjoy it, you will surely find this film entertaining and meaningful at the same time. It was shown at this year's Cannes Film Festival as part of the Un Certain Regard program, which offers "original and different works" outside of the competition. After the film was shown at Salle Debussy, the audience of 1,000 people gave him a standing ovation for several minutes. Do I need to say more?
