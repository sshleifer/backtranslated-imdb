This is a film that I keep coming back to, for a variety of reasons. As a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the Eastern Front in World War II, it is powerful. There are a number of very powerful scenes in the film that help capture the horror of war, such as tank battle, for example. Also, from what I can see, the experiences documented in the film are, in general, "true": if you read the book "Stalingrado" by A. Beevor, you will know what I mean. The film is also successful in the sense that it does not allow the character or the plot to dominate it, it is simply a story of survival, which attempts to represent the battle mainly from the point of view of the common (German) soldier. I read somewhere that the original script had to be toned down, which does not surprise me at all. If they really tried to show what the battle was like, it would have been almost impossible to be sure. Even so, there are still some moments that are difficult to see, this was done before Private Ryan, but possibly even more difficult in some places. Just a word of caution: do not buy the dubbed version "in English", it's pretty horrible and it ruins the movie. Try to get a copy in the original version (in German) with English subtitles, it is much more powerful. You may have to buy a DVD of Region 1 of the movie in this case, as I did.
