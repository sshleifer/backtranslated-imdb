Leos Carax has made 3 great movies: Boys Meet Girls, Mauvais Sang, Les Amants du Pont Neuf. In fact, those films were not that big, but they have the violence of youth, the beauty of youthful wildlife. Carax in these three films was very aware of what cinema was, but he tried to make his own vision of art, without thinking about everything he had seen, but using it and fusing it in his time. Pola X is a very different film because Carax made Les Amants du Pont Neuf, a monstrosity of 20 million dollars, a film that has destroyed everything in its path. After a movie like that, you can not do another in the same point of view. So Leos Carax has to change, and he did. The film is not as beautiful as its first, it is more reasonable, no more study, no more Paris dream, Carax has entered the last reality. It is no longer clean, they are not poetic characters. Carax has become a romantic in the German sense.
