It could be said that the finest series ever made (no discussion here so far) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov and the beautiful Dale Arden who travel in a rocket to another universe to save the planet. On the way, in fascinating, spectacular and action-packed chapters, Flash and his friends along with new friends like Prince Barin, Prince Thun and the incredible King Vultan gather their resources to fight the evils and armies of the merciless Ming. of Mongo and the jealous betrayal of his daughter Priness Aura (now it's a car!). This series is not just a cut above most series in terms of plot, performance and budget, but it is far ahead in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios, it has many old sets available, such as the laboratory set of The Bride of Frankenstein and the Opera House of The Phantom of the Opera, to name a few. The values ​​of production in general are advanced, in my humblest opinion, by 1936. The costumes of many of these strange men and women are really creative and first class. We have hawk men, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids and tigrones (alas!) And many, many other fantastic things. Are they all credible and first-rate special effects? No way. But by 1936 most are very impressive. The musical score is impressive and the beginnings of the chapter are well written, long enough to revitalize the memories of the spectators of the previous chapter, and punctuated by experts. Director Frederick Stephani does a great job putting everything together beautifully and creating a film worthy of Alex Raymond's comic strip. Finally, the performance is quite good in this series. Too often, serials do not have names without talent around one or two previous talents; Here, almost everyone has some ability. Do not get me wrong, this is not a Shakespeare group in any way, but Buster Crabbe does a nice job like Flash. He is ably assisted by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson and the rest of the cast in general, with two outstanding interpreters. But before I get to those two, let me add, as another reviewer pointed out, it must have been amazing for this series to get the Hayes Office. I see more flesh in Flash and in Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in films decades later. The shorts that Crabbe wears (and unfortunately for all of us, Professor Zarkov ((Frank Shannon)) are worn as shorts that boys can wear, girls have ruffles in half and they are absolutely beautiful, Jean Rogers can have Acting limited, talent, but she is a blonde, Lawson is also very sensual, sensual and beautiful, but for me, the two actors who make the series are Charles Middleton as Ming: officious, sardonic, ruthless and fun. class act "Tiny" Lipson plays King Vultan: boisterous, moving, hilarious, a symbol of pure joy in life and the whole essence of hedonism, Lipson steals each and every one of the scenes in which he finds himself. The plot snakes here, there and everywhere, but Flash Gordon is the penultimate series, the space opera and the basis for a lot of science fiction.
