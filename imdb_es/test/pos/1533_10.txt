I am deeply grateful to have seen this movie. The performance is surprising, the film itself is powerful and clear, and the problems involved are handled with subtlety and depth. <br /> <br /> This is an important movie. It could be profoundly transformative. <br /> <br /> I would pay a lot of money to never see him again. Because * it * is * so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to see. I admit that my liking for movies tends strongly towards light entertainment; The visual medium can be so powerful that I tend to avoid it for something really important. Those of you with greater strength than I have may find it easier to handle. <br /> <br /> But I encourage people to see it at least once. Preferably with others, so they can talk to each other and have someone nearby to remind them that there is more in the world than in the movie.
