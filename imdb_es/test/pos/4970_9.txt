Deep Blood ... It's one of those movies you're here with and you do not say another Italian Jaws scam! Well, Deep Blood is far from that. It's a cheap movie like the one you can get and, on the other hand, it's also creative. In Jaws and in all the other shark movies that we've all seen or gathered about everyone using fake sharks, well, in the Joe D'Amato movie he takes a new approach by using all the footage for his scenes of shark. This is one of the many reasons why I like Deep Blood, because it does not use archival material. <br /> <br /> In Deep Blood, an ancient Indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark. in Joe D'Amato's classic Shark, Deep Blood. <br /> <br /> It seems that an elderly Native American once warned a group of young people about this great evil at sea, and years later, friends are forced to face their fears when one of them is killed by a shark in a series of attacks along its coast. Now it depends on the few remaining ones to make sure that this monster is killed, even if that means going out to sea to do so. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato directed and produced this film under his company Filmirage. Released in 1989 and later used in Cruel Jaws: Jaws 5 by Bruno Mattei, along with many other shark movies. The Joe D'Amato Sharks entry is a great movie and any fan of the Joe D'Amato shark movie viewers should try.
