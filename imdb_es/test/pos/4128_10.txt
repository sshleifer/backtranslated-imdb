"The Buddy Holly Story" shows the beginnings of the famous singer in the bed of Lubbock, Texas, his rise to stardom, his tragic death in a plane crash. Strengthened by the fact that Gary Busey, like Holly, plays his own instruments, this film is the biographical film in its purest form. There are some things that seem a little trite, namely, the people of Lubbock consider that rock 'n' roll is the music of the devil, but the masterful performances overcome any weakness. If there is only one thing that is certain in this great world of ours, it is that Buddy Holly's music will never become obsolete. Whether it's "That's Be the Day", "Peggy Sue" or another of their songs, they still sound good after all these years. He is still one of the best singers in history. <br /> <br /> Just to show what Lubbock really thought about his most famous son, they did not name a street after his death until 37 years after his death! What a bunch of ungrateful people!
