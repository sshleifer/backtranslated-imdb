"Challenge to Be Free" was one of the first movies I saw as a child. It was also one of the first VHS tapes I had. I had not seen the movie in years, so yesterday I decided to put the tape and watch it. Wow. The story is as powerful now as it was the first time I saw it. I think that now that I am older I can better appreciate the values ​​that are implanted in the film. (Self-confidence, the value of freedom and love of nature) It's a "B" movie, no doubt, but you'll remember it for years, especially if you see it as a child.
