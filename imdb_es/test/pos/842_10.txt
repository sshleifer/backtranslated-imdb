The third film in a cycle of Exploration films incomparably bright, and the third masterpiece in a row, "Joshuu Sasori: Kemono-beya" aka. "Female Scorpion Prisoner: Beasts' Stable" (also known as "Sasori: The Beast's Lair", where I live) from 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects, but that equals (or even exceeds) the bright The entire original series of Sasori with the wonderful Meiko Kaji stands out as the absolute highlight in WIP cinema, and all films, especially the first three, uniquely combine exploitation and Art-house cinema like no other film. "Beast Stable" is the third and second film of "Sasori" with Meiko Kaji, the last directed by the brilliant director Shunya Ito and, in my opinion, the best of all. The first film "Joshuu 701-gô: Sasori" from 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of Exploitation cinema and simply THE Definition of Exploitation-Art. In the first equally brilliant sequel, "Joshuu Sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô" Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. The third film of "Sasori", "Beast Stable" maintains surrealism (although not in the same way as the second), and presents even more social criticism than its predecessors. Issues such as poverty, forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the film. <br /> <br /> This third film "Sasori" is ingenious and sublime in all aspects and could be said to be the biggest of the cycle, generally brilliant, (for me it is this, with the first as the second closest) . Once again, "Best Stable" is very artistic and very similar to exploitation. The visually stunning film presents a huge amount of brutal violence and sleaze again, as well as sequences of enormous surreal beauty. The incredibly beautiful Meiko Kaji is once again brilliant in her role as Nami Matsushima (aka Sasori). I absolutely adore this wonderful actress, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who does it. The rest of the performances are also excellent, especially Mikio Narita is a great police inspector who is obsessed with catching Sasori. The musical score is the same in all three films, with "Urami-Bushi", sung by Meiko Kaji, as the main theme, which is great, since the score is simply pure perfection. Like its predecessors, "Beast Stable" is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of Exploitation-Art that no serious movie lover can afford to miss. Sasori's complete cycle has a high rank on my personal list of favorites of all time. "Beast Stable" is possibly the brightest masterpiece of all! 10/10
