I had heard of John Garfield, but I did not know him. I really liked that movie. I had never heard of that. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life too, so he knew his part. He was a fugitive in the whole movie. Someone else killed a man. The character was blamed. He is a friend of a family that has questions and is not sure what to do with it. All kinds of minor plots are produced. My favorite was the frightening scene of swimming in a water tower where the water was deep and a Dead End kid could not swim, and none of them could get out. The character of John saves the day. The Dead End Kids were great as their friends and followers. One of them until the end. Ann Sheridan played the daughter of the family and the possible love interest of John. It was believable, but in my opinion it was not worthy of being loved, the only weak link in the movie.
