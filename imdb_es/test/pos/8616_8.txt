I like Breillat movies, but this is the best I've seen when balancing animal heat with sexual intelligence. Anne Parillaud is electric, and the script is amazing, especially considering that it's supposed to take place on the set of another of Breillat's films. You do not have to agree with her, take everything to get a lot out of this. It made me think a lot about vulnerability and power. Try to imagine a male director with the opening of Jeanne, not impossible, but a little hallucinatory. Unannounced underground sexual currents that are always present when humans come together to make anything hold bright light here, but not a cold light.
