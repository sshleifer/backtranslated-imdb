"Tourist Trap" is among my favorite horror films of the late 70's and early 80's. A group of young people is going somewhere, a couple in the car that is ahead, and that car has a floor, and Our movie starts with the young man, Woody, pushing the tire in search of a gas station. He finds a seemingly abandoned place, and yet he hears voices and investigates, and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts. Then the rest of the young people come (in VW Thing) and pick up Woody's girlfriend, and they find this same place, the Slausen Oasis, or something like that ... and then Mr. Slausen passes while the girls enjoy a immerse yourself in the brook. Of course, the VW Thing has died mysteriously at that time, so the strange Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum, with lots of wax figures, and he lives in the museum but behind it there is a big house, where he says that Davey lives. And who is Davey? Well, Davey Crockett, he says ... but if it were Davey Crockett, probably everyone would be safer. The girls are left alone while Slausen goes to help fix the car, but, of course, the curiosity is better than one, she goes to investigate and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and a rather lively one called ... Davey. What follows is a night of quite spooky terror as one by one, they are arrested by Davey, who says he is Slausen's brother. A girl (previously kidnapped) is treated with a plaster facial treatment, which results in her death when she covers her air supply. In any case, there is something of a twist in this and it is kind (but strange). Mr. Slausen is not exactly what he seems to be. A good and spooky horror movie from the late 70s, and many mannequins create a very spooky atmosphere. 7 out of 10
