I absolutely adore this film about a columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a major housekeeping magazine that delivers a welcome article each month that includes details about her incredible family life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The problem occurs when the owner of your monthly publication demands that you have him and a World War II hero as guests during the Christmas holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small apartment in New York, she is not married and does not have a baby, and she can not cook at all! Hilarity (and romance) occurs when you try to put into practice a credible act in an effort to save the face / avoid the owner of the magazine (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is a lovely comedy; One that I highly recommend to lovers of classic cinema.
