After the success of "Muppet Babies", Warner Brothers scored "Tiny Toons". But instead of playing Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and all the other kids in the Looney Toon gang, they created new animal characters that were children with their own distinct personalities but personalities that nonetheless reflected their predecessors. Clues included Buster & Babs Bunny (unrelated, which became his gag or phrase), Plucky Duck, Hampton Hampton, Dizzy Devil, Shirley 'the' Loon, Elmira, Montana Max, Furball, Sweety, rats and assorted animals . of Perfecto Prep, and the original Looney Toons are released. The "Tiny Toons" lived in Acme Acres and attended Acme Looniversity, where the Looney Toon gang worked as teachers who served as mentors to the younger generation from the beginning to the comedy. <br /> <br /> During the presentation of the show, several shots were taken in the pot in the Bush SR. administration, pop culture, and along with other gags and parodies. <br /> <br /> Buster & Babs, possibly the main characters of the show, as mentioned above, were similar to Bugs Bunny in some aspects, but they also had their own personality ticks and different comic styles, namely, the Babs 'tendency to impersonate each and every one, while Buster, capable of being a great imbecile, usually interprets heterosexual men (or heterosexual rabbits) to Babs' antics. Plucky Duck was a virtual copy of Daffy Duck (not Daffy's, but Daffy's egomaniac), with an ego almost as big as Daffy and so obsessed with turning the Busters & Babs as Daffy had with Bugs, though it usually fell Flat on his face in his attempts, however, remained strangely captivating. Hampton was an even more timid version of Porky Pig, and had the ungrateful job of playing Porky to Plucky's Daffy. Shirley, the blond duck girl, was a girl from the era of the new age era to which Plucky entered and left the phases of mockery or competing for their affections. Dizzy was the purple version of the Tasmanian devil. Furball was the silent Sylvester and Sweety was the pink bird Tweetie. There was also the purple skunk that longed for a boyfriend and the pint-sized versions of Wile Coyote and the Road Runner. The evil was defined in the form of Montana Max, a rich child who was always willing to make money or make people's lives miserable. There was also Elmira, a mad lover of animals that everyone feared. And then there was Godo Dodo, a strange creature that did not have any clearly designated species, except it was from "Wacky Land" or something like that. <br /> <br /> References to pop culture included Batman (quite often, actually), Michael Jackson, Vanilla Ice, Dance with Wolves, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Supergirl, fast food, the Ten Commandments , the Twilight Zones, Saturday Night Live and even the Simpsons, among others. <br /> <br /> It's not only fun, it also managed to be warm and moving, something that his successor "Animaniacs" never achieved. Also followed by "Taz-Mania".
