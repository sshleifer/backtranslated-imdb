I'm not sure how I can do ten lines of this question, but I'll try. <br /> <br /> When Julie went to the dance and they danced with slow music. What was the name of the song that was playing and who played it? <br /> <br /> I love that song! And I watch the movie again and again just to hear that song. <br /> <br /> I did several searches online and even searched for the soundtrack, but I still can not find the song. <br /> <br /> It could be because the song they were dancing to was not a complete and only partial song. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate if someone out there knows who the name of the song is and the group that sang. <br /> <br /> Thanks. <br /> <br /> Frank
