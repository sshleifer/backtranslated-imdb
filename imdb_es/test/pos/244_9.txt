This has to be one of the best post-Astaire musicals made by Columbia. Produced by Arthur Schwartz and directed by veterinarian Charles Vidor, this image really put Gene Kelly on the map and cemented Rita Hayworth's reputation as the best dance partner of the cinema. She plays a double role here as she plays contemporary numbers from the '40s with Gene and her co-star Phil Silvers, but also puts her in the role of her grandmother, a nightclub artist in the late 19th century. <br /> <br /> The music should also be highlighted because this was the last project in which the legendary Jerome Kern worked (the most famous nowadays for "Old Man River" and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes") , and his lyricist was the same the legendary gershwin anger. They provided a score that is full of charm and characterization. The music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because it is perfectly designed in the style of the early twentieth century that was Kern's original period. It's a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and listening to them make a song in the original style of that era. <br /> <br /> The story is quite inconsequential, which is fine with me. because this movie is as close an approach as you'll ever see in the Broadway musical comedy style in the 1930/40 Broadway. Even the propaganda aspects of the 1940s war of the film's music give it an extra charm, since the talented trio sings "give way to tomorrow" and even mocks with humor the enemies of the United States and uses the jargon of the time, as referring to "gremlins". <br /> Probably the most memorable performance of the film is Kelly's dance for the "Alter-Ego dance", which found him arguing and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of conscience. This foreshadows much of his later work and also represents an effective and memorable scene in itself. <br /> <br /> Fans will want to pursue this for several reasons: Kelly fans will see this as a rare opportunity to watch it outside the confines of MGM with a different set of co-stars and music superior to their usual MGM material. . Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in a glorious color on top of her fame and ability. And fans of classic Broadway musicals will definitely want to hear Kern's final score and marvel at the quality of Gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. This is a definite gem in the music program of the Columbia crown.
