This movie makes several winks to several science fiction movies. The prologue reminds me of the original theatrical version of THX-1138 (the BUCK ROGERS trailer, here was a fragment of some of the first SF TV shows in Japan). Then, the opening shot of the city in 2345 has the dragon's signal flying over his head with a billboard, reminding one of BLADERUNNER immediately. The BLADERUNNER aspect comes even more pronounced <br /> <br /> when we meet the hero, who is called Replicante (Is it blond and is called Ryo, a tribute to Roy Batty, the character of Rutger Hauer in BLADERUNNER?) . Soon a battle scene emerges that immediately reminds us of THE MATRIX. The government that forces the population to take drugs is like THX-1138 and the main executor, while it seems a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd, turns out to be a robot, very similar to the TERMINATOR. The final battle reminds us of TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is very funny. It's probably not one of the best SF movies out there, but it's nice, certainly a lot nicer than guts like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.
