The director and co-author Alejandro Amenábar did not facilitate things to the spectators of his tense story, a bit extensive but very disturbing, based on the struggle of a Spanish man to obtain assisted suicide. "Mar Adentro" ("The Sea Inside") is exciting and its impact far exceeds the time spent in the theater. <br /> <br /> With the award-winning Canadian film "The Barbarian Invasions", people came to see a family together with a clique of devoted friends who respond to the desire of a beloved but irascible man to end his life. In that film, the center of attention suffered from progressive and incurable cancer and its decline to a terminal stage was rapid. In spite of how exciting the scenes were, death was inevitable: the question was how smooth could be done with the requested intervention. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro (played brilliantly by Javier Bardem) is a different story. For more than two decades he has been a quadriplegic due to a diving accident. (Very keen onlookers can detect a terrible irony as to why they ended up in that condition due to their unpredictable immersion). Once he was a world traveler and a lover of beautiful women, he is now trapped in a motionless body, and all his needs are met by a truly devoted family who voluntarily devotes much of his privacy and time to keep his beloved relationship. <br /> <br /> Rosa (Lola Duenas), a single mother of two small children, enters Sampedro's house so she may have been merely curious to learn about the plight of the paralyzed man, but becomes both in an emotional support center for Ramon and in a funny but sometimes aggravating presence. A good performance by Duenas. <br /> <br /> The problem, of course, is that Sampedro is not sick in the normal sense. He may well live for decades more with proper care. Therefore, his softly but persistently expressed desire to end his life with "dignity" creates a moral dilemma for friends and family members who, logically, react from different ethical and religious perspectives. <br /> <br /> Ramon is the poster quad of A group dedicated to changing the laws of Spain regarding assisted suicide. "Death with dignity" is his slogan. Gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist who recruits the help of pro bono public attorney, Julia (Belen Rueda). Julia has her own health problems that carry an undefined but catastrophic prognosis. Happily married to a devoted spouse, she becomes emotionally attached to her client. <br /> <br /> What follows is a very sensitive interaction of values ​​and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and wife, his adolescent technophile son, not the intellectual who is Ramon, and his elderly father who can not stop crying because of his son's cataclysmic descent into absolute impotence. <br /> <br /> The moral and legality. the problems are solved through an excellent performance and brief vignettes that include a scene in the court in which the formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that may take into account the feelings and views of Ramón. It may be Spain, but the problems are alive in most countries, including the United States. <br /> <br /> Especially funny is a debate between Ramón with a bachelor and a Jesuit priest who gives talks, it's also a shout. quadriplegic, but whose hidden dogma casually conceals the absence of a soul. <br /> <br /> Special congratulations to Mabel Rivera, the sister-in-law of Ramón, Manuela, for a genuinely authentic portrait of a strong woman who has the family together. And the same compliment extends to Belen Rueda, Julia, who goes from being an objective defender to a close friend of a woman who runs towards a dark destiny. <br /> <br /> The director does not impose value judgments that allow each character to express their full range. your feelings effectively and, sometimes, movingly. Like "Dead Man Walking," this movie can support any point of view on its deadly theme. <br /> <br /> No one can prevent a person from committing suicide if determined, but the universal tragedy of the Ramones of the world is that without help, life in a body where only the heart beats and only the head can move is a sentence that no court could pronounce on the most depraved criminals. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is well adapted to the story and the beautiful Galician scenes contrast with the limited views of Ramon's experiences that once roamed the world from his special bed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
