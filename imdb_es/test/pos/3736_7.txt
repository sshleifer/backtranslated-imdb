Even though there were aspects of this movie that I felt were not developed enough, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are excellent in their leading roles. The basic premise of the film is that both were in the wake of broken marriages when they met. Both, too, are seeking healing. Unexpectedly, they find that they can help each other heal. There were aspects of the movie that I wished I had seen play more, where the simple flashes simply suggested themes in which my mind had to fill in the blanks, such as the apology to the grieving widow, and how Adrienne stops feeling guilty for having slept with Paul to feel good about that soon after. The opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was simply suggested that they were going to make love with the arrival of the hurricane. But in the end, the movie left me feeling a great appreciation for the relationship that my wife and I shared. And there were moments that brought me to the edge of tears. Therefore, I have to say that it is worth seeing.
