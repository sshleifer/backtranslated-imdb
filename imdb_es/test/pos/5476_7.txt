What I've seen from Wolfgang Petersen's films has been pretty good. He knows how to direct the action, create suspense and make you interested. Eastwood tends to be big, sometimes excellent. This applies both to his performance and to his direction. Both deliver solid work here. The concept is not bad, and the cat and mouse game works well. Malkovich performs quite well, and the game between him and Eastwood adds to the film. I guess this will not introduce anything new, really ... but it really never affirms, nor does it need. They are two great actors, each with a basic type of role they have demonstrated at other points in their careers that can handle remarkably well, and with a great director at the helm. Actually, it is entertaining, well done, and simply fulfills. The editing and cinematography are good. Acting and writing characters is also. The film manages to be suspenseful and intense, and if you allow yourself, you will probably entertain yourself and compromise, even if there are superior films. The rhythm is quite accurate. I recommend it to any fan of the main actors, the director and / or this type of film. 7/10
