I absolutely fell in love with these girls. Let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series that runs every two days that is on USA TV. I check the Internet and download it from there, so I'm in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I know absolutely everything about them. I looked on the internet about Rory's car, what are their middle names and things like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria. I can not understand why, but my boyfriend does not like them and I try to make him see how wonderful they are but without success, but he understands me and allows me to be with my "obsession" with the Gilmore Girls. I adore you. I really hope that if someone sees this, give them a chance: you will not regret it.
