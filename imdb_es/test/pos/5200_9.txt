Bloody wonderful. Recommended by a friend who knew that I liked Thomas Kretschmann in The Pianist and Downfall. I loved the flow of the narrative: how the characters went from hope and ideals of value through shock, fear, disintegration, despair and total annihilation. A film against the war of the first category that must have created quite a stir in Germany. It is not a moment of pride for anyone and the study of a lost generation. This film was excellent to convey the elimination of the order of the terrestrial troops and to combat the futility of trying to control the untamed nature and the Russian psyche. If I did not know what I would have thought was a Russian movie, it was so fatalistic. What an uncompromising ending. One pieta.
