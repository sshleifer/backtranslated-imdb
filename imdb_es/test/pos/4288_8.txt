If we could have "separate tables", why not "separate lies". <br /> <br /> This becomes complicated. The husband of a housekeeper is killed when he is hit by a car on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman he cleans up for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover when the accident occurred. To complicate things further, the housekeeper once worked for the boy's parents and imprisoned her for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was their car that caused the accident. It seems that she wants revenge. <br /> <br /> All this is complicated. When our housekeeper discovers that her boss was driving the car, she retracts her testimony to the dismay of the officer who is working on the case. <br /> <br /> As if this was not enough, several months later. our lover (Rupert Everett) suffers a terminal illness and our wife (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to take care of him. <br /> <br /> The performance is pretty good here despite the endless "Peyton Place" as the theme. Tom Wilkinson, is a lawyer who tries to protect his wife. <br /> <br /> The movie is good, but we could have done it without the terminal illness. Oh well, the marriage ended anyway.
