This is another scary festival full of universal fun. Many people want to compare it with House Of Frankenstein. Although it has a similar cast and the same director, it can stand on its own (it seems that Erle C Kenton directed most of the Universal). horror movies of the 40s). <br /> <br /> The summary of the argument: Baron Latos appears in the house of Dr. Eidlemann in search of a "cure" for his vampirism. Larry Talbot (who somehow survived House OF Frankenstein) also appears at the door of good doctors who seek a cure for their affliction. After a failed suicide attempt, Talbot and the doctor find Frankenstein's monster. To complicate matters just before he bites the dust, Dracula infects the good doctor with his blood. The doctor becomes a maniac thirsty for blood at certain times. Where this entails is something that you will have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Carradine actually gives a very good performance as Dracula. He is not chewing the stage as he will in the later papers. However, it is difficult to suppress the giggles when it appears in a top hat. The layer / coat is traditional but the hat has to go. Where does the hat go when it becomes a bat ...? <br /> <br /> Onslow Stevens offers an excellent representation of the doctor. He is divided between his basic goodness and the growing thirst for blood of which he is now prone. This is a very underestimated performance. Chaney gives the Werewolf even more life in his fourth appearance in that role. <br /> <br /> The monster does not have much to do this time. Just lie on the table until the end (some images from the Frankenstein Phantom are used). At least in House Of Frankenstein he was a little up. <br /> <br /> Yes, this adheres to the basic universal pattern complete with anger The village mafia goes crazy with torches. But it's not a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes. Get a minimum of 8.
