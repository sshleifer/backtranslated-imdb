This film begins as a T'n'A film from the university, but becomes quite ugly after the sister of the main character is raped by a gang of motorcyclists driving a van. It has a pretty good rhythm, and James Van Patten does a pretty good job in this Cannon tax-paying movie. This was the first movie I saw on the Parkway Drive-in, here in Toronto. The main feature was "Alphabet City", and "Young Warriors was the added feature." Of the 2 films, "Young Warriors" was much more entertaining and memorable.If you're a fan of incredible, excessively violent movies, this would be a great addition to any collection.
