... instead, see it as a great account of coming of age about African-American men in the mid-1960s in the Chicago ghettos. For all of you who are below 50, "What's Happening" was a light and quite extravagant comedy with very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) in relation to a group of young African American high school students who live in a working class neighborhood. I really liked it, it just does not have a real connection with this movie. "Cooley High" started as the basis of "What's Happening", but its serious nature did not register well in the test audiences, so it was remade like a comedy, even though the credits in "What's Happening" still read based on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie starts off lightly, but touches many aspects of life unique to the turbulent 60s and also some other aspects of growth that are eternal. Boys deal with sex, betrayal, unemployment, hopelessness and even early death. The ending is quite powerful and serious, and the film has a great Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended Unfortunately, this movie is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and is not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and can be played in the few places for those movies.
