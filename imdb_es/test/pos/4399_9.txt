This was the best movie I saw in 2000. The Cohen brothers have never let me down before, and certainly not this time either. <br /> <br /> It's one of those rare movies these days: it's witty, smart and very entertaining. I left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. Of course, there are many things about Cohen there: strange characters and quirky gadgets, well-developed plot and magical camera work. But no Cohen movie looks like any other Cohen movie, if the overall quality of them is overlooked, of course. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. But the true masterful interpretation in this movie comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the cast is also excellent. <br /> <br /> A film that is a light comedy with a musical touch that evolves its rednecks of tales and country music of yesteryear, impregnated with wit and intelligence. That is a very unlikely combination. But it is exactly what this image is.
