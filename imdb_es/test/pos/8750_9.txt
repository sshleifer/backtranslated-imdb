What an amazing miniseries! The original TRAFFIK stole me completely from everything that was on it. Much more attractive than the American remake, the original TRAFFIK has an incredible cast of actors less known to the American public. Juliette Binoche is the most recognizable actress who plays a teenage daughter addicted to drugs by a government official. But it is not the power of the stars that transmits this film (although I enjoyed the American version, I felt that it was attenuated by the famous Americans of the image). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I saw the American version before finding the original BBC miniseries. Of course, there were no image filters, lush locals and the big star / director name. However, the sand and grime of Europe (through the world of drugs) perfectly complements the imminent sense of danger that permeates this entire film. The problems, such as getting drug addicts out of their hands, bad anti-drug campaigns and the resistance of foreign governments to help destroy their drug growers from the inside, make TRAFFIK bold, engrossing and horrible at the same time . Weather! <br /> <br /> The truly incredible parts of the film come from Pakistan. My God, I never knew how serious the problem was in Europe ... even everywhere! To get a real education about the problems of drugs, beyond how they affect the human body, you should see this version and the American version. Each one shows a very clear and undeniable fact. These countries, which are leaders in the eyes of the world, have a culture that has led to the death and suffering of many. <br /> <br /> Drugs are worse than war. They work in the shadows, the dark secrets of any "successful" society.
