Michael Radford, the director of "The Merchant of Venice" does a tremendous job in opening the work, as it makes it more accessible for everyone to have fun in the cinema watching this thorny story of a horrible moment in history. The exquisite production of Shakespeare's work is a feast for the eyes with its rich detail of sixteenth-century Venice. <br /> <br /> This is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as William Shakespeare imagined. After having seen the work a few times, we were not prepared to know what to expect. Mr. Radford is responsible for presenting the story in such detail so that everyone can easily understand it. In addition, he has used an English version that makes more sense, instead of relying on the original text. In fact, the way Shylock speaks in the film does not impress at all, being him, a member of a minority that has been marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino tremendous. The representation of Shylock shows a man who is vulnerable, arrogant, vengeful, evil and totally human, all at the same time. Mr. Pacino sheds light on the character of the man who is defeated in court by a technicality. His own daughter has left him and his whole world seems to be giving way. At the end of the film, we see a man who has been reduced to being the target of hatred and ridicule on the part of everyone. <br /> <br /> Lynn Collins, since Portia is a happy discovery. After having seen it lighter, it not only surprises, but it makes the best of its paper and its time in front of the camera. She shows us that she is a woman with a great intelligence, who comes to the aid of her husband and her best friend, who risked her own well-being when trying to help Bassanio get the hand of Portia. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, the man who looks for Shylock for a "bridge loan". After all, he knows that his ships will return with fortunes from abroad soon. Antonio gets much more than he expected by agreeing with Shylock the terms of the loan. Antonio's best plans are diverted when, suddenly, he can not fulfill his obligations. Mr. Irons gives a subtle performance. <br /> <br /> Joseph Fiennes makes a good appearance as Bassanio. Her good looks and charm impress Portia, who clearly sees a soul mate in this young Venetian woman, since she knows that he is the one for her. In addition, in smaller roles, Kris Marshall, Zuleika Robinson, Charlie Cox, contribute to make the film a pleasant experience. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is Mr. Radford's triumph because of the vision he gives us of Venice and its Citizens during a horrible time in the history of mankind.
