Certainly, this proves beyond any doubt that Patricia Arquette is what she is promoted to be: AN ACTRESS! This is, without a doubt, his best moment of action and he certainly deserves credit for his work. Never in any of his other films, with the possible exception of Holy Matrimony, has he been totally credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Plot: a young woman is in Southeast Asia and suddenly finds herself involved in the political chaos of the countryside. She witnesses mass murders and totalitarianism and escapes. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you MUST see or you have not seen all the best Hollywood movies. I classify it 58 in the 100 best movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Thanks Bob
