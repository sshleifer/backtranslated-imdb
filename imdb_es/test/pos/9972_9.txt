The problem inherent in any staging of 'The Merchant of Venice' has never been pseudo-controversial anti-Semitism, but the fact that there are two very different story lines in both tone and content; A frothy romantic comedy and a scorching tragedy. While the mixture of genres caused a stir in the sixteenth century (and mocked Shakespeare in Hamlet), it rarely fails to please modern audiences. As a result, most directors are forced to put emphasis on one plot at the expense of the other, and it is not surprising that the decision falls in Shylock's favor. <br /> <br /> Like many of Shakespeare's. Great tragic heroes, Shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character. Regrettable, proud, angry, vengeful, weak, arrogant; His behavior simply challenges the analysis and continues to be discussed. It has flaws not because it is Jewish, but because it is human. Rarely do modern writers imbue their creations with such richly textured contradictions, and it is for the benefit of all that we have Shakespeare to inspire us. <br /> <br /> The language of Shakespeare is wild and rambling, saturated with multiple meanings, word The game and metaphor. To be understood, it must be manipulated and tamed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so. When an actor fails, the words sprout in a torrent of incomprehensible words, but when it does, the English language comes alive with an immediacy and vitality that take your breath away. Al Pacino is one of those actors, and here he shows an incredible level of clarity and control that, if there was some kind of justice, he would take every prize of the offer. He faces the challenge of presenting Shylock head on, and offers an extraordinarily subtle and nuanced performance. It would be a crime if we never had the chance to see what he does with King Lear. <br /> <br /> The cast of support is worth mentioning. Jeremy Irons offers an original version of the familiar Antonio, presenting an older and calmer figure that shows the disagreeable contradictions between the medieval cavalry and the ugly prejudice of the time. Joseph Fiennes is a revelation as he matures beyond the surface view to really inhabit a character for once. Lynn Collins is the only disappointment. Many of Shakespeare's women are subscribed and require that an actor really work hard to bring them to life, and the personification of Collins Gwyneth Paltrow seems a bit flat and inadequate for the darker tone to which Radford points. <br /> <br /> The design team should be recognized for creating a unique and totally credible vision of the Venice of the late Renaissance. The city has not seemed so ominous since "Do not look now." Taking full advantage of existing locations and natural light, the film has an appearance of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and timeless costume design. All, again, are worthy of recognition. <br /> <br /> Financial sponsors of films like this should be commended. With a budget of $ 30 million, they must participate in such a company with complete knowledge and certain that they will never make a profit and, nevertheless, they invest. We can all be grateful for that, as the result is a remarkable adaptation that will surely be a point of reference for many years.
