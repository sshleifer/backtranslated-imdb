This movie has "obsessed me" since I saw her when she was about 8 years old. I did not know what his name was, so I am very happy to have finally tracked him down. I remember that I was quite scared, because I had been in a tin mine in Cornwall when I saw it, so I could imagine everything. Fortunately, I did not see any ghosts of dead children there, but this movie seemed quite disturbing and terrifying when I was much younger. I have certainly never forgotten it, although I did not find it anywhere. I seem to remember that the films of The Children's Film Foundation are generally good, but they do not show them anymore. I also remember programs like The Children Of Green Knowe at the same time on the BBC, equally disturbing in their own way.
