I'm not sure what version of the movie I saw, but it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I did not know who the "Twins" were (Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi) before watching this movie and I think that the English translation of the title is somewhat misleading. <br /> <br /> Martial arts are very well done. I especially liked them, because there was a lot of judo / grappling that was filmed very well. Donnie Yen (see him in Hero, great acting) as a director is great, since he knows how to film these scenes. <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to flow for me, except that there is a scene in which the girls are. The fighting on the roof with bamboo canes. It really has nothing to do with the plot, but it's still entertaining. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the best (modern) action movies of HK I've seen in a long time. Although cheesy in some aspects, it still succeeds. <br /> <br /> Definitely a 9/10
