The submarine used was not Varangian! 'It' was in fact two ships, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng in Barrow-in-Furness but maintained by the Royal Navy during the war. P615 sank, but P614 finally surrendered in 1945. <br /> <br /> No doubt, the confusion arose because someone looked for P61 (as I did) and found Varangian. When, in fact, the last digit of P614 and P615 was painted ... <br /> <br /> There are some extremely realistic moments in the movie. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class. As no S-class submarine survives, the shots of them (like P61) and of the depot ship "Forth" are part of an interesting record now, as well as an excellent film.
