I have rented this jewel several times! It is a small masterpiece, but in some way expanding, that takes the viewer from Manhattan to the beauty of the Greek islands. The marriage on screen of John Cassavetes with his wife in real life, Gena Rowlands, is on the rocks. He finds meaning in an adventure with the young Susan Sarandon he meets in Greece, while his daughter, played in his first film role by the pubescent Molly Ringwald, falls in love with the son of the Greek shipping tycoon who courts his mother on a yacht that sails in neighboring waters. Meanwhile, the immensely talented Raul Julia plays a shepherd who lives in a cave with his Sony Trinitron. He has the "hots" for the character of Molly Ringwald until he faced John Cassavetes. Everything meets at the end in a classic closing scene where everything is reconciled. You see Raul Julia, the goatherd, dancing with his goat. This movie is full of mysticism, beauty, young and old love, humor, sensuality and more. Look at it!
