I really liked that movie! <br /> <br /> Films and games fulfill their purpose when they expose social, political and other problems that affect the majority. This movie served that purpose. <br /> <br /> I identify with the plot and I know the people to whom this has happened. At the time this film was made, the concepts presented in this film were advanced for the public, but it had already happened to my friends through people in powerful positions. And, I know how it is when people do to you what they did to Angela Bennett, because they did it to me. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed Sandra Bullock's interpretation of Angela Bennett / Ruth Marx. She portrays a beautiful, intelligent and resourceful young woman who has the courage to avoid surrendering to the overwhelming odds, struggles to maintain sanity and the restoration of her life and tries to protect those she loves. Losing his self-concept and succumbing to that old attempt to reinforce a decadent self-esteem by having sex with a stranger added a touching touch of reality. <br /> <br /> The climax of the plot reveals the only real reality. Solution to this type of problem.
