All you need is a large house, a babysitter and a telephone. Simon West directs this exciting and chilling remake of the 1979 original. This version is more of a thriller than a horror movie. Emotionally tense with a growing fear factor. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) has to pay an excessive cell phone bill; she assumes the task of caring for the two children of Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant). The house is a beautiful masterpiece of wood and glass of the seventies. Isolated and quiet. The children are already in bed, the wind accumulates and joins the torrential rain. The phone starts ringing, ringing, ringing. The nanny soon finds herself in a frantic survival mode for fear of the strange stranger at the other end of the phone. <br /> <br /> Belle is a great innocent, intelligent and strong nanny. The voice of the stranger on the phone is that of Lance Henriksen, while the strange physicist is played by Tommy Flanagan. Also presented: Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Congratulations to James Dooley for the original atmospheric music.
