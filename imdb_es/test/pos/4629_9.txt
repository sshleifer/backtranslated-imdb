Well ... What to say. <br /> <br /> I think I'll start with a confession. I have cried 4 times in my life. once when my dad died, twice because of a girlfriend in high school, and at the end of this movie. This film deals with the real problems of confrontation of 6 children in the school, which forces them to feel uncomfortably in view of everyone. I have never seen a movie that deals with the human emotional condition as well as this. Everything, from incest to incontinence, is covered here and I doubt there are many people who are safe from the feeling of familiarity with at least a couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> Start with a suicide. at 2:37 p.m. Then, without letting you know who was the one who died, the story begins to be told from the beginning of the day. follows the lives of 6 children from school until 2:37 pm. It is interchangeable, and edited with personal interviews of the 6 teenagers, lets you know everything about their lives. his loves, hatreds, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false confidence, self-hatred, corruption and arrogance. whose general result is a kind of "whodunnit" that tries to discover the identity of the suicide before it is revealed at the end of the film. Without spoiling anything, I must let you know. Do not feel cheated by the end. It contains a very important lesson. <br /> <br /> And now a warning. This movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. Many people left the cinema in the middle when I saw it. Disgusted by some of its contents. Or maybe it is that sometimes it is difficult to face the cold and hard truth of reality. This is how high school is for many people. I'm sure most would agree.
