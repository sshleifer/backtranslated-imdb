So, after years and years, I finally trace this movie! I was dying to see how I lived until my memories. I distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running through the mine, then, waiting behind two wooden boards crossed in the mine shaft, staring with a pale white face. This single shot was probably the most chilling of my childhood, I remember chills running down my spine. Seeing it now, obviously is not so scary, but subconsciously weird seeing the same images again. If someone wants a copy, send me a private message. <br /> <br /> The story itself is a fairly standard BCFF material. It is strange, however, that the message is not very clear on this occasion, there is no real morality as such (except that 'are the ghosts here to help us?' Or 'Do not be prejudiced against ghosts!') No there was not even an angle of greed / capitalist in terms of wanting to take advantage of the mine. However, a massive act of irresponsibility of the captain, encouraging the two children to really follow the vague implications of a ghost not only in a mine, but also in a new mine hole, which is totally dangerous. Then the captain encourages the children to go down a huge staircase, into the mines, simply because he thinks the ghost loves them too. It is also a bit strange for the ghost to choose the child to help the trapped adults, and not just to help the trapped adults to lead. Oh good.
