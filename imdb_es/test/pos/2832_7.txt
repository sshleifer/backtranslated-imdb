In general, you want this to be a better movie, but you have enough flashes of intense power to make it worthwhile. Peck made this film during the same period he did The Gunfighter, before he apparently decided it was a monument instead of an actor. A pity! He was a good actor, perfectly willing to face characters who were not very nice and to do them extremely well. The character he plays here is motivated and, when necessary, ruthless. Given the mission that has been assigned to the character, and the "men" with whom it must be fulfilled, these characteristics are essential. <br /> <br /> Without being a spoiler, think of this movie as an early and grittier example of The Dirty Docena of the genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this movie is a bit harsh, but it's atmospheric and intense and it definitely tells a story worth telling. It contains a good work of all the actors of the characters and even Barbara Payton becomes a credible performance. <br /> <br /> This is not often shown on TV, so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy. . Ahead! Spend an afternoon on it. It's worth your time!
