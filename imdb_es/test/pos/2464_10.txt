This film is sporadically transmitted, and I never really saw it, thinking it would be similar to Bruce Willis' film "In the United States", with the usual hackneyed story about American freedom, etc. But it was not like that; It was much more! <br /> <br /> Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent; (I've never seen him in a movie that he has not loved, even if the script is bad, because he's very talented). Kathy Bates is the dominant mother and does a great job. The real surprise is Emilio Estevez, who has not always been in the best films, but also directed this film. Please, no stereotype of the movie "Breakfast Club"; he's much better at this, and I'd like him to do more non-commercial and atypical Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The film is realistic, since we see Emilio at home from Vietnam, during Thanksgiving Day. Kimberly Williams is passable as the sister, who feels she is "dishonored and ashamed" by the returning soldier, her brother; it is quite far from the family and, especially at this time in the history of the USA. UU., This story is VERY relevant. <br /> <br /> I learned a lot about post-traumatic stress, and you will really have empathy with this. character; This is not a violent journalistic portrait, like "Platoon", for example, it is more a study of characters, which leaves us even more intrigued and worried about the effects of the war, especially when considering the young age of the soldiers who they are victims With today's violence, it is rare for a movie to make one feel truly sad and to shed a tear; This does, and deserves recognition.
