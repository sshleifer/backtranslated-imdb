It's strange that lesser-known films sometimes end up among the best you've ever seen. This movie has all the elements of a modern standard thriller, pistols, techno, bad, cash, etc. and yet, it stands out from its average in Hollywood. I would attribute it to two very charismatic people. Christopher Walken has great confidence and Lorraine Bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women I've seen on screen. Another important reason why this film stands out is because the stage moves to Jamaica after the beginning. The Jamaica resort is so beautiful that you wish you had been sitting by the pool at night, with a Run'n'Coke. . . I know I did it. I am very happy to have seen this movie, it was too good to get lost!
