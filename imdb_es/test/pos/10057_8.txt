Nikki Finn is the kind of girl I would marry. Never boring, always thinking positively, good with animals. Well, as one critic wrote, a little bit of peroxide, lipstick and eyebrows (only Madonna could get away with it). But that's why I love Nikki Finn, she's not your average girl. She makes things happen, it's always exciting to be around, and always honest. Sure, she steals, but she does not steal or murder (unless you're willing to do it). She knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be obeyed. She knows what to take and what can not be stolen. If you need a favor from her, she is 100%. In short: she knows how to enjoy life. Nikki is always loving (that's why she has a good relationship with wild animals), and she is completely dedicated to those she loves and who love her. <br /> <br /> Who is that girl? She is the girl for me.
