Putney Swope is the story of a symbolic black man on the board of directors of a large advertising company that has accidentally been elected Chairman of the Board when the owner of the company staggers to try to stutter an idea that apparently was quite excited . . Putney, of course, takes his new role seriously and dismisses almost everyone in the agency, hires a new team (all black, except a white man) and proceeds to deploy the most offensive commercials without a PC that one can ask . for. Now it's a pretty motley team that has and, in spite of that, they somehow manage to succeed while they win the money. I like more the scene in which potential advertisers are being released from bags of cash and then they are told to "get out". And your commercials will follow them, like it or not. The story is good but, of course, the highlights here are the unpleasant commercials themselves, especially the "Face Off" acne cream. This is quite old-fashioned, but it's still a fun movie full of fun moments. Robert Downey Sr. worked for an advertising agency that was doing experimental ads at that time and I think this was his middle finger for the Madison Avenue agencies. Very good and very damn funny. 8 out of 10.
