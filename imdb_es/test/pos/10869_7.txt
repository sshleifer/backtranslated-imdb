I learned one thing: you have to take this movie as a funny vintage comedy, if you do not want to be disappointed. The movie is nice because it's a delicious comedy. I think the excess of exaggerations hurt him: the too glorified Monica Bellucci appears in a few scenes and is not as good as they wanted to let you believe. It sounds unnatural, false: the best actress in this movie is Sabrina Impacciatore, who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines with Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very, very good: the most promising young Italian actor, according to me. Daniel Auteuil looks like Napoleon, but I preferred other actors. Therefore, the most promoted performances were also the worst. <br /> <br /> The costumes and the production design are fine: of course, the films of the American era are more precise about these things because they have bigger budgets, but the Italian skill rewards the lack of money. A good period comedy, in short, with a first-class casting (except Bellucci and Auteuil).
