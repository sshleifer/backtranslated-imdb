This movie was sadly underestimated, but it proved to be truly exceptional. When I entered the theater I did not know anything about the movie, except that a friend wanted to see it. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the quality of the film. I could not imagine Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance really exemplifies his character. This film is exceptional and deserves our monetary support, unlike many other films. For me it is not easy to recommend any film, but in this case I strongly recommend that everyone see it. <br /> <br /> These movies are really exceptional!
