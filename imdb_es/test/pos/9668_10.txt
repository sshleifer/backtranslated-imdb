This is a brilliant series in the same Simpsons line. Following a family as they go through life and problems, etc. Something less realistic than the Simpsons, talking to a baby and a dog? Family Guy goes where SImpsons or Futurama does not dare, passing by sick jokes and rude jokes. And believe me, it works! Almost all the gags hit the mark and will have you in stitches (especially the random and frequent flashbacks!) When my brother showed me this for the first time, I was not hooked, but after some episodes I was hooked. You will be 2. 10/10 for a truly brilliant show. Congratulations to Seth Macfarlane for bringing this show to life. :)
