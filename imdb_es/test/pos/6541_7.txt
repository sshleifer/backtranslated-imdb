I guess everyone, it does not matter if we're car fans, we like the sound of a Dodge Challenger as it growls along the road, the noise a Chevy 57 makes when it screams ecstatically when it bends around a corner and, More that nothing, the explosion of sound like a classic vehicle burst into flames as it explodes. I'm not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination, but any of the above really speeds up my engine! The importance of transport in the cinema can not be denied. It has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences in early cinema (looking out the window almost like a moving image and the idea of ​​being transported to a different time / space). But the car is still the most popular and the most luvedo, even has its own genre: the automotive genre. A genre that focuses exclusively on the beauty of cars. In effect, it's just porn! Car porn! And I'm not talking about that rather unpleasant documentary on Channel 4 in which men actually had sex with cars. Whatever your car floats ... I guess. Continuing ... while RUNNING ON EMPTY is not as pornographic as VANISHING POINT (Richard C. Sarafian, 1971), for example, with its close-ups of the car in motion, all its bumps and curves (!), This does not mean that the car is not the main focus of this film. In fact, the cars themselves become characters (more on this later). They are objectified and fetishized as much as women, in fact, maybe even more. And holy saints, are these cars something? Are all the cars in this movie (besides the ones in the background) just beautiful? Works of art, there is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> As I was saying, these incredible cars are, in a way, given to the characters themselves. In fact, you start to sympathize with the car! SPOILER ?? In particular, during the scene in which the car is being smashed and burned SPOILER OVER. This has become almost a convention of the automotive genre. the evil 1978 Plymouth Fury of CHRISTINE (John Carpenter, 1983), the custom of Satan Lincoln Mark III in THE CAR (Elliot Silverstein, 1977), the ingenious and small Mini Coopers of THE Italian JOB (Peter Collinson, 1969) to the friendly Volkswagen Beetle in THE LOVE BUG (Robert Stevenson, 1968) and, of course, each DEATH RACE 2000 (Paul Bartel, 1975) and even WACKY RACES (1968-1970), all of which had their own character. Ironically, however, this emphasis on the car often exceeds (!) The human characters! And this is certainly the case of RUNNING ON EMPTY, in which only a human character (the blind character who drives his car with his hearing instead of sight) has some kind of dimension, the rest are very common characters. These are all your stereotyped Australian teenagers of the 1980s; Big hair, annoying accents and none of which would look out of place in NEIGHBORS, especially the look of Kylie Minouge. But who gives a damn? It's about car racing and crashes! That's! If you do not like it, you're really seeing the wrong genre. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the cars are undoubtedly the point of sale of this film, and the best that can be done. They are fast; very fast! And we're not talking about the rather annoying technique that some movies seem to use to record the "speeding" of the car at about 40 mph and then accelerate it. Oooh no! Not with this movie, no. These cars are advancing at high speed in real time? No fancy editing tricks here. Then, we have speed. Check. What about the crashes? Check, check, check! While there are no cars crashing EVERYWHERE in the style of BLUES BROTHERS (John Landis, 1980), when the cars collide in this movie, they certainly collide! It seems that they use gunpowder or something similar to build the cars as a small blow and KABOOM are on fire. It reminded me of something of THRILLER: AN IMAGE OF CRUEL (Bo Arne Vibenius, 1974) in that sense. <br /> <br /> Among these simply stunning scenes (especially the beginning and the end) there are quite a few scenes that slow down everything that is done and, in my opinion, do not manage to add much to the film. Note: more explosive cars are needed! However, there are a couple of exceptions here, which are great scenes? SPOILER especially the attempted rape scene. <br /> <br /> So, in general, this is a men's movie! A child's movie! Full of vroom vroom vrooming cars around the interior and a couple of boobs thrown in good measure too. I would recommend this little movie to anyone, even if they are enthusiastic cyclists (!)? It's a great movie in which you can turn off your brain, sit in your leather chair and put the whole volume. I will give you 3.5 luvs of 5 luvs ?? Bruuuuum! ?? Amazon are selling this for only £ 2 ?? It is a real bargain, although the DVD lacks special features.
