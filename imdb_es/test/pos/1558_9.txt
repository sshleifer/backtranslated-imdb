Fantastic movie! Wow - this is really a gift. I can not believe I discovered a movie jewel. <br /> <br /> A pretty girl who travels to South Florida meets an older, more friendly couple with an RV, after she has an apartment at a rest stop. However, she learns that things are not as they seem and the couple gets a bit creepy after spending some time on the road with them. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the place was as perfect for their parts as you think you are seeing this happening in real life in front of you. <br /> <br /> The newcomer Emily Grace did a fantastic job as the very cute, but somewhat shy, Alice. Emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see how she came to the situation that develops in the film. I'm sure we'll see Emily in more movies in the future. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others have said, the lighting and photography in this were simply perfect. The editing was also done well: the correct way to assemble images of the road to give you the feeling that you are traveling together with the cast on your road trip. <br /> <br /> I did not see it on the big screen, but I can only urge everyone to go out and see it. More movies like this are * exactly * what we need. <br /> <br /> SF
