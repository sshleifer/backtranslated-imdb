Two actors play rival gang members in three films, the end of which is a science fiction movie, which strangely assents to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick and the anime, all at the same time. The robots are actually called "replicants", a reference to Dicks Blade Runner (you can also find several visual allusions to the movie) and the bad boy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation by using a compulsory drug to "Heterosexual". love is fleeting, and homosexual love is eternal "... martial arts fights ensue, a first for films of the dead or the living." The hilarious climax involves the two conductors who become a winged robot with a gigantic phallus per head, personifying the "destruction", which has been the path of both characters until now, their individual minds and then their literal heads function as something like testicles.The film ends with the mayor of his jazz game free boy lackey while the robot apparently knocks down a wall around him, the mayor's last words "Oh f * &%", followed by a quick fading to black, a part of me felt cheated, a part of me confused, but mostly I was laughing, but a lot of the movie is pretty boring, the best scenes include the movie, while the rest is too slow Takashi Miike has always mined the sexual motives of male violence in action movies, and this film, with the exception of "Gozu", reinforces this theme more than any other. Sex and violence are two pretty basic topics, but like Cronerberg (to whom jazz interludes can be a tribute to Ala Naked Lunch), Miike can show where the two connect, with a hilarious and strangely cohesive effect.
