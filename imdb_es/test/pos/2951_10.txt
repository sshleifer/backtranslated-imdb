This is a really great movie! It makes you think of your parents. How we all have fragile relationships that we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we must remember to open up and show our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely watch this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they post my comment, how strange. Generally, online comments should be short, and here I am asked to write more. Well, I went to see the movie with my parents, I thought that later they would want to talk about their parents, but my father always wanted to talk about himself and the things in his life that he feels he made a mistake, which was unusual, my father he's not a reticent man, but I was surprised he wanted to talk about the mistakes he thinks he made. Mike and Kitty came to the film to do a question and answer session and there was a fun time when my dad was talking to Mike, while my mom was talking to Kitty! I really just ignore my last prayers to fill in this comment, and just remember '51 Birch Street, 'go see it.
