My 5 year old daughter is very interested in the Barbie movie series. I have had mixed feelings about it: I did not want her to buy the whole picture of Barbie-doll stuff, and I recognized that movies are a marketing strategy to convince young girls to buy more dolls and earn more money for Mattel. This morning, although she asked me to watch this movie with her, and, being a lazy Saturday morning and with not much else to do, I accepted. I do not know if the movies have been made to help market the dolls, which seem to be losing their appeal a little from what I've heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies (or, more likely, a little bit. In both cases, I have to admit that, to my surprise, it was not so bad. <br /> <br /> It's a funny and imaginative story, full of magical places and people and memorable characters (both good and evil.) Essentially, Annika ("played" by Barbie) has to find a way to build a "wand of light" to reverse the wicked spells of wizard Wenlock, who among other things has turned his sister into a flight Horse and his parents in stone. Animation here was pretty good, not the caliber of Disney (if you think Disney is the standard to aspire to), but overall it's pretty good, and although the movie is obviously designed for young girls instead of middle-aged men, still There was enough twists and turns to make me wonder how everything would turn out. It is true that there were some gaps in the story, or at least some logical inconsistencies, but once again one must remind the target audience, that they really would not think of such things. This is a decent family movie. 7/10
