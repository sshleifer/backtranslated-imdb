I had never heard of the architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this nearly two-hour documentary, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the poor neighborhoods of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia, where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton and La Jolla, California, as well as to New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families, including his wife Esther, who refused to grant him a divorce and his daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel includes members of his family. Louis also has another half sister, Alexandra Tynge, from his father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a fellow architect. Louis's passion was his art.
