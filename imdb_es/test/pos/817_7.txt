I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a group of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He preceded it with how amazingly amazing he thought it was and how funny it was and, in the context of his explanation, it was HILARO. I can see how it would be detrimental to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the movie that made me laugh so much that I thought about urinating. They do not come until after the middle point, but when they do, oh God ... you will die. Oh, and Jim Brown is brilliant. It's not in much of the movie, but when it's there, you know whose movie it is. Naturally, the best line of the movie (and the funniest) is yours; You will know when you hear it.
