After seeing this movie, let's say, about 8 times, the story line has never boring me. Each character has its own distinct personality and its own views of "love". This movie has timeless, almost realistic love lessons. Filled with philosophies about love, a striking soundtrack and great actors, that's why I would call it a classic.
