For just making a few movies with his life the great deceased Chris Farley. Farley died in late 1997 and will be missed mainly by his co-star Tommy Boy, David Spade. Since the lame Police Academy 4 Spade has really done well with his film career. Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we see him. From appearing on Saturday Night Live to Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Beverley Hills Ninja, Almost Heroes, Billy Madison and Dirty Work. I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career. Tommy Boy was his best in my case and I would like to see it again and again and laugh at the same part every time. Thanks Chris Farley.
