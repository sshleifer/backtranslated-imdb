"Hit and Run" is a devastating story starring the always wonderful Margaret Colin as a society lady who "has it all" until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene. Hence the title. The tragedy is that she will ask for help and come back, but she is scared by passers-by who think the batter left the scene. This was done in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there would not be a story. <br /> <br /> Colin's guilt and anguish is palpable and makes him act so strangely that a detective stands to his right. far. His lies sink deeper and deeper into a hole that hates itself, which makes a bad situation worse. <br /> <br /> This is a very stimulating story, and you can not help but feel this. the lady's pain, wishing she would just clear up. <br /> <br /> Like a television movie, thanks to Colin and a solid script, this is a television movie far above average.
