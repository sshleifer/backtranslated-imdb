A late concert release, the Rush-in-Rio DVD is convincing and disappointing. This elegant set of two discs shows Rush at its best. After 30 years of honing their unique sound, it's great to have this record from one of the most talented rock bands in history. <br /> <br /> The concert features more than two dozen songs, a documentary and three songs with multiple songs. - viewing at an angle. Packaged in a double-fold holder with a sleeve and a small insert, it has a very good price for the amount of material it contains. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Rush from the late seventies to the early eighties, and this DVD comes in big, with half the program highlighting songs from that era. I will not list the songs, in case you want to be surprised. If you attended the Vapor Trails tour, you will know what will be played. <br /> <br /> Playing in Rio before his most numerous audience, Rush pleases the whole world. In fact, that was one of the first things I noticed that was peculiar in this show. Throughout most of this two-hour concert, you listen and see the crowd, singing and dancing to the beat of the music. At first, it's encouraging to see that fans give Rush a well-deserved answer. But after several songs, I was ready to listen and see more of the band and less of the crowd. This is by no means a blow from the Rio crowd. More power for them! It is a criticism of the final edition of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my second and main reason: "I hate it." The video editing is terrible in my opinion. Except for the multi-angle view bonus cuts, the whole show is a frenzy of visual chaos. It's as if the director wanted to see how spastic he could do it. I count the changing angles of the camera, on average, between every one and four seconds, constantly! After about three or four songs, my head and my eyes were ready for a break. Which is a shame, because I would have liked to have sat in the whole show, as I could do in the concert last year. Maybe this quick edit is the latest fad of concert DVDs, but I really think it's a nuisance and detraction from the overall experience. As said before, I would not mind a song or two, but all the visual aspect of this record is rushed or RUSH. It's really ironic, because all the previous concert clips I've seen from Rush, mainly from Moving Pictures, are strictly recorded, with little change from one side to the other. It's almost boring, visually speaking. This DVD has taken it to the other extreme. I know that many fans of Rush dyed in wool will disagree with my statements, but it's just my impression. <br /> <br /> The conclusion: if you are a fan of Rush, I will buy this DVD regardless of my criticism, or any other. I would still have bought it after having read my comment. Just do not expect a "normal" concert. Who knows, the things mentioned above may not bother you.
