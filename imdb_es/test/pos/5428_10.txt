This is a masterpiece. 'The Big Snit' is a crazy, strange, hilarious and eventually moving look at an old marriage and its quiet life, which discuss cutting and scrabble while a nuclear war continues on the outside. Everything in this great animated short film stands out as memorable: the trembling of the wife, the aspiration, the husband saw the fetish (watch those funds!), The very verbal cat, the insane game, the "informative" news anchor, the "beautiful" accordion serenade and the touching and memorable ending. I am very happy to have found 'The Big Snit', which is undoubtedly one of the best cinematographic works ever produced.
