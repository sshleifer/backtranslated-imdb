When a bomber, a patricide, a pornographer and a crazy motorcyclist, along with other forms of social scum, have had enough of their shit-infested cell, they see a rat and look for the hole. Escaping from the wastewater to the group of 9 souls, take advantage of your new freedom and go to civilization. What follows then is not surprising. Complete chaos and terror continue in their wake. It seems that each one has some pending issues to attend to. <br /> <br /> Based on The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is, by far, one of the 5 best movies I've seen this year. Running at approximately 2 hours 9 SOULS will deliver a story so powerful that it will literally take your breath away. The beautiful, but subtle, use of the sides of the rolling country adds the realism that is expected from this story. The vision of director Toshiaki Toyoda (Blue Spring, Porn Star) is completely mind-boggling as he implements a sense of compassion towards the characters. As fast as each character captures their dream, it is as fast as it is plucked from them. Now, the entire responsibility for the success of this film should not rest solely on the shoulders of the director, but also the accessories should go to the actors. This movie was full of excellent performance from top to bottom. Ryuhei Matsuda (the son of Miyuki Matsuda of Audition) offers a stellar performance, and seems to bring some concern to their mothers to the screen. <br /> <br /> I must also give support to the Artsmagic DVD. This is the sixth movie of them that I have seen now, and they seem to improve more and more on each DVD. The quality of the sound is perfect and the image; Clean and crunchy It is very annoying to try to see a film with a too dark transfer, so the discs of these cats are nice. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie will soon receive the status of masterpiece from viewers around the world. Keep an eye on 2005 for 9 SOULS; It's a really amazing movie to watch.
