I liked this movie. Many people call him "Sabrina the feminist teenager". They do it with many films in which Melissa Joan Hart is. However, it really surprised me in this movie because I was very good with Mary, who is fighting for justice when they rape her roommate. You could say that Hart was extremely determined in this movie and showed himself. I also liked Lisa Dean Ryan as Mary's roommate. She was very effective in making me feel sorry for her character after she was raped. Josh Hopkins was as good as the cocky and selfish rapist. Lochlyn Munro played her character convincingly. The acting in this movie is better than in most television movies, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> However, the movie was quite predictable. Also, I expected more from the end, it was too abrupt. The delivery could have been better. But the actions and the general plot compensate for these problems.
