I just saw it in an advanced projection. I have not read the book, but I heard many good things about it. <br /> <br /> The movie was absolutely fantastic, very moving. With a roller coaster of emotions you connect totally with the characters. Shaun Toub was great, it was a complete departure from his usual roles, and his performance for those who understand Persa / Dari was amazing. <br /> <br /> One thing is that Khaled Hosseini really loved the movie that is Unusual for book adaptation films. Even after watching the movie several times, "I was sobbing." <br /> <br /> Also the animation of the introduction was exquisite, with names that are displayed as if they were Persian calligraphy, very unique! Sometimes, the translation did not convey the message clearly, but in general it was a great movie.
