My wife and I saw this when we were 17 years old. The only good thing my father did (he made us enter). This is "our movie" and the music is "our songs". Michelle's song is "our" song. Yes, today, it is a crime to show the children naked on the screen, but we were fucking at 16, why not these children? The film is: the rich child impregnates the poor girl, then the rich dad steals it at the end, after she gives birth in conditions of impoverishment. She is left alone with the child. It is a story of love and a story of "growing up". The music is fantastic, and the story is one that anyone could relate to. It may be that one day this will be released on DVD.
