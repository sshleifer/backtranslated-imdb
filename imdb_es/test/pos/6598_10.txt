I must say that this has to be the best documentary I've ever seen. First I say the movie at my friends' house, and I did not have the opportunity to finish seeing it. From that moment, I spent my free time trying to find the movie. I never found it, but on my birthday, my friend, who knew I had more difficulty finding the movie, received it as a gift. Sean Penn does a great job of narrating the documentary. I loved how he told the story of each of the Z-Boys and the history of Dogtown. I have been to Venice and the surrounding area many times, and I had never known what had happened until I saw the documentary. I did not have the opportunity to see the film itself, and I heard that it was not even close to what the documentary was. I do not know if I really want to see the movie, but who knows.
