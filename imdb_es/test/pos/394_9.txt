I enjoyed this film, which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love and hate relationships, along with interspersed action scenes and some joyful moments in which the men of the mountain oppose the harsh discipline of the army. All the main characters are well fused. It is true that John Wayne or Robert Mitchum could probably have taken the lead role as well, but Victor Mature certainly presents himself as a stubborn Tarzan fight. He reminds me of his cinematic role as Samson, another difficult man, but not impossible to tame. <br /> <br /> The men of the mountain in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism, since the era of the men of the mountains of the pure trappers ended 20 years earlier, with the collapse of the populations of beavers Western, as well as the fashion market for beaver skins. This story supposedly takes place in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War. Judging from the volcano at the bottom of the opening scene (probably Mt. Lassen), the fiction fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the Cascades, since we never see any other civilians. However, there is a lot of contradictory evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana. Red Cloud, the war chief who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fort, is the very name of a very famous Sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 1865-66 to exterminate the newly built army forts in Wyoming and Montana. It is mentioned that Fort Laramie (east of Wyoming) is not too far from the fictional fort. The Tribe of the Assiniboine Plains is mentioning how to join Red Cloud. This aspect of history, then, has a general resemblance to historical fact. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting to observe certain similarities between the plot of this story and that of John Ford's "Fort Apache". In both cases, we have a strong commander who was recently assigned to his first border post with Native American problems. He underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries, considering them little more than cannon fodder to promote his career. In both films, he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy. Also in common, the green horn commander resents a subordinate who has a long experience with local Native Americans and wants to tell him what is prudent to do and not do. . In both films, we have a budding romantic relationship between a woman very close to the heart of the commander and a subordinate, which the commander does everything possible to stifle. Clearly, the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to be completed. <br /> <br /> I also see certain similarities with "The Misfits". The soldiers, in general, including the commander, are a kind of misfits (as one of them admits): they mostly have "problems" or are raw recruits with no experience in the fight against Native Americans. Apparently, the commander's wife is the only woman. in or anywhere near this fort, therefore, is intrinsically maladjusted to a husband who is unsure of his future in the military. Trappers, in turn, are also maladjusted, since they do not really want to accept military or civil discipline, but they are isolated. from their previous free-spirited lives by the recent antagonism generated by the army by Red Cloud. <br /> <br /> Finally, we can also compare this story with Anthony Mann's later film "The Far Country," starring Jimmy Stewart. In Stewart's In this case, you can choose to be a lonely cowboy at the end. But Mature's character does not have a new way of being her own boss. Red Cloud has made life outside the army in this region too dangerous. contemplate. In addition, he has an obsession with the Commander. 'wife.
