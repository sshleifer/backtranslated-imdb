Wow. This movie is the voice of a climbing generation. Director Sam Keith takes us into the darkest depths of man's soul, where we find love, life and rope. Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick), tired of the world, follows his heart and his anchors through a cerebral journey to find sanity in a post-apocalyptic Colorado. Instead, Telly encounters confrontation in Don (Jason Bortz), the embodiment of machismo and a zeitgeist of the weaknesses of the humanities. The epic film reaches an escalation in a skill competition that will make even the strongest spectators feel uneasy at dizzy heights. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all: the top off-the-rope, Top -Provide in the gym, clipping shorts and sleeveless flannel shirts, amazing climbing images (some so good! you see it 2 or 3 times!), attacks of bears and snakes. 8 out of 10 because I wanted the romance to develop a little more. It seemed as if the movie was leading to a spicy sex scene with the high chord between Telly and her new lover, but, unfortunately, it would not fit the hour and a half already full of emotions. <br /> <br /> The fans of Cliffhanger and Mission Impossible II will find that this movie is a diamond in the rough. In general, if you are ready to challenge your vision of the world about humanity and climbing, this is the movie for you 1
