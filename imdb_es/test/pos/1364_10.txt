Believe me when I say that this show is simply very funny. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe, who travels from city to city taking part-time jobs, chasing women and learning everything he can about life. Kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever created. Take everything to the extreme, and only laughs out loud every time. From his constant interminable search to study life, to the little things that explode instantaneously in matters of life or death. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things about this program is simply the extremely extreme expressions and reactions of Kintaro. . Spend a lot of time in several super deformed modes like Dragon Half or Trigun. Other times, in less than 0.1 seconds, his face will become not only serious, but expressions of life or death in the style of manga fighters, like a weightlifter trying to bench press a new record. It is funny. <br /> <br /> If that was not enough, the writing is excellent and the interpretation in English could not be better. Kintaro's English VA is simply perfect and will make you roll when you're not even saying anything. However, the only thing that needs to be mentioned is that this is undoubtedly a series of Ecchi. Practically defines the word. If you're an adult anime fan who can laugh at movies like American Pie, you'll love it. <br /> <br /> - Rirath_com
