This film must be seen for music, which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Obviously, the original soundtrack is not exactly high fidelity, but there are many excellent versions available in classical music selections. The cantata can be appreciated by itself, but having seen the movie helps. <br /> <br /> The story itself is a pretty standard Soviet anti-German propaganda of war. A funny anecdote is that Stalin was more than eager to buy time by appeasing Hitler at the beginning of World War II that Eisenstein was seconded to a German film for a short time, as a penance. <br /> <br /> Prince Alexander Nevsky (revered as a saint by the Russian Orthodox), having earned his nickname by defeating the Swedes on the Neva River, holds the Russian resistance against an invasion of the Teutonic Knights, and concludes his victory with a severe warning to other possible invaders. <br /> <br /> An interesting scene: Alexander sees a convoy of Russians being taken as slaves by Mongolian soldiers, and does nothing to stop this, since the Teutonic knights are his priority. The historical Alexander Nevsky paid homage to the Mongolian kanes, like his father before him, while working to consolidate the future independence of his kingdom.
