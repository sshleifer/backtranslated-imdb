a very good episode, although it is not such a devastating ending as the end of season 1. The idea of ​​turning it into a flashback of Desmond worked very well, and Henry Ian Cusick was fantastic, perhaps with the best performance of the whole series , but my only complaint would be that the plot of Michael was very similar to a secondary plot, and after three minutes of the previous episode, I thought I would have more. But the strength of character and performance of Cusicks overcame him. The developments of the plot, as always, left more questions and then answers, like who are the others, something that we still do not know, and where they take Jack, Sawyer and Kate. What was the white light, what impact has it had? Are Locke, Eko and Desmond dead? how the hatch was destroyed around him. If they are, it would be a big mistake, since these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them and Terry O'Quinn has been fantastic in both series as Locke. An appropriate ending to a series better than the first.
