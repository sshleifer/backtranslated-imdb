From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a little while to recover from the beginning, at least for me, since I expected it to be an America Pie movie. But it was a bit different: a vague fun-loving guy who finishes high school and makes his own university, administering it accordingly. As you can expect, there are many parties and hot girls in bikini, but this movie did more than your average teen movie. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / partners to learn through freedom of expression and, finally, to "push the system". The humor was varied that I loved. The entire cast offered fantastic performances. Get it with a friend, it's a fucking crack!
