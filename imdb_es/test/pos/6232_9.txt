Maybe it's one of the first slasher movies that came out after Halloween (although they were made by Irwin Yabalans since Halloween), I must say, honestly, I found that "Tourist Trap" is more scary and fun. "Trap for tourists" is one of those quirks that you find from time to time, and you are left with the most pleasant sensation of surprise. I told them it was destiny, but one night I was at my local Blockbuster (one or two months before the business was closed) and I had nothing to get. Then I came across this movie, I think it looks like a laughable B-Movie, I rented it and took it home, boy, I was expecting a good scare. "Tourist Trap" appears like a bad movie, it definitely has its cheesy moments, but in the end you're having a lot of fun with that so you really care. <br /> <br /> The things that absolutely impressed me. most, and the things that made this movie one of the most terrifying I've seen, is the number one configuration. A horror movie without a good stage is not very funny, not here. I love it, I love it, I love the location, I feel we can relate to it, we almost feel like we've been there before. What makes it more spooky. Below are the characters, none of them is really stereotyped, and they all have a real personality. For example, they are not drug addicts, alcoholics, or even people obsessed with sex, they feel like normal young adults. Also, they look realistic enough, and then there's Chuck Connors. Who gives a great performance as Mr. Slausen, who we all like instantly because, again, it is so real that he feels like a good boy who believes grandpa we love. The last thing, and probably the most important thing that makes this movie terrifying is how we are made (to the audience) to jump to the middle of our seats and activate the rights, for the right reasons. For example, most of the time in horror movies, we mainly skipped due to a sudden change in the tone of the music, but in "Trap for tourists", get ready, that's not the case. With the perfect use of lighting, mannequins and rarity, you feel completely scared. Also, I love it because, although you can go a little over with some things, you still feel like this could happen. Which is exactly what a horror movie should do that takes such a ridiculous premise, and that is to make (the public) feel insecure and terrified. <br /> <br /> In general, in regards to any major problem, I do not have any. , just that its weirdness can be a bit too weird sometimes. However, in the end, "Tourist Trap" has a place close and dear to my heart, for being one of the few horror movies that make me turn on the lights and feel insecure to travel.
