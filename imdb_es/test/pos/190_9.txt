The fabulous photo by Sergei Urusevsky helps make this an impressive job. The initial scenes are as if one were flipping through a master photographer's album and, as the story begins to unfold, we crawl with the events that are shown and the beautiful look. Everything is well filmed, but there are several complete sequences that are simply impressive. Difficult to describe without 'spoiling', but suffice to say that one is a very intense scene during an air attack and that the lady stays behind and her lover's brother disagrees when sirens hiss and windows break . Another superimposes a spiral staircase and a rotating shot of treetops and even becomes a fantasy sequence. The realization of Soviet films of the first order.
