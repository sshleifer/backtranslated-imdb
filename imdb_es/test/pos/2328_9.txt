It is not the best plot in the world, but the comedy in this movie. Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this movie. Another fun guy is Rob Schneider, who will make you break with his segments with Ken Hudson Campbell who plays Buckman. Lauren Holly plays a probably more serious character in the cast as Lieutenant Lake. Bruce Dern is a great actor in this movie, probably playing the most serious character in the movie. The actor that I liked the most was Toby Huss as Nitro, all the electric shots that his character takes in the movie are very funny. <br /> <br /> The plot is a little irregular, about Lieutenant Commander Tom Dodge, who for years has wanted to send his own sub. When he finally has the chance, instead of a new submarine, he gets a rusty Sub Diesel from World War II, the Stingray. Your crew is not better, maladjusted from the United States Navy. It is then placed in a series of War Games, which shows how an old Diesel Engine can be operated against the current Nuclear Armada. Things still do not get better when he learns that his dive officer is actually a female officer, to see how women are doing on real submarines. To get the position of commander you want, you have to win the War Games and fly a Dummy Ship. <br /> <br /> The film fairs are quite good, in fact, I laughed non stop when I saw this movie in theaters I loved them when they were silent and with the bits of Buckman, and everyone's reaction to smell is funny <br /> <br /> In general, 9 out of 10, this movie is just fun to watch, it's good to have a movie. So, I hate movies that try to be 100% serious.
