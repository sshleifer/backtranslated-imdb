I saw the film at its premiere in North America (July 14, 2004) at the Fantasia Festival. I felt a little disappointed, since I was expecting a more epic film and with a cast in conjunction with Musa, the Warrior. Instead, the film concentrated only a much smaller number of characters. Still, the film was solid, reflective and visually intriguing. There were slightly discordant changes in the dominant and reflective tone of confused loyalties, intrigue and blood, versus the lighter and extravagant martial arts sequences. It almost seemed as if the filmmakers could not decide if the film was supposed to be a martial arts "movie" or a historical epic. The story touches very well on the need for loyalty to the need to adapt to new situations. Is it really worth your life and that of your friends to be loyal to your teacher or does there come a time when you must submit to the winds of change? Is there perhaps greater courage to leave the old forms for new? How do you decide? These questions are raised in this film, and ironically, there is a suggestion that the given answer may, in fact, be the wrong one.
