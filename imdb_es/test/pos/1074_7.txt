Actually it is not about wine. No, the real objectives of Nossiter are those that would rationalize and assimilate the peculiarities of local production (wine) for commercial purposes. For this he has made an excellent objective film. The independent, enthusiastic, clumsy, emotional and imperfect wine producers are juxtaposed with the Americans and the austere, austeuropean, fine means of communication: the art of winemaking versus the manufacture of laboratory products and oriented to the market. It is an open program that does not reach any conclusion. <br /> <br /> Nossiter's film is sometimes irritating to watch: the cameras are not hidden or fixed, in any way. There are also many subtitles and subtitles to be devoted, often too little time on screen. <br /> <br /> However, he beats Michael Moore in the game that Moore can not play anyway. The characters speak for themselves and, therefore, condemn them. It's worth a visit 7/10
