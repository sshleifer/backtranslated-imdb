I must have seen this on television when it was first broadcast a few decades ago. I thought it was brilliant at that moment, and as I remember a lot now, I may have been right. Although I have lived in London and in the surrounding area, I can not call myself a Londoner and I do not know him well. Who do you dedicate other than taxi drivers? Once the viewer understands the premise; that here is a group of men who try to learn what apparently can not be learned and ascend to the status of demigods, then the rest is pure joy. The characters are well contrasted, their family relationships are equally diverse and they look so different affected by the events of the film. Do not think that this is a documentary, it's pure drama, and The Knowledge is one of the characters. I've never seen anything like this movie, before or after. Look at it!
