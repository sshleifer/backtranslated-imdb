So we saw this on DVD in our apartment here in Paris. We are all here in an exchange program. We all laughed so hard because so much of what was happening in the movie happened to us! I mean, yes, I'm sure part of that was pretty clich√©, but still, I know what I'm saying. <br /> <br /> I think I interacted more with the quiet boy (the Italian) than with Xavier because I am more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I'd like to have a hot roommate like Cecile de France. She looks like a great girl in the movie and really, after I saw her at the Cannes Film Festival last month. <br /> <br /> Now I think I want to go to Barcelona next summer after watching this movie. I also have to watch the sequel that just came out here in France.
