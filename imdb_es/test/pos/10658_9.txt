On June 14, 1905, during the Russian Revolution of that year, the sailors aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. Frustrated by the second-class treatment they receive, and more particularly by the meat infested with worms that are forced to eat, the ship's crew, led by the inspired Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), decides that the time is right for a revolution. And so begins Sergei M. Eisenstein's classic Russian propaganda, 'Bronenosets Potyomkin / The Battleship Potemkin'. <br /> <br /> The film itself is full of brilliant examples of stunning visual images: the glasses of a deposed ship captain. it hangs delicately from the side rope on which it had been thrown; the body of a deceased mutineer lies peacefully on the shore, the sign on his chest reads "KILLED FOR A BOWL OF SOUP"; shots close to the clenched fists of the hundreds of spectators who are finally fed up with the tsarist regime; a misguided baby carriage rounds the steps of Odessa as desperate spectators watch with great anticipation (this scene was "borrowed" memorably by Brian De Palma for a particularly suspenseful scene in his "The Untouchables"); Are the barrels of numerous canons sinisterly leveled towards the battleship Potemkin, outnumbered? <br /> <br /> However, the film itself is better analyzed. Not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes? but as one movie, and, in fact, each scene is enormously memorable. Although divided into five quite different chapters, the whole film flows beautifully; At no time do we find ourselves losing interest, and we do not doubt at all on which side we should sympathize. <br /> <br /> The movie is often called "propaganda", and that is exactly what it is, but this does not need to carry a negative connotation. 'The Battleship Potemkin' was produced by Eisenstein with a specific purpose in mind, and it accomplishes it perfectly in every way. Planned by the Soviet Central Committee to coincide with the twentieth century celebrations of the failed 1905 Revolution, it was predicted that 'Potemkin' would be a popular film in its home country, symbolizing the revitalization of the Russian arts after the Revolution. It is somewhat unfortunate, then, that Eisenstein's film has not performed well at the Russian box office, allegedly hit by Allan Dwan's 1922 Robin Hood movie in its first week and which lasts only for four short weeks. Luckily, despite being banned several times in several countries, 'The Battleship Potemkin' was more admirable abroad. <br /> <br /> The film also proved to be a successful vehicle for Eisenstein to test his theories of "montage". Through the quick editing and remote shots of the crowd of extras, the public can not sympathize with any individual character, but with the revolutionary population in general. Eisenstein briefly breaks this mold, however, in a scene in which Vakulinchuk flees from the officer of the ship that is trying to kill him, and, of course, during the famous Odessa Steps sequence, while our hearts beat with horror for the life of the unhappy child in the baby stroller that falls. The soundtrack that accompanies the version I saw, which largely presents the orchestral works of Dmitri Shostakovich, served wonderfully to increase the emotional impact of such scenes. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of the silent era, 'The Battleship Potemkin is a triumph of phenomenal cinematography, and is a significant part of film history. The highly exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there was never really any violent massacre in the Odessa Steps) have been recorded so completely in memory, that we are often not sure of the true story behind the events described. This is a great achievement.
