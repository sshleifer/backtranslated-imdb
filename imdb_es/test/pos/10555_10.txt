I think it's a great and a VERY funny movie. The story is very funny. The daughter Nicole brings her father Andre, in some very embarrassing situations. In an effort to impress the child of her dreams, the daughter pretends that her father is her lover. You just have to see it !! Heigl is charming like Nicole, maybe too charming; I'm not sure why I'd have to lie to hook someone up? Gerard Depardieu performs very well in this comedy film, it is very fun to watch. If you like comedy and the romantic movie you just have to see this !!! I think you can watch this movie many times and still you can laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> In an effort to impress the child of her dreams, the girl pretends that her father is her lover.
