I have seen this caricature as a child, a father, and now a grandfather. It's my favorite caricature. I love the characters, the little melodies and the very good drawings. I love the main song that appears throughout the cartoon. I think it's a beautiful little caricature. Everyone I have shown him to simply loves him. It's a shame that it opened on such a bad day (the Pearl Harbor attack). If it was not for the bad time, it would have been a great success. I hope to find a DVD of it because all the VHS tapes do not do it justice. <br /> <br /> I think that if someone shows your child, you will get the same result. They will simply love it. <br /> <br />
