The first time I saw this movie I saw it for the first time and I also bought an LP recording of the soundtrack. I liked it so much that I saw it again several times ... I can not understand why it was considered a failure. Julie Andrews was lovely in this movie, her voice was at its best and the costumes were beautiful! <br /> <br /> The film contains a bit of everything and although some of the scenes were a bit clumsy, they were still fun <br /> <br /> I recently discovered that I could get a copy in DVD format and the I ordered ... I was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences from the movie were not included in the DVD version. I asked.
