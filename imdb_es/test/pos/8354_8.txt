Another good Disney animation. The sequels are not always so big and tend to follow the same plot as the original. However, Tramp's son tries to savor the world outside the home and the family that knows and learns where he belongs. Being a scrap dog is not for everyone, er dog, but Scamp overcomes adversity. The voices of the various characters were excellent and were provided by several well-known actors such as Scott Wolf, Alyssa Milano and Mickey Rooney. Entertaining and a well-made family movie.
