A family travels through the Midwest. There is the widower Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and the little daughter of Ben K.T. (Geri Reischl) Then, go to a town called Hillsboro, where everyone acts more than strangely. Your car breaks down and you are forced to stay. They soon discover that a coven of witches has a spell over the city and is at the height of an incredible evil. <br /> <br /> The story is not so good. People simply solve things from nothing and simply discover where the witches are at the end. There are also a lot of lagoons that remain hanging at the end. The acting is pretty poor too. Bateman and Capri are bland and everyone else is almost the same. Only the old professionals Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones gives good performances. This movie still works. Abandon the blood and blood (there are some, but this is PG) and you manage to work with some very creepy visions and environments. The acting makes a lot of this difficult but it still works. Martin especially chews the stage in his role. I can not explain exactly why I like (more or less) this movie, but it worked on me. It's a kind of silent horror that is no longer done. Just a masterpiece, but this deserves to be rediscovered. A 7.
