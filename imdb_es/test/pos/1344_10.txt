It is difficult for me to explain this show to my adult friends. I have a lot of Shasta Daisy in the backyard that I lovingly call my "Chuckle Patch". My friends laugh at me and they look at me like I have 2 heads. It would be great to see this series on DVD for those of us who remember it fondly with our other childhood memories, or to show our friends that there really was a patch of laughter. Where children's television is compiled today with violent cartoons, characters that make magic or a talking sponge that lives in a pineapple under the sea, The Magic Garden was real in the respect that taught us good values. <br /> <br /> I will have fond memories of Carole and Paula, and of Chuckle Patch.
