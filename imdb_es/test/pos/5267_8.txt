Vidor shines as Judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family. His brother, David, is so oppressed by his father that it is a surprise that he can even tie his shoes, instead of asking Dad to do it for him. <br /> <br /> Other critics have already described the plot, so I will not do it again; However, I will point out that Nan, who is pregnant with David, is also married to him. This is not a pregnancy outside of marriage, which would have been horrible by the standards of 1921. The two are secretly married, but Nan's father, who was paid by David's father, breaks his marriage certificate. <br /> <br /> The scene of Nan's death, with Judith present, is a truly heartbreaking experience, and highly charged with emotion. It's worth watching the movie just for this scene, but there's a lot more to the plot than that; Why the hell are not modern movies made with the same attention to history?
