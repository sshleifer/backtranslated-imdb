Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a moving poignant starring Academy Award nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and the Harry Potter series, Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall, (Rupert Grint), a seventeen-year-old boy who is held captive in the heart of his mother, neurotic and neurotic, Laura (Laura Linney). After her school year ends, she decides to take a job with an intelligent, free-spirited, "heavy in the bottle" retired actress, Evie Walton (Julie Walters). The couple embarks on wonderful adventures, from camping to walking around the block, to simple conversations about life. Challenging the dominant mother, as well as the other on the road, the two develop a beautiful bond that revolutionizes their lives. <br /> <br /> The comic elements are perfect and precise, especially those of the British veteran, Julie Walters. . Brock uses his unique style to create an infamous and loving nature that first-time directors could only dream of. Directing is natural to Brock as he creates stunning images that break surfaces and immerse the viewer in an overabundance of worship and creation. Even the subtle score of unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourn accentuates the tone and manner in which Brock had no trouble generating. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney is always leaving her mark in the movies as she does as "Laura". The bossy and domineering mother is sometimes unbearable and with Linney in the lead, we are involved in that person. The complexity of his character could not have been portrayed more perfectly by anyone else. Rupert Grint separates from "Ron Weasley" and tries someone new. His performance is more sensitive than talkative, but Grint gives us someone new for a child performance and the viewer can enjoy it. But the highlight comes from actress Julie Walters, Oscar nominee, which gives "Evie" a life of its own. Even though the role is clearly one of the main ones, Walters is better presented in the support category, where I think she can simply take the prize home. "Evie" is a mixture of "Clementine Kruczynski" and "Mrs. Laura Henderson" with her free spirit and adorable person. Let's hope his role does not go unnoticed in this awards season. <br /> <br /> Driving Lessons is not an "out of this world" experience but a pleasant and enjoyable experience that any viewer could simply go back and learn something. about life, love and friendship that come in the shapes of the most beautiful colors and sizes. <br /> <br /> Grade: *** / ****
