I remember seeing this movie when it was released and I still remember the 'buzzing' that I felt when I left the cinema. Everything about this movie is magnificent! The music is first class and I still play the soundtrack after all these years. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie so many times and I still have yearning to see it again and again. Nicholas Cage was great and every time I see Cameron Dye in something today, I always associate him with this movie. It's a shame that the rest of the cast has not advanced much, but maybe that's part of the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> I will not make a criticism of the film school, since I am sure of everything. Analysts can find flaws if they wanted, but what I'm going to say is that this movie defined my teenage years and still continues to influence my life more than 20 years later. The film "feels" good and awakens emotions when you look at it (well ... it did it for me) and I can not recommend it enough for anyone who has not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> You either 'get' the movie or not! Those of you who 'understand' will be rewarded with a unique cinematic experience.
