2001: A space odyssey <br /> <br /> Is it a sermon? An account of the history of humanity? An exploration of man's futile attempts to advance technology only for technology to destroy it? Is it the fragile balance of time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacle of spectacular effects? A film that Kubrick did just to show us the unlimited possibilities of the film and present us with the truth that images are much more powerful than words? <br /> <br /> 2001: A space odyssey is all these things. One of the most interpretable films ever created, it is almost more fun to analyze and discuss the ambiguous design of the plot and the events of the film, than to really see it. But it is open to discussion intentionally; if Kubrick had explained the meaning of his wonderful 1968 classic (ranked # 22 on AFI's list of the 100 best movies ever filmed, my favorite personal film number 21 currently), and nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Director , Original script, Art The direction and the visual effects for which it won) would have lost half of its fascination, all its complexity and a good part of its cinematic value. We would only have technical ingenuity; which in itself is worth praising. <br /> <br /> Because each shot is worth taking the time to look at. And there is a lot of time. 2001 is very elegiac, and also coldly distant; separated. The emotional remoteness and the slow rhythm yield a perfect tribute to the unique visual experience; 2001 begins with the simian ancestors of humanity, who are updated from the scavengers of the planet to hunters and toolmakers after discovering a giant monolith in the middle of their home in the desert, then (in one of the most inspired from the history of cinema) like a bone. thrown into the air and becomes a satellite, jumping forward a couple of thousand years in space, where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the moon, and then the film follows a mission of space crew as they follow the signal of the monolith through space, accompanied. by his unworthy HAL computer, which attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew, before finally the only survivor is launched through space and time (in a flurry of colors induced by the drugs that probably gave the hippies a epileptic shock in the day) to age, die, and be reborn a "child-star". Whew <br /> <br /> This rhythm and emotional emptiness are also in stark contrast to the film's most ironic scene; The destruction of HAL. When the last explorer of the crew turns off the machine, bathed by the holy aura of the red light that Kubrick has always used as a reason for repetition, HAL singing a lovely melody, is a strangely emotional experience. And everything is genius. <br /> <br /> Other notable aspects of Kubrick's masterpiece is the memorable voice of HAL (a serene and sinister, Douglas Rain), the minimal use of dialogue (Kubrick relied wisely on his images to propel the film; give only banal and useless lines to their actors, the most famous being "Open the pod doors doors HAL"), satellites that dance in orbit to unorthodox music, and that first, impressive earthing; Slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of him, he played with the sound of explosive and triumphant horns. <br /> <br /> 2001 will always remain a mystery, and will always be a testament to the strongest point of cinema: images are more powerful than writing. It is all about one of the best legendary directors in the history of cinema, whose unique vision was always his. 10/10 <br /> <br /> "Open the doors of the HAL capsule bay" -2001: A space odyssey
