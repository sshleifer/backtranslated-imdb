The consequences of love: there is really something special in this movie, but it is very difficult to point out. It's a kind of love story, but not really one I've seen before. It has several themes of love throughout the film. The love of a man for a younger woman, the love of a younger man for his older brother, the mafia love for money at all costs, are just some of those that are intertwined in a story that makes you guess or, rather, not knowing where and how it will end. The cast is excellent, from Sophia, the mocking waitress, to the straight face of titta, the central character of the film. With a simple but affective work, the camera bounced on a constantly changing soundtrack that mixes low fidelity jumps with exuberant orchestral pieces. The style of the film changes perfectly with several styles without ever becoming disordered. Love has never seemed so diverse and powerful as the stories that tell us that resound to different conclusions. The director has married old and new in a rich Italian classic.
