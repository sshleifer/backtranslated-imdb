Sally and Saint Anne is a very funny movie. The first time my mom told me, I was 7 years old and Santa Ana had just been the Santa I had for my Holy Communion. My mom knew it, so she told me to look at this with her. I did it, and I've seen it many times since it's really fun. Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith Show was in it and Sally's grandfather was the guy who played Santa at Miracle On 34th Street. Then, there are also many actors that we have seen in television programs. There's a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house, and Sally keeps trying things with St. Anne to help raise money so they can keep the house. That includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brian who plays his older brother. This is a good and funny movie that I still love.
