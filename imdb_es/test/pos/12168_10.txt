It is a great achievement that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers can be simultaneously so insightful about homosexual and bisexual relationships and their struggles! <br /> <br /> "Pool Days" is about the discomfort of adolescence and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one. A story about experience and vulnerability! <br /> <br /> "A Friend Of Dorothy" presents a common dilemma that many gay and bisexual people experience at some point in their lives: the intense attraction to someone who is heterosexual. Examined sensibly, this story really touched me! <br /> <br /> "The Disco Years" shows another version of a non-winning situation: getting involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation, but also terrified of being exposed as something other than straight! A very enriching story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person! <br /> <br /> While these three stories will appeal to anyone who has a little empathy for others, psychologically it will train those who consider themselves homosexual, bisexual or seekers. Each story is edifying in its unique way!
