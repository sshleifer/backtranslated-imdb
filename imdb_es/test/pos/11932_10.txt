Sean Astin performs another incredible performance in "Toy Soldiers". He plays the very clever prankster, Billy Tepper, along with Wil Wheaton and Keith Coogan, who play their best friends, Joey Trotta and Jonathan "Snuffy" Bradberry. During a regular day at Saint Anselm's children's school, a group of dangerous terrorists take all children and teachers hostage and threaten to blow up the school if the leader, Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff), the father is not released of the United States. In prison, but these are not just ordinary children being taken hostage, most of these children are children of very powerful people in the United States and half of them were expelled from other schools before arriving in Saint Anselm . They are mouths and actions that can kill them. When the government is desperately trying to find a way to help, Billy, Joey, Snuffy and some other children decide to take matters into their own hands.
