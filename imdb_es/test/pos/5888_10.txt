In a film as successful as this, it is difficult to distinguish any factor. All departments work in perfect union to create one of the most moving human dramas ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The production is a tribute to the joint efforts of writers, producers, cast and crew. To name a few, Hugo Friedhofer's magnificent score is a subliminal marvel, Greg Toland's subtle but surprising photography, and William Wyler's incredibly effective direction combine with an ideal cast to create an American classic. <br /> <br /> The DVD version is a special gift to watch. What a pleasure to see "The best years of our lives" so beautifully preserved for generations to come enjoy.
