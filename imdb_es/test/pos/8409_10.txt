First of all, nothing compares to the original movie, but for the love of God, do not try. It's just a person's opinion of what might have happened after Rhett left Scarlett in Tara. On the one hand I thought it was a fantastic movie and I would like to add it to my GWTW collection. The landscape would only make me want to see the movie. Simply see this movie as an extension of the original and do not think that you are trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable, and you will enjoy it a lot. They really captured Scarlett's pampered selfishness in many of the scenes and can be seen in the longing in Rhett's appearance that he is clearly in love with Scarlett. The fact that he can recognize many of the actors in the film is another advantage, although some of them have only been seen on television. I always wanted them to have other children after Bonnie Blue died in the movie and this perfectly satisfied my need. <br /> <br /> Lore60
