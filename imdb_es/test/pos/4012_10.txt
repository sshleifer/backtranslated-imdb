This is probably my favorite television show. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! It always makes me laugh and feel good when I see this show. There is something about it that is surprising, difficult to describe. <br /> <br /> It seems that some or all of the episodes are also synchronized with the music albums. Here are some examples. (Episodes begin again when they end, but DO NOT play the ending credits until the end, but always play the opening credits.) With most episodes, the album plays once and the episodes are played twice, but some continue.) <br /> <br /> RADIOHEAD, PINK FLOYD, BOB Dylan. <br /> <br /> 2.02 'Double bogey' Kid A / OK Computer (the episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> 2.14 'Saturn' Kid A / Meddle / Shot Of Love <br /> <br /> 2.19 'World without Alex' Kid A / I wish you were here / Pablo Honey (the episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> There are clues in the episodes that tell you which albums to sync . Child A can synchronize with EVERY episode!
