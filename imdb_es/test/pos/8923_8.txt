This is an excellent film, full of complexity, themes and a great dialogue. The characters are well drawn, with Phil the biggest loser of all time. <br /> <br /> The character of Adam Haddrick is the cruelest thing I've seen on the screen since Adolf Hitler's performance of Alec Guinness in 'Hitler: The Last Ten Days'. "<br /> <br /> I just wish everyone could get away with it, but without revealing too much, there are some situations you can not lie about.
