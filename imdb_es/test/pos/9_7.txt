I've seen this story before, but my children have not. A child with a problematic past joins the army, confronts his past, falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor this time is perfectly interpreted by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with daily problems who lives an extraordinary conviction to save lives. After losing his team, he takes a teaching post in the next generation of heroes. The young recruit with problems is played by Kutcher. Although his scenes with the interest of local love are a bit stiff and do not generate enough heat to melt butter, congratulate Costner well. I never understood Sela Ward as the careless wife and I felt that I should want Costner to resign because of concern for his safety and not for his selfish needs. But its presence on the screen is a pleasure. The two non-accredited stars of this film are the Coast Guard and the Sea. Both powerful forces that should not be taken for granted in real life or in this movie. The movie has some slow points and could have used the 15 wasted minutes to strengthen the relationships of the characters. But it still works. The rescue scenes are intense and are well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact. This movie wins the applause of the public. And the applause of my two children.
