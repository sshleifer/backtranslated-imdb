full of action, with my favorite type of creature. I will not reveal anything if you have not seen it, because it is worth taking the time to sit down and unravel the mystery of things as presented in this film. sometimes it got slow and those were the moments when my mind wondered what, anyway, it does easily, but the humidity kept me quietly excited, where you keep it in your head instead of letting it out, probably the mood I was in at that moment. Effects and action sequences can be felt for occasional quiet moments. Of course, there are a lot of movies exactly like this, the film still has its own style and flavor, which anyway respect for independent horror films.
