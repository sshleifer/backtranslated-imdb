Okay, this does not compare to the explosive tempo of the opening sequence of the first part; nor to its visual shock value; nor, for that matter, the melancholic suspense of the second installment. No, it's surprisingly and refreshingly different (apart, of course, from the two main actors). The ironic futuristic scenario makes the characters address each other through genres and languages ​​with an almost gravitational force. The moment of conclusion of the impact is your choice of: a) Shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b) the sublimation of violence in homoerotic; c) humorous detonation of an impossible accumulation. Everything up to that moment is even less unequivocal. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for indiscriminate moviegoers who do not mind following foie gras with a hot dog; Caution to the most refined palates.
