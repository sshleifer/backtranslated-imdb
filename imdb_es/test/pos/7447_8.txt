I only saw it then. It's pretty amazing The fights are fantastic and the magic is really great! It's totally like a video game in parts, with an incredible hand-to-hand combat. <br /> <br /> This film is for fans: "For those who loved this world once before and spent time with them, friends, get together again and dedicate your time ..." In addition to this sinister opening, The story was not very difficult to follow, and I have never played a game of Final Fantasy. I think it's worth being familiar with role-playing games in general; A little knowledge of the genre helps you better understand something about it. However, I think that if you pay attention and accept what the film throws at you, it is quite easy to understand. There are many things that are not explicitly explained, and if you demand that it be, then you will probably be confused and irritated. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie is like falling into the middle of a big saga, and having to put together as many puzzles as possible. I like that approach; you are trapped in the mystery and confusion that all the characters go through. But like I said, just accept. If a strange thing about the talking red lion shows up and starts kicking assholes and taking names, and the other characters just say it's an old friend, accept it and move on; You do not need a biopic flashback, or a sit-me-down that says everything. You are an observer here, of something beyond your experience and understanding. <br /> <br /> So: great graphics and animation, excellent voice acting, great videogame style music, history and characters, and maybe some of the best fights you'll see in a while. It's worth seeing, and while it's for the fans, it's perfectly accessible for people like me who have never played the games.
