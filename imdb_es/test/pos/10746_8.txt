Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan) is back, having rid the seas of the dreaded Pirate Lo. Back on the ground, he is assigned to the police force, where he must clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb. Along the way, he finds himself trapped in the fate of several Chinese patriots who seek sympathy and support for his revolutionary cause. The Manchu Chinese government persecutes these revolutionaries, and anyone who stands in their way is in trouble, even if they are in the police force. I had high expectations for this movie after seeing Project A. But, unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. There is very little action compared to the first movie. There is only one good fight scene until the grand finale. That fight scene is in the "place of the gangsters" and it's good, many people fly everywhere and they throw strong kicks and punches. Jackie Chan and his team of specialists do not disappoint here. The ending is very entertaining, Jackie Chan shows us why EL is the best specialist in the world. Really exciting things! The only bad thing with the end, is that the fights are too short and forgettable. Conclusion: Many fun moments, good acting and crazy acrobatics. But it is not enough to fight for a higher rating.
