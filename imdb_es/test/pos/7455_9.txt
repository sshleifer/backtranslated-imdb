TV-14 rating for sexual content and language. <br /> <br /> I remembered hearing about this program in 1998, when I used to play on the Teletoon channel. I did not see it, but now I hear it. The channel, Razer. I have seen about four episodes of this program and I must say that it is quite intelligent and fun. <br /> <br /> The show stars Jason Alexander of Seinfeld and also Tim Curry of Rocky Horror Picture Show and It fame. The program is about a duck who is a police officer. Basically, he does his job as a policeman, while facing personal problems. This program is quite funny at times and the fans of the animated comedy are going to like this.
