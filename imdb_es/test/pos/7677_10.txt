I saw this movie when I was very young. It is my favorite of all times. I had not been able to get a copy until recently and seeing so many good memories returned to me. I loved the interpretation that Sidney Poiter makes of Porgy, he is his character with such strength and courage. The part of Pearl Bailey, although small, was not different from many of the members of our own family. My favorite songs were and still are "Bess You Is My Women", "Porgy, Do not let him handle me" and, of course, "Summertime". According to the guidelines, if I interpret them correctly, I can not publish where I could get my copy, I'm sorry. That's why I registered to share this information.
