Symbolist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new scientific experiment explodes the city. <br /> <br /> The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006, but for the vast majority of the followers of Dan Brown did not do justice to his award-winning book and, although it lasted 2 hours and a half, seemed to bore many. <br /> <br /> Having read the book, maybe I was one of the few that Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou tried to solve the murder mystery in the Louvre, but for Angels and Demons, the scales rose once again as principal star and director of return. <br /> <br /> Having asked, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to the Da Vinci code for entertaining reading and it seems that critics and fans, although not yet fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release. <br /> <br /> This image of Howard certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise unlike Da Vinci, Robert Langdon and Tom Hanks as just one night to solve the mysterious activities of the Illuminati forgotten in The Vatican and due to time constraints, action and desperation increase the initial bet and generate an emotion that certainly surpasses the Da Vinci code, but also generates many twists and impressive sequences killings. <br /> <br /> The interesting factor of this 2009 version is the constant elements that are justified for the murders. The earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to convey a sense of general power to the situation. <br /> <br /> This really justifies the label of the thriller with a constant tension and a sharp drama with The problems and the beliefs, once again, have been solved. <br /> <br /> As 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols that once were believed lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone. the light in and between the controversy of other compelling circumstances. <br /> <br /> It's fair to say that Dan Brown is a complex writer; He certainly likes to put themes and dramas between his action and exciting sequences. In addition to trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of religion are again present. All interesting to discover and listen, if sometimes the debates and the dialogue tend to make your mind be distracted, but as there is much in the novel, this was always probable. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard, who remained frankly A normal type of direction that turns on Da Vinci, perhaps returns in the worst possible way. His camera style always moving irregularly does nothing to maintain the pressure, and we can never fully accept what is happening on the screen thanks to this frankly misinterpreted style. It's certainly not Paul Greengrass and this is not Bourne in any way. <br /> <br /> Stylish and stylized, this is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci.
