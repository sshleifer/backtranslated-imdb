My wife is a mental health therapist and we observe her from beginning to end. I am the typical man and I can not stand girl movies, but this movie is amazing. If you want to see how it is for someone who is going through these kinds of problems, this is the movie for you. As I watched him, I felt bad for him and for others like him. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** Plus the fact that all the people in the film, including people in the mental institution, were real people in real life, made it more real. <br /> <br /> A must see for someone in the mental health profession!
