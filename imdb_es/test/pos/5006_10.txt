I am appalled and appalled that the Network has canceled the Talk Show with Spike Feresten! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with The Fox Television Network, canceling the Talk Show with Spike Feresten and replacing it with Wanda Sikes? For those on the Net with little attention span, Wanda At Large was canceled because the audience got tired of their nasty insults that would make the audience shudder, and Wanda Sykes threw her own brand of vengeful jokes of mud shots is not humor It is unpleasant and repulsive. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the Fox television network has rewarded Wanda Sikes because she has obtained an important appearance in front of President Barak Obama. There is no doubt that Wanda's recent bad temper in front of the president of the United States is not funny and the laughter of the audience was only to sponsor and please Barak Obama. <br /> <br /> Talk Show with Spike Feresten has a genuine sense of humor and has never deliberately or vengefully insulted any guest or artist. Spike's well-rounded personality always rejoiced, mocked life and himself. And his Pieces filed during the first two seasons with actress Mary Mae Atwill of AFTRA, as Mae West of the 21st century, were absolutely hysterical with the parodies of Spike Feresten: Judge Joe Brown, The exchange spouses and the James Kyson episode Read from last season, where Spike talks to Erica through the Internet on the show. <br /> <br /> Despite the budgetary restrictions of the Network for the elaborate field pieces and the WGA Strike of the Second Season, Spike Feresten did not give up his sense of humor or show integrity. Talk Show with Spike Feresten always had new talents and his comedy parodies for the Stoners of Nanny 911 and Idiot Paparazzi were considered cutting-edge and had excellent production value. <br /> <br /> On a professional level, Spike Feresten, was the best executive producer, and set producer, Brett Webster, along with his fabulous production team, was one of the best production teams I've ever been on. worked in my AFTRA career. It would really be a shame and shameless shame to cancel Talk Show with Spike Feresten. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, your success could be taken to Comedy Central or another Network and financially speaking, that would become a valuable revenue loss for FOX Television. <br /> <br /> On behalf of the last hour of Saturday's hearing on Fox Television, supporters of the talk show with Spike Feresten, including all the actors and the team, we asked the Network to keep the talk show with the Spike Feresten franchise and give the band a second chance to become a successful Fox Show.
