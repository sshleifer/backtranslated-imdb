Nothing better than an android with technology from the 80s and a history of coming of age to take your thoughts from the depths of your mind to the center and center so that you will be captivated by a beautiful and adorable cast. Growing up in the 80s gave me the invaluable opportunity to see "not entirely human" repetitions on many special occasions. Considering the fact that my parents were never present during the presentations, I suppose I would most likely not enjoy it as much as when I was a child. So maybe this is a movie to unearth from your VHS collection and deliver it to your children, you can find it on the same tape as "The apple dough ball gang" and an episode of "tour of duty", it's Say, if you recorded in LP Mode of course.
