This movie kept my interest from the beginning to the end, with many laughs and realistic acting throughout the cast. Glynn Turman, (Preach Jackson) is the star of the image that plays the role of a smart guy who likes poetry and had a very sexy girlfriend. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs, (Cochise Morris) was an outstanding athlete at Cooley H.S. and he even won a scholarship to a famous school. There are scenes in this picture with the Chicago Police Department chasing all these guys in a Cadillac and a visit to the Lincoln Park Zoo with monkey droppings. The music is exceptional and there is a great picture in the city of Chicago. Great movie, enjoy.
