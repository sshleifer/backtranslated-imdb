Almod√≥var very typical of the time and, in his way, no less fun than many of his latest works. And why is that? There is nothing to be provoked or scandalized, and I think that such an effect is more a coincidence than an attempt. No, the great humor comes from an underlying absurdity, almost surreal, that is woven on stage: the almost complete lack of taboo of the characters. It is the same type of 'comic suspense' that you will find in his later works, although here you will find it in a more approximate version. It is preparing for the masterpieces that are to come, but it is not there yet. <br /> <br /> The only critic who commented on this film before I did it, stated that it had to be a "very select" group of people that I found this hilarious movie. I make.
