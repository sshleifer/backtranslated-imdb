Each year there is one that can not be missed, the long-awaited grand prize for the big budget with the right combination of star, director and theme that fails miserably at the box office. This year was Superman Returns. In 1982 it was Blade Runner. In 1957 it was The Spirit of St. Louis, by Billy Wilder, a film that had it all: the principal director, the big star, the best-selling real story about an American hero, except for a sufficient audience to cover his costs. Perhaps the public still remembered the anti-Semitism of Lucky Lindy and his great admiration for the achievements of Nazi Germany before the war (neither of them is covered in the film, which ends with his arrival in Paris before the legend will weaken). Maybe because they thought they knew the story or that he was just going to be a man trapped in a cabin for two hours. Certainly, Wilder and co-writer Wendell Mayes are aware of the dramatic pitfalls of Lindbergh's relatively uneventful flight, alternating a well-executed flashback structure at key points in his life and the preparation of the flight itself. Once the film is in the air, it is surprising and exciting, finding a genuine drama in its attempts to stay awake and navigate without the proper instruments. <br /> <br /> It also creates a rather remarkable sense of fear that does not look like anything else. in the filmography of Wilder, allied to a real sense of the epic: you take as the sinister storm clouds on the hanger, the dark dawn before the flight brings a real chill of foreboding. Even the typically muted and problematic WarnerColor is added to the movie rather than detracting from it. Along with the excellent use of CinemaScope, there is a remarkable score by Franz Waxman: majestic, growing but full of underestimated threats, and intelligently used as part of the fabric of the film instead of mere musical accompaniment. The film loses points for insinuating, although in reality it has never said it openly, that this was a race to be the first to fly across the Atlantic. In fact, Lindbergh was the third man to fly across the Atlantic after Brits Alcock and Brown were almost completely forgotten. I've been flying eight years before, but it's still a remarkably tense and absorbing adventure story that deserved the success it never found.
