"You were climbing and you tripped with a skirt!" Gilligan tells Jim Leonard. That sums up the plot of this story of the promising Leonard (a YOUNG Humphrey Bogart) when his dream is diverted by the Carol bomb, played by Dorothy Mackaill. Leonard has been working on a new and improved engine, but now his love life and his engine company have their ups and downs in this 68 minute short. Bogart had not yet developed the calm and melancholic style. Good performances from most of the secondary characters: his butler, his co-workers, a sister, intruders along the way. Some themes for adults, since it was done just before they really imposed the code of the film, but it is still moderate compared to what is seen today on television. Directed by Thornton Freeland, a year earlier, Freeland directed the incredible "Flying Down to Rio."
