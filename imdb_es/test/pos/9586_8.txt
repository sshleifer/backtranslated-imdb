I always enjoy watching this caricature, with Sylvester trying to catch Tweety on a train, instead of at Grandma's house. Actually, it's a standard fee, but entertaining, especially when Tweety pulls the emergency stop cable. One of my complaints about this is how careless the animators were with the train. When you look at this again and again, as my child did (who loves trains, which is why he liked it so much), you begin to notice some things. <br /> <br /> Throughout this short, the position of the luggage car changes on the train, either 3rd, 4th or 5th, and in long shots, at all. The engine has the number 651 or 814, or none. The coal tender has the number 99 or the letters "S.P. & Q.R." in it, or no numbers or letters at all. The coaches wear the "S.P.Q.R." without the "&" in long shots, and then in close-ups it has the words "SouthEast and Western". <br /> <br /> All this does not interfere with the story, but the details of the production obviously were not seen very carefully. <br /> <br /> This caricature is still among my favorites with Sylvester and Tweety.
