Despite all the fuss over the episode of THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES, THE BALANCE OF TERROR could be the best episode of the series. And, although I've always liked PIECE OF THE ACTION because it's really fun, I really have to cast my vote in this episode of Romulan as the best. <br /> <br /> The movie, oddly enough, is really like an underwater film from World War II, as it bounces between the covert Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it tries to destroy the Romulans before they slip through. of the Neutral Zone after a raid on the Federation's outposts. In many ways, the show looks a lot like the movie THE ENEMY DOWN, where the American Captain (Robert Mitchum) and the German Captain (Curt Jurgens) appear in counterpoint while both try to outwit the other - and in the process, develop a spiteful respect for their enemies. <br /> <br /> It is quite interesting that only a small fragment of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet, and this is incredible because an episode aboard the ship could easily have been static and dull. But, because the writing was fantastic and the main characters were written and acted very well (Shatner and Mark Leonard as the Romulan leader). Interestingly, for die-hard Trekkers, they will recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spock's father. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is simply a great and extremely attractive episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
