I saw this movie on my local cable system under the title "Beyond the trade." I was looking for new material to see, since most of the repetitions on a Saturday morning did not interest me. I've always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Ironside, so I chose this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Personally, I enjoyed the movie. Rich Roesing, who posted a comment about the movie that was ruined by watching scenes from the film on the back of a video rental box, is well justified. I did not have the disappointment of knowing anything about the film beforehand. This led me to rate the movie above the average score that appears on the page. <br /> <br /> I like suspense movies, and this was no exception. The movie kept me guessing until the end. I was surprised by the end! <br /> <br /> The moments of reflection and memory of past experiences of the main character during the film were only added to the suspense. His reactions to those memories gave the film a sense of the humanitarian, albeit conflictive, side of police work. Struggling with your faith is also a welcome addition. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense films, but also films that expose the side of feeling, the personal inflection of the character, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie in your local cable or satellite system guide, watch it. <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking for a rental video, follow Rich Roesing's advice and ask someone to get the video for you before seeing it.
