I am sure that the film contains certain gaps in logic, but it captivated me so much that I did not really care. The film is developed as a fun and cheerful teenage game combined with a Schwarzenegger type action movie. It is full of action, full of emotion and also has some comical moments. It's fun to see Sean Astin, and I have not seen Louis Gossett, Jr. since I saw "Diggstown" in theaters. He is a good actor, underestimated and I love seeing him on screen. I wonder what he is doing now. Unfortunately, he could be starring in many of those direct movies to the video. With luck, my guess is wrong. Anyway, this is a fun thriller on the edge of your seat and I definitely suggest you take a look. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
