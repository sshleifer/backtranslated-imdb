The Sherlock Holmes films of the classical universal era tend to vary in quality. This range goes from very good to above average, without any of its results being abysmal or surprisingly bright. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon fit perfectly in the middle level in terms of quality, and, as always, it's a nice start that fans of the series, like me, will enjoy a lot. This film sees Holmes in the middle of a World War II plot by the evil Nazi to steal the invention of a Swiss scientist, who could become a key element in the battlefield. The Sherlock Holmes films of the Second World War are not usually as good as those of The Scarlet Claw, where Holmes is conducting private investigations, since they are generally harassed by too much propaganda or a plot that has more to do with the War than the mystery. This one, nevertheless, stays quite remote of both and, when concentrating in Holmes and its investigation, the film works much better. Maybe Universal saw what knocked down the previous Voice of Terror and changed the focus because of that. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, once again, presents an excellent nonconformist acting as a detective and while Nigel Bruce does not appear as much as it is normal, it is good to see him when he does. The two did not spend much time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things in Holmes's films; but this gives Holmes more time to show up in various costumes, which is always a lot of fun. Dennis Hoey's Lestrade is definitely my favorite of the supporting characters, and although it's not as much fun as ever; His facial expressions are excellent and his presence helps to emphasize how big Holmes is. His scene with Watson in a car after the paint drops on the road is my favorite moment of the movie. It's good to see the nemesis of Holmes, Professor Moriarty come back, even if it looks like he's been knocked down. The performance of Lionel Atwill is not as good as that of George Zucco in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, since he never really convinces that he is a brilliant mind; but to see it with the protagonist is fun and it's nice to see it in the film to compensate the themes of the Second World War, which are never as interesting as Holmes himself. The film begins as a thriller rather than a mystery film; but once it starts, it is difficult to leave it and this is a more than solid entry in the work of Universal.
