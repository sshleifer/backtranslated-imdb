I have read the comments in Las Vegas and I agree with some of them, it is not a brain surgery program, but again I had the impression that television was mainly for escapism, especially with what is happening in the world of today. Let's face it, a program about Vegas (which is not a reality-based program) does not go to one based on reality, because for me Vegas is pure fantasy. It's the kind of place where we can go and do practically what we want when we want (subject to funds, obviously!). <br /> <br /> Therefore, the fact that Las Vegas is beautiful, sexy and clicheado with characters that Reflect all this seems to be in the money in my eyes. If you do not like it, do not see it, for which we have a million channels! <br /> <br /> We're getting to the third episode here in the UK and I know I will. be making a straight line to see it again. I just hope it does not cancel, something that seems to be happening a lot with most of the shows that come to the UK that are half decent! (Firefly and Jake 2.0, anyone!). <br /> <br /> It's harmless, very funny and every time I see it, I want to go back to reality :)
