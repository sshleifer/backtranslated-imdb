I saw him for the first time as a teenager in my senior year of high school. I was fascinated by it! I loved the special effects, the fantastic places and the test and flashback method to tell the story. <br /> <br /> Several years later, I read the book and, although it was interesting, I could definitely see what Swift was. Trying to say, I think that while it is not as perfect as the social commentary book, like history, the movie is better. It makes more sense that it's a long adventure than the return of Gulliver after each trip and make a profit selling the little sheep Lilliput or whatever. <br /> <br /> It's much more amazing when everyone thinks he's crazy and the sheep do a cameo anyway. As a side note, when I saw Laputa I was stunned. It looks a lot like the Kingdom of Zeal from the video game Chrono Trigger (1995) that I liked even more in this miniseries. <br /> <br /> I saw him again about 4 years ago and I realized that I still enjoyed it the same way. A really high quality material and started an excellent series of Sweeps for NBC that followed him with the solid Merlin and the interesting Alice in Wonderland.
