The Duchess and her three kittens enjoy the good life with their devoted human lover until the evil butler Edgar, with his eyes on a great heritage, decides to drain them and remove them from the scene. How can these fragile creatures manage in the unknown countryside and the meanest streets of Paris? Only to meet the irrepressible street cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After tasting the wide and dangerous world, he guides them home and Edgar gets his fair desserts at the wrong end of a horse. As always, it's the voices and not the animation that make up the heart of Disney's magic: Phil Harris is brilliant as O'Malley, Eva Gabor as Duchess is ... well ... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most memorable turns are those of Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who turn the old dogs Napoleon and Lafayette into a pair of clumsy fried peasants from the south. His scenes with Edgar and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his cool band are classics. The most surprising thing about seeing The Aristocats now is how deeply the Disney animation style has changed since it was at the forefront in 1970. Perhaps the nostalgic and antiquated feeling is only the result of being duped into Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are more complicated. (a pity) and the animation and the general rhythm are much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than in the more recent efforts, like Aladdin.
