Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a good number of Sherlock Holmes accounts, but the famous detective's popularity ensured that the sequels in both the print and the film would extend well beyond the works of the author. <br /> <br /> In "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon," Holmes, Basil Rathbone, patriotically assists British intelligence to ensure that the Swiss scientist desperately needs the vision of the bomb. The film is from 1942 and I wonder if the producers and writers realized how vital were the secrets of the vision of the bomb (the vision of America Norden was almost as jealous as the new radars that would change the course of the Second World War). <br /> <br /> Holmes and his faithful but hopefully fellow mate, Dr. Watson, Nigel Bruce, fight against Dr. Moriarty, Lionel Atwill. As bad as Moriarty has always been, it is a bit shocking to see that he has registered with Hitler. Does man have no vestige of decency? I suppose not. But Atwill is deliciously evil. <br /> <br /> The story has a reasonably fast pace, as Holmes and Watson try to retrieve the stolen pump sight components before they can be sent to a submarine. Rathbone is his usual soft personality and several holmian costumes are well done. <br /> <br /> This and other Holmes stories from the 1940s are now available on DVD and oldies.com has published a very good set of four discs in a wooden box: this movie is included along with a Extra CD of an interview with elder Doyle. The set sells for around $ 26 at the main DVD and CD stores, but I found this and other oldies.com games at a winery club for $ 14.98. The transfers are very good. <br /> <br /> Very nice and relaxing to see the night. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
