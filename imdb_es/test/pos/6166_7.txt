It seems that no matter how many films are made on the subject, there is no shortage of the stories that emerge from the Second World War. It is logical to think that a conflict on a scale such as global war would capture the imagination of filmmakers around the world and provide them with ample material on which to base a story. Going in a different direction to most conventional movies about war is Dark Blue World, a film that does not deal with the traditional main battles of war, does not tell the story of many of its main figures and does not even focus on Soldiers of any of the main allied powers or axes. The dark blue world instead of venturing into the world of the refugee soldiers who fight in exile for their occupied nations. <br /> <br /> The film does a wonderful job of portraying the challenges facing Czech pilots flying under the Royal British Air Force, expressing the frustration of feeling both the language barrier between them and the other flyers, but also the fact that they were prevented from taking revenge on the Germans until they were retrained. <br /> <br /> Dark Blue World also works pretty well outside The arena of the war movie as a story about human relationships. A love triangle develops between the two main characters and an English woman that complicates the teacher-mentor relationship of the two exiled soldiers. This relationship is extremely well acted, and it becomes a father-son relationship in many points. <br /> <br /> The air combat in the film is one of the best and it is also very interesting to explore the cultural challenges. mentioned earlier when men fight to blow up their machines, fight against the enemy and transmit commands and answers in an unknown language. The tension and struggle of these scenes continues the tension between the men on the ground, as does the tension in the ground that is felt in the air. <br /> <br /> This may not be a movie for everyone. The movie aficionado of the hardcore war may find that his exploration of relationships is a bit unpleasant, but in general it is an excellent movie regardless of the bellicose element or not.
