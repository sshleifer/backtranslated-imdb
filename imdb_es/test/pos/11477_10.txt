This is probably one of the best Portuguese films I've seen ... I really liked the plot, because by the way the story unfolds, you would get more involved in how your world was really upside down ... There's just one part that really does not seem to fit in the movie, which is the strip of girls ... It does not add anything important to the story, it seems that it is there only for an entertaining purpose for men. The end is a little unexpected, although, at the same time, something expected. If you do not understand, then follow me: after so many strange events, the viewer is so used to the oddities, that ending the film with totally unexpected relationships (like Mimoso and Susana) sounds totally natural after watching the rest of the movie. But, above all, Sorte Nula is a film that makes you think a lot to solve the mysterious events, laugh with your unfortunate lives and mess up your perception of what can happen in a few minutes, when you turn away from something ... for everything that, I rate it 8/10
