I remember seeing this a long time ago, and I knew most of the concept, but no detail, so I'm glad I saw it again, from director Frank Oz (The Muppets Take Manhattan, Bowfinger). Basically, new star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) just won the Academy Award for his most recent, where he plays a gay soldier, and does the usual "thank you," even mentions his English teacher from the previous school , Howard Brackett (Golden Globe nominee Kevin Kline), and he takes him out as gay! Howard is determined to clear his name, and get out of the media spotlight as a denier man, especially when his marriage to Emily Montgomery (Oscar Cusack, Oscar nominee and Golden Globe) is on the way. So it's about the wedding day, and when Howard says yes or no, it's when he overreaches, and admits to himself and everyone, that he's gay. This, of course, causes him to be fired as a teacher, but everyone stands up on graduation day to get out (in support), and Cameron even appears to clarify things, so that everyone, especially the director of Tom Halliwell School (Bob Newhart Elf) know it's okay to be gay. Also starring Tom Selleck as Peter Malloy, Debbie Reynolds as Berniece Brackett, Wilford Brimley as Frank Brackett, Gregory Jbara as Walter Brackett, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg and Jay Leno. The highlight of the film is when Kline can not help but dance with Diana Ross' version of "I Will Survive," which must have been what convinced him of his sexuality. Kline is always good, Cusack is a surprise Oscar nominee, and all the supporting cast members also do it in this funny comedy. Very well!
