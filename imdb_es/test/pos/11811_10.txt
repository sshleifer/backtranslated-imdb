This was such a beautiful movie. Such an incredible performance by Joseph and Brad. Very innocently written and done. You must see it !! I cried my eyes almost through the whole movie. This is a film that every family should sit down with their children to watch, teach us all a very important lesson in life and how we should focus on the hard issue of AIDS, how we should teach our children to face it. and the people around you. Not only with AIDS, but with any terminal illness. I had not even heard of this movie until I moved on television. One day and run it. I recommend everyone to see this, but do not forget your box of tissues. More movies like this should be made. Extremely comforting
