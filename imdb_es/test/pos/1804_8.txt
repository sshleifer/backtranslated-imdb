Valley Girl is an exceptionally well made movie with a great cast. Even though the dialogue is a little outdated now, when the movie premiered it was very current. To this day, I know many people (including teens) who can not form a sentence without using the word "I like". That is without doubt the legacy that this film will leave. A rating of 8 was given for this, like, the most excellent movie.
