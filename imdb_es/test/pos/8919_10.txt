This really is a cult classic from Australia. If you are one of the lucky ones who have seen it, then you are very lucky. It has been released in most countries, but not in Australia for some reason. I have a DVD copy of the United Kingdom. It's not a big transfer, but I bought it, having seen it before in a film festival. The direction is right and the rock performances! This is a dark movie that is scary, but often it is very funny in some places. I urge you to watch this movie, there is a coldness in this that you do not see in 99% of the typical Australian rate. The script is very well designed and sends you on a trip where you know it will end badly, but until the last ten minutes, you can not choose how bad. Great work of the four protagonists, especially Lachy Hulme. <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done: Great job on display!
