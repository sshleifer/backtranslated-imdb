I missed the full four-hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played for a week. I had to settle for seeing the shorter version of two and a half hours or so a year later and I was stunned by what I saw. I left the cinema thinking that I had witnessed a masterpiece and I was wondering what the full version would look like. <br /> <br /> The full version is good for the most part, but it has sequences that are so incredibly boring that the whole movie is shot down and almost sinks under the waves. <br /> <br /> The problem is completely in the edition, which should be labeled as the last word in excess. There are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens. Photos of people in a city that last too long without any purpose in the narrative. We get beautiful views and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to your eyes, but they are used very often as a marker of place instead of punctuation or to establish a place. Much of the longer version seems to be on the screen simply because it looked good. <br /> <br /> Actually I tried to sit down and watch Heavens Gate without having to resort to the Fast Forward button, but somewhere along the way I find that I can not take it anymore. <br /> <br /> I wish MGM would take pity on us and launch the shortest version on DVD, as well as the huge dinosaur. Maybe as a pack of two so we could see which one is the best version, and if Cimino was crazy or not. <br /> <br /> And while they were at that, why not include the edition that Johnson County War once rumors about that ran? 90 minutes. Supposedly, United Artists played a new court hoping to recover some of their money. If it was ever made or still exists, it is in the air, but it would be interesting to see it.
