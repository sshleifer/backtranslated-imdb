I'm a big fan of M Lillard that's why I ended up watching this movie. Honestly, I doubt if he was not in the movie I would have enjoyed it so much or even seen it, but once I saw it I realized that the story was pretty decent. A bad ending, I must say, but I saw it coming. It's a low budget movie and some of the actors were not really good, but in general, I rated 7/10. <br /> <br /> The suspense of wondering what Lillard actually did was what really kept me interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
