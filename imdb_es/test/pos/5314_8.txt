I loved the catcher in the rye, it's my favorite book. JD Salinger, the author of the catcher, has the rights to the book and he did it so that no one can make a film about it with his permission. <br /> <br /> With that said, here is "United States of Leland." Beautiful film with a lot of sense and depth in emotion. but it reminded me a lot of the catcher, almost too much reminded me of the catcher. The few stories Leland told in the film, such as visiting New York and his adventures, were very similar to Holden's in the catcher, and the way Leland sees people and emotions is also similar to Holden's, both are simple and true to themselves. others. Acts accredited to don cheadle and Kevin spacy. Great edition, everything fits perfectly, and I loved the story all together. Recommend as a purchase or at least a rental. good movie. <br /> <br /> the only thing that drags in some points but it compensates in the long term. Give him time and appreciate a good movie.
