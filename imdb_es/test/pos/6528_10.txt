I love Aaron Carter, but I even expected the pop star to be predictable, but I was so wrong! Aaron Carter was very funny and a great actor. Also the actress who played Jane was a brilliant actress! All those who did not, whom I saw, loved it. <br /> <br /> The music that it contained was also very good! <br /> <br /> My favorite quotes from the movie are "you can not send me to a public school mom! I'm a CELEBRIDEE!" and "Take your time, I come to you!" <br /> <br /> Although the endings are a little cheesy, everything good girls do! This movie is great, and a good movie of Chick, that I can see again and again.
