At first it looks like the romantic movie of today where a girl meets a boy and falls in love, but the point is that this movie has the feeling that others do not. The first time I saw her I did not see her complete because I had to leave. But as I walked, I thought I should see him again, but by then I had no chance. A year passed until I saw this movie on a non-free channel, I saw it and recorded it. I also saw it once, twice ... up to 200 times and I was not kidding. I knew all the hart dialogues and I do not know why, but I saw it every day and I never got bored. And I have to say that I'm not used to seeing a movie more than twice. The act is very good. Gerard Depardieu is also a talented actor and Katherine Heigl. I would like her to be in a good movie because I think she can do it. In general, it's a movie that I can not get out of my mind.
