Some people say that the pace of this movie is a bit slow, but how is it different from any other Hitchcock movie? Everyone moves very deliberately and, as a point, they have injections of suspense and brilliant montages injected through it. This film gives us the right amount of comedic relief that makes suspenseful scenes seem even more exciting. The Albert Hall scene is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema that exists in the Hitchcock collection (the best is probably almost all in "Rear Window"). Pure Cinema for Hitchcock meant a series of films, usually small, that fit without dialogue, to tell the story visually. This is, of course, the basic definition of the Albert Hall sequence, as well as the shorter sequence of stairs at the end of the image. <br /> <br /> There are not many mistakes of Hitchcock here, and the acting is excellent, especially by Doris Day in a rather surprising role.
