Undoubtedly, the best movie of Burt Reynolds! Even better than Smokey and the bandit. This was probably the first bloody police thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect mix of humor, action, mystery and style that is lacking in today's movies. <br /> <br /> This has it all: a psychotic Henry Silva loaded with PCP, a thousand dollars a night, killer ninja and Burt Reynolds who cut their fingers, one by one, with a butterfly knife. The film is based on the novel by William Diehl who also wrote PRIMAL FEAR, another of my favorites of all time. It's worth watching this movie just to see how Henry Silva gets shot six times, crashes through a window and falls thirty stories from the top of an Atlanta skyscraper. This is probably the coolest trick in Hollywood history, done by the legendary specialist Dar Robinson. <br /> <br /> Robinson also played "Moke" in Elmore Leonard's STICK, also starring Burt Reynolds. Stick has another great trick of Dar Robinson. Robinson falls out of a Miami apartment building and unloads the six shots of a magnum of .44 on his way down. Very interesting things. <br /> <br /> SHARKY MACHINE is my favorite police drama. I never understood why this movie failed like it did. If Burt made more movies like this, he would have built a better reputation for himself. He proves to be a talented director with Sharky, as well as a talented actor. Burt has the support of Brian Kieth, Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward and the villain of all favorites, Henry Silva. PLEASE remake this classic movie! Get Affleck and Samuel L. and some other popular actors and you have a great movie waiting to be filmed. <br /> <br /> I give it a 9 out of 10
