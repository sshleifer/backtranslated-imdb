This little hard-to-see photo was played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. It's a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, who wears many famous faces sitting for interviews, which are rarely seen in television performances and in the scenes of Nilsson at work. There are even some shots of "Son Of Dracula". This film is the last tribute to one of the best voices, the most intelligent composer and the most entertaining man of popular music. It is a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and / or interpreted. His friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented giant with a subconscious desire for self-destruction. As an added benefit, you even get Eric Idle to perform the song written for Nilsson's last album during the final credits. It's funny, it's sad. It is not in general version. If this image is reproduced near where you live, look at it!
