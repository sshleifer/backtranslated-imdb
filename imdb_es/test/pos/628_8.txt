The plot is something original, and all the actors did their job quite well. There is also a lot of comic relief. Some things do not make much sense (for example, the first "persecution" scene, why does not the heroine hide somewhere and wait until the bad guys leave?). Actually, Russians speak Russian without an accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models spanning about 50 years, so the place seems strangely out of date. In general, if you like thrillers, you will probably like this too.
