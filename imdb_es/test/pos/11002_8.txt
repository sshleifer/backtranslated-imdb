In "The Squire of Gothos," Kirk and his team encounter a powerful super-being, which keeps the Captain, "Bones" and some of the crew members held captive for no apparent reason. I could be wrong, but I think this is the first episode of Star Trek I've seen and the program that made me hungry for more. It's not one of the best episodes, but the solid premise of an alien being that puts the crew of the Enterprise in a corner is the kind of situation that makes the show so fun to watch. In a way, the superhumanoid anticipates one of Star Trek's most famous characters, the enigmatic "Q" of the next generation. This episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation: it is the first time that Uhura is part of the action and the story allows the spectator to see what a beloved character of Uhuara can be when history allows it. Too bad the show never completely explored this iconic figure.
