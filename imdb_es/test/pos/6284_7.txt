I think this is the best of Pauly Shore, he played the perfect role. I really enjoyed this movie, Patrick Renna is really funny like Zack, the annoying little brother. Son In Law is a good comedy that's worth it, but all I want is for Tiffany Thiessen to be the farm girl instead of the one they had.
