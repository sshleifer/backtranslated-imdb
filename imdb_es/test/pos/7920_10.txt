This is being discussed only because Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953) may not know at first how powerful a score is and how majestic these lyrics really are. If you read the lyrics of Alexander Nevsky op.78 there is nothing here that is less than a witness through the song of one of the most beautiful and moving scores of all musical literature. This film with its accompanying score has a special place in the world and can be as true on the Internet as anywhere else. The composers' website, which is backed by its heritage, provides additional attention given the score that this score really deserves. For me it is as deep as it is wide with such audacity that it wants to be the only one, which they called Great Novgorod. This is a song about Alexander Nevsky. Yes, it happened on the Neva River, on the Neva River, in the wide waters. There we killed our enemy of fighting men, a selection of fighters, the army of the Swedes. Oh! How we fight, how we defeat them! Oh! He destroyed his ship. The war went on! In the struggle, our blood spilled freely for our great land, our Russian native land. Hears! Where the broadaxe turned like an open street, through their ranks a path where spears ran! Swedes like the grass of the feathers that grow on the desert floor. We will never give up native land of Russia. Those who march on Russia will be executed! the weapons continue) Stand up for arms, Russian people, in battle, in the fight to the death, get up, free and brave people, defend our just native land. To the living warriors, high esteem, immortal fame to the dead warriors! Home, Russian land, get up, Russian people! In our great native Russia, no enemy will live. Get up in arms, get up, mother native of Russia! No enemy will cross the Land of Russia, no foreign force will assault Russia, invisible Roads to Russia. No enemy will devastate the Russian fields. (Here, dear reader, we are asked to live forever with the following verses e) entitled "The Field of the Dead": I will cross the snow-covered field, fly over the field of death. I will look for brave warriors, my fiances, my unconditional young people. Here is one struck down by a wild saber, one impaled by an arrow. From their wounds, the blood fell like rain on our native soil, on our Russian fields. The one who fell for Russia in a noble death will be blessed by my kiss in his dead eyes; , brave boy, who remained alive, I will be a true wife and a loving friend. I will not marry a handsome man, earthly charm and beauty fade and die quickly. I will marry the man who is brave, Give pay attention to this, brave warriors! (now to its conclusion with the entry of Nevskys to Pskov) In a great campaign, Russia went to war. Russia brought down the hostile troops. In our homeland, no enemy will live. The enemies that come will be defeated. To death! Celebrate and sing, mother native of Russia. In our native land, men will not live. The enemies will never see the Russian cities and fields; those who march on Russia will be condemned to death In our great Russia, in our native Russia, no enemy will live! Celebrate and sing, the native mother Russia! All Russia triumphed in the celebration. Celebrate and rejoice, Russian motherland! - It should be noted that Prokofiev was under quite a bit of pressure from Stalin, if you want, do it right. This musical score was really approved by Stalin. For me, there is an unmistakable beauty in the way we love this world and Nevsky talks about a Hero whose attributes of God they like. for all the participation in that love. A truly beautiful and furtive story of the story of Alexander Nevsky.
