Brian Keith as Cole Wlikerson and Richard Jaeckel as Wade Matlock are excellent villains. They just love intimidating locals in the most brutal way possible, and they make a sexual mockery of any suggestion that there might be a more humane way to achieve their ends. It's a shame that good gifts from Glenn Ford stand in his way.
