reflects this good comedy about an elderly father (C. Aubrey Smith) who decides to reunite his adult children around the world. Davies is working as a showgirl in New York when he receives the news that "papa" loves her. Hmmmm, sounds familiar. Davies' considerable talents as a comedian save this otherwise regular comedy, as it alters the British countryside with its blatant American personality. It's not as sharp as other Davies comedies, but it's worth checking out. Ray Milland plays his "brother" lost a long time ago. Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray and Halliwell Hobbes are also fun.
