I grew up in New York and this show went on when I was four years old. I had a half-day kindergarten and was on channel 11 of WPIX in the afternoon. I just loved the music and the stories and I remember having them humming in the house while I was playing. <br /> <br /> I just watched part of an episode on YouTube and, for a moment, I could remember how I felt seeing those shows as a little kid. I, of course, stopped looking when I entered 1st grade because it was on before school left (there was no VCR or digital video recorder at the time). I grew up, without noticing that the program was still on until I was in the 11th grade. <br /> <br /> I also had no idea that there was DVD and I wish my nieces and nephews were young enough to enjoy this program, but now they are all beyond demographics, or I would buy them all. sets This was much better than many of today's children's shows.
