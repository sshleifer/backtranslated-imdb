The animation is still the slightly harsher style of the first episode, Simpsons Roasting on a Open Fire, but now, with this first regular episode, Bart the Genius, the humor starts to be more "in layers", faster and with more depth of characterization. It is already appearing. <br /> <br /> This episode firmly establishes Bart's "vague" personality, and more subtly, Lisa's intellectual superiority over the whole family. Although that is the main theme of the whole episode (there is also a good secondary theme of the father / son relationship of Bart and Homer), we are presented first in a few words, since the episode begins with the Simpsons playing Scrabble. Lisa comes up with "id" for her word: short, but something for which she has to be well educated to know. She has to read the definition to the rest of the dictionary family, which has been serving as a way to lift the sofa. Marge can only reach "him". Homer has already "oxidized" sitting on his tray in order, but does not recognize that it is a word, so he presents "do" instead. Bart comes up with "kwyjibo", which he insists is a word. Similarly, in the main plot of the episode, Bart cheats on his IQ test, which leads him to enter a special school full of gifted children. We know that it is not likely to last long. <br /> <br /> "The Simpsons" has always had a lot of fun playing with varying degrees of intellectual abilities among people through their characters, and more importantly, that's how people with different degrees of intellectual abilities they fit (or not), they are accepted (or not) and they are perceived in society. Aside from starting to present the place of Bart, Lisa, Homer and Marge in this context, this episode already begins to mock respectfully of nerds and geeks outside the Simpsons family. Through some dialogues of special school students, as well as some of the other references, including purely visual ones, this episode also shows that "The Simpsons" are not going to make any effort through writing or conversation. up to your audience. It may be just a caricature, but it is a caricature that intellectuals, geeks and nerds will understand more than anyone else. And that fact, apart from being a very funny show, is the key to the longevity of the show.
