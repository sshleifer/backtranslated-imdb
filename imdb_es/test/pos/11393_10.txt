Everything you need to know about pornography in the late 70s and early 80s is all included in Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS. Although the film is completely fictitious, it is supposedly based on the story of John Holmes. <br /> <br /> In Southern California in 1977, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) works as a waiter at a nightclub. One of the regular customers is the pornographer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and two of his stars, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack and Eddie meet and Jack realizes that Eddie is fine ... a little ... gifted. <br /> <br /> So Eddie stars in Jack's films under the pseudonym "Dirk Diggler". She becomes a "big" porn star (no pun) and seems to be above all. Then comes the decade of the 80s, when the video replaces the movie and the porn empire of Jack begins to collapse, along with Dirk Diggler and everyone else working in the field. <br /> <br /> BOOGIE NIGHTS is a really well filmed drama. There is a bit of violence, but P.T. Anderson makes it more stylized. And it's a kind of scathing approach to the degradations of pornography, especially when VHS became the standard way to make porn. <br /> <br /> Many unique and strange characters are presented. William H. Macy has an interesting role as someone who works in the movies, whose wife continues to have sex with everyone. I especially liked the role of Don Cheadle as Buck, the stereo salesman. The best performance is that BOOGIE NIGHTS was definitely Burt Reynolds. A classic of the 90s!
