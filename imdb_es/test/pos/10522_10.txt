I managed to record THE DION BROTHERS, out of television, (with commercials), in the early 80s. I lent it to many friends, all of whom agree that it is one of the best B-bandits movies ever made. One day, while walking to my apartment in New York, I saw Stacy Keach filming a scene for her television series, Mickey Spilane. We had a moment to chat, and I told him how much I enjoyed THE DION BROS, and I considered it a pure classic. He thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable film experiences of his career. He was very friendly and sincere, and I was grateful for the few moments he took to chat with a fan. This is a classic that needs to be on DVD.
