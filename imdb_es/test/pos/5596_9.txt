Race Against Fear has to be one of the most moving television movies I've seen in a long time. All the performances of the main actors were excellent, especially that of Ariana Richards (Mickey Carlyle), William Bullimer (Coach Kurt Ansom) and Susan Blakely (Margaret Carlyle). Ariana, in particular, put an extremely emotional performance, with facial expressions to match. She described the emotions that Mickey was feeling perfectly, and you could easily believe that she really HAD been raped, so realistic was her performance. <br /> <br /> RAF is an incredibly realistic movie, due to the moving performances of the broadcast. Bullimer was incredibly well as a rapist, and you hated him more and more as the movie progressed. Blakely also had an emotional performance as the mother of the raped girl (Mickey Carlyle), and you felt more and more sorry for the Carlyle family because nobody believed them about the rape. <br /> <br /> In general, RAF is a great movie. It is poignant and full of suspense, as he is not sure if Ansom would be prosecuted for the violation, due to the lack of witnesses, evidence and belief in the claim. I highly recommend watching this movie.
