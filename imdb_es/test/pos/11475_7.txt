From box number 1, do you know that the good guy in the suit and tie is doomed? He has no luck ("Sorte Nula"), or so he believes with that music on the car radio, and the dubious conversation of his best friend and partner of the company that takes him to unknown places through a desert road. Alberto just wanted to be left alone, to take a flight abroad the next day, with ?? Well, someone left us guessing. <br /> <br /> Is the movie going a long way? what will you find short? to a final scene with the man who listens to the same music in a taxi to the airport. In the middle, several fortunate people have found different ways of getting out of history, some dying, others being born, others falling into anguished anguish. Is this time really condemned? Or is it? The film is a kind of individual show by director Fernando Fragata that only left the sound recording and special effects to other competent people. Those who normally reject Portuguese films due to sound problems and unclear voice recordings, should look for other topics to criticize this moment. The car accident (this is not spoilers, the film is too smart for THAT) makes it a great scene, and apparently was made with cheap equipment. (US Studios take note: you can save one or two dollars by hiding competent Portuguese directors!) <br /> <br /> The rest was done by Frigate, from the script to the dialogue, from the work of the camera to the editing . If a part of the dialogue was improvised, then again he should be congratulated for the direction of the performance and for the casting with mostly inexperienced actors. A lot of parties that do not speak are credited, but most of those people were used for the video clip and the performance, and they were widely used in the film's promotional trailer. The cast has a dozen actors and actresses, of which ten are relevant people and a large number of relationships? that reveal themselves step by step, in an exciting way, of suspense, that remembers the best genre authors. 'Alfred Hitchcock' (qv) and 'Claude Chabrol' (qv) come to mind, for the game of cat and mouse between the director and his audience, and the nature of his characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this thriller and comedy to Portuguese-speaking speakers and, if the film comes to have a decent translation of its colloquial dialogue, to anyone abroad who enjoys those genres.
