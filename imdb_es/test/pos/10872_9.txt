Would you like to know why the French and Italians love each other / hate each other? Would you like to take a look at the story that drives our life? Then, go see the Virzi movie (in its original language, of course) and you will see a wonderful Monica Bellucci who finally speaks her mother tongue from Citt√† di Castello (Umbria, right on the border with Tuscany). And the rest of the characters talking Livornese (the lovely Sabrina Impacciatore and all the others). Daniel Auteuil definitely in his shoes with Napoleon. Lots of fun, a true fresco of the landscape of Elba Island and an image about the political reasons to kill or leave alive a tyrant (good forever).
