If the genre Caper owes much to Walter Huston, he also owes a debt of gratitude to Jules Dassin, a man who was ahead of his time and who suffered a lot due to his blacklist when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a communist. The end of his career in the United States would have meant the end of Dassin, but moving to Europe proved that he was bigger than the same people who contributed to his death in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> "Rififi" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to the vision of Mr. Dassin. He decided to adapt the novel by Auguste Le Breton because he saw the possibilities of converting it into a caper film that became an instant classic. Jules Dassin did not have a penny in Paris when he discovered the city that would serve as the backdrop for his film. The bad weather paid off to Mr. Dassin since the streets were always wet and there was not much to do to show them that way. <br /> <br /> When we meet Tony for the first time, he is playing cards. Tony seems to be in poor health; He coughs all the time and sweats abundantly. After losing all his money, he goes to see Jo, the Swede, who tells him about the possibility of a robbery in Maupin & Webb, the elegant jewelry in a small section of Paris. They pass the idea through Mario, who suggests to Cesar, the Milanese, an expert in safe cracker. <br /> <br /> Tony, who recently left the prison, learns that Mado, his former lover is now with Grutter, a Creep who owns a nightclub. When confronting Mado, instead of loving, all he feels is contempt, and the meeting ends badly and he throws it out of its place. Grutter does not love Tony, who is his natural enemy because of his connection with Mado. <br /> <br /> When the day arrives, the gang may arrive at the apartment building on the second floor, just above. The jewelry, the owner lives, but he is far away. Everything is going well and the gang gets away with the jewels. CÃ©sar, the Milanese, a typical man of the ladies, takes a ring as a souvenir, which in turn gives the singer at the Grutter nightclub. This tactical error is the spark that unravels the plan well thought out. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais did an excellent Tony. He showed a tired man who was possibly doing his last robbery. Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel and the director, Jules Dassin, are seen as Jo, Mario and Cesar, the quartet's jewel thieves. Marie Sabouret plays Mado. Marcel Lupovici plays Grutter with a tenuous intensity. Robert Hussein, who would later direct films, impresses Remi, one of Grutter's men. <br /> <br /> The best asset of the film is the great camera work of Philippe Agostini, who captured the atmosphere of Paris and the places where all these criminals operate. The music of Georges Auric plays well with the action in the film. Jules Dassin was peculiar in his choice of films that he directed, and unfortunately, that is our loss because this man was a genius, as was demonstrated mainly with "The naked city", "Night and the city" and "Rififi".
