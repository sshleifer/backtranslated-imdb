I saw it for the first time in the 70s on syndicated television and I admired its production values, which were high tech at that time. The remastered video is rich and colorful, much more intense than the pale 35mm TV prints. This film deserves more attention: it paved the way for UFO, Space: 1999 and even Star Wars with its detailed miniatures and ingeniously conceived gadgets. Of course, the story of an alternative planet anti-matter Earth has been recycled hundreds of times since Star Trek, but the beauty of this film is its self-conscious European design style: from the space motors of Rolls Royce to the "Euro Sec". The letterhead business, JFSS or Dopplegangers as it was called in Europe is nice for the imaginary vision of Europe in space in the shadow of superpowers. The ambitious epic of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson becomes a bit tedious when the American astronaut finally realizes that he is on the planet Doppleganger, and everything is literally downhill after the poetically elegant shuttle's boarding sequence. A mediocre story is aided by a great classical and lyrical score of the late great Barry Gray, John Williams of Great Britain.
