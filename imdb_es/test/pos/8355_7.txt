Well, first of all, it's not a bad movie. It's good, and I like the introduced characters. I also like the voices of Lady and Tramp more in this. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to see Lady And Tramp more. I know it says' Scamp's Adventure ', and I love Scamp And Angel in parts, but it's a sequel to the original, where, in my opinion, they should have released it as' Scamp's Adventure', not 'Lady And The Tramp II: The Adventure of Scamp '. <br /> <br /> Tramp had a good role, but he did not have much time with Lady. <br /> <br /> But anyway, the songs are pretty good, and Scamp and angel are sweet I've seen better sequels, but hey, it's not a failure. <br /> <br /> I give it 7/10. Very good, but still had flaws.
