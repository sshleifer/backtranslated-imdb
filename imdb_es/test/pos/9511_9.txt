I have never seen a file in a language that I do not understand only because I wanted to see the movie and I could not find it with subs in English. I do not know how much I missed but it was not much. Probably only specific details that sound silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact with each other. I want to mention to The Diceman of Germany that there is no reason to feel that "it sucks" when it comes to commenting on the emotional force of the film. As I said, I do not understand Japanese, or at least just the small amount that I got when reading the very extensive novel, probably my favorite book of all time, that I could not stop reading and I took the next day. Work just to finish reading! I do not know if there is a dubbed or replaced version in English, but if the movie, but if there is one, I would love to see it. The movie was amazing in Japanese nothing better is the icing on the cake! Slainte ', Maegi
