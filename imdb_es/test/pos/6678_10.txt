I just saw this and it was amazing. I had serious doubts about the rental of the DVD or not. So if you are ... and you like to watch action films that do not have a brain ... do not hesitate. Do not let the boring deck discourage you. The script is one of the best of all time. Intelligent, fun, original, touching and keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout the film. I had already seen another movie just before this one and I was very sleepy, and I usually get bored seeing a second movie in one night, but it really woke me up and I had no boring moments. It also made me rethink many things in life and it gave me a very good feeling. <br /> <br /> The performance is also excellent (one of Kevin Spacey's best roles). The images are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen. If I have to find something negative to say about it ... well ... I really can not find anything ... Enjoy it! 10 out of 10
