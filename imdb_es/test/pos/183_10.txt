This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest milestones in the history of cinema. Seeing this film, we can only retrospectively note that world cinema in the 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy, such a strong and adequate use of the montage of sound images and an almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life . Cinema was not then a single art form. He was much taller than ordinary life and gave many people the hope of living after the tragic war. It is said that even Picasso was moved and shouted that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years! Audience that time was also different. I read that after seeing Kurosawa's "Ikiru (Live)" on his first release, the young couple said quietly: "It's a good movie, right?" I think that contemporary cinema, although technically developed and opened a new narrative perspective, has lost the most important thing: public confidence. Cienma was once the most popular art and, unlike modern fine arts and contemporary music, gave millions of people. People wait and ideals. In this point of view, "Letyat zhuravli" must be in the pantheon of the classics of all time, such as "City light", "Ikiru" and "La Strada".
