Imagine that you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a child. Now think what would happen if you had the opportunity to talk to your younger self, or even change it. Would you try to influence or change the beliefs of your youngest self in the light of your future experience? Or maybe the meeting would change the perception of life and reality of your greater self? <br /> <br /> Walt Disney's The Kid tries to get involved with this complex thought by putting "the older one" Bruce Willis on a collision course with the "youngest self" Spenser Breslin (from The Santa Clause 2 and The Cat in the Hat) fame ") The result is a sometimes funny, sometimes moving encounter that makes you reflect on your own past, present and future, and really believes that it is never too late to change its course.
