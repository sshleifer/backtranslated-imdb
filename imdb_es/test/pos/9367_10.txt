The best real image of 1947 also deals with anti-Semitism and is superior to the AGREEMENT OF MEN by Elia Kazan (the eventual winner of the Academy Awards that year) in practically all departments. The almost perfect direction of Edmard Dmytryk, the smooth script of John Paxton and the expert expressionist lighting of J. Roy Hunt are wonderfully encouraged by an excellent cast. Although Robert Young (playing an easy, methodical and very nice policeman) and Robert Mitchum (who actually has some witty and carefree comments) are the stars of the film, are the Oscar nominees Robert Ryan and Gloria Grahame, as well as Paul Kelly, in the small but fundamental role of the pathetic husband of Grahame, who grants the most memorable characterizations of the film; Ryan proved as convincing as a racist homicide who was eventually pigeonholed for a while, excelling in equally evil roles in films like ACT OF VIOLENCE (1948), CAUGHT (1948), THE RACKET (1951), CLASH BY NIGHT (1952), THE NAKED SPUR (1953) and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK (1955). The film is also notable for its atypical structure, since Ryan's "flashback" sequence, a complete fabrication, was filmed in a direct manner, while the real truth emerges from the nebulous and distorted memories of the true protagonist of the film that, moreover, He did not even play with any of the stars in the movie! In addition, CROSSFIRE had originally treated homosexuality (according to the original novel by Richard Brooks, "The Brick Foxhole"), but this taboo subject was unacceptable to the Hays Office at that time, very far from the situation we have today when (at less) 3 gay-themed films are competing for this year's main Oscars! <br /> <br /> The print used for Warner's DVD transfer shows some unfortunate signs of wear sometimes, but the Audio The commentary by noir experts, James Ursini and Alain Silver, is good, although I do not share its opinion that Dmytryk's career steadily decreased after his HUAC problems, such as excellent images as THE SNIPER (1952), THE CAINE MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), THE YOUNG LIONS (1958), WARLOCK (1959) and MIRAGE (1965) amply demonstrate; Having said that his collaborations at RKO with producer Adrian Scott and screenwriter John Paxton - MURDER, MY SWEET (1944), CORNERED (1945, I hope this is part of the next Warners Film Noir Box Set) and CROSSFIRE - are their best moment work. In any case, in my opinion, the latter is not only one of the key films of the 1940s, but also one of the best novels made to date.
