There are other films about internships and pranks by students and staff, but "The Belles of St. Trinian's" is rising above all! The plot has been summarized in depth by other posters, so I will not cover the same ground. I just want to say that it's a shame that it's finally on DVD, but in a format that can not be used in the US. US! :-( <br /> <br /> Enjoy, fanatical friends in New Zealand and Australia! And if someone reading this has any influence on these issues, PLEASE help him to be released on DVD with the coding of the Region 1! In addition, it is possible to receive an email notification when (I do not say "yes") it is published on DVD in the United States.Thanks!
