Ocean's 12 <br /> <br /> 'If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you'. (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard) <br /> <br /> This adage is certainly true in this sequel. Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and his compadres were the ones who scammed him and now he wants to get everything back. The Ocean gang needs a lot of money and fast, but it can not work in the states since Benedict has made it impossible for them. So we go to Europe to perform acts of death that challenge the theft, while we try to avoid Catherine's super cop Zeta Jones, an old flame from Rusty's past (Pitt). <br /> <br /> In their first robbery in Amsterdam, they discovered that who had attacked them was the 'Night Fox', a super astute thief with a complex of legends. He issues them with a challenge that could cancel their debt in full or take them to some kind of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-live-type-sequence. Interesting? Okay, yes. Slow? A kind of Entertaining? Mainly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Much. <br /> <br /> Ocean and its band of happy men are charismatic, and nothing else, and since this is a continuation and we are all old friends, we see many more situations and "fun" conversations. Too many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins ​​are fighting like we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's cock-er-ney accent is as bad as ever (I really like Cheadle, but I could not stand it). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling their glasses and reading their minds. However, what worked so well in the last movie was the lack of development of the character compared to how skilful the whole damn operation was. And as much as these actors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this movie like a large square peg in an 11-sided hole. She just does not fit in and her chemistry with Pitt is nonexistent. <br /> <br /> The stars of this film for me, however, were Vincent Cassel as the location choice of Night Fox and Soderbergh. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he had been born in both. His Night Fox is arrogant, "terribly arrogant with the lives of other people" (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast with the Ocean gang. This is where I think the movie loses its way. Cassel and the European locations offer a too realistic contrast with American actors and the style of the first film. We want skillful, impetuous and sharp; Not gritty, considerate and intellectual. This is where the movie does not work. <br /> <br /> It's true that you can not repeat the same formula twice in the lyrics, but going to the left or to the right usually does more harm than good in a conventional movie like this one. .
