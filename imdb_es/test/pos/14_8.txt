I attended an anticipated screening of this film without knowing what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; Both have delivered less memorable performances and films. While the underlying "general" plot is somewhat familiar, this movie was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher offered powerful performances playing extremely well with each other. The weaknesses and human strengths of their respective characters were incredibly interpreted by both; The scene in which Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the rescue elite of the Coast Guard was the most unforgettable emotional moment of the film. The "specific" story was an education in itself that represents the personal sacrifice and the demanding physical training that the rescuers of the elite Coast Guard must perform in the preparation of their only job and responsibility ... to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and "wowing" ... I have not seen seas so angry since "The Perfect Storm". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's "Carnivale", it's a pleasure to see him again) played the captain of Kodiak base, Alaska Coast Guard, in a strong and compelling role as a leader with the prerequisite and the necessary ice water in his veins. The film, wonderfully, and finally, the Coast Guard is expected and respected for a long time; I had the audience applauding at the end.
