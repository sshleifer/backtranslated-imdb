So I turned on the television today at 1:00 p.m. of a Sunday, hoping to see false information and infomercials, and this great movie was just beginning, I did not know what it was but it attracted me almost immediately. The movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> there were a couple of things that did not make sense to one that I do not understand why the dead man was talking about doing things to get out of your bad situation, but then Jimmy does not do anything except the basic things to survive that anyone would do in their situation, in other words, it was not their initiative that got him out of his bad situation, it was just luck, second, I do not. find out that the girl killed the mobsters at the end, because everything was partly invoked by the thief who stole Panda's money, and then the other thief kills Panda at the end, so they steal the money twice and kill him how is that good
