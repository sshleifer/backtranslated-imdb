I've been seeing King of Queens from the beginning, and I felt that it was overlooked in the awards. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk a lot at work, because I work in a company very similar to IPS (DHL) and we love Teamster plugs. Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she puts it there, no matter what the theme. Arthur well, what can you say? He simply breaks you, and really turns things around. Doug, well, he's very nice and funny, the three characters, and all the friends just complete the show. This is the best comedy on TV !! I'd say up there with Seinfeld, and hey, there's nothing wrong with that ... Excellent! as Doug would say.
