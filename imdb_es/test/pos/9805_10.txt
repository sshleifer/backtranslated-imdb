I rented the movie and I liked it so much that I bought it. Elijah Wood (Mikey) and Joseph Mazello (Bobby) stand out as the two children. His new stepfather physically abuses Bobby. The abuse is implicit, for the most part, it is not seen, and it aroused a lot of passion in me to help abused children. The film has a magical quality, since children's imagination helps them find a way to deal with abuse. You have to try to understand the story from a child's point of view. I'm still thinking about the end. I have seen the movie 3 or 4 times and every time I think of possible new meanings. I'm not sure what Richard Donner wanted me to think, but this is an excellent movie! Joseph Mazello and Elijah Wood will make you embrace your children.
