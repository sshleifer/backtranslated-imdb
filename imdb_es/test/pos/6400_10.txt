I think "Key West" could do well as a DVD. There are probably many failed Star Treks that never had the chance to succeed. We will never know if this could have been a great series. I'd love to know if there's a way to watch older shows like this or if they're just another Hollywood footnote. Is it possible to find copies of these programs so that we, the fans of life, can enjoy them again? The show had a great talent for writing and some, if not all, of the episodes left you with a sense of the characters that are often missing in today's hit shows. Often, I had the feeling of learning something from the story lines and I entertained myself a lot. The very unique characters. Thank you.
