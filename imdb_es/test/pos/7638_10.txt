I saw this movie thinking that it was going to be absolutely horrible and that it was ready for all the itching, bad special effects, etc. But I was pleasantly surprised. I do not mean it's the best vampire movie I've seen, but it's certainly not the worst. I liked the whole reality / alternative dream state that he played in the movie. The graphics were pretty good for a DVD movie and I liked the overall look of the movie. I enjoyed the main character Sai. Usually, I end up hating the protagonists, but there was something about her that kept me interested. Yes, she makes some bad decisions, but that was to be expected. Yes, the other characters were stereotyped, but I also expected that. I do not know if I would recommend this movie, but give it a try and it will pleasantly surprise you. I'm putting this on my list of guilty pleasures.
