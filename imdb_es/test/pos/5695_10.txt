BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to fully transcend its limitations (it is an independent film) by continually subverting expectations so that they emerge as an intense experience. <br /> <br /> In the tradition of all good animal-centered thrillers, for example, Jaws, The Edge, the original people of Cat, the directors know that moderation and what is not shown are the best ways to hit. The performances are real and exciting, the crocodile is extremely well done, in fact, if you think that the Black Water website is because they used real crocodiles and the location of the marsh is fabulous. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a Gore fest croc breaks forget about Black Water, but if you want an intelligent trip full of suspense that will make you fear the water and ask yourself what the hell it would do if that tree climbed, it is a must .
