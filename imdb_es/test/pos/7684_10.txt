When will ART overcome racism? I think the American people have grown since this movie was made. Porgy consists of a stellar cast and music. This film is an excellent adaptation of a great opera. that is, Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, Les Miz is based on a classic book. Recently, an opera has been presented here in Los Angeles, based on the movie The Fly. AN OPERA !! So be it!! <br /> <br /> Disney is hesitating about releasing Song of the South. The NAACP has not expressed any contest for career issues, and let's not forget that Amos N Andy was a great success in the 50s as a television series. Ethnicity is our heritage in the United States. UU And we must embrace all forms of ethnic artistic diversity. <br /> <br /> PLEASE LAUNCH 'PORGY' ON THE DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> j hartz
