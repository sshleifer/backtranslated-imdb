I really liked that movie !! Jack Black and Kyle Gass have probably made one of the best comedies since Up in Smoke. This movie has something for everyone: rock, drugs and Satan. What else could someone want? I suggest this movie to anyone who wants to sit down and forget about all the problems in the world and laugh. Even if the film does not do well in theaters, it will surely become a cult classic. I suggest that anyone who goes to see the film pick up D's first album, because many of the jokes are only funnier if you've listened to the songs (like JB's obsession with Sasquatch and the epic battle against the devil). He laughs with a guarantee even if you have not listened to his music but the songs are so great that you can not let them go by.
