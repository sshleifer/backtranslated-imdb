The separate lies changed my life. Actually, the Q & A did. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS DOWN. Read only if you see trailers or if you have already seen it: <br /> <br /> The character of Emily Watson deceives the character of Tom Wilkonson. My first reaction to the puppy-eyed dog, Emily, was: "It's over, throw it away, bad luck." For some reason, he stayed. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened and tried to accept his needs. Sometimes he needed to leave. But he stayed with her and let her live her life. But I still wanted to see it <br /> <br /> Then, Julian, the screenwriter and director, talked about the movie. I'm glad he did, because, frankly, I'm also you and I was too immature to understand the point before he explained it to me. <br /> <br /> Tom's character loved her, and no matter how much his search for his needs might be at odds with what he wants, he would always love her. The relationship and love they shared was not a lie, all of a sudden, just because she wanted to be with someone else. The fact that she wanted to be with someone else did not make her who she was. When you are over fifty, there is a great possibility that the love of your life does not reappear, so you can not be as derogatory as when you were younger. You have to try and make things work, because the alternative can be much worse. <br /> <br /> I needed what I needed and I could not help it. He had to learn to let her go if he wanted to be the complete man he could be. He helped her chase her lover, even when it hurt. <br /> <br /> Another thing: Julian said that the most powerful tool of a controller is the fault. <br /> <br /> Again: the strongest tool of a controller is the fault. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Tom freed her of her burden. He felt the need to let her know that he loved her, but not to get her back; I wanted to let him know that I did not have to feel guilty or think badly about the relationship, simply because it ended in such a terrible way. <br /> <br /> It is not my way of reviewing a movie based on the message, instead of the execution, especially when I understand that message better when the director explains it to me, but here I make an exception, since I feel more mature than I would like to see the movie. <br /> <br /> The execution of the shooting was a good British step. Rupert was slobbering and disgusting. Tom and Emily were his generally solid and real characters.
