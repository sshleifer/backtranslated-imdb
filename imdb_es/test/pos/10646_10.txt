/ * may contain SPOILERS, but of course it does not matter :) * / <br /> <br /> Battleship Potemkin is an impressive spectacle of disturbing images. The visual direction is (well, and has been) inspiring, the magnitude of the film is impressive, and the technique is certainly pioneering. What is really surprising is, in my opinion, the depth and effectiveness of a film, without the proper literary script, sound (except the soundtrack), decent image quality, false-deep (referentialism) (auto ) of today, exceptional performance, pretension, etc. What you get is a purely visual experience to be remembered. <br /> <br /> By the way, the previous poster noted: "Eisenstien felt after much suffering for giving the heroes what they wanted, the problem is that you think Eisenstein is preparing for a big final fight and then you It's a little cheap, I'd rather have seen a great scene of final action. " <br /> <br /> I must warn you that The end is not cheap, and Eisenstein was not being generous with the heroes. The story, however, was. Potemkin really went through the squadron as was shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I highly recommend seeing Battleship Potemkin to anyone who is more or less seriously interested in the cinema. Seeing him with a movie partner, he kept me talking for hours. However, if you tend to think that movies, generally accepted as "big" or "classic", are "slow" or "boring", this movie may not be for you yet. There is not much cheap entertainment here. <br /> <br /> Although for me, it's a full 10/10.
