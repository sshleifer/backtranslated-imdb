I agree with one of the messages here that the book is not like the movie. I read the book as a sophomore in high school in Sumter SC. Instantly I fell in love with the book and waited anxiously for the launch of the mini series. As much as I liked the movie and I thought it was very well made, I was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book. I was glad that Orry was not killed as he did in Love and War or N & S II. <br /> <br /> Having grown up in SC and graduated from University of SC, I fell in love with southern history because of this Mini series and book. I had the honor of meeting John Jakes at a symposium in 1988 at the USC. Then I stayed and I found Mr.Jakes. Unfortunately, I could not ask a question. But knowing him was a sufficient honor. I specialized in accounting, but I obtained my specialty in Southern Studies. In addition, I followed many of my manners after Orry Main. Orry and I are very similar. I feel like I was born 150 years too late. I am a southern gentleman and I am very proud of this. <br /> <br /> Well, I fell in love with 2 women in the movie ... Genie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne. Man, I had the hots for Wendy !! I could never find a real version of it. I hope that one day too!
