A stranger should be able to trip over "Classe Tous Risques" just by chance; it should be on any "best of film-noir" list, including the IMDb list. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as good as ever; knowing his grave and delicate family situation gives more weight to his almost expressionless face and his brief dialogues. The moderate performance of Belmondo under the firm direction of Sautet only shows how wonderful the actor could have been, and should have been. <br /> <br /> "Classe Tous Risques" is absolutely minimal, dry and cold, without Melville's artistic setting, beautiful faces and luxury cars. The encounter with the cinema-noir is almost neo-realistic. Davos's few harsh words to his children that describe his secret life from there, hold you in your throat until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The final sentence of the film, a narration in off of the end of Davos in no more than ten dry and gloomy words, leaves you with a strong punch in the stomach. <br /> <br /> A true jewel in the great crown of French cinema.
