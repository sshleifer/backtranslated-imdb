The crazy career of Scottish warriors, abandoned in outer space, without food and without budget, began to go down to three, who will help these men of pillage, with visual effects that stink, but I liked a little the strange being, if I ran into one and then I would run away, but not if I had Scottish companions, we would swear and avoid fate, so in the end it was not a failure, it was a DVD that I'm glad to have seen, but if they ever do a sequel, they abandon some actors , not all are equal, some were good, they acted harshly, some were made of wood, and maybe they should pack it, but the action kept me watching everything, the shots, the screams, it did not stop, I will tell my friends not to be afraid and to look again in another year.
