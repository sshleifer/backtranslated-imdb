Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde. <br /> <br /> Michael McGuire was the father. <br /> <br /> Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon. <br /> <br /> Did you see this movie? ? I doubt it! <br /> <br /> Blankfield was quite popular at this time for playing pills doctors on Fridays. Thomerson has been fun in everything he does, from movies to series to comedies. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this HBO movie in '82 and the tape is pretty worn. One of the funniest shots of the Jekyll & Hyde theme. <br /> <br /> Of course. With all the references to cocaine in this film, it would be criticized as too politically incorrect today, like Cheech and Chong. Pity, because it is FUN, FUN, FUN!
