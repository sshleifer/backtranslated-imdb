The BBC surpassed itself with the limits that crossed with Tipping the Velvet. In the past they have been 'daring' with the works of Dennis Potter, but this miniseries (as projected in the UK) is excellent. Andrew Davies' work is top-notch. I have not read Sarah Water's novel, but I imagine that she has done it with justice. Comment on the extravagance (most men have seen it for that) proved to be an important point of conversation and sale when originally announced. The fact is that, according to the lesbian side of society, in the 1800s, it was the time when most thought they were old men and hired guys. Well, it was. The lesbianism was developed mainly behind closed doors and often respectable. <br /> <br /> You can also see Tipping The Velvet as a 'love story', actually it is, as well as a 'self discovery' that many homosexuals and heterosexual and heterosexual people make and comments on this happen and they repeat all the time. <Br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, whether it's repeated on TV or on DVD, get it, they'll treat you, and even the production and filming are perfect. Just try to hide your blushes in parts, as I said, "obscene" is the order of the day, and be careful with a "phallus" or two! <br /> <br /> Enjoy it!
