"The Vicious Circle" is a very unknown British mystery story. Like many Hitchcock films, it is about a man who is being accused of a crime he did not commit, and does everything possible to prove it. This time it's a Dr. Latimer (John Mills), who finds a murdered German actress from his apartment. As an honest man, the doctor calls Scotland Yard, which turns out to be a big mistake ... <br /> <br /> There's really nothing special about this little movie. However, watching the movie is an entertaining way to spend time. I enjoyed following the development of the plot. Good actors are a plus.
