Minor spoilers <br /> <br /> In Chicago, Grace Beasley (Kathy Bates) is a housewife who has a marriage of twenty-five years with attorney Max Beasley (Dan Aykroyd) and a hysterical and psychotic dwarf-in-law, Maudey ( Meredith Eaton). Grace adores singer Victor Fox (Jonathan Price), who will present a television show in Chicago and give five spots in the front row in a television promotion. Kate calls the program and earns a ticket, when Max simultaneously asks for a divorce, claiming their lives are too monotonous. Grace is depressed, and when she goes to the show, the audience is informed that a serial killer from Chicago, who uses a crossbow, killed Victor Fox. With a broken heart, he decides to fly to England to Victor Fox's funeral. There, She realizes that he was gay and befriends his former partner Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). They fly to Chicago, trying to find the killer. This movie is a charming, original and strange dramatic comedy, with strange characters. It has great potential to be a cult film, with the presence of Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow, and a joke with Nicolas Roeg's masterpiece "Do not look now," when Maudey wears a red raincoat in the underground part of Chicago. . The beginning of the film, with Jonathan Price singing 'Hitchcock Railway', is wonderful. I have repeated it four times in a row. The cast has a magnificent performance, highlighting Kathy Bates, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton. In fact, this movie is an excellent entertainment. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Amor a Toda Prova' ('Love to the test')
