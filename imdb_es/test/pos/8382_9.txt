Brad Pitt sticks his index finger into the wound in Diane Kruger's leg and holds it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly like that. The invented thread takes to "The Dirty Dozen" and, sometimes, leaves it to pay homage to other films. Too much fun. Even "Paris when it sizzles" is mentioned in a deliciously organic dialogue. I was touched by the character of Christoph Waltzer and his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There is a peculiarity in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. Fortunately, his hand. Your brain and your heart are visible everywhere.
