Okay, so start in an unimaginative way with a narration of the main character (Justine played by Laura Fraser, an amazing actress in her own right), but it becomes miraculous. It has silly little things that you really should not find funny but that you should do every time. There is an especially memorable moment in which his jaw drops to the floor the first time he watches her when Jake's male body, which contains Justine's female mind, is trying to get used to his new anatomy. I will not spoil it for you, but the second time I saw it was with friends; Seeing their faces was brilliant. It makes you tremble, but laugh at the same time. I'm also a big fan of the music used. There is a beautiful little band that appears randomly on the street or on a path from time to time, but also some beautiful pop songs, but unknown (often the best ones). It feels like it was written for an English cast by an American writer, which bothers me only a couple of times. In general, this movie is hilarious. I am a big fan of Laura Fraser now, after they gave me their movie for my birthday, and I hope that, although some of the cast members are little known to most, you will also enjoy every part.
