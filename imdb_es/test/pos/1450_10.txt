I am fifteen years old and I have seen thirty-three of Sinatra's films (not counting the videos of television programs and documentaries) and only two of them have impressed me. '' Till the Clouds Roll By, "and" The Miracle of the Bells "do not count, however, considering that in the first part all he does is sing a magnificent" Ol 'Man River ", and in the last one he does not The half is bad, just the picture is pathetic.My favorite albums, radio shows, TV shows and movies about Sinatra change almost every day, everything takes a different connotation in each visualization and, sometimes, it seems the best It has done and, sometimes, the worst, until the cycle reappears, but there are a couple of things that can not be compared. With regard to the films, "The Man with the Golden Arm" tops the list Everyone who knows anything about Sinatra knows that he thought this was the best, he was always nominated for an Oscar, it was the first serious look at drug addiction, etc., etc. The jazz score is unforgettable, the sympathy of Kim Novak despite the ridiculous accent, Eleanor Parker is annoying and very d ram√°tica, the turtle like Arnold Stang is fun the fi For the first time, but more and more shameful, and Darren McGavin is a wonderfully viscous drug trafficker, the sets are not convincing. At first glance, it looks like a peculiar mixed bag launched by the great Otto Preminger with an off-center charm. <br /> <br /> Then you come to Sinatra. Like everything else in his life, apart from music, the reports of his performance are always divided in half. Directors like Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Otto Preminger, all agreed that Sinatra had worked as hard in his films as he did in singing, which had been among the best actors in the world - if not the greatest. Humphrey Bogart even said: "This guy has the most natural acting talent I've ever seen." Not bad for a man who never took an acting lesson in his life, at the same time produced the discography that would make him "the best singer of the twentieth century" and made almost all his scenes in one shot. <br /> <br /> In direct conflict with all this, are the other reviews and biographies that sniff arrogantly about how evil this Mr.Sinatra was, and how many "bad" movies he did. The question will never be answered to the satisfaction of all, because the controversy was one of Sinatra's greatest assets, and both arguments in a certain sense were playing into his hand. In any case, at this moment, in this role, Sinatra is magnificent. One critic said in the late fifties: "Sinatra may not be the best actor in the world, but there is nobody more fascinating to watch." No matter what Sinatra does in a movie, it's hard to take his eyes off her. This, of course, is a "charisma" that I have only seen in a handful of other people: Orson Welles, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, perhaps James Cagney. There's no real definition for that and it often makes it difficult to figure out if you're really enjoying a performance or simply spellbound, but the quality shown here is what makes the film. Sinatra is really fascinating, real, intense: it transcends decades and thousands of pop stars from paper dolls with something called quality. Whether we like it or not, this is a one-man show with some character actors in the background. Cover every emotion with remarkable subtlety, from the sweet and lonely tenderness with Kim Novak to the terrifying shock of Frank Sinatra (Frank Sinatra!) Moaning and screaming in the agony of the "cold turkey". Sinatra was right: this is his best performance. No doubt. <br /> <br /> I was eight years old when Frank Sinatra died. I was not present for all the years of bobby-soxers and '' Anchors Aweigh '', Mr. Ava Gardner and '' From Here to Eternity, "albums with lanterns and" swing lovers ", Kennedy, Vegas, ring-a - ding ding, Basie and Mia and Reagan and concerts from Madison Square Garden to South Africa to the White House to the sands, I can not say I like Sinatra because I heard it at Paramount or because I hear "September of my years" autobiographically, The usual excuses ... And my excuse? When I was eleven years old I saw a movie called "In the city" ...
