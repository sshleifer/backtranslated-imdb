I am a great movie enthusiast and also an active rugby player who believes that rugby is the best game ever played. Forever Strong is a mix of Coach Carter and sloppy rugby. This movie is full of great acting characters, well developed and in action that will make you dodge and dodge in your seat, but with more arm tackles than pee wee football and almost every shot is cut as soon as a player touches the ground . Filmed to look almost like soccer. If you want your children to see a movie that will create a character from within and that can inspire a blind person to see again, I can easily give you 9 out of 10, if you want to see a great rugby movie that really shows the sport. You will have to wait for the next one because Forever Strong is mainly practice, career and a ruck movie, that's why I give it a 7.75 out of 10.
