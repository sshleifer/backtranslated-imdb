I think this is a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it VERY interesting for me. It's blatantly obvious once you look at it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for The Simpsons thugs. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney and Tony is Dolph. There is even an episode of The Simpsons where Jimbo uses the line "I played with a stick". <br /> <br /> Jimbo-Layne's connection is the most obvious with the knit hat, the long hair and the voice. Kearney has a shaved head, unlike John, but she is big and silly. The Tony-Dolph connection is quite obvious with the long and separate haircut and even the second level status.
