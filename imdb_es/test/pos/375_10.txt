When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGE ON A TRAIN, it was a harbinger that most of the film was made public because he was back at his best. From 1946 to 1950, his films were not blockbusters, and his contractual agreement with David O. Selznick ended because of this. He actually made some really good movies in the period, such as NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, UNDER CAPRICORN, ROPE, and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. However, while the likes of NOTORIOUS and SPELLBOUND were discouraged, Hitch's attempts to experiment with experimentation: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali on SPELLBOUND was acceptable, as was the scenario among psychiatrists. But the experiment with long shots in ROPE confused the audience (ignoring the merits of that movie), and Hitch's willingness to let the audience be fooled by a lie told by a main character in a flashback was not well received, much more upset than then deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK. A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of its star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini was unleashed) made it look like a failure (and it was not like that). THE PARADINO CASE was another failure, and one that really had little in its favor. <br /> <br /> With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, Hitchcock avoided the special tricks that interested him in recent movies. Instead, he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the story was about how Guy Haines, a professional tennis player, meets a fan of his, Bruno Anthony, a playboy, who travels on a cruise train at the same time as the athlete. Bruno is talkative and flatter, and Guy sees him as one of the typical fans he has met ... although a little eccentric, with his talk of wanting to be in the first rocket to outer space. But Bruno knows all about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous girl named Miriam, and is in love with Anne Morton, the daughter of a senator. Bruno knows that Miriam will not divorce her famous successful husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize: he hates his stepfather, who criticizes him constantly. Then Bruno mentions (more or less, unknowingly) an idea he has about two men, technically unknown, who exchange murders for each other and then commit two perfect crimes, with no solution, instead of torpedoing them. Guy hears the idea, and accepts that it is an interesting idea. The train arrives at Guy's destination, and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He simply does not realize that Bruno, the "eccentric", is a sociopath, and believes that Guy has just accepted that the two kill the enemy. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's a wonderfully simple plot. Bruno, of course, kills Miriam, but expects Guy to comply with the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrified, and what's worse, he finds he's the number one suspect in the police department. When Bruno, to encourage Guy, mentions that he has the latter's lighter (he kept it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site, Guy encounters deeper problems: how to avoid the police and how to control (if it's possible). ) The crazy Bruno? <br /> <br /> Hitch always planned the shots of his film with care, so that from the beginning we see our "heroes" from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting on the train. There are constant crossed contacts used in the movie to show how the two men are attracted to each other's orbits. It's like fate uniting them together. However, both have their own personality, and Hitch, with a typical twist, makes the crazy Bruno more an attractive figure. His plan can be vicious (he will kill two people if he succeeds, and he will make Guy live up to the agreement, no matter what) but he has enthusiasm for life. One suspects that once Guy also had one, but the failure of his marriage, together with his current socially prominent wife, has made him more prudent and bored than he is. <br /> <br /> The cast is also good. Robert Walker probably had his best role in this movie (just a year before his death). He was very far from being the boy next to the house of SINCE THAT YOU LEFT OR THE CLOCK. Her slender figure also looked quite elegant in stories in various scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts as a cousin to his co-murderer in ROPE, especially because circumstances make him increasingly suspicious of the authorities (since his earlier role made his nervous behavior increasingly suspicious of Jimmy Stewart) . As for the ladies, Kasie Rogers is as lazy as Miriam, which allows the public to be prepared for his disappearance (in a famous sequence of shots in the reflection of his glasses) so that they are actually encouraging Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears as Anne's younger sister (Ruth Roman), who looks a lot like Miriam, and accidentally puts Bruno on a social occasion. She plays this strange role well. Ruth Roman suitably supports Granger, but her role is limiting because she is an establishment in her past and, in a way, discreet. Other supporting actors, Leo G. Caroll as senator, Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno's mother and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of Walker's violence are shown to the best advantage, all in hand of a teacher.
