I recently discovered this fantastic series and it seems that I can not get enough with Garner's relaxed PI. The programs continuously show an excellent level of writing and episodes of suspense. <br /> <br /> This episode, Sleight of Hand, is a bit different. Leave the humor in favor of a more serious turn for Rockford while looking for his missing girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The mystery is great and its revelation is convincing enough. It is based on a book (I do not remember the name) and could easily have extended to an episode of duration. Garner excels here, as Rockford becomes hard and really means business. This has a feeling of "noir" until the end, the dark lighting and the general mood echo the great dark thrillers of the 40s and 50s. <br /> <br /> Very good episode in a series of class A. Easily deserves a 10.
