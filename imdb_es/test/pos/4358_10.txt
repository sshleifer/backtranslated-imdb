This film stands as one of the most amazing examples of attractive and artistic films I've seen. Herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of Dieter's story, as well as his endearing personal character. At the end of the film, I was looking forward to having had the opportunity to meet Dieter before his death. <br /> <br /> In a technical note, the cinematography is intimate and astonishingly beautiful. The narrative is intricately woven, with great awareness of the subject and its ability to relive and recreate traumatic events. Few documentary directors have such a strong ability to invest the audience in the character. This movie is a must!
