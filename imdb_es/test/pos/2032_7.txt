Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid movie in all aspects. Everything, from acting to cinematography, was solid. It is not a perfectly linear line, but there was nothing you could not see coming. Maybe a little melodramatic in the points, but once again, a pretty decent movie, nonetheless. Definitely worth checking out. If you have questions about which movie to rent during the weekend, try it out. Even if you do not feel like running out to buy it, I think it's worth it.
