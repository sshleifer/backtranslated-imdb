I went to see this movie because Joaquim de Almeida was in it. Joaquim had a pretty small part, so it was good that I liked the movie for himself. In fact, I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on two characters, Albert and Louie. Albert is a shy, withdrawn guy, and Louie ... well, Louie is not. The story revolves around Louie's request to Albert to let him come to Albert's place for a moment. Louie just got out of jail. <br /> <br /> Albert and Louie have known each other since childhood, and of course, when they do something together, there are problems and Albert is always at risk. <br /> <br /> The action of the film is based on the adventures that derive from the visit of Louie. On The Run is a chronicle of madness, madness, situations. However, Bruno de Almeida and the screenwriter, Joseph Minion (After Hours), do not always take him where he expects to go. There are twists and turns that add depth to this movie. Of course, there is a lot of open comedy, but there is also a lot of subtle humor. <br /> <br /> There are also some really good performances here. Albert is played deliciously by Michael Imperioli. He is becoming well known these days of the HBO series, The Sopranos. <br /> <br /> John Ventimiglia plays Louie, who imbues his character with an adorable and childlike quality. (No matter what he does, you must love Louie!). <br /> <br /> Both actors are excellent in their individual characters. With Imperioli, you'll want to hug him and take him home with mom. Ventimiglia, well, you will not know if you should slap her or take her home (and NOT mom!). <p> <br /> <br /> There are also other featured presentations. The character of Rita is played by Drena DeNiro (yes, Robert's daughter). The audience adored her. When talking with the others who watched the movie, it was fun to discuss whether it was Albert or Louie who was their favorite of the two. But everyone loved Rita! <br /> <br /> Is this movie perfect? No, I can not say that it is. There were many times when I would have liked the director to have had a bigger budget to work with. There were some scenes that cried out for more budgetary freedom. (Give this guy a decent budget to work with and I think he's going to see a movie that will make him stand up and realize). <br /> <br /> The final sequence was a small victim of the budget. However, in my opinion, the budget or no budget, the final screen capture, brought together the talent of the actor and the director in a memorable and emotionally effective scene. <br /> <br />
