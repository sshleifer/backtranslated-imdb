A short-lived crime show that spawned three movie spin-offs (Naked Gun 1, 2 and 3), this is a fast-paced, on-your-face, fast-fire comedy that has more hits than failures. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen plays Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent detective who works his way through cases, with the capable assistant of his boss, Captain Ed Hocken. <br /> <br /> The story lines are spurious, at best, but it is deliberate, since the goodness here does not lie in the telling of the story, but in the fabric of a constant uproar of jokes along with some really strange and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> The jokes themselves come in many forms, be they word games, slaps, word games or background gags, most of them hitting the place, although some fall a little flat. It is inevitable with this approach of 'gag every few seconds' that some will fail, but the proportion is good. <br /> <br /> The characters are a delight. From the guest star of the week, dying in the first seconds of each episode, the laboratory scientist who seems to be performing cruel and unusual experiments on children to show off the shine of the shoe that is a form of oracle, the writing is witty and sharp as a cashier. <br /> <br /> Although it was not particularly successful at that time, it quickly developed a cult, many blaming the relative lack of success of the programs on being too ahead of their time and too sophisticated for the target audience, including the main Nothing less than Matt 'The Simpsons' Groening: and he should know. <br /> <br /> Dated by today's standards, if you can see through that aspect, you are ready for a gift.
