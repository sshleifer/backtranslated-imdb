I have to make up for all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I see him every time I need him to pick me up. Okay, it's not like the sound of music, but it's so much fun if it's not your thing to choose movies. I adored Bobby Vann, who is late (and great), and James Shigeta has always been and always will be the favorite. I saw this when it first came out in theaters. I'm a big music fan and this is 100 times better than Twiggy in "The Boyfriend." It is a modern musical and should not be judged by everything that was before. It is best for dreamers like me, who would like to find this place: without diseases, without wars, without drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. This is just a good movie to feel good. That's what all the movies should be. The title song by Shaun Phillips is excellent and explains the full feel of the movie. If the performance is not the best, who cares. I love the idea of ​​the movie. Peter Finch, a very rigid actor, Liv Ullmann, magnificent as always, Sally Kellerman, surprisingly good voice, Michael York, typical, and Olivia Hussey, impressive, they all convinced me that they were normal factory people. None of them acted as an actor in a movie. They acted like real people, in the same way that I would act if I found this place. Divided between going home and staying there, amazed at everything. Yes, there are flaws in this movie, but know it, it's not Citizen Kane, it's a good musical feeling!
