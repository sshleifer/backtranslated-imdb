This was a safe "sleeper"! Much better than I thought! I never realized it was a horror movie ... and who was this magnificent baritoned voice bearer, called Vin Diesel ... adding spice and intrigue to this otherwise unproven movie? The monsters in this movie were quite unusual, they were not the same as the guys to gobble you up! The ending was also great, for a change, not all "bad guys are bad"! I give it 2 thumbs up !!!
