I saw him at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, more than three years ago. I entered without expectations since Christopher Nolan did not have a name at the time, but it sounded interesting and it turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood. Mr. Nolan gave a good account of his creation in the end, enough so that no one would come out as a filmmaker! I liked it better than Memento, although this was, perhaps, due to the lower expectations. And the fact that it was more an art movie.
