This was an excellent movie. I deal with a child that I am raising that has FAE and see this movie was more than you can explain. I also bought the book and it was great. I would like a copy for my own use and for my child's teachers to see it too. I would like to know if someone could sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a while or send me to Someone where I could buy it. Thanks, Myra. I would recommend this movie to anyone who deals with children / adults with special abilities. This movie must be shown again on television. The team of doctors who have been following my son also want to have a copy. Your special education teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy you may have or may borrow. <br /> <br /> Thanks
