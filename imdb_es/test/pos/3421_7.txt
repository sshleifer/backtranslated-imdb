POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It is likely that no one will buy a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa. Hilary Swank plays an exiled South African who returns to his hometown as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is looking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They certainly could have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt to cover her unmistakable American accent. However, she is the only actress known in the movie, and probably would not have been done without her or someone equally known. She does a passable job. However, Ejiofer and Muller (pronounced in the German style with an umlat on the "u") stand out, as does Jamie Barlett as police chief, responsible for murdering fellow prisoner and partner of Mpondo. The scenes of torture are shown in brief flashes, but they are vivid and credible. What is not credible is the process of Truth and Reconciliation, except that it really happened. The "red dust" must be seen only for that reason, since it was and is incredible that the ANC prisoners can really forgive the torturers, and this is the closest thing we are likely to get to seeing the process in action.
