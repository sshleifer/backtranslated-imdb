This is a really amazing story and the most amazing part of all this is that it REALLY happened! In case you have not noticed: it is based on a real story. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> Imagine the shock and horror of discovering that your own father was once an SS. official in the Second World War. <br /> <br /> It's a very intriguing story and I'm really surprised that the movie has a lousy 5.3 rating here on imdb.com. <br /> <br /> my rate: 7
