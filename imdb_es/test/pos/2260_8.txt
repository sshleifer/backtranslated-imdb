Having not read the book, was more open to the new interpretation that each director gives his medium (which is a movie, not "to the letter" of reproductions of literature) on this particular film. I was glad that the holocaust that happened in Russia (and its neighboring countries) finally received some attention. The Nazis were particularly cruel to the Russians and Russian Jews. If you read the stories and see the monuments built in Smolensk and nearby regions, you will understand this film and why many were silent when they should have spoken. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, it was time for this to become a chronicle. and I hope more stories come out of this. It's time.
