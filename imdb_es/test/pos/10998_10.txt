When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought it was sweet, a family movie. However, during the rest of the night and for the next two days, the smart moments and the fun lines continued to creep into my thoughts and our conversation ... There are many things, classic elements of farce, good acting of characters and Wendie The line of Malick's story is simply hysterical. Labeling it as a "feel-good movie" hides ingenuity and fun, is smarter than it sounds, like "It's a Wonderful Life."
