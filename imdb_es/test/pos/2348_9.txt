I liked this movie, the second Naruto movie. However, I enjoyed a little better than I was in the snow, because I found the story here a little disconnected since I was not sure where certain things were supposed to happen or when. Still, like the first movie, this one also has a good execution time of an hour and a half, enough time for a well-developed movie with some really cool fights. The story begins with a village ninja hiding in the sand in combat with strangers. Then he shits Naruto, Sakura and Shikumaru hunting a ferret for what they think will be an easy task. Soon they discover the opposite, since they are also attacked and Naruto separates from his friends after having a fight with a strange young warrior dressed in armor. Both are injured and are taken by a caravan and shortly after Naruto is invited to join this strange organization that wants to create a utopia. Of course, not everything is as it seems and there are many fights to go. My favorite was the one that involved Garaa fighting with this strange woman who takes it very lightly, which is a big mistake. The final fight is also quite good in which Naruto and this strange man who is a better villain than any of the previous movie.
