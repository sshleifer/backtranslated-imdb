I loved this movie almost as much as the original version! What teenager does NOT go through what Scamp is going through? Wanting to find independence more and more away from your family? The songs were nice and the character designs were great. Lady and Tramp look almost exactly as they did in the original feature. They did a good job with the voices of those two, also taking into account the fact that the original voice actors are probably dead. However, I think they should have given more lines to Lady, Annette, Colette and Daniel. Oh, well, at least they had the common sense to keep the same scenario of the original movie.
