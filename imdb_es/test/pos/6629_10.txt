Being a big fan of Bergman, I literally had to look for years to find this movie (at a price of less than $ 60) and finally I bought it a few weeks ago. The basic premise of Bergman's films is the relationship between the characters and the way they deal with difficult situations. Therefore, this movie is the same but it is different because the setup is very different from most of the Bergman movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> It is set in times of war and the heroes are trapped in the middle. <br /> <br /> It's fascinating from start to finish and once again proves that Liv Ullman is one of the best actresses of the 20th century. You must see it.
