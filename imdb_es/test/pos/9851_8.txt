Well done documentary that focuses on two Sudanese refugees who are resettled in the United States. It's your basic story of fish out of water with a touch of non-fiction. I found it fascinating to see how Peter and Santino lived before coming to the United States and how they adapted once they arrived here (in Houston, Texas). They expected a kind of paradise but discovered that it is much more difficult than it seems to face well in the states They pass from hopeful idealists to more realistic skeptics. Wherever they go, they meet bureaucrats with traces of paper that most citizens can take for granted. They worry that they are blacker than African-Americans here and do not feel accepted for that. One of the "Lost Boys" manages to leave Houston to go to Olathe, Kansas, where he finds the conditions a bit better but even less than the ideal ones. There are people who try to help them and hurt them in this movie. They do not show themselves, but they are talked about, those who put a gun to their heads and steal them, leading a Lost Boy to comment negatively that "all blacks in the United States are not good". I also found it interesting that they arrived in Houston in August 2001, one month before the World Trade Center was attacked by terrorists. I expected to see his reaction to this tragedy, but it is not mentioned at all. Still, in general, a documentary very well done without narration. You really do not need any. The "Lost Boys" do a good job exposing the events that happen around them without any help, thank you very much.
