I thought a dark night was great! It deserves a 10! As for a statement made by a user, the dead ERA zombies in this movie. A dead person returned to life IS a zombie, regardless of the method or the cause of being returned to life. The "zombies" in this movie are used to scare the girls, not to feed on them, like traditional zombies. This movie is a star defined among the horror films of the 80's. The score and the atmosphere are quite strange, and the public remains suspended throughout the scenes of the mausoleum. The acting is really convincing, with genuine expressions of horror at the sight of the undead. Although I enjoy all zombie movies, this movie is a refreshing change from the typical movie of "meat eating zombies".
