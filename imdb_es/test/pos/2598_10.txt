If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a fun and funny cartoon of Looney Tunes. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of bold colors too. The writing is very clear, and the gags in sight, especially Daffy, who constantly blow his head, are perfectly synchronized. I really loved the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love that Daffy is really greedy and nasty at the same time that he is very funny. I prefer it when it's manic, but it's also fun here. Bugs is still his charming and mischievous person, and Elmer is also funny, though quite silly. In short, this is absolutely brilliant, and it's actually my personal favorite of the hunting trilogy for its sheer entertainment value. 10/10 Bethany Cox
