I saw this movie at Galway Film Fleadh the year he won the best short film. I must say that I thought the direction was fantastic and that the performances of the key members of the cast were memorable. Both of the main cast are definitely names to be careful of. <br /> <br /> The final shot on the cliff was fascinating and I would like to meet there if I was waiting for the end of the world to happen. The kiss was definitely a great reward, done with great enthusiasm! <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the film was recorded in a movie, and I heard that the DOP won an award at the Tribeca Film Festival for their work in this film and I must say ... well-deserved . <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the eighties. He brought back some great memories and some of fear.
