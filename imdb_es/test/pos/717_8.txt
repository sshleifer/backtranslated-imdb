The movie is not for everyone. Some may think that acting is bad when in reality it is simple and natural. Obviously, there are no evil acts and there are no incredibly beautiful moments. There is a lot of indecision, many conflicting feelings. <br /> <br /> Actually, this film analyzes in a very honest way a very complex subject, Sex with minors. It's complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when their body and their hormones are still developing and their minds and personalities are still developing. Complex also because society has a very simplistic view of sex with minors, and complex, because the characters do not know if society is right or if their instincts are correct. <br /> <br /> Some are not going to like the movie because it leaves questions unanswered. Questions like who was really in charge of the relationship, who was damaged, it came out well, it was art, who got hurt more, some of the problems with their relationship were due to the fact that it was forbidden by society, some of them did The problems that arise from your own immaturity, and probably the most important, was this really a crime? <br /> <br /> The film is decidedly neutral in all this, and it is this neutrality that is its strength. It is the reason for the discreet performance, the simple ensembles, the lack of background music, the soft lighting and the general "flat" presentation. The message is clear. We do not really understand this kind of relationship nowadays, and quick judgments are meant to be superficial.
