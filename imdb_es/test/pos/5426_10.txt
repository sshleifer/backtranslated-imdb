This movie is all about humans. This movie remained my favorite short story of all time for years. <br /> <br /> Are not the simplest things the ones that make life so much more interesting ?! Humans are so soft, compassionate, funny, that we take care of each other in a moment; We invent the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with the least effort in the next. In our short lives, we destroy our world, each other and, often, our own lives, we spend the rest of our lives trying to fix what we have destroyed. Sometimes, nothing remains to be fixed! <br /> <br /> This movie can entertain, educate and even help us realize what is wrong with our lives! Life is short and can be even shorter! The ending is too optimistic, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> I love Richard Condie's mind and what makes it happen with that! <br /> <br /> Enjoy <br /> <br /> H.K.
