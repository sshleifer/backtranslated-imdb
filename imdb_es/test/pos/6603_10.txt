My son, an avid skater, sat me down and made me see this with him. Since I love documentaries, he did not have much pressure on his part. All the amazing story of everything: a group of poor children crawl together and end up creating something revolutionary from nothing. Well, more than a little wood, wheels and lack of waves to surf, I was simply surprised. He still does it. I did not think I would enjoy it the way I did, nor did I think I would cry watching Stacey Peralta mourn the fate of Jay Adams. And just watching Jay Adams himself ... the genius of skating for children and the shrug of the adult who remembers. I saw him again last night so it has to be the tenth time and I still have goose bumps watching him fly up the hill with Jimi Hendrix's "Freedom" hitting bottom. And I cried, again. Not many movies have the same impact with me after several presentations. Sparkly.
