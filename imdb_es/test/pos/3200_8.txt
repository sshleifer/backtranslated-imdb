This short film (and the poem that is behind it) is one of the best metaphors I have seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The poem is beautiful! Does it describe exactly the feeling of a person who pursues a dream and can not realize it? But it also says how to fulfill it! I see the "History of the cat and the moon" as a beautiful metaphor of human relationships, passion and love. <br /> <br /> Technically a good job has also been done. Despite being very simple, the animation, in black and white, gives a tone of allegory to the film and its message, but also to tenderness and nostalgia. <br /> <br /> In addiction, music also contributes to this poetic feeling. <br /> <br /> "Nothing else matters, I'll wait! He'll come when he can, or whenever he wants!"
