In this episode, Locke and Eko go looking for the "?" Symbol that we saw during the blockade in a previous episode. Michael, after shooting Ana Lucia and Libby, fights with his actions while Libby approaches death. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of this episode (I think). It is during the commercial break. Locke and Eko find a hatch under the plane that killed Boone in season 1, and a new training video ends with "Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989". In a next commercial break, a rather strange and bland advertisement "The Hanso Foundation" (a commercial planted), and the advertised website (www.sublymonal.com) guides the visitor through a world of information about life on the outside of the LOST story. A must for all fans!
