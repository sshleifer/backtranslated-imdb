Jack Webb's representation of the marine drilling instructor who sets up the new recruits in the basic training does not require interpretation. Directly, directly, in advance, are applicable to this classic. In a time when analyzing the statements of our leaders is a necessity to understand what they are saying, this film does not play with our language or with our moral fiber. The right and the wrong are clear and easy to define. If you like a clear and well-understood dialogue in a disciplined military environment, this movie should be right for you.
