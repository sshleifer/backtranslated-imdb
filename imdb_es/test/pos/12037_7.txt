The Turner Classic Movie Channel has spent the month of January doing the films of one of my favorite actors, Robert Montgomery. His films are rarely seen these days, except for those that were atypical for most of his career, which means that the roles that reappear frequently on television are INCREDIBLE, THE LADY ON THE LAKE, THE NIGHT OF JUNE, THE NIGHT SHOULD FLIGHT, THE SAXON CHARM, RIDING THE PINK HORSE, RAGE IN HEAVEN, THE EARL OF CHICAGO (in short, the movies in which he struggled to get the papers because they were not the typical comical fuzz in which he used to appear ). It is ironic that today, when one thinks about Montgomery's career, it is the films that were made mainly after 1937, which broke the original image that was pressed by MGM and Louis B. Mayer. The grief of this is that Montgomery was a gifted comedian, and he saved many movies from being routine. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is one of those movies. Made in 1936 with PICADILLY JIM and TROUBLE FOR TWO, it was an exceptional year of good performances by Montgomery, and helped him convince the powers to be at MGM to allow him to play "Danny" at NIGHT MUST FALL next year. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is located in Labrador, and Montgomery is a weather station operator named Dascom Dinsmore. He has been living there for five years, and has not been in the company of a woman (with the exception of Inuit women) for most of that time. He has a kind of girlfriend named Clara (Winifred Shotter) whom he proposed, but two years ago he has no news of her, so he believes that she has surrendered to him. <br /> <br /> The world of Dinsmore shudders when Sir James Felton and Irene Campton (Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy) appear. They were flying to Toronto for a business meeting that Felton was going to board. Felton is committed to Campton, but Dinsmore finds her charming ... and gradually she finds him equally attractive. Certainly, the pompous, self-important and desperately inept Felton is not a competition (it's a measure of Owen's performance that keeps the character entertained even if one finds it hard to believe that a tit of this type is a Canadian captain of the industry. ). /> <br /> There is something surreal about this movie, probably due to the original work. Although the scenario of "Labrador" is quite false, it fulfills its purpose for the comedy (witness of the polar bear sequence). But the highlight of Surrealism is the dinner that Dinsmore serves to his guests, a dinner of "Pemmican steaks", which Owen eats with great enthusiasm. Owen (a minor nobleman as a baronet) is dressed in normal clothes - a winter suit for the weather). But Montgomery is dressed in his evening gown (as if attending a dance at the embassy). Loy, seeing him disguise himself, also puts on a dress. They are being looked after by Dinsmore's servant - assistant, the Inuit Kimo (Otto Yamaoka), who also wears an evening gown - it turns out to be Owen's! Owen, who previously insisted that Dinsmore wear more suitable clothes for his station, is the only person who is dressed inappropriately for this dinner !! Montgomery was the most elegant MGM actor in a tuxedo or evening dress (Franchot Tone was his closest rival). It is a release in the film if Montgomery or Fred Astaire were the most elegant figure in such costumes. Difficult to decide. <br /> <br /> The course of love does not move smoothly in comedy or drama. Clara appears (at the beginning of the film we inform ourselves very soon about this when we see her on an ice ship). Will Dinsmore break up with Clara? Irene will break with Felton? The movie is fun, and Loy and Montgomery make a good couple. They had appeared together in another movie, and both were in separate scenes in a second, before this movie. But this would be his last film together. <br /> <br /> One last interesting point: at the beginning of the film, when the credits are shown, illustrations of men and women in comical situations are seen. They are based on the work of art of John Held Jr., the great draftsman / illustrator of the 1920s and 1930s, who was the recorder of Flapper and "Jazz Age". It's an unusual choice, since it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot of the movie or Labrador.
