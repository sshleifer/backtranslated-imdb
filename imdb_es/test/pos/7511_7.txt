this movie is fun, funny, funny, my favorite quote from the movie "I think I saw a half-naked Indian in my room last night", the answer was that it was not a hallucination, he was an Indian in your room "and another is" What the hell are you talking about? about, what the hell are you talking about? but if I ever get admitted to a hospital like this, I'll be prepared to write my will at the time ... I'd say that in my opinion there were three very funny characters in this movie is the funniest , but three is the funniest for me, although their lines were few ... and I do not mean the patient of the crucible, hehehe, the one that I will keep secret and fast.
