This film is about Xavier, an Erasmus exchange student from Paris who spends a year in Barcelona. During that time, under the influence of all new impressions, he changes and grows. Upon his return, he has a much clearer vision of his life and finally takes it into his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most moving movies I've seen in my life, and the reason is probably that I've been in a very similar situation. I'm from Germany, not France, and for me it was Madrid, not Barcelona, ​​but I can assure you that this film is a completely accurate representation of what an Erasmus semester will do in Spain. From what I hear, the story is autobiographical, and that's probably why it's so realistic. <br /> <br /> Let me give some examples (slight alert from SPOILER) - Xavier shares a flat with other students from Italy, Denmark and Germany. , Belgium, Spain and England. The apartment looks EXACTLY like all the Erasmus shared apartments I've seen in Madrid. The main characters are very well developed, and some funny scenes arise from the usual stereotypes. The Spanish owner is also 100% accurate. - The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine, who stayed in Paris, is also very typical. About 90% of all relationships are broken during a semester Erasmus (or shortly after). - There is a wonderful scene in which Xavier tries to convince Wendy, his flatmate from England, who is a bit "discourteous", to go out with everyone else. Finally she succeeds, and Wendy probably has the night of her life. <br /> <br /> Another great thing in this movie is that it is truly trilingual: students in the apartment speak Spanish or English, and Xavier speaks French with his mother and girlfriend. There are subtitles so everyone can understand what is being said. . Surely I hope this movie is never dubbed anywhere. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that for people who are not Erasmus, this is just an entertaining comedy, but for all my fellow Erasmus I can only say: this is YOUR movie! If you have not seen it, do it. But be prepared for some nostalgic feelings ... <br /> <br /> 10/10
