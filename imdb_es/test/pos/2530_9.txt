For me, this is another one of those movies that I could see outside the "Z" channel of Los Angeles when it was in service. And it was another one of those movies that I saw when I was young ... and I learned that there was a world out there ... one that I did not want to accept. <br /> <br /> Moving to Los Angeles and watching international cinema became one of my hobbies of guilty pleasure and, to date, none of the main channel programming has been compatible with the "Z" channel in its screening of international films. The three international films that were trapped in my young head were "Spetters", "Beau Pere" and, of course, this one, "Pixote". <br /> <br /> This was the most shocking and saddest film I have ever witnessed in my life. This was also one of the first films that made me understand that there IS a difference in the cinema: entertain and inform. Let me be honest ... growing up in a small town on the east coast, I had no idea that something like this existed. All I knew about South America were the leaflets of fabulous vacations in Brazil and that Colombia had a lot of drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> Next comes a movie like Pixote. Sad. Disturbing. Barefoot. Scary. You are watching: children. Those who need shelter, love, understanding and all this is a way to survive day after day through drugs, sex, theft, robbery, sleeping on the streets and in sadistic group homes, etc. It is difficult to observe them with other street children. , prostitutes, etc., and you start asking yourself HOW you can allow things like this to happen in this world. <br /> <br /> Pixote is not an entertainment movie, it is an information movie. It shows impressive and disturbing images, but it shows life for these street children.
