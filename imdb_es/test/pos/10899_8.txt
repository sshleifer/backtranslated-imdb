"Lonely among us" is definitely one of the best episodes of the first season. The plot, although somewhat confused, creates much suspense, supported by the soundtrack driven by spooky synthesizer. This is a typical scenario of "invasion of foreign bodies", but ultimately it turned out to have no evil purpose (for me, the death of assistant chief engineer Singh was an accident). The two delegated species deliver an entertaining framework (the best makeup so far) and finally add a bit of black humor to the series (the final scene). Patrick Stewart obviously enjoys getting out a bit of his character Picard and exploring a new terrain just like Data by impersonating Sherlock Holmes (another classic of all time). The special effects are also convincing and director Cliff Bole did his job well. He is the first to try to compensate for Trois' lack of acting ability by improving his appearance. She looks beautiful in some scenes and the collar of her dress greatly improves her appearance. The "lightning scene" of Picard on the bridge gives him a slight air of Star Wars emperor "The Return of the Jedi" (which is a personal impression but it made me smile). <br /> <br /> There are also some games with the illumination of the corridors (simulating the night on board) and the first camera in motion, withdrawing from Picard when he enters the transport room to broadcast to the cloud ... Good job. Intelligent cutting, creating a continuous dialogue through different scenes (Troi's hypnosis report) rounds off the impression of a truly well-crafted TNG episode. The first, where even Wesley Crusher seemed almost tolerable ... <br /> <br /> However, the ending is a bit confusing, as if the producers were running out of time. "P for Picard" is a little exaggerated and his return is too easy, but that can be left aside with respect to the many strong moments that this episode has to offer ...
