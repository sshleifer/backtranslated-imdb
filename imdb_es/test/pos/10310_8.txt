I think the movie was really good. Subject, performance and the music of Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan were wonderful. Although the director has been successful in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer in the hands of the male-dominated culture, he has neglected Phoolan's character a bit and focused more on the violence she faces.
