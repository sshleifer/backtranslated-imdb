I just saw Monster Man yesterday. It had been a long wait and after much anticipation and development, I am happy to say that it was met and met my expectations at all levels. It's true that you really can not expect too much from listening to the plot summary, but after reading some of the reviews, I was ecstatic. I mean, what junkie would not want to see a gore movie about a devilish madman who cuts people off with his makeshift monster truck? I went in hoping for a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got a lot more. This was a horror comedy that really worked. The filmmakers got it right when it came to making you writhe and make you howl with laughter at the same time. Congratulations to Michael Davis for doing everything possible with the gore and pushing the envelope with sick humor. Let me list some of the reasons why I love this movie so much: The first thing is the story. It has been done to death in so many other movies. A boy from the university realizes that his love for childhood is going to get married. He, being the 25-year-old virgin that he is, gets on his Vista Cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love, hoping that she falls headlong on the hills and all that jive. Hidden in the backseat of his truck, is good friend Harley. Harley is the horn, ex-friend, who laughs and talks like Jack Black in High Fidelity. You can not help, but you like the boy, but if he were your friend in real life, you should have a ball bat on hand (laugh all you want, but have you ever been hit with one?) To keep it low control. So, it's a bit clumsy, to say the least, but you can say that he's a loyal friend, deep down ... Anyway, they're on the road and when they stop at a bar, they aggravate the locals. Now they are being harassed by a leatherface clone in a monster truck. That's. Yes, on the way they pick up a great hitchhiker, but I'm too lazy and hangover to get into that right now ... so just look at the damn movie. <br /> <br /> The second thing I love is humor. This had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since Cabin Fever. How tangled is it? Well, I will not even enter the scene of the cat and as for the "corpse burrito" thing, I will also leave it to your virgin eyes. The bar full of amputees was unsettling and that guy who looked like John Turturro also bothered me. Harley, although he is a totally unpleasant type of frat boy, can really get rid of the linings. I love clogs, by the way. I need a new pair ... <br /> <br /> The GORE. This he pours in heavy. While the first hour develops as a crazy road comedy, the last third has to do with blood and guts. If the movie had not kept such a smooth tone all the time, it would have been a bit disturbing, but seeing how it all played out for the laughs, there's no way it bothers you. If you are still in your seat for when the time comes, it is likely that you will also see the humor in it, but seriously, there were cubes and cubes of red matter. There was a big twist in the plot that I did not see coming and when the credits rolled, I was completely satisfied. I got exactly what I came for and I'm very glad I bought it. Like Cabin Fever, it will repeat a lot. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the film was outstanding. There was a deliberately cheap look that made everything scream in the late '80s and I loved the exaggerated colors. It's obvious that Monster Man got a relatively low budget, but like Cabin Fever (sorry, I'm still comparing the two) it really works in favor of the movie. Cabin Fever was an ode to the greats of the 70s, this was the response of the 80s to that. So take that for what it's worth. There is no CGI here. This is what we all need. I'm not exactly sure why he did not get a theatrical premiere because this is all that Jeepers Creepers SHOULD have been. Thank God for the door of the lions.
