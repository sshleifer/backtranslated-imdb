I saw this movie last night at the Phila. Film Festival. It was an interesting and funny movie that had some attractive and moving scenes. Peter Falk was excellent as was the rest of the cast. They were believable and played their roles well. The film may have lasted a little and the conclusion was good. The public laughed in the right places. The family dynamics were spectacular and, although it was a Jewish family, they could have been Italian, Irish or any other, even Greek. I recommend this movie if you are interested in laughing at a subject that often is not handled that way. IOT makes you think about the consequences of your actions and how they affect others in your life and those who are not clearly in your life.
