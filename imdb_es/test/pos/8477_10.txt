Bright biographical film ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Well, certainly this is one of my favorites. Biographical film This movie came as a total surprise to me. I had been avoiding this movie for a long time. That was because I'm not a fan of Jamie Foxx. I'm still not a big fan of him, but I'm sure I'm a FAN now. <br /> <br /> Well, he deserved every BIT of that Oscar. His performance is one of the BEST performances I've seen in a long time. It is really sensational! <br /> <br /> Well, the narrative, or the flow of the story is great for a biographical film. I'm a fan of DRAMA, so I was not bored at all. <br /> <br /> I was too surprised that I liked the movie so much that I did not see any flaws in the movie. I think there is no defect in the movie. Maybe some event errors But hey who Cares? <br /> <br /> The performance of the woman who plays Ray's Mother was also really GOOD. Well, Kerry Washington? She has a lot of potential ... if she is given the right paper. She could be the winner of the next Oscar. <br /> <br /> Well, the story of the movie was so EMOTIONAL, TACTILE ... I cried? I cried very bad ???? <br /> <br /> I do not give a damn if things were crazy or not, because this movie drives me crazy? And that's a lot for me! <br /> <br /> In general, Â¿A SUPERBUSA FILM? One of the best of this century! <br /> <br /> 10/10
