Personally, I do not like many b / w movies, but there is something magical about this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). "Liz" writes a column in a magazine about how is the 'Martha Stewart' of Connecticut. Of course, she is lying. This becomes a problem when your editor, Mr. Yardley, asks you to be the hostess of a Navy navigator during Christmas. In addition, Mr. Yardley, who will be alone for Christmas, is invited to the farm for the Christmas party. From there, things just go crazy. <br /> <br /> Since the movie takes place on a New England farm, the movie has a warm holiday feel. Also, the characters are fun. Mr. Yardley is always shouting orders, and Liz's friend, Felix, always shouts "Catastrophe!" when things go wrong. Finally, the movie ends as a Christmas movie should end; a cheerful fat man laughs and yells "What a Christmas!" <br /> <br /> In summary, no matter how old you are, you will love this movie.
