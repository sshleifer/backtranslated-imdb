DALLAS is a throwback to the "old" Westerners of the 30s and 40s (like DODGE CITY). DALLAS has a number of things going for it: Gary Cooper in his most brilliant and eye-catching Technicolor photograph by Ernest Haller (GONE WITH THE WIND) and a Max Steiner score (KING KONG, GWTW, DODGE CITY and others). In addition, there is a masquerade, a wrong identity, a false death and more escapes of breath than a Republic series. As always, Cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure. Forget about the Western anguish of the 50s ... this is pure entertainment!
