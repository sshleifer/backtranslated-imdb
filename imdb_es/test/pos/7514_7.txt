I should never go to this hospital [or hospice, if I want to be politically correct] [what asshole coined this silly phrase, anyway?], For anything other than instructions on how to get out of town. George C. did a masterful job interpreting the burnt and exhausted cynic who came to the conclusion that his life has been a waste, but he can not change his environment or his conditions even when he is given a golden opportunity [which probably was not so golden anyway]. I got a lot of laughter from this brutally black comedy, however, at the same time I became sober and often froze to the core because I fear that this same atmosphere invades most healing houses, even as I write.
