So far, only the first episode has been shown, and a great uproar has been made about the scenes of lesbian sex. But for those who bother to look further, they will find an incredibly beautiful love story and one that, in this episode, ended in a disconcerting climax / swing. I have found the story so powerful that I have been inspired to read the novel on which this fantastic series has been based.
