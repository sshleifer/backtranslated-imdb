I just saw this for the first time in 10 or 15 years ... maybe close to 20. In some ways, it was better than I remembered ... in others, it was MUCH worse. <br /> <br /> First, there's the music. It is simply horrible. In the movie there are only 5 songs, most of them used more than once. The opening song is squealed by a chorus of annoying children, and the disc title track is played by Rick Dees. There is nothing worse than that. Even the background music is terrible, and much of it repeats the themes of the other nauseating melodies. We also got some really convincing slapstick, mainly in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Bill Murray is perfect as usual ... you have to ask him if he is improvised. , or if the writers only gave you all the funny phrases. Or maybe it's so cool, it turns a weak script into a comic genius. The best part are your surrealistic PA ads. ("Lobsters ... get out of here ... you're a threat!") <br /> <br /> You also get a lot more character development than you have the right to expect in a movie like this. At least half of the characters look like real people ... and mostly real people that you'd like to have around. Even "Spaz" does more than any other Eddie Deezen character, and when he gets the girl, it's plausible. (She is not absurdly hot, but he does not automatically associate with one of the nerdy girls, see "Revenge Of The Nerds" to see examples of both cinematographic phenomena). <br /> <br /> And when the plot looks like a clich√© ... well, you should ask yourself if it was not a cliche yet when they did this. While it was not the first summer camp film, at least you have to go back to "The Parent Trap", it is undoubtedly the movie that made it your own genre. In fact, I was surprised that there was not a Talent Show scene ... "Wet Hot American Summer" faked the summer camp genre perfectly, I just assumed that everything came straight out of Meatballs. (I also half expected Jon Cryer to ride in a convertible with a chimpanzee, thanks to the epic parody "Monk Academy" of "Mr. Show" of "Mr. Show".) Anyway, this seems to be fading a bit until the comedies of the late 70's and early 80's, is no longer a staple of cable, and certainly does not have the cult of Caddyshack or Animal House. I was pleased to see him on Showtime today, and in high definition! Sure, it's pretty horrible in some places, but you could do much worse in a comedy for teens in the 70/80. And again, Murray is a genius.
