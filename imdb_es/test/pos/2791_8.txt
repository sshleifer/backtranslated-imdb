I could see this movie in my French class, as part of, let's say "French culture". I thought about the way it was filmed and the editing was really good, but above all it was entertaining, especially the guy who played Wendy's brother. In addition, the story was very good, as well as credible and, at the same time, adventurous. <br /> <br /> Favorite part: When William makes fun of the German boy he studies and when he interprets how flies reproduce! :) <br /> <br /> My French is not so good, but with the subtitles, I could see what was happening. <br /> <br /> Look at it!
