I was very impressed by this film by the newcomer Director / writer José Reyes. The cast was excellent. "Jorge Córdoba" performed a powerful and surprising performance as the main character of "Rafa". It is inspiring to watch independent films with this level of talent. <br /> <br /> It takes talent, courage and determination to go out and make a quality film. <br /> <br /> I admire anyone who can take an idea from the concept to the conception and walk the mile. <br /> <br /> It's easy for people to judge the young filmmakers harder, but I applaud "Jose Reyes" <br /> <br /> and the talented cast for their successful efforts.
