This is easily the best summer camp movie. In fact, few of the others are even fair, let alone an entertaining site like this one. <br /> <br /> The movie is just to have something good, clean and fun. Many people who went to the summer camp when they were children will see that it is presented here faithfully to the way it used to be, but with the mixed comedy sickstick. Bill Murray, as the camp's chief counsel, Tripper, heads an excellent ensemble cast, and is usually the center of unbridled madness. Tripper has excellent one-line phrases, generally broadcasting his jokes as pseudo announcements about the camp's public address system. <br /> <br /> Several great support actors played the campers and counselors to create a wide variety of fun and interesting side arguments. , all the time dotted between the many incidents of hi-jinx camp. Spaz (Jack Blum) and Fink (Keith Knight) were two particularly well-made characters. The adventures (and misadventures) of these two are hilarious. Each one has classic lines, and they are characters that you like and that take root. Find Spaz in the dance disco pandemonium scene. <br /> <br /> The girls in the story are also realistic characters. They are not stupid, naive, extravagant, exaggerated, nervous or any of the other stereotypes of abusive and overused characters of adolescents. Kristine DeBell, Kate Lynch, Cindy Girling and others make these characters believable. <br /> <br /> The necessary jokes abound, usually at the expense of the camp director Morty (Harvey Atkin). The nature of these jokes begins in outrageous and progresses from there. However, with all the nonsense that happens, Tripper and the others have their serious side. For example, Tripper befriends a shy and lonely child, Rudy (Chris Makepeace), and takes it under his wing. <br /> <br /> The story ends with a sports competition against a rival camp. It's a great ending to "root for the underdogs." When the chips are low, Tripper's motivational speech "It just does not matter" is inspired and is one of the highlights of the movie. And get ready to root: "Spaz, Spaz! Spaz !!!" "
