I own this movie and I love Canadian films, but hire an actress like Rose. I do not get it. She is completely useless in this movie, just a name. It is everything else. . I was surprised by the plot that is not the first time it was used. But those unknown actors did very well even Jergen, I'm not a big fan of him, but I liked in this movie. If you have the opportunity to see it go for it.
