To be honest, I thought that this movie would be a Japanese drama. I was completely wrong. This movie is based on the popular Japanese anime novel of the same name. Tells the story of a town that is cursed by Uzumaki or The Spiral in English. Little by little, the residents of the cities begin to obsess violently and violently with anything that has to do with spirals, and some of the residents begin to become living beings that actually have some kind of spiral inside them, like a snail. <br /> <br /> The movie was a giant trip, random, acid, twisted with romance and drama. Something like a twisted drama. What makes this film disturbing is the way some of the people are obsessed with The Spiral. For example: one of the dads has a garage full of household items with built-in spirals, a girl took her extremely long hair and mocked an incredibly huge spiral style, a child slowly transformed into a human snail, a man could twist her body in the form of a spiral, a woman tried to open her ear to get the cochlea inside and a teenager ran on himself to be able to twist the tire of a car and a child got into a washing machine to become a spiral . <br /> <br /> Another very disturbing aspect of this union is the atmospheric tone and the style in which this film was shot. The angles of the camera add to the psychotic and twisted story, in other words, a very good photograph. The general coloration of this image makes it a somewhat demented story. The color is a mixture of lime green, yellow and a little orange and the special effects with some of the spirals are exceptional. <br /> <br /> However, like many Japanese films, it has a nuance of forbidden love and Romance between a girl and a boy. However, with all the spirals and strange events happening in the city, it is difficult to keep up with the relationship of the two teenagers. But, in a way, it's very irrelevant, more like a second-hand story that has nothing to do with the real story of the city obsessed with the spiral. <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend this film to anyone who likes very different and bizarre foreign films. It has enough madness and madness, it moved me.
