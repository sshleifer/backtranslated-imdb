The new voices scare me! Kuzco does not have to pass some shit academy to become emperor again! It's the same thing over and over again, right? This is a children's show, right? Yzma turns Kuzco into something stupid, like an animal. He learns a lesson. IT'S ALL THE SAME!!!!! David Spade and John Goodman never came back ... * sniffle *! Nothing changes because Disney will not do anything about it. It's probably one of the most delayed shows in history! The first movie was much better! Malina is probably the only person I like. Kuzco is so crybaby! Kronk is retarded! And the delayed ER of Yzma (if it is a word)! What I meant was ... How could you, Disney ... why?
