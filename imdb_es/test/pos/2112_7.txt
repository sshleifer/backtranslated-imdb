I have seen the Grand Champion at least twice now. I enjoyed the story of the film, the characters and the actors were not bad. It's refreshing to watch a classified movie G This is a feel-good movie. The story is mainly from the view of the children. The interactions between children and adults make the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family movie. If you liked the Little Rascals, you will probably enjoy this. I've seen this movie on cable. Either in the Encore family or Showtime. This is not a movie that went to see the theater. But, I only go to the theater for the effects of the big screen, so most of the comedies, romantic movies or dramas that I do not go to the big screen, I wait for the TV / cable edition. Gather your children, take out some popcorn and enjoy!
