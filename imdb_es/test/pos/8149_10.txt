With the exception of the main character, the performance did not convince me, but the story was pretty good: it is a love story between a gay boy and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. The film is very American and, as such, has some metaphysical nuances to counter its criticism of religious intolerance. But some lines of the story are funny: one of the main characters asks his gay colleague: "Do you believe in God?" And he replies: "You mean: apart from Madonna?" All in all, the film is not one of my favorites of all times, but the script is really good and I liked it a lot: it is entertaining and it is opposed to prejudice and intolerance (religious). I think this is an important message in our times. Since I rated movies that I liked less with 9, this is clearly a 10 for me. Some people may find this exaggerated, but I think this movie deserves it.
