This is the creation of Better Off Dead tracking. In a competition, Better Off Dead would win non-stop. But for the power of the stars, One Crazy Summer eclipses the best script of Savage Steve. Problems with One Crazy Summer (OCS): casting. Better Off Dead (BOD) was released much better. Friendship: OCS shows Cusack looking with hatred at Bill Murray's little brother. Problems on the set? Most scandalous friends in OCS, but more genuine friends in BOD. The plot was good. You will predict some of that, but even the predictable parts go beyond what you think they could. So, although this is the ugly stepsister of Better Off Dead, it's worth checking out. See Demi Moore before plastic surgery if for no other reason. Fans of John Cusack, you have to see it, just to say yes. If you do not like Bobcat Golthwaite, I'm sorry. I do not like it either, but you can not escape from it in this one. At least he does a great job in the movie doing a tribute to another monster in the movie. The issue needed help on the beach, but for the most part, there's not much to complain about. In general, it's good and fun. But try not to compare it with BOD or you will find it missing. *sigh*
