Haines is excellent, since the impetuous cadet who believes that West Point really will amount to something now that he has arrived. Haines shows off his comical and silly character while facing West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And surprisingly poignant after the character of Haines goes too far and is almost rejected by his fellow cadets. The new Haines, full of humility, receive their last breath to play in the football game against the Navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. The fantastic MGM entertainment in this Haines formula movie shows Billy at his best. William Bakewell also scores as the skinny follower. Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and others played the handsome but ridiculous character in recent decades, another version of the beautiful ladies who play Carole Lombard and Marion Davies. West Point is a winner!
