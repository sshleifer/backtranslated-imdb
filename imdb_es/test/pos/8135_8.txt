Whenever an idea has been successful during those "Golden Days" of Silent Movies, it could bet its last dollar that would be repeated; although "Rework" is the term used. Of course, one could argue that this rework business has never left us, because success in movies or on television always leads to a trend; with all the competing parties competing to create their own version of that hit Movie or TV Show. <br /> <br /> To this last premise we totally disagree; because this is copying or plagiarizing, plain and simple. <br /> <br /> THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, surely must have been quite well received; for ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach / MGM, 1929) was reworked in Roach Lot, not once, but twice in the following three years. We were invited to LAUGHING GRAVY (Roach / MGM, 1931), in which the Goat was replaced by a cute little puppy. In addition, the climate becomes the dead of winter, in the midst of a snowstorm. They also made other changes to the lineup by replacing owner Edgar Kennedy with owner Charlie Hall. <br /> <br /> The second review of the animal's hidden premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach / MGM, 1932), which replaced a simia from a disbanded and deceased circus, of which Stan and Babe were former employees. The Circus paid its employees with their assets and the Boys received the Chimpanzee as their last payday. <br /> <br /> RETURN to our original "victim", today's subject, ANGORA LOVE. Remember? The short begins simply enough. The boys meet the Goat in the street and the Nanny in return follows them to their guest house; After Stan gives him a donut. The comic moments that follow are generated by the interaction between L & H and the slow motion exponent, Edgar Kennedy, its owner. The impact of the incident is amplified by having the interaction during the night. And how luck would have it; his room is located directly above the owner's rooms. <br /> <br /> In addition to the noise, the goat bath, its smell and owner Edgar's suspicions that Laurel & Hardy has another person illegally in the room; we had a lot of fun with a small disposable gag, which could well have been missed by the censors. While admonishing the children for the noise they had been making and reminding them of the house rules about the fact that an unauthorized person stays there all night, regardless of their sex. <br /> <br /> Your camera shot is taken from inside The Boy's Room, over your shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and in front of them, he warns; "Remember, this is a respectable establishment!" Just when he says this, a lady dressed in evening clothes walks through and behind the owner; Followed by a uniformed sailor, who grabs his hat forward when they pass! POODLE SCHNITZ !!
