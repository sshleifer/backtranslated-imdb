Being myself 15 enjoyed this film thoroughly! I interacted with Ann August's character more than most would. My mother is not as eccentric as Adele, but the feelings of loneliness are the same. This movie is perfect in terms of aspects, and the performances of Natalie and Susan are so close together that it's the best double screen I've seen in years. Their chemistry gives life to the characters, they become real people! I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to escape. Because there are many people who would like to be "anywhere but here" including me! and if you can, watch this movie with your best friend or your mother. It is the tears that mix the most around you!
