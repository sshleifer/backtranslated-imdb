I thought that this movie was going to be totally boring because of the ads I saw in theaters. When my sister borrowed a friend, I decided to see him because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . No need to say ten minutes in the movie and I loved it. Amanda was a great actress in the movie, her comic time was perfect. The guy who played Duke was sexy, simple and simple. My favorite scene was definitely when Amanda walks by the gardener and a classmate who suspects her and is talking to her mother about the dresses, while pretending to be a boy! I went back to see this part again and again ... to summarize the story, I thought I was going to be a little stupid, now I have it.
