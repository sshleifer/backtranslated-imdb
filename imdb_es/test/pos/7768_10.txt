Film critic Gene Siskel said that this movie shows how easy it is to make a movie. I was doing a compliment, although now that could have been taken as an insult these days. Although I did not always agree with Gene Siskel, I agree with him here. Love Jones is a brilliant example of what a love story should look like: realistic with real characters in real situations. <br /> <br /> The story tells the ups and downs of the relationship between Darius Lovehall (Larenz Tate) and Nina (Nia Long). Larenz Tate and Nia Long are more than a beautiful couple on the screen. These two really have chemistry together. You can feel the vibe between these two when they are on the screen and it is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Bill Bellamy is pretty funny, since the deceptive Wood and Lisa Nicole Carson are great as Nina's friend, Simone. Isaiah Washington is as good as Darius's close friend, Savon, and he sighs every time I see him in a movie. The boy is a great actor whose career is ruined by the low lives of the industry and the children's games they play. You may believe that he called the little weasel of Gray's Anatomy by name, but anyone who knows how Follywood works knows that he should not believe any "official story" of the place of fantasy. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a wonderful love story full of interesting and pleasant characters who find themselves in realistic situations that anyone who has been in love can also relate. You love these people because they are credible and are not portrayed as gangsters and vagabonds. You can not find an obscene stereotype here. Contrast that with Toady's romantic movies. Exactly. To finish, if you like Black Cinema, you would do well to have a copy of this movie.
