This movie really proves that the world is too often an unfair place, especially the world of movies. "The Assignment" hardly received attention with its release and not surprisingly it failed at the box office, but when the story is written, this movie will surely receive some lost praise. <br /> <br /> Thank God. I'm surrounded by friends who know what's best for me. Being a film aficionado like me, a very recommended friend "The Assignment", a film about which I had not even heard. I decided to see what Leonard Maltin gave him, and it's not surprising that he did it ** 1/2. Knowing that this is the same degree that gave the classics as "Alien", "The Usual Suspects" and "The Matrix" (no kidding) I knew that its meaning meant nothing. So without hesitation I went out and bought it on DVD. This was about 3 years ago and the film is still one of my proudest belongings in my DVD collection, despite a cover design that echoes a stinky low budget with Casper Van Dien. <br /> <br /> "The Assignment" is expertly directed, providing some really intense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film, besides that it has a sometimes brilliant story that you know will be riddled with twists and unexpected turns. He presents Aidan Quinn in one of his best performances, and gives him great support from Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, who are in excellent shape. <br /> <br /> Something like 40 of the 42 user comments like this movie. Most of them seem unable to praise him enough. So, what are you waiting for? If you call yourself a fan of action thrillers, you should have bought, rented, seen YESTERDAY!
