One of the best television programs, if not the best. Why? Simple: it has guts to show us real life in prison, without clich√©s or predictable turns. This is not Prison Break or any other program; Actually, compared to Oz, the sopranos look like a story for children. Blasphemies, curses, explicit violence and use of drugs, disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes ... all this and more in Oz. But this is not the best part of Oz; The characters are the strongest point of this show; All are excellent and not annoying, despite the fact that we are facing brutal criminals. The actors are excellent, my favorites are the actors who play Ryan O'Reilly and Tobias Beecher, because they are unique and they are changing their behavior completely. And above all ... they have no remorse for their actions. In general ... Oz is an incredible show, the best there is. Forget about CSI and programs about stupid doctors ... this is the deal ... Ay!
