Wicked Little Things was a really good movie. I will say that in some parts it seemed really incredible, and in others it seemed that he had not thought enough about the actions of the characters, but in general it was exciting and entertaining. I do not understand why the rating of this movie is so low. I do not understand why all the ratings of the movie Afterdark Horrorfest are so low. These are people from B movies, and nothing more. They offer great entertainment and most do not. It has many flaws. Definitely worth checking out, because you will not be disappointed with the result. Wicked Little Things is one of the best first annual films of Afterdark Horrorfest, and is compared to many other movies in the series. This is one of the best in general.
