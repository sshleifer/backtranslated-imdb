The "House of Dracula" really has nothing new to offer in terms of chills, emotions or new twists in a tired story. This film was made as a quick sequel to the "House of Frankenstein" rather better done a year earlier. In "House of Dracula" you can see the factory as production values ​​of 1945 making a dent in a film that could otherwise be scary. The footage from previous films in the series and then the end of "Ghost of Frankenstein" used as the ending here only makes for a movie of "The Cheepo". There lies the shame of the studio and the producer, as they had first-class talent and simply squandered everyone's time and effort in a quick money-back plan. But that seems to have been the trend in all of Hollywood at the end of World War II. This is what caused some of those senseless SciFi photos of the 1950s with all their close-ups of harmless lizards to make them appear as dinosaurs. The days of James Whale and Val Lewton, to mention two, ended up creating a real atmosphere and atmosphere in this genre. Also note that the makeup genius, Jack Pierce, who did medical research to create all of our favorites, was fired immediately after this particular movie was released. A less able makeup artist named Bud Westmore was later hired as head of this department at Universal, which will soon be Universal-International. Not to denigrate Mr. Westmore's ability, but horror films were not his forte. It's okay, look or not look. Watch this movie, but only as part of the chronological order of the Frankenstein series, and you will see how all this ended as a comic book for Abbott & Costello.
