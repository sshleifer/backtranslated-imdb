*** Spoiler in the fifth paragraph *** This was an amazingly frank picture (ahem-huh, huh-huh) for 1955. Otto Preminger and Carlyle Productions took a risk by doing so, the Motion Picture Association of America refused to certify a movie openly showing a syringe containing a syringe full of heroin in his arm. Frank Sinatra risked both playing an addicted musician and falling flat on his face in a role that required at least twice as much acting as ever. In summary, the film is a classic, although it is not perfect. <br /> <br /> Nelson Algren's novel may be great, but it has too many possibilities to fit comfortably into a two-hour film 'The man with the golden arm' lasts 119 minutes and often feels much longer. However, in my opinion, it is not only Frankie Machine (Sinatra) that makes the film, but the other characters and their subplots, all related to Frankie. Ultimately, it's not just Frankie who has the addiction, everyone and everything seems to depend on him and he feels it deeply. When the pressure becomes too much, the drummer begins to play the soundtrack and Frankie crosses the street with his "friend" Louie, well dressed. <br /> <br /> It's an exaggeration to say that Frank Sinatra's musical career was ever really in stagnation, but in the early 1950s he was in limbo between his days of touring with big bands and the era of Las Vegas. 'From here to eternity' established him as a serious actor and his career as a singer also recovered, but 'The man with the golden arm' was still a major challenge, the whole show sinks or nothing with his performance. He accomplished it with such skill that for several minutes I forgot that I was watching Frank Sinatra, he must have known addicted musicians and exploited that knowledge to the fullest. <br /> <br /> Be by Billy's side Wilder's masterpiece, "The Lost Weekend," places more emphasis on the sociological causes of addiction in "The Man with the Golden Arm." While Don Birnem (Ray Milland in 'The Lost Weekend') seems to fight mainly against himself, Frankie Machine is harassed by external forces and takes refuge in the needle. Neither approach is right or wrong, mainly because the addiction is impossible to fully explain, but it seems that this film could have benefited from a little more information about Frankie's internal struggle. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ** * One of the problems I have with this movie is the clich√© dependence on "leaving the turkey cold". I realize that 'The man with the golden arm' was probably setting the trend instead of following it, but that does not improve it. In the beginning of the film, Frankie has all the appearances that left his habit with the help of a doctor and a treatment center of some kind. Naturally, the drama of the film requires me to step back, but I found the ideal All-American that a man has to face his problems alone (or perhaps with the help of a good woman) out of place here. Going cold to Turkey and riding towards sunset with Kim Novak seemed too unrealistic. The end of 'The Lost Weekend' was similar, but in my opinion it was a little less attractive.
