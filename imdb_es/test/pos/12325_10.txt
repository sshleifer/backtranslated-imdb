I've seen thousands of movies in my life and I think this is the most "perfect" movie ever made. By perfect I mean the narration, the plot, the acting, the staging, the camera work, etc. (This is a lay opinion, I have no experience in film production). Many movies have perfect scenes, like the bartender filing a report with the police officer in the movie Fargo. (In fact, that scene could be good as brief). In The Dead, all the scenes are done perfectly, making the whole movie perfect. Maybe, John Huston sold his soul to the Devil to make a movie like that. Hopefully, Daniel Webster has taken him out of the contract!
