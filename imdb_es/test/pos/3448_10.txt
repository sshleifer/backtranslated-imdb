This movie is great, especially if you enjoy the visual arts. The landscape that the two daughters paint and photograph is beautiful. The story is also funny and moving at times. <br /> <br /> People who like European films and "art films" will like this movie. This is really an art movie, it really has a lot of art. Go rent it. <br /> <br />
