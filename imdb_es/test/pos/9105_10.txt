I was lucky to win free passes for the advancement of POD. Let me tell you that, from the previews, I was excited to see it! The movie shook absolutely! What I really liked was the fact that JB was in his element. With other films like "School of Rock", he does namby pamby music for children and families, but this music is obviously all his. <br /> <br /> I took my brother and sister to see her, and she laughed basically all the time. There are a couple of places where I wonder what the hell they were thinking, because some elements are a bit disconnected, but for the most part it was great. Most of the time it did not seem like a low budget movie, so it's an advantage. <br /> <br /> What surprised me the most was Dave Grohl as Satan. That is hilarious! Honestly, seeing the movie would not know that that is him. <br /> <br /> I say that if you are a rock fan and you like JB, KG and / or Tenacious D, go see the movie. Get ready for MANY drug references, MANY four-letter words and some crushing rock!
