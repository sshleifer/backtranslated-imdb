I've seen two episodes so far, I really like it. Although I'm not in college anymore, it makes me miss the wonderful university life. I would like to spend a little more time socializing. I identify with the oxidized. When I was running in a fraternity, my older brother was not like Cappie, I would like to have an older brother like him. So, if a program like this can make people identify with the characters, then it's a pretty good program. <br /> <br /> It's more realistic than the American pie with less explicit sexual jokes. Can we also call this a younger version of "desperate wives"? Some of the writers must be Greek, the story seems to reflect something of true fraternity and fraternity. It was shot in high definition. And they actually filmed outside instead of inside the studios. so the quality of the image is very good. They could easily make this a good movie. Unlike a movie that can only last a few hours, I can have about 45 minutes of fun watching it on TV weekly. <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, the actors are the right age and they are new and fresh, so it makes them more real. This show is practically on everyone. There are also Asian and black frat boys and sororities in the show. It's almost a bit shocking that they had a little story about two guys in the fraternity who had sex in the first episode, and then they tried to connect again in the second episode. I do not think I've seen anything like that on television before. This program reminded me in some way about a Warner bro teen TV show called "Young Americans" that was canceled in early 2001. In that program, a girl who dressed like a man kissed a man and that man thought that he was a homosexual man. <br /> <br /> Greek life can be fun, but at the same time, students have to study for exams, etc .; At the moment when people really have some free time in their lives, there is no fraternity of brotherhood so they can join more. I do not know how long this program will last, sooner or later, those people will also have to "graduate" from college. Maybe they will find new actors for another 4 years of fun in university life!
