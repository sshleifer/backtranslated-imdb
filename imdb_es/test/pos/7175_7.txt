How important is the director, anyway? In this film, made in the politically tumultuous times of the late 60s, where issues of social organization were major conflicts, that question is asked by making a film that takes the camera away from the action and only asks to reveal the director, William Greaves. It is an important job, since it shows how no other film shows the difficulties to block, organize and configure the scene; It reveals the role of the crew, something that most directors would like to disappear completely and that invisibility is essential to suspend disbelief; and also puts into consideration the role of performance and scripts and how they agree / do not agree with reality and what they have to say about how the director influences reality (if he does). <br /> <br /> Documentary, or pseudo documentary, or fictional narrative (as you prefer, through their interpretations of the themes) has its brain in the overeduced and overintelligent team, its entrails in the lost artists struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions. , and his heart in the director, which appears as the desire to portray, represent, express without any idea of ​​how to do any of those things or why he wants to do it. It is a film that deliberately repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities. It is a film that sometimes shows multiple shots simultaneously, just to leave the editing to the audience and also to reveal how the different shots change perspective. <br /> <br /> It is an important job and something that everyone interested in the industry and the filming process should look at and understand. Like many experimental films, it has no real appeal for the mass audience, it is not for them. It is for the industry and for the 60s, asking what to do with a medium of group effort that still depends on a single "voice" and "author". <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
