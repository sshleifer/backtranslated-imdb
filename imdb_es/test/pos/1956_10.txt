I really do not have any complaints about this movie, except for the disturbing scenes with the body. I fell on her one night while she changed the television. The performance was really amazing, I did not expect it to be better than it seemed! I thought that Keanu's performance (which seems the same since 1986, which is very good, hehe) was really great, and Crispin played his character perfectly! This movie is a hidden gem! It is a new awakening of reality to the 80s, in comparison with the other films for teenagers made by the pack of brats (although I also like those hives). In general, I give my approval!
