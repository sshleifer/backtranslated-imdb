I love this movie! When I saw this movie on television when I was a child, I got really scared. Probably because the mannequins also scare me. Jocelyn Jones (Molly) is an excellent actress. She uses her facial expressions, especially her eyes. Chuck Connors is great as Mr.Slausen. I was happy to see him play such a different role. The other actors in this movie are great too! Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Robin Sherwood (Eileen) are great actresses and I hope to see them in future movies, especially Jocelyn Jones! <br /> <br /> So if you love scary movies but you're tired of seeing the same old thing, watch this movie!
