At first glance, Suzumiya Haruhi no yûutsu (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) could make you think that this is just another animated comedy / drama from the school. Well, it is not! The environment has just been a school environment. This is a good comedy, but very smart with a lot of sarcasm. And the characters have a psychological sublimity that is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of Ingmar Bergman. The episodes are emitted, as it seems, out of order, that is, the pilot is, in fact, episode 11. This allows to present small clues of the next episodes. The show is an adaptation of the popular series of novels by Nagaru Tanigawa about Haruhi Suzumiya. <br /> <br /> What about the story, then? As in all episodes, the story revolves around Haruhi Suzumiya, who tries to ease her own boredom by embarking on adventures. Haruhi, his self, has no interest in ordinary humans and actively seeks aliens, time travelers and espers (people with supernatural powers). To find this type of people, she has formed a club called the SOS Brigade (Save the world by overloading with fun: the Haruhi Suzumiyas Brigade). With the exception of Haruhi, the other members of the SOS brigade are Kyon. He is the true protagonist of the show. It is through his point of view that we follow the story. He just sat at the front in class when Haruhi came up with the idea of ​​forming the SOS Brigade. He's quite skeptical about most club activities and labels, just to make sure Haruhi does not go to extremes, and he's the only one in the class that Haruhi likes to talk to. Another member is Yuki Nagato, who is the "indispensable silent member" and also the only remaining member of the Literature club, the room that the SOS Brigade has occupied in the search for a free club room. She does not care that the SOS Brigade uses her social room, as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books. It also participates in the activities of brigades. Mikuru Asahina was "voluntarily arrested" by Haruhi because the club needed a pet similar to Lolita to make something suspicious happen. She often acts as the club maid. The last member is the always smiling Itsuki Koizumi, who is the "mysterious transfer student" (which means that he moved two months to the semester that Haruhi considers to qualify as mysterious). <br /> <br /> Haruhi thinks that all the members, except Kyon, are people chosen at random in the school, but they do have their own interest in her.
