'Manna del cielo' is a delightfully attractive movie. <br /> <br /> Within the changing paradox of values ​​in middle-class Americans for 40 years to this day, the plot modifies concerns and hopes for an interesting range of 'Damon Runyonesque' characters. <br /> <br /> Their struggles with moral dilemmas, which are based on 'what could have been', hope to fulfill the youthful dreams, the romantic longings and 'hit big' combine to make a film more entertaining. Instead of relying on the sexual explanation "in your face", the growing relationship between Inez and Mac / Bake is classically subtle but clear. Unraveling the knot in your shoelace in the Art Gallery and the heat in your poker game is outstanding. <br /> <br /> The clear writing of the script is skillfully performed by an outstanding star and cast cast. One of the few films I've seen twice in his first race, 'Manna From Heaven' definitely guarantees national distribution. <br /> <br /> Conrad F. Toepfer
