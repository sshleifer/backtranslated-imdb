Dolemite is one of the best movies with a pimp as a hero, who knocks down the man, while being hooked with all the most beautiful women the ghetto has to offer. Keep in mind that these women know karate and are good astute ladies. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: the final scene of the fight is pretty crazy, with Dolemite tearing Willy Green's heart out. Make sure your copy is not classified. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a cast full of bright and innovative characters like the pimp of the hamburger, the Reverend, the mayor, the queen bee and others. The clothes are great, and the sets are full of the style of the 70's. There are some problems in production, such as the sudden appearance of microphones, among other things, but that increases the charm and laughter. <br /> <br /> I would recommend taking a pack of 6 units before and during. This movie, and keeping the squares and the man at a great distance.
