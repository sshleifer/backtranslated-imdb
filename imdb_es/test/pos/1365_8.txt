Golden Boy is ecchi humor (bordering the hentai) under the guise of "educational moments". The main character, Kintaro, wanders to get into the most silly situations related to women ... It's just that he's shy on the surface but analyzes everything until he can learn something from him. The most surprising feature of the series are the circumstances surrounding his "education", which are downright embarrassing, but fun at the same time.
