Besides having minor flaws, this movie is a masterpiece, and definitely the best war movie I've seen. It's not the mention that it's one of the best movies I've seen in all genres. I could have written this before for no man's land, but now I think this is better. It is VERY sad at the end, and I almost cried after the two shocking scenes that happened within 5 minutes of the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Karel's performance as a main character was fascinating, although he is supposed to be a rookie considering his age. This movie makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least brings you closer), and makes you hate any kind of war and politics. The flashbacks to the prison-hospital make the film even more delicious. <br /> <br /> A small flaw in the film is the non-British accents of supposedly British people. Most of the British on screen were actually British, but what about those who are supposed to be British and speak with a foreign accent? That really does not fit into this lovely movie. But it is practically the only defect that I have noticed. The effects could also be a bit better, but again, we all remember many movies from a particular country that have tremendous special effects and absolutely nothing else. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this movie is a total masterpiece and every person should see it. If you want to travel to Czechoslovakia in the 40s, and if you want to witness virtually a lot of emotions at once, this movie is for you. If you do not want to do that, this movie will make you want to do it.
