I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to entertain. The direction, the acting and the story are brilliant. There are definitely movies like Scarface and the godfather. This movie causes your heart to accelerate. Damian Chapa and everyone else. The cast was incredible. I would definitely rent this movie. Damian Chapa deserves an award from the academy for his performance, and for the way he portrayed the life of a gangster. This film is a classic that will soon be classic and brilliant. I loved it and I give it 10 stars. In a sentence, the only way to describe it is a flawless film. Watch this movie and you'll see what I mean. 2 thumbs up !!!!!!!
