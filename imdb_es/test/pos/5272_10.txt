The Helge Schneider phenomenon defies easy description or rapid categorization. However, for the international audience that does not know him, one could say that it is something like a crude mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman, adding a weakness for jazz music and the outfits of the 70s. While his performances on stage they are already eccentric, their film works are simply hilariously scandalous. <br /> <br /> "00 Schneider" is, in my opinion, the best Helge film. He stars in the two main roles: the police detective "Kommissar 00 Schneider" and the killer-villain "Nihil Baxter", and also in a smaller and more precious role as the doctor "Dr. Hasenbein". <br /> <br /> At the opening In the scene, we see how Baxter, lover of modern art, accidentally kills the circus clown Bratislav Metulskie, from whom he bought a defective used Jaguar, when a beloved sculpture escapes the Baxter's hands, fatally hitting Metulskie. When reading about the incident in the newspaper, he returns from his retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal partner, Lieutenant Koerschgen, who is played by an older actor with the same name. They pick up Baxter's trail quickly, and interrogate him in his strangely decorated mansion (one of the best scenes in the movie!), But initially they do not gather any proof. The story progresses through many twists, with several scenes that do not always really contribute to the progress of the plot, but are very fun, like a dream at 00 (including the most unusual view in a brief panty man in the film ). history), a party of the police department during which Koerschgen gets in a row with the boss and has to be hospitalized, and a visit to the aforementioned Dr. Hasenbein's. Baxter, then, is finally surprised trying to escape to Rio de Janeiro on a plane. <br /> <br /> It is always worth mentioning Andreas Kunze, who in this case plays the wife of 00, since she usually appears in a role of drag that plays female roles. in the Helge movies. <br /> <br /> So, friends looking for new laughs, I recommend this movie. The capture? You have to understand German (since I doubt there is an English version) ...
