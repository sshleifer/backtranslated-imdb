I remember seeing this movie when I was very young and several times on television since then. I've always liked it I have noticed in the print that is shown on local television that a scene has reversed the film. It's where they hide behind the rock outcrop (it looks like Vasquez Rocks near Los Angeles) watching the Indians pass by. If you look closely, you will notice that, suddenly, all the soldiers are left-handed! It's just a short segment and I have to admit that it took me years to notice. <br /> <br /> In history, there were often expeditions to rescue the white captives of the Indians. The direct connection for the final scene of the battle is the Battle of Beecher Island. In that action, a group of volunteer scouts equipped with repeating carbines (Spencer carbines, not Winchesters) were surprised by the Indians and retreated to an island and rejected several charges. In the last charge, they killed Roman Nose, one of the most famous Indian chiefs. I have no idea if the screenwriter had this in mind, but it fits pretty well. <br /> <br /> There are several Guy Madison movies that I hope will be released on DVD someday and this is one of them.
