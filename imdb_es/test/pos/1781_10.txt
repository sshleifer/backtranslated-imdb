Dekalog Five was an interesting visual experience for me, due to the question that Kieslowski seems to subtly ask the audience. Three men are the focus of this chapter, and Kieslowski introduces the two involved in the murder with both good and bad traits (in the case of one, almost overwhelmingly bad). With such vile characters, I was almost glad they received some kind of punishment. However, when the time comes for the murder (and it is a further effect on the murderer), Kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who share my opinion: "Are not you as guilty as this man?" This type of indirect direction of the audience makes the end of Dekalog Five much deeper, since Kieslowski (as always) does not stay within the literal limits of his subject. Just as the other parts of Dekalog do not take the theme of their Commandment in its literal sense, neither do Dekalog Five. He asks us what is murder, who is more guilty of murder and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any. It is a fantastic film and, typical of Kieslowski, absolutely impressive.
