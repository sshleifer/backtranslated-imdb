I saw this film at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and Director Aku Louhimies presented his film and was available for questions and answers later. For some reason, this movie is called Frozen Land in English, so I do not know how the distributors froze Paha. This is a very good movie. For me, I do not have enough that I would like to reach the excellent category, but I did talk to some viewers who considered it an excellent movie. Louhimies said that in Finland people loved this movie or hated it and said that many people in theaters abandoned it. I'm sure some opposed some scenes of violence, insults, drug and alcohol abuse and explicit sexual scenes. It's a very smart story of how these different lives intertwine due to a trickle effect. This movie has very interesting and strong characters. I would rate it with a 7.0 of a possible 10 and would see it again and would recommend it with caution.
