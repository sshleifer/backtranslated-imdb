A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel "Waltz into Darkness" by the writer Cornell Woolrich. It is a drama more than a black cinema, which tries to send a message that love changes your own life, that is, your love for any person and the love you received from it. A rich man really changed his life for love, while his partner finally understood that he was the only one who loved her. Belmondo played well as always, while the young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role as a detective or police officer. Frankly, Bouquet was not so impressive in this movie, but less than that was the performance of Catherine Deneuve. She was not as convincing in her role as a prostitute and lover / wife of Louis Mah√© (Belmondo). For those who like to visit the world, the film offers the chance to see part of the Ascension Island and also the city of Lyon in France.
