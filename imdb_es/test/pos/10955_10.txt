Improvisation was used in an innovative way in this film, but it only works as a novelty. No greater truth about the situation is obtained by asking the actors to improvise. The performances do not improve with the improvisation, because now the actors have the double of what to worry about: not only if they are delivering the line well, but if the line itself is good. That is why the performances in many of Robert Altman's films are often very interesting, since the actors are not really sure when they say the lines they invented, and therefore they are not sure they are good. <br /> <br /> And, honestly, it's often not very good. Often, dialogue does not really follow from one line to another, or adjusts to the environment. <br /> <br /> I crunched with a youthful and unpredictable energy, but honestly, I found it difficult to follow and concentrate on it. so bad <br /> <br /> However, a fascinating film in the rough, and admirable 100% for bringing power over the green light to the street. <br /> <br /> There are some great things in general in that. This joke, for example: <br /> <br /> I'm a dancer. What kind of dancer, like a ballet dancer? Oh no ... exotic. <br /> <br /> And the whole party scene unfolds, the next trip to the park and the scene where the children are going to look at the statues. <br /> <br /> 2 / 5. However, I would not say they are worth 2 hours of your time.
