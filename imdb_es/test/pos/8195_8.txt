This is an excellent movie. No, it's not Mel Gibson in "Braveheart", but then, it's not trying to be. In fact, "The Emperor and the Assassin" probably has (fortunately) more in common with a Shakespeare production than with a Hollywood blockbuster. <br /> <br /> In the third century a. C., the King of Qin is trying to unite (in other words "conquer") the seven kingdoms of China. He has already overthrown the Kingdom of Han. Now he needs an excuse to invade the Kingdom of Yan. <br /> <br /> This is where Lady Zhao comes in. She and the King have been friends since childhood. Obviously they are very much in love, but they can not get married for political reasons. Together they devise a plot. She will pretend to have fallen out of favor with the king and escape Yan. Once there, she will convince the Prince of Yan to send an assassin to kill the King. When the murder fails, the king will have his excuse to invade Yan. <br /> <br /> Once in Yan, however, Lady Zhao begins to reconsider. Listening and seeing more and more examples of the cruelty of her old childhood friend, she begins to wonder if it is possible that the King should really be killed. A clear sign that you are not watching a Hollywood production is The Final Encounter Between the King and the Assassin. Unlike a Hollywood movie where the hero and the villain are clearly defined and the end result is already predetermined, this is a fight that could go in any direction. <br /> <br /> This is a well-crafted and well-acted story of a tumultuous one. Time in Chinese history. There is a mixture of incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. The most beautiful of all, however, is Gong Li as Lady Zhao. Every time I see her more, I feel more and more convinced that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world. <br /> <br /> I must say, however, that she has an unintentionally funny line in this movie. At first, Gong Li asks one of his servants "Do I have a pretty face?" <br /> <br /> Duh !!!
