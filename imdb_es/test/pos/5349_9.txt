My only problem with The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is that the film does not take the time to present Wallace and Gromit to those who are not familiar with Park's short films. Interestingly, "A Close Shave" manages to do this with much less time to spare. Still, I loved seeing the guys back in action and loved all the new characters, humans and others. I especially loved the voice of Ralph Fiennes as the intriguing Victor Quartermaine. It is also interesting to see the series on the big screen. The workmanship with the clay characters really stands out. It's hilarious, and great for the whole family! I buy very few DVDs, but I have all Wallace and Gromit and I will gladly add this one.
