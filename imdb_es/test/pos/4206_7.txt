Another fun Warner movie. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I wonder why Cagney was not in the role. Maybe it was too similar to angels with dirty faces? I mean, it's also another story of Dead End Kids, but I really appreciate them here and this movie had a lot of comedic touches and a good serious drama. The boys work very well with Garfield. A good sequence was the whole "swimming" scene that begins without worries, but ends up getting too close to disaster. <br /> <br /> A negative comment: Claude Rains was totally wrong. As a detective, the good actor seemed out of place here like a nun in a brothel.
