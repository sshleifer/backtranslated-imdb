I'm not a big fan of Disney, but my 7-year-old son is starting to get into them, so we've created a great collection, and this is one of my favorites. We saw it for the first time a couple of weeks ago and we should have seen it half a dozen times since then! Okay, as others have pointed out, it's not the most complex or inventive argument, but there's more to a movie than that. <br /> <br /> Great characters, Phil Harris steals the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar The butler is not far behind. The music is excellent: my disabled son always insists that I pick him up and dance with him so that "everyone wants to be a cat", that says it all. And "Thomas O'Malley" is just as fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why some people like this movie so much that it is not an aversion to cats. And yes, it takes some of its "101 Dalmations" signs, and maybe "The Lady and the Tramp" (It's been a long time since I've seen it, so I'm not going to compare them), and while "101 Dalmations" is better in some ways, for me "The Aristocats" is much more pleasant. Is not that what these films are about? <br /> <br /> Aside from "Peter Pan" (now that it's a 10/10 movie), this is my favorite Disney movie. My 7-year-old loves it, his 41-year-old moody father loves it, so you can not ask for much more than a family movie. <br /> <br /> Great!
