The essential message, a message that Miller would surely have tried after seeing Vichy's war crimes trials, is that hatred of someone without a rational basis is a waste of life. Meat Loaf's character, Fred, has known Lawrence for many years and yet, when the time comes, at the request of his fanatical followers, he allows them to attack a man who is not part of his "target" group. For me, this is the crucial message: no matter what Lawrence and his wife do from this point forward, they are marked and have the opportunity to save themselves using reason. Animal aggression and anger have blinded the thugs of Fred's Union to reality. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine suggested that he should see "The Wave" to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without their noticing. I once did an experiment in a role-playing game, and I was surprised to see how normal and sensible people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state, which would ultimately threaten them all, because it dragged itself along in stages. <Br /> <br /> Fred is the beginning, his Los Angeles friends and his preacher idol are the catalyst that pushes his neighbors to violence without stopping to think what they're doing wrong. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein, the Jewish merchant, is fascinating, because Lawrence loses consciousness almost to the end: if fans force Finkelstein out, where will he go? If your family has fled from the Nazis, it is an irony to be tormented again in the land of "freedom". <br /> <br /> That big poster (it's a pretty famous piece of propaganda) about American families enjoying the highest level of quality. Living in the world is a very important detail. When you see this movie, look at the graffiti on the subway and all the small posters. The message hides there, too. <br /> <br /> This film should be in every school's curriculum, especially in our time when baseless hatred is being promoted so widely by "reasonable" people who are only extremists in disguise.
