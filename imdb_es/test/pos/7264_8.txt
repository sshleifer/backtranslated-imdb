If you liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you probably like this too. Although I suppose that some of the British jokes (like calling two characters from London, Dixon and Winterburn, after the Arsenal football players) can get lost in some, this is still an entertaining entertainment, that really pumps with vitality. <br /> <br /> Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are excellent, bringing depth to their characters, and the interaction between the two protagonists is always right. In fact, the direction of Scott is very safe, considering that this is his first feature film, and shows that he has the talent of his father to reassure us in an unknown environment. <br /> <br /> Hell, I've convinced myself. I'll see you again!
