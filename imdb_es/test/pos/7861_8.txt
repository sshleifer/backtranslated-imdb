It is difficult to know in which category to place this film, most of the films set in this period of the history of the United States are westerns, but here, instead of the wide plains of the west, the action is almost totally limited to a boarding school of claustrophobic girls in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Amy, a young girl, walking through the woods picking mushrooms, while she does, she runs into Corporal John 'McBee' McBurney, a wounded soldier of the Union, whom he leads to the school. We know he is not a particularly nice person when he kisses her on the lips to distract her from alerting a Confederate patrol that passes though she told him she was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> Once you return to the school's opinions are divided about what to do with your new host, some think they should take care of it until their wounds are healed, while others believe it is a Treason not deliver it to the Confederate forces at the first opportunity. The first group prevails and little by little it recovers. While doing so, his presence has an effect on all the girls who have not had a man in the place for a long time, including a young teacher and the head of the head, whose previous relationship seems to have been with his own brother. McBee is dedicated to seducing them, emotionally if not physically, this leads to considerable jealousy among the girls. <br /> <br /> While this movie has a rating of fifteen, it's definitely not for younger viewers because of the sexual content, of which little. Actually it shows, but it gets very involved, and for a very exhausting scene that made me writhe more than any other scene in any movie I've seen for quite some time. It's interesting to see Clint Eastwood playing against the guy, instead of being heroic, his character is unpleasant and most of the time he's at the mercy of the women around him. The acting is solid at all times, not only of Eastwood but also of all the actresses, including the young Pamelyn Ferdin who played Amy.
