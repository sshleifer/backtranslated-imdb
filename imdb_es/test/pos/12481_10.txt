One of the best movies I have seen. <br /> <br /> The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic. He really "fills in" his part, and this is wonderful. He's such a good actor that you can not think of anyone else to take his part. <br /> <br /> And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are good like the standard French, trying to defend themselves in the fight born with a murder ... <br /> <br /> The story is awesome and it's okay constructed. You can feel the atmosphere of Paris during that period (around 1930-40), between two wars ... The clubs, the small old buildings, the neighbors. <br /> <br /> All those things contribute to making a good movie.
