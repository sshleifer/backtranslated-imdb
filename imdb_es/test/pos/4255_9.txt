I thought I might be disappointed to see this movie again after so many years. On the contrary, it impressed me more now than in my youth with his honesty and his courageous humor. In 1969, the transition between African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new and quite controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the establishment and the anti-establishment as the caricatures that often approached real life. A special mention must be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully prevented his character from falling into sociopathy or buffoonery. I'd rather see this than "To Sir With Love" any previous day!
