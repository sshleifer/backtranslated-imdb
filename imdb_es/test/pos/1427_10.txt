Clifton Webb as "Mr. Scoutmaster" is one of the greatest of all time for comedy and the memory of an innocence, now diminished in the world. I can not understand why networks like American Movie Classics and others do not show this movie, although I have requested it again and again. <br /> <br /> This film should be shown to children now for their representation of loyalty, respect, dedication and resolution to achieve the best possible individually. There is a lot of talk about low self-esteem in today's daily life, but this movie, among many others, would be a wonderful learning tool for the younger generation of today to see what can be achieved with common sense and decency. Pride in yourself and your achievements to improve yourself. It is sad that this type of film does not attract modern audiences. No doubt we were attracted to yesterday's baby boom generation. THE OLD LESSONS ARE UNIVERSAL AND WITHOUT TIME.
