an excellent historical drama, carefully produced, well interpreted, ingeniously written, filmed in a way that transmits precise visual images of the congo and with more than a few moving moments, especially for those who care about the history of Africa and imperialism. however, a good amount of worthwhile content is lost in the translation, and because the names, acronyms, etc. They are difficult to follow. so I would strongly recommend consulting a neutral source, such as wikipedia, to get a basic sense of the story that is represented (and the subsequent story) before enjoying the movie. If you have the DVD version, there are also some useful historical backgrounds. There is a point towards the end of the film where the name of a character who then speaks with an American accent is actually sounded: a simple Google search of the "lumumba film censor" or something similar will reveal a truly fascinating (and perhaps disturbing) aspect ) turn with regard to the production of this important film. this film, if combined with a little external research, helps to contextualize dozens of other films related to central / eastern Africa and / or imperialism, for example, Hotel Rwanda, shaking hands with the devil, various adaptations of the heart of the Conrad's darkness and even "Ali" when Mohammed Ali visits Kinshasa.
