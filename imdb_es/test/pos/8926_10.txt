I read viciously hidden comments in previous comments that said this movie showed a group of gay boys fighting over their homosexuality. <br /> <br /> This could not be more deceptive. "Eighteen" is not a gay movie. It has only three homosexual characters and one of them is a victim of the prejudices of people like the one who wrote the comments, despite his confession of justice. <br /> <br /> Pip's grandfather was not gay. The tender scene of the soldier and his sergeant is the male union at the crucial moment of death. But some people are horrified by a kiss and a scene of guts flying out of a man killed by a bomb. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is the direct relationship of Pip and that sweet girl and their faces. social obligation and paternity. <br /> <br /> Ralph Rewes www.r1313.info
