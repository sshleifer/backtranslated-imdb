Recent years have seen a series of biopics of famous singers, and "Ray", the story of Ray Charles, has much in common with "Walk the Line", which was made the following year and told the story of Johnny Cash. Cash and Charles were almost exact contemporaries, both were born in the early thirties and died in 2003/04. Both grew up in poverty in South America. Both lost a brother in an accident during childhood. Both achieved success in the 1950s. Both experienced problems in their marriages, and both were addicted to drugs. All these issues are emphasized in both films. There are also similarities with "A Beautiful Mind" by Ron Howard. Although that film was about a mathematician rather than a musician, like "Ray" and "Walk the Line," he emphasized the role played by his subject's wife to help her husband overcome his problems. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles was born to a single mother in a poor black community in Georgia in 1930. (His original name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he was beginning his career as a musician, he left his last name to avoid confusion with the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson). In a way, Charles had an even more difficult time than Cash, since he had to face two additional disadvantages in the form of his blindness and the racism that affected all black Americans, especially in the South, during his life. Charles had a particularly traumatic childhood, witnessing the death of his younger brother George in a drowning accident and becoming blind about one or two years later. He seems to have been chased by nightmares and feelings of guilt over George's death throughout his life. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is quite slow and is a biographical film typical of the entertainment world. The story of how young Charles is taught to play the piano, becomes a nightclub performer and then becomes famous as an important artist, falling in love on the road with the beautiful Della Bea. The best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks of Charles's childhood. There is an effective recurring image of colorful glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of your house; Perhaps this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he became blind. There is also a memorable scene in which the adolescent Charles embarrasses a prejudiced bus driver to allow him to get on the bus pretending to have lost his sight on Omaha beach (actually, he was only thirteen years old at the time of the landings of Normandy). <br /> <br /> The second half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into more controversial territory, focusing on Charles's drug addiction, the problems in his marriage caused by his relationship with Margie Hendricks, one of her backup singers. and its battles against racism. In the early sixties, Charles caused a sensation by refusing to play in front of a racially segregated audience in Georgia (although, contrary to what is said in the film, this did not result in him being banned from acting in the state) . He also fought against racial divisions within the music industry, not only with traditionally "black" styles of music such as gospel and rhythm and blues, but also traditionally "white" as country and western (considered by many black Americans as the chosen music). for the peasant community). <br /> <br /> Like Peter Bradshaw, film critic of "The Guardian", he pointed out that "Ray" is a sunny film that moves diplomatically away from the darker side of things. It omits any mention of matters such as the death of Charles's beloved mother, Aretha, during her adolescence, her brief marriage to Eileen Williams in the early fifties and her eventual divorce from Della Bea in 1977. The number of her illegitimate children. There are similarities here with "A Beautiful Mind," which also omitted a series of controversial details about the subject's personal life, including a divorce. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles fans will definitely enjoy the movie for the music, but it's worth seeing even for those who do not know much about it, mainly because of Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning performance in the main role, reproducing Charles's gestures so exactly that we think we are actually seeing a blind man, although Foxx sees himself. (However, unlike Joaquin Phoenix in "Walk the Line", Foxx did not make his own singing, certainly Charles's distinctive voice was too difficult to reproduce). She receives good support from some of the other artists, in particular Sharon Warren as Aretha and Kerry Washington as Della Bea. The film is uneven and too long, but nonetheless rewarding. 7/10
