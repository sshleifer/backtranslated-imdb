On March 17, 1974, a man was found dead in the toilets of Penn Station in Manhattan. Although known, he can not be identified because he erased personal information from his passport and his body remains unclaimed in the morgue of the city for three days. It turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the best American architects of the twentieth century, Louis I. Kahn. He died at the age of 73, on his way from India, where one of his major projects, the Ahmedabad Institute of Administration, was about to be completed. <br /> <br /> One of the most influential post-war American architects. The architectural legacy of Louis Kahn includes the House of Parliament in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth, the Yale Art Gallery, the Salk Institute in California and a kind of mobile "musical boat" designed to give concerts in the ports of several cities around the world. <br /> <br /> Although he was a renowned architect, he knew very little about his private life. In addition to his wife Esther and daughter, Sue Ann, Kahn was survived by two lovers, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng, and their two children. The three families lived miles apart from each other in the suburbs of Philadelphia, but their paths never crossed until the funeral. His son, Nathaniel, the director of this film, was only 11 at the time and had only a few memories of his father's weekly visits to Harriet Patterson, Nathaniel's mother, in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, he embarks on a journey to confront his father by visiting Kahn's buildings, talking with family and colleagues, and visiting places that played a role in the life of Louis Kahn. <br /> <br /> One of the most most touching confrontations is when Nathaniel asks his mother, a landscaper and lover of Louis Kahn, why he remained in the secondary role of his wife and never confronted with this. Tears shed her eyes, but she does not regret it. "It was worth it." It is such an intensely sad moment. Obviously she is devastated, treated like an outcast at her funeral, which she was forbidden to attend, it is almost as if she were leading a substitute life. Everything feels strangely unreal. Another interview with Edward Bacon, the enemy of the architecture of Kahn, who was in charge of the reconstruction of his native Philadelpia in the fifties and sixties, almost suffers a blow in the place, when he is reminded of the unpleasant ideas of Kahn about the architecture. His son, Nathaniel, listens uncomfortably when a very old bacon literally screams with anger every time the name of Kahn appears. The final scene is reserved for the largest creation of Kahn, the Capitol in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It took 23 years to complete, a vast and extraordinary building, of which Bangladeshis are extremely proud. It is one of the few national symbols with stature in this impoverished nation. Some of the interviews with the locals filled my eyes with tears, especially when they learn that they are talking, God forbid, of the architect's own son! <br /> <br /> The film is a journey as personal as it is It is a story of the great architectural legacy of Kahn and is mainly about the fruition of the film and the making of films in general. Perhaps Louis I. Kahn hesitated as a father, but these deficiencies in his personal life make the portrait even more interesting in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
