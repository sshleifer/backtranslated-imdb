What is it supposed to be? Was it a child in the past, ... and the future? This movie had many problems. Is he a ghost, or just a strong child? Man, what a piece of shit. I'm still confused. Also, is it supposed to be an abortion? Strange. Very strange. This movie will affect your mind ... and it's not very scary ... it's just confusing. Why was he? ... Where ...? What was he ...? Oh, who cares, ... Milo is not worth it, ... <br /> <br /> My score: 10
