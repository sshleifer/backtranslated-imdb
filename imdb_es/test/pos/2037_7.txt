Surprisingly, well-acted and well-written film about the hard-rockin-but-decent young man who gets the long-awaited ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace his lead singer. It is not exaggerated, the film tries to keep things in perspective and does not reach the top; It certainly makes you think twice about those persistent teen fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite the solid dialogue, follows a proven and true formulated pattern, and gets stuck by its own clich√©s in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary "Almost famous". It has a nice and bitter edge with its heavy metal decay, but a stronger finish could have made it more memorable. ** 1/2 of ****
