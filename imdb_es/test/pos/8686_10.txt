I saw the Princess of the Nile for the first time when she was about 10 years old. I am 63 years old now and I have never forgotten the movie. Nor have I overcome my fascination with Egypt. I searched the Internet trying to buy the movie, but I could not locate it. I wonder if this is one of the movies lost in Hollywood. I loved Debra Padget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have such charisma together. If you asked me about the movie, I could not tell you anything other than who was in it. I vaguely remember a scene by the Nile with Debra Padget and other women. I've always wanted to see her again. I never thought it was an escape movie back then, but now I can see where that was probably the case. I hope they put it on DVD and I can watch it again before I die. It was a wonderful movie.
