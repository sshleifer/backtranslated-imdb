After reading the terrible reviews of this movie, including the comments quoted by Colin, I almost did not bother to add this film to my Firth Film collection, however, being the Fantastic Firth that I am, the intrigue surpassed it! <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I enjoyed the movie a lot. He had suspense, drama and intrigue and scenes of V. sexy Colin. The plot kept me guessing until the end of the credits and I felt that once the opening scene of Jennifer Rubens was over, the actress played her role convincingly. Colin was as brilliant as ever and it's great to see him play a character from the 'dark side', a 'chill down my back' and after watching this I can not wait to see Colins 'recent film' Trauma'soon to be in DVD. <br /> <br /> Ok, maybe 'it was not a movie that was' in your face' so to speak and one could not 'sleep on the plot', especially towards the end as there was a lot. but that was what I liked, the performance was subtle, fortunately not exaggerated (like many suspense thrillers), which made the movie even more spooky to watch. One simply could not guess what the character of Colins (Ross Talbert) would do or, for that matter, the character of Jennifer Rubens (Jamie Harris) who was going to do next, and there were many surprises in the store, I sat on the edge of my seat in everything, with a cushion by hand! <br /> <br /> Personally, I am very happy to have seen 'Playmaker' and I will certainly rewind and watch again. I think any Fan of Firth would benefit from watching this movie, if you did not like the plot, then just look at Colin ;-))
