I like this movie above all others. It is "multi-layer"; There is a lot to see and appreciate. Each visualization brings a new appreciation of the plot, the plot and the characters. He acted without failures and was extremely nice if he took the time to see and appreciate it. I love the interaction between the players; the subtle relationships; The atmosphere of time. Ralph Fiennes is the perfect cast as the meditative lover and Geoffrey, the abused husband, is very well minimized by Colin Firth. The scene in the sandstorm where Catherine and El-masy are discussing the different types of sandstorms is one of the highlights of the film and where the affair really begins. The other relationship between Hanna and El-masy is another "layer" of the film that is totally charming (and heartbreaking). A winner worthy of so many awards.
