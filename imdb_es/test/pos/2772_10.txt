I love this movie. Is it already in the air? What can I do to reissue it because I miss this movie when this movie is aired again? I love this movie so much. Does anyone know how much time has passed since the last time at Disney? It's been a long time and I'm tired of waiting. I want to see Susie Q again. I swear, they take all the good movies out of the air and play new stupid gays that are fake and retarded. I miss this movie, I want a star, Kazaam with Shaquille O'neil and a lot more. Where did all the good movies go? I want them back. I miss all good movies and they do not have them anymore. If someone finds out if Susie Q or some good old Disney movie comes out, please let me know, my email is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl (no blank) 148. Thank you and I hope you also want to see this movie again . Have a great day
