Five fingers of death: although the previous epics of Shaw Martial Arts had shown the influence of the genre of American cowboys, none had paid a tribute as open as this, especially in the scene of fight room. And although the Shaw Bros. movies had been borrowed from the Japanese chambara (sword fighting) genre before, none had done it as successfully as this one. I suppose some of this had to do with the fact that the director originated in Korea and, therefore, offered a non-Chinese perspective to such loans, which undoubtedly raises some interesting questions about culture; but in any case, this film presented true innovations in technology and technique in the Hong Kong action films. For the first time in Hong Kong, the camera had access to a whole set, which meant shots from many different angles, such as the low-angle interior photo showing the ceiling of a room (the original American innovation of which is generally attributes to John Ford), or the high-angle shot that allowed the visualization of a large area of ​​the terrain, or the frontal tracking shot. <br /> <br /> It is true that it was not the first hand-to-hand combat film of true cinematic substance, which is still the "Chinese boxer" of Wang Yu; but at a commercial level, Shaw Bros. was right to choose 'Five Fingers' as its first major release to the West because, arguably, it was the 'least Chinese' of its action films, that is, the least dependent on purely Chinese Traditions. of the theater. Although this did not impress the American critics at that time (who shattered the landscape), it was not lost on the American public, especially among African-Americans, whose culture had always been, by necessity, an eclectic mosaic of borrowed elements and innovation. In 'Five Fingers' they were given the opportunity to discover the core of the story, in the serious young man forced to make an extra effort to overcome social barriers and betrayal so that his merit was recognized. This seems to be a universal theme for modernity, but each culture has its own way of expressing and resolving it; 'Five Fingers' presented it in a way that many Americans could relate to as much as the Chinese. <br /> <br /> So, is the movie now only of historical value? Certainly not. On the one hand, this problem has not disappeared. Second, some of the innovations leave much of the film with an aspect as current as it did in its first release. In addition, the action is well organized, and the performances, although a little too serious, are clear. The film is too long a force, but the story covers a lot of ground. And there are wonderful arrangements, like the confrontation in the room, the fight on the way to the contest, the strange double ending. <br /> <br /> It definitely looks better on a movie screen, but it's still impressive to see at home: recommended.
