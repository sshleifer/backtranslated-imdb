"Sister Helen" is an excellent documentary about a rigid (intolerant) nun with a dirty, bitter and Oblate mouth who runs a shelter for drunks and drug addicts in a badly deteriorated neighborhood in the South Bronx. All but one of the 21 residents are drunk / addicted. Robert, the only representative of the middle class? I had a real job, home, and even a BMW? He regrets that she died before he could scold her. Why? <br /> <br /> Robert, like six of the residents, was on probation. He complained that Helen was holding a huge stick over him and was constantly threatening to hand him over if he did not tow her. In an "extras" interview, she said Helen ran the center to compensate for the death of the three men in her life. her husband and two children <br /> <br /> The husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at age 55. One child died of an overdose of heroin and the other was stabbed to death at age 15. Helen stayed with a daughter, whom she left to run the center. The daughter was not happy. He loved his mother. <br /> <br /> The fascinating thing is how little Helen changed. Apparently, she made a big change in the sea. But after watching this fascinating and disturbing video a few times, once with the directors' narration, it became clear that Helen replaced 21 male addicts with bosses to replace their three dead men. <br /> <br /> Helen admits that she ignored her children and spent every day in bars. However, at the age of 56, his bossy attitude, intolerance and sharp tongue did not emerge. Living with her must have been extremely difficult. Even Robert says he stayed clean despite Helen. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Helen abusing a man who wants to live in the shelter. Supposedly she is showing her understanding of the street. Again, she publicly belittles Mel, her "assistant" for not bathing for a year. Then she waves her dirty pillowcase in the air. The film is slimy with Helen threatening and degrading people. His signature song is "My Way". Her favorite phrase is: "I will be totally honest with you". Often, people who use such phrases turn out to be the opposite. <br /> <br /> The residents are really depressed. Only Robert has business skills beyond pushing a broom. Everyone desperately needs a roof over their heads, and Helen, since she runs the place herself, has the power to admit or evict whoever she wants. She does not have a board of directors to respond and does not get public funds. It is his show. <br /> <br /> Helen believes in the approach of cookies towards sobriety. She stopped drinking cold turkey and that means that everyone else can also. She blames substance abuse on drugs or alcohol, and not the underlying problems that led men to drink and get high. She is not a therapist, only a landlady who dyes her hair, wears a habit, exerts absolute power over her tenants and stops drinking. <br /> <br /> Helen also controls her on her inmates by demanding urine tests (ureen she calls him) in the applications. Twice as old, a long-time resident, very solid and respected, in whom she trusted, failed her tests. Helen was furious and evicted him. Major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never used heroin. Helen did not give in and could not consider that she could have made a mistake. This was especially worrying because he knew Major for a long time. However, she discounted her relationship with him, assumed he was a liar and completely trusted the results. Mayor finally discovered that the codeine in his cough syrup appeared as an opiate. Helen never publicly apologized, but supposedly reconciled with the principals in private. <br /> <br /> Helen also had a very stained reputation in her old neighborhood. She tacitly admitted to Robert that she had once got up too late one night to cut someone's tires. The person mistreated her and, of course, she deserved to have her tires cut off. She was not a good woman. So, in the end, did she decide the only way to keep the name of Travis alive (her last name)? Since the death of the three male travises? was to start the Travis Center. <br /> <br /> For some of the residents it was a great offer. They complied with Helen and, in exchange, they received a place to live cheap, safe, sober and structured. One however, said he preferred jail. Addicts and drunks do not need to be treated like children. Helen used "old school" techniques that have been discredited. However, no one was forced to stay in the center and for some, it was definitely a positive experience. The Travis Center is not a treatment center. It is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who straighten their lives. <br /> <br /> To receive the full experience of Sister Helen, see all the additional interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences living with Sister Helen and her guests.
