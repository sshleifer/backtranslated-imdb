Ok, maybe Posse can not be compared to other popular cowboy / western movies. But that's because I did not have the funding that those films had. Obviously, when you want to produce a story like this, focusing on African-American historical participation (and NO, the servants and the 'mamis' are not a historical participation), Hollywood is not going to be too understanding. And believe me they were not. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of "pocket" expenses to make "Posse", just so that the story could be told. I think it's just commendable. Posse may not be Oscar material (and they do not like black media either), but it's a start. It is entertaining and introduces us to the black cowboy, a character that most of us are not familiar with.
