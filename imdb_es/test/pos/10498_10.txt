A while ago I saw this movie and it seems that I can not track it. Does anyone know where I can get it? I feel it's worth it to see him again. <br /> <br /> I regret to say that I had never heard of Chloe Nicholle until this movie. Yes, she can act. When I started tracking this movie, I confused it with another of his films, Sex Spa. The plot seems similar, but the roles are reversed. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've seen Dru Berrymore. I looked for some of his other films and I feel that he looks better as a blonde. <br /> <br /> I agree that this is a good introductory film. Not too soft. Not too hard You have to start somewhere.
