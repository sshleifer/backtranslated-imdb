The most intense and powerful film I've seen in years. There were other films before they went into the Vietnam Vet, but nothing compared to this emotionally heartbreaking film, since a typical American suburban family, around 1972, melts at the seams, revealing the scars that Vietnam has left in our group collective. souls The cast is fantastic A ++++, with the four actors (with Kathy Bates a standout) giving fascinating performances. The wonderful thing about this film is that it does not take sides, but it includes the four characters and identifies with them, even though the four have divergent points of view and needs. Here are scenes that are as powerful as the family secrets and the feelings that are revealed (like the confrontation between the son and the mother) that will make you feel emotionally exhausted and crying with anguish. I really cried in this movie, something I rarely do. The shocking ending is a stunner! A very overlooked film that must be seen. I rate this 1996 movie a 10/10 superlative piece. Highly recommended especially in this day and time, our country was involved in a horrible war, our holders shouted of atrocities and, again, our young men and women returned with deep psychological scars, with their deep sorrow for the facts done in the line of honor. . You have to see the movie.
