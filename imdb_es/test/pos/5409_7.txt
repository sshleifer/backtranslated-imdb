The Kinks warned about media heroes. Outside of movies, most of the heroes are also "ordinary people". Society demands some role playing, but what happens when that extends to the father-son relationship? Do some parents try to improve themselves through their children instead of the other way around? How is a role model provided but not a role? A brilliant swimmer who hates to swim; A brilliant musician who will not play. Unconventional, fun (despite the representation of "serious" problems), very good multidimensional action by everyone. Many twists of the plot complement the emotional tension. The heroes of celluloid never feel any pain. I do not remember ever being disappointed with a Sigourney Weaver movie (I even liked "The Village"!).
