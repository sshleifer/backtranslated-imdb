Like many of the stars on the big screen as their careers ended, many turned to television, where they probably earned their reputation as posterity. Donna Reed is an example of that. <br /> <br /> I do not think Donna Reed thought that Donna Stone was anything challenging, not for a woman who had won an Oscar for playing a very different guy in From Here for eternity. She was certainly better prepared to play his wife, mother and housewife, Donna Stone, after having played Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life. <br /> <br /> Donna was always beautiful, wise and always helpful with the problems of her children and her husband. Carl Betz was not an idiot, he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house. Talk about the man who is always ready in a crisis. <br /> <br /> Although this was the Donna Reed Show because Donna's husband at that time, Tony Owen produced it. However, it lasted as long as it did because of the popularity of the two children, Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had the best selling teen album, Johnny Angel, which she presented on the show. She successfully made the transition to the adult star, best known for her role in Coach as the wife of Craig T. Nelson. <br /> <br /> But Petersen was a teenage chewing gum idol in his day. Donna Reed's show dares to say that she attracted the majority of her viewers thanks to him. He forgot now, but Petersen also had a best-selling record, My Dad. He did not do it as much as Johnny Angel. <br /> <br /> Now Paul Petersen runs a support group for former children stars like him. Many of them end so tragically, it's a good job that he's doing. <br /> <br /> The Stone family was the quintessence of Central America. They lived in a suburb near Chicago, led healthy lives. Mom and dad were always there for the children. Of course, the problems they had usually were nothing more than breaking the curfew. <br /> <br /> It's this series that I think was the model for the television city of Pleasantville where Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are absorbed. <br /> <br /> I have nice memories of The Donna Reed Show. Easy to drink, but not too serious.
