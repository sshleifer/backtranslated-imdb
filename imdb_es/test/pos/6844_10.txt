Sure, there are things here that the Coen and Elmore Leonard have done before, but so what? If you want entertainment, lustful and intelligent, "Judas Kiss" is almost perfect. The fans offended by the tongue in the cheek do not understand it (Talk about how to expose their sex and their violence, keep their investors happy.) That is independent cinema 101). As for the British who make a package, I doubt it very much. This film is clearly a work of love and the budget is probably not half of Mr. Tarantino's salary. Maybe men do not like it as much as women. I thought it was rocking. Go Coco!
