John Wayne is one of the few players in film history who failed on his first big break and then succeeded in the second time. Of course, everyone knows that the second time was the classic Diligence with the direction of John Ford. <br /> <br /> But we're here to talk about The Big Trail. John Ford's fellow director, Raoul Walsh, saw this tall guy on the set of one of Ford's movies and thought he had potential. He wanted to make him the leader of a large Western budget that Fox planned to make. The film, as planned, would be a tribute to the famous and silent western western The Covered Wagon. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing The Big Trail, I was struck by how similar the Wayne character of Breck Coleman here is to the Ringo Kid on Stagecoach. . Both characters were nice young cowpokes, but both were also on a mission of revenge. And, of course, both films were made in the place and show the expense in doing them. There is no study product here with a western backlot set. <br /> <br /> I also do not think it was an accident that Wayne had this opportunity at the beginning of the sound era. Raoul Walsh, I guess he looked at Hollywood and probably did not think that many movie cowboys had the power to keep the sound. That's another thing Walsh discovered in Wayne. <br /> <br /> According to what I have read, The Big Trail failed because after spending all that money to make the film in a widescreen process, a genius of Fox realized that his theaters were not equipped with the wide screen to show it. And when the Great Depression came, there would be no money to expand those screens in Fox theaters. So The Big Trail got a limited release, even in what we would call a formatted version, and lost a lot of money for Fox movies . <br /> <br /> Marguerite Churchill is fine as the crinoline heroine that Duke wins, loses and wins again from Ian Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens and F. Tyrone Power are the trio of villains that Wayne has to deal with. <br /> <br /> F. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous legend of the movie Tyrone Power. He was a corpulent man with a great career in classic roles on the screen and on stage. I would not be surprised if your son, who at that time was 15 years old, was not hanging around the set. <br /> <br /> Also look for Ward Bond, although you might have trouble locating him in a large room. beard. <br /> <br /> Watching The Big Trail it is now interesting to speculate about where John Wayne's career might have gone if The Big Trail had been a great success.
