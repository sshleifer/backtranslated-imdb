This is another film where cinematography is the best to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travel diary, but as a dramatic exercise in film art, that's not enough. The issue of respect and cooperation between species timidly ventures into the forbidden world of love between species, but its approach is stereotyped, indicating a lack of understanding of the motives of behavior of both species. As with many movies, one always wonders what could have been achieved with a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Oh, we'll probably never know.
