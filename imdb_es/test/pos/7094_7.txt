One True Thing rises above its potentially messy material to give us a vision of a family of complex relationships and real and imperfect people. It opens with Rene Zeleweger discussing the death of her mother with the District Attorney; saving us the cheap film shots of a "shocking" illness and death. From there, we move on to a family system, in which everyone plays with a set of unexamined rules, and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. <br /> <br /> William Hurt as the self-important father, and Meryl Streep as the mother of Suzy Homemaker are excellent; Shades and not what they seem to be. Zeleweger is furious, angry and surprised at herself. Tom Everett Scott does not have much to do, but he does it well. <br /> <br /> The story is predictable, and it takes at least one malicious twist that it should not have taken, but the performances and the vision of the family as a place where anger and love mix together makes worth it.
