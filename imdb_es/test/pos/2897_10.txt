This DVD will be treated with indifference by millions of devotees of classical rock music around the world because Rush is simply not cool. It is a pity that Rush has had to overcome the scornful disdain of most American and British music journalists in their more than thirty-year history, as this has deprived many people of participating in a real band. Each of the last four decades is well represented here and what a catalog of songs it is! We have the seminal "2112", the magical "The Trees" and the lyrical "Tom Sawyer" interspersed with the high energy and challenging pieces of the genre of his latest album "Vapor Trails". The musical mastery is almost impeccable, the theatrical show is spectacular and the Brazilian fans are simply crazy (at one point, they sing with an instrument!) Each member of the band plays at a level that challenges the artisans who believe in the art. this tests the instrumentals "La Villa Strangiato" or "The Rhythm Method" for size, and yes, the latter is a drum solo (which must be seen to be believed). <br /> <br /> Sound production and vision values ​​are very high as befits the Rush experience and you also get a documentary and multiple angle pieces to boot. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing performance and a tribute to Canadian rockers and all serious fans of classic rock should own a copy.
