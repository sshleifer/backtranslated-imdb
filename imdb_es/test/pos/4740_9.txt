I have seen many documentaries in which it seemed that the law was on the wrong side of the fence: The Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost come first to mind. But this is the first movie that made me boil with rage after seeing it. In my opinion, from the evidence presented in this film it seems clear to me that what happened in Waco was at least an unprofessional and careless disaster on the part of the FBI and the AFI, and in the worst case it was an act of murder. Like most people, when the siege was happening in Waco, I assumed that David Koresh was a completely evil madman who led a violent cult. After seeing this, I think Koresh was more likely to be a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who, without realizing it, caught the attention of the US government through his eccentric actions. Of course, there were many weapons in the complex of the Davidian Branch. But none of that was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video images of the people inside the complex, they all seemed to be very nice and harmless. And it was annoying to see the cruel testimony of the men in charge of the government forces at the Waco site, the confused testimony of Janet Reno and the partisan defense of the attack on Waco, a defense led by some Democratic committees. . The highlight in my mind was the representative of NY and the current United States Senator from New York Charles Schumer. I voted for the man when I lived in the state of New York. I am a Democrat and I am also quite inclined to the left. After seeing your actions on this committee, I would like to go back in time and vote for D'Amato instead! For anyone who is remotely interested in government, this is a very important film, you have to see it. I even think that this should be shown in the classes, it is so important.
