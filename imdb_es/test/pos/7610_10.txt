I thought this movie was really awesome! One of Drew's best. I'm also a fan of Michael Vartan, so I thought he was very good at this movie. Why all the bad reviews. I would like to see this movie again and again if I could. I also loved the end. This movie has clearly shown a smile on my face! I was also surprised that James Franco and Jessica Alba were there. I love you both, so I also highlighted this movie. In the end, when Drew is making a great comment about the truth, he really told the truth of what sometimes happens in high school. Once again, the movie was incredible. Challenging a 10/10. I hope this comment is very useful for any IMDb reader.
