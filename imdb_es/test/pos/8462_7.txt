I saw this movie when it came out and then a couple of times more years later. I'm seeing it now 20 years later and it's still a very good story. Does the "movie network for life" break? Yes, but unfortunately life did not exist back then, so I needed some air. <br /> <br /> The cast was excellent. The story was a bit clumsy; Two women become close friends and, without anyone knowing, one of them is having an affair with the husband of his partner. She is invited to the house for a dinner, and that is how she discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend. She is horrified and tries to break the matter. Shortly after he dies tragically in a car accident that is devastating both women. Of course, the wife finds out about this matter by chance and wants Holly out of her life now, but their friendship can prevail because they need each other. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good story. Great cast and perfomrances. I really enjoyed it.
