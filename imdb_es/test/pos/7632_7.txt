Surprisingly good film made in the wake of the Exorcist about a young woman who is possessed by a spirit after she goes to an unsanctified church to restore a life size and a life like the crucified man. The piece was Christ and the two thieves, however, Christ was sold a long time ago. The problem begins once the figure withdraws from the cross and seems to come alive and seduce the woman. From that moment on it becomes a battle for the girls' soul. Spooky, scary and much better than you think the movie works because its cast sells events that are decidedly adult. It helps that these real people have defects, so it is easier to relate to them. I really liked this movie, and seeing it for the first time in at least a decade, I was surprised at how good it is. Definitely better than any of its thousands of exorbitant titles makes it look like.
