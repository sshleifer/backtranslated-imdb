Great small short film that aired some time ago on SBS here in Aus. Get a copy if you can (it's probably only good for some visualizations, since you'll end up remembering the script) and it's the twists that make this movie so much fun. Well directed and intriguingly written, it is an example of how good low-budget short films can be.
