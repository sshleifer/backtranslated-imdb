I remember that I did not like this movie the first time I saw it, but it has grown in me. I love the costumes and poses that the actors do, the humor, the cinematography, the soundtrack. The scenes are very rich, and it moves very fast. Every time I see it, there is something new that catches my attention. Aaliyah as Akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it, but not enough. <br /> <br /> Also, the Lestat in this movie IS different, it's not the same character. You can see that the character of Armand has been given qualities similar to those of Lestat because I assume that Anne loved him. But there's no reason to tear this movie apart just because it's not like books, it's fascinating on its own.
