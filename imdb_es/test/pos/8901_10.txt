After another raid on an empty village, Viking chief Timandahaf misunderstands Cryptograf's explanation that "fear gives wings to the inhabitants" and believes that fear actually blows the villagers. They decide to pursue the champion of fear in Gaul to learn to fly and turn them into invincible warriors. Meanwhile, Vitalstatistix's nephew, Justforkix, is sent from Parisium to the village of Gaulish to become a man and Asterix and Obelix are assigned to train the young man. The stupid son of Cryptograf, Olaf, listens to a conversation of the coward Justforkix with Asterix and Obelix and kidnaps him. While they return to the Viking village, Justforkix meets Abba, the daughter of Timandahaf, and they fall in love. But the ambitious and Machiavellian Cryptograf plan to marry his son Olaf with Abba and become powerful. In the end, Asterix realizes that it is not fear that gives wings, it is love. <br /> <br /> As a teenager, Asterix was my favorite comic book and I read all the stories of Goscinny and Uderzo. This film shows all the original elements and the humor of the comics in a delicious and wonderful animation. The romance of Justforkix and the beautiful Abba is charming and the situations in which Asterix and Obelix are involved are very funny. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ast√©rix e os Vikings" ("Asterix and the Vikings")
