Great party movie, following the adventures of Bill and Tom, two high school classmates at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live a straight life, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) does not take anything seriously, except partying all the time. When Bill moves out of his mother's house to live alone he faces many problems, from his girlfriend to his brother and his owner. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves to keep the rent low, but he proceeds to change Bill's life. This movie is a non-stop comedy from beginning to end and is one of my favorites. The soundtrack features guitar virtuoso Edward Van Halen throughout the film, also featuring the cameos of rockers Lee Ving and Ron Wood. The legend of the 70s Kitten Christmas porn star also makes an appearance! The classic movie of the 80 is worth multiple looks. Now all you have to do is a much anticipated DVD release! If you liked this movie, check out "The Last American Virgin," which is similar to "Wild Life." I rate both highly.
