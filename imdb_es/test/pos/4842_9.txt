Being relatively young, I did not know how bad anti-Semitism was in Brooklyn, where my family was originally from. This movie absolutely horrifies me. I have seen many movies about prejudice, racism and anti-Semitism, but this hit me harder than most. <br /> <br /> This was definitely one of the best independent films I've seen in my life ... I had to travel 45 minutes to see it, and it was worth it. Almost everything about the movie was great. Sometimes it was a bit slow, but that really did not bother me because the movie was very atmospheric. It took place in the 40s, and it really looked like it was the 40s. The performance was great ... William H. Macy, as always was wonderful, so was Laura Dern, and I was pleasantly surprised by Meatloaf's performance, playing the vicious antisemitic neighbor. <br /> <br /> 9/10
