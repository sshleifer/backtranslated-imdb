It is interesting to see what people think of this film, since it is, in fact, quite unique (although it carries some of the trademarks of the Clive Barker script). Although it may seem a little cynical to say so, the film is complex enough to deflect those who need the hooks from the standard Hollywood plot, and in layers, so if you expect to be fed, you'll see a monster movie normal with a lot of monsters and a disconnected plot. <br /> <br /> Those who need a linear, specific and unraveled plot will hate this movie, because the story is, as in the novel, partially between lines, or in this case, Partially off the screen, in the comments and in the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another possible problem is the end, which I can say, without spoiling it, which is not all good or bad at all. In fact, it is not very definite at all, what I know sends some people to furious tantrums about not knowing what happened, but for me, and for many others, I'm sure, just add another dimension of the story : the dimension of speculation and, in addition, the point that a large interruption has a tendency to cause undulations that extend far enough. <br /> <br /> There is definitely moral here, but in a quite different way. more than the standard Hollywood screen type on your face at the end of the movie. Summarizing that the moral is simple, although it is not as simple as it is shown; Prejudice and the human tendency to hate different people. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, although, as many of the critics have noticed, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of David Cronenberg, who makes a comment). wonderful aspect) are rather tacky. However, I am not sure that they are the only ones to blame for their ramshackle appearance and lack of depth, since these are common problems in turning literature into a script. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a great movie. , as long as you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie.
