Being a middle-aged mother myself, I greatly appreciated seeing a romance between older people that interweaves in the many problems that affect us. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still having a happy life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Richard Gere, but he always does a good job with the guy who is a jerk, but he learns something about himself. <br /> <br /> Criticism of your romance as unrealistic is unjustifiable compared to most other romantic movies. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fall in love with Australia, with hardly a conversation between them, it is considered a great romance. Here we have much more with Rodanthe. She redeems it. He frees her. It's nice. <br /> <br /> The intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity, the fans in a flame of passion. How long it takes is irrelevant. Maybe the film was a bit too subtle in the sense that it was the letters they shared during the following year that deepened their relationship, again another real way to meet a person. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoyed the plot and the themes, the dialogue was not consistent in quality. Some lines sounded so real, and other lines were embarrassingly flat and flat. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the relationships with Adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend, reminding us that there are many types of love, not just romantic love. <br /> <br /> This is not a bit cheerful. The romantic comedy, plus a romantic drama. It has a very relaxed pace that some might consider too slow. <br /> <br /> The beach house is a fabulous work of art. Look for the wooden bench adrift on the porch in the first bread basket of the house, very beautiful. I also enjoyed the music and the stage, which combined to create the effect of the location as the third main character. It was this place away from their normal lives that allowed them to see themselves and each other from a different perspective. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to appreciate these issues and are in the mood to cry. Get out of the Kleenex and enjoy this movie.
