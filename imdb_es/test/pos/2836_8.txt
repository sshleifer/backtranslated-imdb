This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements of the Westerns released during the 50s; the cavalry that needs to protect the territory from a band of murderous Indians, a determined officer to carry out that task, and the men with him with various character flaws that have to merge into a cohesive unit. This small band must cling to a fort located near the Indian village until the reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, very well, that the small band is poorly protected, and could be eliminated before help arrives. An important difference for this film, "Only the Valiant", is that it tries to reproduce the usual plot, but at the same time, it transmits the message that duty is a primordial concern to be shared by all, even if they do not. Do not accept that charge. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck embodies the captain of the tight-lipped troop that has to prevent the Indians from entering the territory. The soldiers who take him to the small outpost are the stool of the troops in the fort; they, in turn, have complaints or weaknesses that make them wonder if the captain has not taken them out due to his general lack of devotion to a cause. Finally, the captain and the small band confront the hostiles, and at the same time, each faces its own defect. The cast includes the West's stalwarts such as Ward Bond, Gig Young, Neville Brand, Lon Chaney, Jr. and Warner Anderson. <br /> <br /> A sleeper of a movie, and a good solid western for fans of this genre.
