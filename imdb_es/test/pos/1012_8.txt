Despite some truly scenic locations in the East and sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this film does not reach the level of Joe D'Amato's similar efforts while remaining almost as of poor quality. The author of the original book "Emmanuelle: The joys of a woman", Emmanuelle Arsan, directed and had a small role in this film, which mostly pornographically exhibits a very young Annie Belle while in a variety of strange sexual situations . Her boyfriend, played by Al Cliver of ZOMBIE, actually approves of her sleeping and even convinces her to continue with her practices, even after they got married. Orso Maria Guerrini is presented as a teacher who, in general, is married simultaneously with two women, one of whom is played by Arsan herself. Despite starting in a promising way and having some hilarious lines of dialogue like "can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "I can see you better naked!", The movie wobbles throughout the plot to the less spectacular end. Like EMANUELLE AND THE LAST CANNIBAL D'Amato, the main characters are all looking for some lost tribe, but do not get your hopes up, there is no violence at all in this movie, and there is not much sex either. Just a lot of nudity and silly dialogue. I could not help but find some appreciation for this little movie, if only for the logic of the corn ball that passes.
