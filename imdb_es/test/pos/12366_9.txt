Not as well known as English, American, German and French cinema, although the Swedish cinema of the 1920s was also quite good, interesting and revolutionary. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has become great because of its history. The story is told in a way like "A Christmas story", in which death itself confronts the deceased with his past, present and what could have been. Of course, it is a story that focuses on morality and does it very well. The message is presented as very powerful and effective. Of course, this is also definitely due to the effective direction of the father of Swedish cinema; Victor Sjöström. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the novel by the other Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf. The story is adapted by Victor Sjöström himself, who perhaps should have taken some more elements, to allow the story and the film to flow better. It may take a little too long before the movie starts to take shape and the story clears up, but when the film takes shape and rhythm it becomes really wonderful. <br /> <br /> The movie not only has a great story, it is also a good one. The film uses some early and effective effects, and uses different color filters to create the right mood and indicate what past, present and "future". <br /> <br /> Sjöström not only wrote and directed this movie, he also plays the main character. Of course, the acting in the film is sometimes exaggerated, according to current standards, but not as bad as in the first German films. And after all, this movie has more to do with its history and its morale than with acting, so it really does not matter much or distract. <br /> <br /> A classic silent movie underestimated really excellent and effective. from Sweden. <br /> <br /> 9/10
