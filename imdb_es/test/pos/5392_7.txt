Gary Cooper and a Marshal change their identity, since both agree that Cooper would be more efficient against the outlaws. What is remarkable in this film are the costumes, both the marshal and Steve Cochran, who is the bad guy. Cochran uses his weapons backwards, probably to be able to cross. The movie starts quite exciting with a confrontation with Wild Bill Hickok. Ruth Roman, very pretty is the marshal's fiancee. There is a lot of action, never a boring moment, but you have to concentrate, because the story is a bit complicated. Good entertainment
