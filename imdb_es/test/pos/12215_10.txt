Someone asked why it was canceled. I tell you why. Because "reality" makes money. the surface of the program was canceled so that they could replace it with a "reality" program, this will persecute NBC, me and almost half of my high school, approximately 1000 people in total have committed to boycott NBC, until to recover this program. in my area (I do not know other places) but they had a great experience with the science fiction channel where the science fiction channel would show the episode of the last weeks at 7:00 and then the NBC would show the new episode of the week 8:00 this was great because it gave him some information about what happened in the last episode. I was so angry when I found out that the show was canceled and that they were going to leave them on top of the church that way!
