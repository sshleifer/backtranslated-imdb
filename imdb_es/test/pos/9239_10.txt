After seeing Texas Tale of Treason, Cox's miserable correspondence efforts could not even afford the massive collusion that Stu headed without a budget. Tell a story about dedication, sweat, genius, fire and punk rock. I love! My favorite parts are the interviews with Marci (she is a very good girl and she digs me but she does not know yet). The Japanese employee who was silencing his lines, that broke me. The sex scene was really great. I'm going to see if Stu will come at some point and do the light-wave box when I do it with my wife. The introduction and of course my 5 seconds during the closing credits. I know that's going to get me some girls. I hope to see more of Antstuie because I know I can expect the unexpected.
