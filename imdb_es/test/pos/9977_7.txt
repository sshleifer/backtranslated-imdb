The first time I saw the movie announced, I thought it was going to be another Disney movie that almost goes directly to the video. I finally moved and rented it. I thought it was going to be bad because I could not see Shia in any other role than her recently canceled "Even Stevens" program. When I turned it on, I was ready to turn it off for boredom in about ten minutes. It started a little slow and I could not understand the beginning because the years did not make sense and then they explained it to me later in the program, so I felt relieved when asked about that. In general, I thought it was a good movie and I would recommend it. The cast was top notch and, although I'm not a golf fan, easily kept my attention with a good plot.
