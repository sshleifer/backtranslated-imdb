The Women is a beautiful film about women of all ages (but mostly over 30 years old) and their problems in life. Not only men and infidelity, but also relationships with friends and family, making time to connect with others, problems with the image, compromising their values, achievements in life and finding what will really make them happy. <br /> <br /> It's also about being true to yourself. Many times, people give you advice but do not follow it themselves. Sometimes, they have created an illusion for themselves, and should they really follow the same path or react according to their feelings now? I really liked this movie. Of course, sometimes I tried to be like Sex & the City, but that probably helped me. The difference here is that it is like the discoveries after the stage of life in which the stars of Sex & the City were: here, most are married or beyond the point of trying to find a man. Now, they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives. <br /> <br /> Obviously he is not an Oscar candidate, but he is entertaining and fulfills his purpose. <br /> <br /> And for the men out there, there was an equal proportion of men and women in the movies (most were with their wives / girlfriends), and the men were actually laughing. :)
