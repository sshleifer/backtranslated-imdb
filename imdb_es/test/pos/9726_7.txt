I had no idea what I was going to experience when I saw this old 1940 movie. However, I always enjoy watching Laraine Day, (Katie Lattimer), who plays the younger sister of Jean Muir, (Helen Lattimer) and also his mother. Billie Burke, (Mrs. Julia Lattimer). I thought I would be bored by the story of two sisters and a mother who protects her daughters too much until they meet Robert Cummings, (Ridley Crane) who has the reputation of being a millionaire playboy who has many girls and is a great drinker who does parties all the time. One night, Helen Lattimer goes on a date with Ridley and he proceeds to be bombarded and simply can not drive his car. It is at this point in the movie when this becomes a drama and changes the whole direction of this film, which will definitely draw attention until the end of the film.
