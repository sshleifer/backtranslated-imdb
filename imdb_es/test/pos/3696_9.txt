Jenny Lewis plays a clumsy girl named Jade. She smokes and drinks. She does not have many friends and has an annoying mother (Beverly D'Angelo). Jade is closer and closer to her mother's boyfriend, Billy (Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I do not need to tell you what happens after that. <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes the whole world is to blame. This movie also has the best performance I've seen in television movies. Beverly D'Angelo does a very good job as a sweet and loving but neglectful and blind mother. He could not see what was happening under his own roof. Rob Estes is at his best here as the sleazeball. Jenny Lewis is the standout. She seems to be exactly like her character. <br /> <br /> It seems that everyone likes this movie!
