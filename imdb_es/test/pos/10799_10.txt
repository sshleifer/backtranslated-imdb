From the point of view, I knew it was going to be a fantastic movie, the rhythm, the cinematography, the indigenous personalities of the Dallas area, the diversification of characters, not to mention the director Oliver Stone and, of course, Eric Bogasian. The film begins on a Friday (suggestively hidden first) and begins with a radio station in Dallas presenting its number one talk show, The Barry Champlain Show (Based on talk radio host Alan Berg) ... Barry (Eric Bogasian is the presenter of radio talk shows and his work is such that it is obligatory to pontificate all the sensationalist nuances of the radio audience that fuels his program ... He tries to sympathize with a group of deviators from society have become lonely and vulnerable., obscene callers and who have the masochistic desire to be publicly vilified, Barry Champlain is effective in dealing with this class. and precarious, degrading them socially instead of simply submitting them to a simple reprimand ... New techno The logies have a stigmatic purpose for the Dallas radio audience, and the most important concepts take a back seat to perversion, they talk about " Baseball scores, orgasms and people's pets! "<br /> <br /> This is all a cacophony of drugs. Induced diatribes and a medley for psychopathic paranoia !! This high profile canyon fodder is something that Barry Champlain thrives on! The madness of this movie is perfect, since there is the perfect setting for this Barry Champlain movie! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> a fall of two thousand feet in terms of ideology. In downtown Dallas there is a dominant sense of cosmopolitan consciousness, so an important chapter of the Ku Klux Klan is located 20 miles away! ... The play is based in Denver That's where the real story takes place, other small plays represent the cities of Louisville, Atlanta and Cleveland. Dallas is the city where the movie takes place, I thought it was an excellent choice! ... This film illustrates how people have a wrong and erroneous and deadly misinterpretation of the Jews in the United States, through which they control the banks, their agenda. It is different from everyone else's and its intellectual literature leads to perversion! These preconceived notions aggravate the general dilemma of Barry Champlain. The personal ruin of Barry Champlain is that he is irascible and does not respond to his alcoholism, and his harsh and politically controversial nature is his ultimate downfall, this is what makes the film so credible !! <br /> <br /> The characters in The movie were well represented, Dan, the tailor made for the middle management ax man (played by Alec Baldwin), was constantly monitoring every movement of Barry Champlain! It is always misunderstood !! Ellen, his ex-wife, is the recipient of Barry's anguish and selfishness, but he can not abandon his feelings for Barry, regardless of the path of personal destruction he ends up having to go to !! The Dallas radio audience is a crucible of socially misplaced retrospectives that have fun with their own real flaws ... In part, everyone's complexes, including Barry Champlain's own, are what Barry Champlain does! ! His audience speaks of depravity, asks for improvements and finally becomes Barry Champlain's favorite project for prescribed sinners! The conflicts of the social culture turn into the fall of Barry Champlain! <br /> <br /> This movie is excellent !! In my opinion, the best image of Oliver Stone, including Platoon and Natural Born Killers ... That statement in itself tells you how magnificent is a Talk Radio movie ... The consultation, acting and co-production of Eric Bogosian is simply convincing! The angles of the camera, the dialogue, the representations of disturbing characters, all first class ... The cinematography of the Dallas skyline at the end of the film is excellent! Dallas has the dubious distinction of being considered a mega metropolis ... So now, as in Los Angeles and New York, there are cases of babies too numerous to count, neighborhoods of low-cost housing in Hell and budget cuts which will mean that there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this date next year! ... Dallas claims that it is an important metropolitan area in the precarious way in which human debauchery prevails! The city has its radios radio listeners who have taken a pejorative turn to the wonder of the communication of air waves across the country! These are the culprits in the movie !! The ruffians of the tabloid macabre who want to meet the great bad wolf, and his decadent curiosity, has morally erased "The last neighborhood of America."
