The Box is one of the strangest movies I've seen in my life. To explain my experience, let me use this word image: imagine that you have been docking sticks of pixies and paint fumes during the last month while you did not see anything other than Twilight Zone replays. The resulting coma takes you to a hospital, where it seems that the nurse gets angry for shooting adrenaline in your IV. The dream you have while in a coma will be something like this movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: A man appears at the door of a couple. Give them a box with a button. Press the button, you will get a million dollars in cash and a person you do not know will die. I will try not to spoil anything, but from there things become a plot so interrelated, complex and purely original that it will make you question your sanity. But hey, most of us have been healthy for a while and the change is good. <br /> <br /> PROS: A surprising story, a good performance in general, it's not a slow moment once it starts. It asks questions about human morality that rarely, if ever, are made in popular culture. This movie is deep, it makes sense. It's not a very successful summer special effects fluff (not that there's anything wrong with that); This movie had a relatively low budget and was shown in some places. But I think maybe that's what I like so much. <br /> <br /> CONS: The first twenty minutes, before they start, are quite slow. At the end of the movie, you'll be so confused that you'll just have to sit and think for half an hour. I can guarantee that this film will not receive favorable reviews from its colleagues or most critics; It's too strange and there are no explosions every three seconds. In fact, there are no explosions of any kind in this movie (apart from your brain jumping to try to understand exactly what the hell just happened). Personally, I do not think this is bad, but many will. <br /> <br /> RATING: Easily a 9/10. I have never had an experience like watching this movie. The only reason I can not give it a 10/10 is that it is too wrapped up in itself. There are several big things that remain unexplained in the end that are still bothering me as I write this. But in general, this is the best experience I've had in a movie theater in a long time. But be careful, you will not like this movie if you can not sit down, activate your suspension of disbelief to approximately 150% and prepare your brain to do some awesome stunts. <br /> <br /> Visit www. thestuffblag.com for more comments
