Flowers If it's something you take away from this movie, it will be the flowers. They have such a prominent place and are used as plot devices, you will become an expert in identifying daisies and black tulips for when the film ends. <br /> <br /> In Amsterdam, Daisy tells the frustrating story of the love triangle. Between 1 girl and the 2 men of her life. One is a professional hit man who makes a living, the other is an Interpol agent. I could imagine the headaches in coordination. With the pan-Asian cast (Korean, Hong Kong) and the team (director Andrew Lau of Hong Kong, the Korean writer and a post-production team from Thailand), I can imagine the headaches in coordination. <br /> <br /> Park Yi (Jung Woo-sung) is a hit man who found a weakness for the painter Hye-young (played by the beautiful Jeon Ji-hyun). It is love at first sight in the meadows of daisies, where his clumsiness caught his attention. However, being shy and always aware of the dangers of his professional career, he can only admire it from afar, do small (or maybe big) things for him anonymously, but the one who takes the cake is to send his daisies in flower pot. Every day without fail at 4:15 p.m. He becomes his guardian angel from afar, protecting her and keeping her safe. <br /> <br /> Hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. She is constantly waiting for him to appear, but I really wonder how hard it could be to receive the almost punctual delivery of the daisies. However, she is terribly moved and moved by this one act. However, as the stars would have it, interpol detective Jeong Woo (Lee Sung-jae) finds Hye-young in a city square during one of his secret missions, and he is also captivated by her. Similarly, because of his profession, he has doubts about whether he should take the first step. <br /> <br /> That's where the audience would find it frustrating. The lady would obviously fall in love with the wrong guy (then, again, it's the "good" guy), Park Yi got mad at the search for Jeong Woo, but still refuses to come out and identify herself, and Jeong Woo is the opportunist in grab the Free Anonymous identity without knowing it. It's almost as if you want to slap everyone to wake them all up. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it is precisely this tension that keeps you intrigued. And it's perversely fun to see the two male leaders who find it hard to fall in love without jeopardizing their careers or that of their loved one. But do not worry about the fanatics of the action, there are enough revelations of cats and mice and comradeship without saying in the mold of the Infernal Affairs, as well as extensive shootings, although I felt that the ending could have been written with greater precision. <br /> <br /> What's cool is the smart edition. Tell the story in a non-linear timeline (do not worry, it's not that bad, you can still follow the narrative) from the points of view of all potential clients, keeping it in suspense and culminating in a screen divided into three directions that He shows all his emotions in a single convergent event, which seemed extremely well done to me. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful film in terms of landscapes of lush meadows and busy city squares, with lots of classical music to calm the soul. As with romantic movies, all the tracks are sweet to look at: the girls will have a field day with the two attractive male guides, while the boys have to settle for a rather plump face (argh! OK lah , in certain angles) Jeon Ji-hyun. <br /> <br /> If you like a romantic movie with the same balance in the action / tension department, then Daisy will be your choice. If you prefer a more conventional cry, then the other Korean film that premieres here at the same time, You are my sun, would be your alternative. And yes, I totally dig the final scene, why did I think that only Koreans do it better? A little reminded me of the JSA one.
