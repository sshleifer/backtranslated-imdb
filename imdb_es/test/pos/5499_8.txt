In The Line of Fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this fascinating film. Malkovich says he will kill the president, who purposely calls Eastwood and presses his buttons. It questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings a cold but very intelligent mentality to his character. Everything he does, he does it for a reason, and he is not shy to kill. Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors to catch Malkovich, but nobody wants to listen to him. The result is a movie that creaks with suspense that rises to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure hotel. Wolfgang Peterson increases the tension and we feel each turn.
