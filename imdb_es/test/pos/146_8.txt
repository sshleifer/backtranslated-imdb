A beloved and devoted priest from a small town volunteers for a medical experiment that fails and makes him a vampire. <br /> <br /> Physical and psychological changes lead to your relationship with a wife of your childhood friend who is repressed and tired of his worldly life. <br /> <br /> The one-time priest falls more deeply into despair and depravity. As things get worse, he struggles to keep what's left of his humanity ... <br /> <br /> The vampire movie should have gone extinct now thanks to the poor efforts of the Twilight and Underworld franchises, but the Director injects new blood into vampire history by putting simple things in perspective. <br /> <br /> These vampires have reflections and do not have fangs, but still they feed and die the same. Making the main protagonist a priest really opens a can of worms to question the acts. The priest feeds mainly to get better, but when he finds his wife dissatisfied with his friends, carnal instincts are established. <br /> <br /> What makes this film intensely erotic is that when the couple consents for the first time, it is. experiencing something they have never had before, passion forbidden, which makes the stage more sensual. <br /> <br /> Chan-Wook adds some much needed humor to the film, but this is only done in the last third of the movie. movie. We see the daughter raising her mother in the chair in front of everyone, and when she realizes her own strength, she simply lowers the chair and continues. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> and the final act would not be out of place in a cover film, or even the three Stooges when the couple struggles to survive / die respectively. <br /> <br /> CGI is subtle and fantastic, and the scenes with them jumping from building to building are so elegant that you could be watching ballet. <br /> <br /> The vampire genre feels fresh and vibrant after this, but the most important thing is that it has the eroticism and intensity that most vampire movies are losing these days. It is violent, but the director in question, would not expect anything different. <br /> <br /> A really interesting story, with fantastic characters and a beautiful photograph.
