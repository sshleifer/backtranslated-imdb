If you are in the midst of a fierce war and it is still unclear if you are going to get ahead, among the things that concern you is maintaining the morale of civilians ... demonstrating that our troops have the courage, ingenuity and dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And that's just what director Anthony Asquith provided to the British with the 1943 naval war movie, We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it is not surprising that part of the film is dated. It does not help that the class stereotypes that help define the men recruited from the officers can be discordant. Here, as in many other British war movies, men invariably have thick accents of the regional working class, while the officers speak with an educated fluency that would place them at home in the best establishments of England's ruling class. In this film, Freddie Taylor (John Mills), the captain of the submarine Sea Tiger, is intelligent, confident, witty, aggressive, in control, good with his men, comical with his teammates and rushes to make a decision. And it helps that I get lucky. His men are mostly cheerful, competent in their work and always ready with a joke when things get tense. Although we spend the first third of the film to meet these people while on leave, after that things get tense quickly. <br /> <br /> Taylor and his submarine are ordered to destroy Brandenburg, a new German battleship. They only miss the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and goes to the Baltic. Taylor evaluates the risks and decides that the Sea Tiger will pursue him, through minefields, anti-sub networks and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to the base of operations. After several tense situations, the confrontation takes place. The Sea Tiger releases six torpedoes but has to dive, not knowing if he had done his job. After an ingenious subterfuge, Taylor overcomes a couple of German destroyers, but then realizes that there is not enough fuel. He plans to sneak out of his submarine and surrender when, just at the last moment, James Hobson (Eric Portman), a sailor who had been sullen and lonely and speaks German, says there is a small Danish coastal town that has been a fuel. Deposit. He thinks it could still be for the Germans. The last third of the film is an exciting sequence of action, as the submarine team tries to keep the Germans long enough to pump enough fuel for the Sea Tiger to return to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda movie, so do not expect a failure. And did the Sea Tiger really knock Brandenburg down? Do men meet with their wives and boyfriends? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and young son who let him smile for once? Freddie Taylor finally had the chance to use all those feminine names in his little black book? You will have to see the movie. <br /> <br /> There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, such as One of Our Aircraft Miss and The 49th Parallel by Powell and Pressburger, are still reluctant to see them because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators did not use obvious clichés of shorthand. Others, such as We Dive at Dawn, were created with enough clichés that when we see each other we have to remind ourselves how terrible was the time when the film was made. Still, Asquith can generate a lot of suspense even with some clichés. The sea tiger that made its way through a subnet was tense. The stalking of Brandenburg and the conspiracy necessary for the torpedo's shot were realistic; The sensible attitude of John Mill as he prepared to attack was well handled. The false preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges were as realistic, both inside and outside the submarine, as might be expected, and the battle for the fuel tank was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war movie, but it is a well-done, well-acted example of its kind and time. <br /> <br /> John Mills, it's worth mentioning, he had a long, long career. Especially in the fifties, he played in a series of serious films that look back on those days of World War II. He had the quality to show guts, joy and perseverance, but also to be trustworthy, a man England could be proud of while fighting in the war. Eric Portman, an excellent actor with a unique voice and the ability to give you so cold looks that you would like to wear a sweater, was the highlight of this movie. Everyone in the submarine is very angry in joke mode but with rigid lips, but Portman achieves some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman did good jobs working together in this movie.
