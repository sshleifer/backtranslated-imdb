Human Traffic is a view of an average weekend for a group of friends, it is a view of flight on the wall in their lives (and minds) that will show you how this group of friends relate to each other. There are many moments in which everyone can relate, such as being out of your head at parties and talking to strangers. The characters are people with whom you can relate and are credible in the roles they play in the film. The situations in which they find themselves are all situations in which we have all met, and that is where this film is successful. Issues related to sex and drugs are handled in an excellent way so as not to interfere in the relationships between the characters. The story of the movie is not all that, but that is not a criticism. This is a movie about people. This is a well written movie, with a soundtrack to die for. Pete Tong from D.J has put together an excellent selection of tracks for this file, which makes this one of the best movies I've seen in 1999. After watching this movie, I felt like I had gone partying all weekend. Fantastic movie! Jo Brand as the voice of reality - I need to say more! <br /> <br />
