Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about Nanny, a woman who gives herself everything to help those in need. It is told from the point of view of a child, taken by Nanny when his own mother is not up to the task. <br /> <br /> I respect this movie for three main reasons: 1) It is touching. , but not sappy It is told in a very real way, without much of the aggravating Hollywood narrative baggage. And the end is pretty good (tearful but not exaggerated). <br /> <br /> 2) Although it is clearly an African American film, it is set in the black community of Lackawanna, New York, after segregation. He does not wear his ethnic group on his sleeve. The story is based on the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) that surround their lives. He is not a preacher, he is simply good. <br /> <br /> 3) It has a great soundtrack (it can not beat the old school R & B and the Chicago blues). <br /> <br /> In general, the performance is strong, but not universally so. Some of the performances simply do not refer to the characters that the actors must represent. But considering that it was a film made for television, it is to be expected. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Imperfect but nice, good movie for a rainy day.
