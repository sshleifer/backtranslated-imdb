Actually, I had considered investing in this movie when Gorman was raising funds. I loved most of the script, but I did not like the ending. Gorman insisted that the end was as it should be. <br /> <br /> When I see the whole movie, I have to say that I am surprised. When reading the script, I had not imagined that the performance (and the direction of Gorman) would be as powerful and moving as it is here. The two tracks did an incredible job. They were very credible and it's worth watching this movie just for the performances of these two incredible stars. <br /> <br /> Now, for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie, do not keep reading as I need to watch the movie first. (In fact, I wish I had never read the script just to be able to experience the end of the movie first-hand). <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---------- SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have two main problems with the movie. First of all, and I'm sure I mentioned this when I read the script, the wife should have died. If she were dead, the ending would be much more credible. As it is, we have this guy who has been dying for a woman who left him "years ago". If she left him and he is still in love after so long, he would have to be seriously delirious. But he does not find himself that way in the script. (There is also the problem of why he did not spend all this energy after the wife he still loves). <br /> <br /> Also, if the wife was dead, we could really believe that they had one fulfilling, corresponding to love, and therefore I think the boy is devastated enough for the end to be reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, I do not buy Daphne doing what she does in the end. It would take a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl (very naive for a whore but believable because of Bohl's performance) did what she did. The character is simply not cold enough. And if she did this for a love or something else, then a complete piece of the movie / story is missing. <br /> <br /> Much of this film is reminiscent of "Sex, lies and videotape." I think it could have been so popular if Gorman had chosen to give the film a more credible ending. <br /> <br /> So watch the movie, enjoy the performance. And decide.
