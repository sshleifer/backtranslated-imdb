This is a movie that you will love or hate. I loved. If you are looking for suspense, great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc., you will not find it in this movie. It is a film of feeling good, sentimental, positive, uplifting. The heroes of the film are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), a man of strength and integrity, and Radio (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a man with mental retardation who finds a way to contribute to his world. I guess I did not find this movie to be "sentimental nonsense", as many did, because it seemed very real to me. I know people how are you. I've seen athletes who think it's fun to mess with the vulnerable. I have seen men of integrity defend the vulnerable. I have seen people who think that high school football is a serious matter. I have seen people who know what is really important in life. Any of these people could have been people that I knew. I laughed I cried I left the movie feeling good, remembering that there are people like Coach Jones and Radio in my world. If there are no people like them in yours, you may not like the movie. If you do not like a movie that shows the best side of human nature, you will hate it.
