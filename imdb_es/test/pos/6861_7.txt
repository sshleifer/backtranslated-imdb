An image of terror ultimately up to parody, but still in its completion, could scare some of those who are nervous or upset when they see what's under their skin. Although I laughed about it. It was easy to decipher the real murderer and his performance did not help. This only led Powerful to look even better. Anatomie is not a horror image for those who are alien to the genre, but those who are content should get some unintentional laughs and an interesting spike in German horror movies. 6/10
