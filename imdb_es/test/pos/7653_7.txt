I ended up liking this movie, but it was not the easiest to understand. What makes the movie great is the music and the landscape. The songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. It did a great job to show different configurations for rom people. <br /> <br /> However, the viewer was not guided enough. A deeper story of the Rom people would have been nice. Only a fraction of the spoken words received English subtitles. In addition, they would also have appreciated more explanations about the configuration and who was his and some of his challenges. It would have been useful if there was a narrator who also explained about customs, dress and music.
