First of all, let me say that this movie is not for everyone. It has a very strange theme. A spinster who lives alone and lives a boring life discovers a young man in a park across the street from his house. She notices him sitting in the rain and invites him to dry and warm up. The man does not speak and the woman assumes that he is deaf and dumb. Even so, she is fascinated with him and sexually interested in him. He finds her strange and continues his silence, although later we discover that he is not mute at all and that he informs his sister of everything that is happening between him and the woman. I will not give away the rest of the plot. If you can find this movie look at it. You can not take your eyes off. What makes it so interesting? Well, it's totally unique. I have never seen anything like it and seeing these two together is very uncomfortable. Especially when you discover what this obsessive, boring and boring old maid is capable of. You will not forget it soon.
