The first time I saw this movie was in the late 60s, and I try to watch it every time it appears on television, which, unfortunately, is not very frequent. Now that I have TCM and FMC, I expect them to be activated at least once a year. Like Louis Gossett Jr. in An Officer and A Gentleman, Jack Webb offers an unbelievably great performance as a drill sergeant on Parris Island with the classic recruit and history in this case, although dated, it's moving and very well acted . . And having real fools in the cast certainly helped in the realism of the movie as well. It's a great movie with an excellent performance and a great story. See it if you have the opportunity. It's worth the time!
