I do not know how this movie went unnoticed for so long. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on TV, I was flipping through the channels and I came across this surprisingly well made movie.

You never know when they will be killed or what they are doing. so it's even more tense. Although there are many new faces, their performances were first class. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers play with your mind, revealing enough blood to make you imagine the rest. Shock, fear, horror and impotence are also highlighted in the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> The well-written situations, the fast movements of the camera, the elegant editing and the excellent direction make it an excellent suspense thriller.

Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I could not even move from the television even during commercial breaks. I was the impotent MUTE WITNESS of this magnificent movie.
