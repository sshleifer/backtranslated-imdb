I expected a lot from this movie, and I can say that it has not disappointed me. In the first place, this film, like a world tour through the elaboration of wine, allows the viewer to enjoy beautiful places. The people interviewed are also very interesting and fun, in particular Hubert de Montille. The shot can be confusing, the camera is always unstable and often focuses on secondary elements in the backgrounds. You may not like it, but I do not consider it a defect. <br /> <br /> The issues raised in the film can also be somewhat confusing, since globalization is not the only subject discussed. But Nossiter managed to give a consistency to his movie all the time. A great achievement of this film is to reveal all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are, avoiding the clich√© "Good against Evil". This could be the main difference between "Mondovino" and Michael Moore's documentaries; Nossiter's point of view appears in a subtle way, through opinions expressed by his favorite characters. The richness of this documentary is based mainly on the characters, the history of the long-standing wine families, such as De Montilles, Mondavis, Antinori and Frescobaldi. Nossiter allows the viewer to discover that wine is related in some way to families, rather than just a business and an industry. This film does not make you want to drink wine, but it certainly makes you want to discover vineyards and winemakers. <br /> <br /> I saw this film as a student in Oenology, and there are only so many ways to learn. I give this documentary 10 out of 10, despite its technical peculiarities.
