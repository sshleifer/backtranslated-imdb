Looking back on Alfred Hitchcock's career, it never ceases to amaze how such a brilliant and visionary man can be denied sufficient recognition of how revolutionary it was for the film industry. It's probably a sign of how far along he was at Hitchcock, always trying to push the envelope, and never moving forward with a movie made simply for the purpose of entertaining, but always with a deeper and poignant motive in his mind. Strangers in a train, one of Hitchcock's first and most underrated successes, is a perfect example of these traits: an entertaining and suspenseful story, even seen more than 50 years later, yes, but so carefully and intelligently constructed, it stands today as a masterpiece. In the technique of cinema. <br /> <br /> It could be said that one of the pioneering "thrillers of suspense", Strangers in a train may seem somewhat dated in certain aspects, but retains all the superbly elaborated tension as it did in 1951 (if at all less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting, as well as the quick and careful editing, are what really make the film stand out, avoiding as much tension as possible and keeping the focus of the audience even in slower scenes. If there was ever any doubt about what a simply masterful filmmaker was, Hitchcock, simply observing five minutes of Strangers in a train should be enough to disprove those feelings; Each shot is chosen and constructed with such care, everything serves to boost the plot in a particularly innovative way. Unfortunately, there are certain moments in history that are sufficiently out of place to take our focus away from superb cinematography and editing. Bruno is able to get to the bottom of a sewer grate and it is simply amazing. An old, stereotyped man who crawls under an out-of-control carousel provides an involuntary comic relief in what is supposed to be the most tense and attractive scene in the film. These are only brief moments, but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film. <br /> <br /> But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the premise of the story. As Hollywood films of recent times run the risk of inescapably descending beyond the plot of cliché turgid after cliché, it is wonderfully refreshing to see a 50-year movie with a premise that in reality seems intelligent and original. Of course it's quite simple, but the concept of "swap murders" is simply one that would not fly in today's movies, which makes it more entertaining to watch; The brilliant script of the film keeps the action flowing at a rapid pace and, at the same time, it provides us with some wonderfully memorable lines. One can not help noticing the deeper issues to which Hitchcock also alludes, especially the concept of "darkness in the heart of humanity", demonstrated by the elderly fascinated and enthusiastic about the prospect of murder, as well as by the attitude arrogant of Bruno. towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of dark humor (Bruno pops a child's balloon with his cigarette), and irony, shooting suspenseful scenes in happy and quiet environments, like the iconic carnival scenes, to create an even stranger atmosphere . . This may be a thriller of suspense, yes, but ignoring the brain hidden beneath it would simply be inexcusable. <br /> <br /> The antagonistic figure of Bruno (rehearsed to the perverse perfection of Robert Walker, sadly in his last role in the cinema, but easily stealing the film from his castmates with a very admirable talent) is without doubt what it does to the Strangers In such a memorable train, since the character is a marvel to behold. Here we have a simply magnificently elaborate villain figure, all the more intriguing because it is so ordinary and simple. Instead of cackling madly and frustrating the hero in every possible moment, Bruno is a calm and controlled psychotic disorder. He talks about murder in such a strange tone, but retains a passionate glow in his eyes when he talks about the different fashions of killing people. It seems that Bruno represents the "identification", as Freud would say, the inner, darker and uninhibited aspects of humanity. It makes an interesting contrast with the figure of the hero, Guy Haines, and how insipid and uninteresting it seems, almost as if to suggest that evil is much more interesting and attractive than constantly striving to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> However, despite this implicit message, Hitch still twists our emotions enough to encourage Guy at every moment, and encourage every new obstacle he is forced to overcome. It's a testament to the talent of actor Farley Granger that, even though the villain of Robert Walker easily steals the show, Granger's hero is still sympathetic, still in command of our support, even when we're prey to being a character much less convincing Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome the cliché and be a more innovative and complex figure of romantic interest, Kasey Rogers provides an impressive performance as the horribly manipulative and hedonistic first wife of Guy, and Patricia Hitchcock, proving that she is much more Talented than being simply "the director's daughter" would imply. The magnificent cast (led by a simply wonderful Walker) really brings the film to life, adding much more merit to the film than Hitchcock's impressive stylistics. <br /> <br /> In general, Strangers in a train may still seem a bit old-fashioned to certain viewers, but it still amazes the modern and attractive to the contemporary public, considering that it was launched half a century ago. . Once again, Hitchcock demonstrates his unparalleled mastery of the tension and technique of the film, and the film's surprising and original premise is worth seeing. Highly recommended for all those who wish to undertake a brilliant cinematographic experience, but very entertaining. <br /> <br /> -9/10
