For those who consider themselves to be reasonably intelligent human beings, who love cinema, have good attention to detail and enjoy independent films with a fun and intelligent dialogue, then this is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> For those with little attention span, high expectations and no brain ... well ... um ... you can get bored and find things that creep in sometimes. <br /> <br /> This is a lovely place, modest and of good rhythm. Film with actors that gives a true sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled almost all the way through ... <br /> <br /> This movie is a little gem.
