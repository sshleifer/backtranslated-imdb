WEEE this is still very fun! As with most of my friends, we had seen this movie on HBO when we were young, and since then we searched for a copy of it. When they finally reissued it a few years ago, we had a Midnight Madness party ... and the movie stayed well. Sure, it's pure cheese, but it's still fun. If you did not see MM when you were young, you may not appreciate its value today.
