This is my favorite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) Plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at first does not give you any clue as to what the cause was! Peter Falk is in the usual way in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favorite episode). The cast of support is excellent, especially Julie Newmar (very underestimated) and Jeanette Nolan as the housekeeper that Columbo continues to bother. The surname of Martin Landau's characters in this is 'Paris'. That was the surname of Leonard Nimoy's character in Mission Impossible. Coincidence? Or a joke by Steven Bochco?
