Plot spoilers !!!! Dr. Boch (George C. Scott) is the chief of medicine at a major hospital in New York. He has left his wife, his children have denied him, he is impotent, he drinks a lot and contemplates suicide. There is also a murderer roaming the hospital. Then he meets the strange Barbara (Diana Rigg) and falls in love. She wants him to escape with her, but can he completely renounce his old life and start a new one? <br /> <br /> Very strange movie with an Oscar-winning script by Paddy Chayefsky. He presents a suicidal main character and shows us a hospital full of overworked nurses and doctors who are running incompetent. He manages (in some way) to make this look pretty fun. It's not laughing out loud, it's black humor. The performance is also correct; Scott is simply excellent (and is Oscar nominated) here. You see him trying to keep his sanity in a totally crazy situation. The character of Riggs is more than a little strange, but his way of being actually works and is incredibly beautiful. The script is strong and brutal, but never too much. I think the ball is lost at the end with a situation that is too high, but it is worth seeing. If this had been done completely seriously, it would probably be impossible to take it. Also look for Katherine Helmond in a bit and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guest in uncredited bits. Personally, I had trouble taking this seriously. From what I've heard, the hospitals WERE so bad in the 1970s, but not anymore. See it for the performance and script. I give him a 7.
