I loved. I had just sat through half of "The Glass House" (I turned it off ... God, what a predicament and bad acting) and then I saw this movie. I thought it was awesome. I loved both Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster in it. I liked the escapism of the whole scenario, the travels in Europe in the 60s, but they made it more realistic by showing the dark side and all the bad things that could happen. It caught my attention completely, even if I thought the parts were incredible.
