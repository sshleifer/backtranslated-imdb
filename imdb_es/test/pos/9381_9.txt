George Barry "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is, in the background, a fairy tale told through a frame of horror film. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1970s, and it is absolutely criminal that the image was basically stolen and distributed without Barry's knowledge (those responsible for this theft must be taken to bed, ASAP) . If you're looking for a gore or rabid action, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is not the movie for you. "The deathbed" is a more bland and strange picture; It is played as a completely strange dream, half remembered. I recommend reading Stephen Thrower's summary of "Death Bed" in Thrower's FAB Press, "Nightmare USA" (perfectly describes the movie's environment). Whether intentional or not, I've noticed nuances of "The Deathbed" in everything from the "Ghost" movies to the "Cemetery Man" by Michele Soavi, to the magical realism fiction / glide of authors like Kelly Link. Barry is an original and in a fair world, I'm sure he would have followed "Death Bed" with a number of incredibly strange movies.
