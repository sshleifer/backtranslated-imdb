Many funny scenes about people you do not normally pay attention to in a movie and what they have to do to get a job and what happens once they do it. Lou Myers was very funny as Half-Step Wilson. Anyone who has a limited group of friends can relate to many of the non-film related scenes scattered throughout the film.
