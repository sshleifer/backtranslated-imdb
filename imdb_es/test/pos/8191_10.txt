As with all great art, this can be understood on many levels. The film evoked for me images and ideas of Homer, Euripides, Machiavelli, Shakespeare and Freud. <br /> <br /> The story itself is true (I checked it out on britannica.com!), so this movie will be appealing. to history buffs.

Battle scenes are only worth the price of the ticket.
