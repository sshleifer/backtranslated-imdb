I saw this movie at the Magnolia Theater in Dallas a couple of days ago. Punk! Everyone and everything involved in the film joined the punk. The music, well of course. But the film itself captured the entire punk genre. Even a grandmother and a school teacher (me) can appreciate artists who can turn their ideas into reality (well, reality, the movie). This film takes a handful of young filmmakers and clearly and intelligently shows the "why" of their anguish at not having received the green light to finish the Waldo movie. The (relatively) happy girl gave a good comic relief, a good respite from the continuous (but understandable) betrayal about the guy who left them in a jolt. Although I have to love Stu. And make sure you see / read the credits, they are the icing on the cake!
