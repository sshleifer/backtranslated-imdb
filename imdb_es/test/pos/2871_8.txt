There is a new loose assassin, and he is doing God's work. Yeah sure! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a fool, and Freddy Krueger looks like a rag doll against this guy. He is Jacob Goodnight (Glen "KANE" Jacobs of WWE), a 7 'monster that handles an Ax, and a hook and a chain. Those weapons are nothing to him, his true terminator is tearing eyeballs from the victim's basins. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and mutilated the veteran after putting a bullet in his head. How the hell did Goodnight survive after 4 years? Now he's in the damned hotel called Blackwell. And this hotel has many stories to tell. I thought that this movie was disturbing, as well as interesting. I liked the part where Goodnight checked one of the girl's tattoos on his back. And Goodnight himself is really upset thanks to his maniac mother. If you think that Friday the 13th was something, you'd better think again. This movie will leave you on the edge of your seat. And I think the rip of the eyeball was chilling. This movie proves it, and it was not a waste of time. I loved it. The title does not lie! Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!
