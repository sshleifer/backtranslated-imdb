This is the first science fiction series to which I've been seriously hooked since Star Trek (and I have not seen Trek in years). Take the invasion theme in somewhat different directions, but he has done it in a very exciting way. It also borrows the telenovela format, where the bow continues throughout the year of the series. The CGI definitely does not surpass the plot or the characters, except Nim, the budding creature that is a pet with a definite attitude. (Anything that shows what I really thought about the neighbor's yippy dog ​​is A-1 in my book). It was a stroke of genius. <br /> <br /> I stay at the end of the end asking questions (smart, I hope) and crossing the fingers and toes for NBC or someone else (Sci Fi, maybe) to continue with the series and answer those questions <br /> <br /> A really great and classy show.
