I watched this series on television in 1990 and I loved it (I was nine years old). I bought the first DVD box about six months ago and got the second one a couple of days ago (thanks to my dear husband). My God ... it was hard to sleep with all the thoughts in my head ... what was going to happen with Madeline and George, etc. The problems of slaves and civil war have always fascinated me (a 25-year-old Finn). to read Slaves in the Edward Ball family for those who want to take a look in the past and try to understand what really happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I want to see Heaven and Hell after Many people have said here that it was not really that good.
