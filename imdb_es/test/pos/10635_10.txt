Michael Haneke is known for his disturbing films such as "Funny Games". This time he adopted Elfriede Jelineks "Die Klavierspielerin", which is probably his best work so far. Jelinek always writes about abusive behavior in families, and especially about the suppression of women in a patriarchal society. <br /> <br /> Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) works as a piano teacher at the Vienna Council. She still lives with her mother (Annie Giradot), they even sleep in the same bed (it is already a sign of something strange). Erika harasses her students in the same way that her mother intimidates her, watches porn movies in secret and plays sadomasochistic games with herself. A student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), falls in love with her, but she refuses to simply sleep with him. She wants to play her games with him, but he is disgusted. Reluctantly he follows his rules, which means a disaster for both. <br /> <br /> Haneke has a very clear image language, everything is filmed in an almost spartan way, so the complex characters and the story get better. <Br /> <br /> People who do not know Austria very well may not realize how essential the stage is for history. Jelinek (like other great Austrian writers such as Thomas Bernhard) suffers from the coldness and indifference of Austrian families and society. Austrians (at least the Viennese) are often unable to express their pains and desires, repress their emotions, so often there is no true love, affection and closeness in their families. In a society, where it is more important to show a perfect fa√ßade to society (even if this means protecting crimes within families like Erika and her mother protect Walters' violation of Erters to avoid a scandal) than dealing with their problems emotional, probably not so. I wonder if Sigmund Freud founded psychoanalysis in Vienna. Erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother, only when they share it, some emotions are very violent and not at all loving. Erika replaces her hidden emotions with desires of violence, so that she can finally release some feelings. But she does not have anyone who really wants to talk about her emotions, so in the end she has to stab herself to relieve her inner pain. <br /> <br /> Isabelle Huppert shows the best performance of her career (also of most of the others) actresses). With a face that does not smile, you often only see a hint of emotion on his face, a quick smile, a look with his eyes. And in the end, his pain is shown masterfully without a single tear. <br /> <br /> Benoit Magimel and Annie Giradot also have powerful performances, but the film belongs to Huppert.
