All the trials and tribulations of making a movie without a budget directly from the mouth of those involved. You feel all the sweat, guts, determination and dedication that Stuie put into this work of love and the frustration of having been hung up after all his work. The clips of the interviews with all those involved provide a great fluid narrative and transmit the dances, the hardcore punk, the almost anarchic attitude that took to film "Waldo" and, later, the documentary. Stuie and company deserve all the accessories of the world for not giving up when things got tough and taking out "A Texas Tale of Treason" so we can see what it is like for the budding filmmaker on the street!
