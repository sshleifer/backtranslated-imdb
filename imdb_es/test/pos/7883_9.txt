This is a classic film that dramatizes the difficult situation of a man who can not adapt to the changes that take place in society and feels increasingly alienated, leading to violence. Joe is a worker, he is dissatisfied and angry, and everything he needs is a pretext to attack, which is what the story is about. Alone, Joe is calm; Together with someone else, it becomes lethal. And what makes Joe's character even more chilling is that he fully rationalizes his violence, so for him not only is it not bad, it's necessary. Joe projects his own violent tendencies on those he considers "the enemy" and, therefore, considers himself a war, and in this film, the "generation gap" is described as a war. But it's just a war in Joe's mind, because "the enemy" in this case is in his imagination. Nobody wants to fight Joe, but Joe feels he must defend himself. Although this film premiered in 1970, its message is as relevant now as it was then, as society continues to experience important changes that lead to the kind of intense alienation that the film dramatizes effectively.
