I thought that this movie was fun. I had never seen old movies before and this was really a great first dating movie. He had warmth and heart and spirit. It was a bit corny, but in the current film industry, cheese is nice. I gave him a ten and I strongly suggest renting, buying or watching the movie anyway. Gene Kelly was very dreamer and a bit sarcastic and you knew that the character thought he was going to have it all. The female protagonist was cast perfect because her two personalities had a spark and you wanted to stay and see what happened. The grandmother in the movie had no price. The perfect complement to a great old movie. I love the fact that it was black and white and Gene Kelly is so sweet with all the kids in the movie that you can not help but like it. Look at it.
