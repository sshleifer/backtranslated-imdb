If we compare the film industry with an ocean, we tend to observe only the surface. Driven by Hollywood's strong marketing force, we all watched war movies like Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. But beneath the splashed waves grow quietly, from time to time, lesser-known pearls. When you choose one and look at it carefully, you wonder why this pearl is almost unknown and why it is not already in the crown. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is a jewel. Why do you have a lot of classified billionaire actors? No. Do you have thousands of extras? No. Do you have impressive, spectacular, brilliant computerized visual effects? No way. So, what is so special? Well, in a word, it is pure past reality recreated and transposed to celluloid fifty years later. The tragedy of the bloodiest battle in history is here. Dirty, wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion, burned villages, collapsed buildings, collapsed suburbs, fires, explosions, burning tanks, soldiers fired, burned alive, land by tanks in their pits or pieces in pieces. everyone. But the real horror is elsewhere. People are reduced to simple pawns, without the power to change anything. The soldiers that we follow in the film try to leave the combat zone and fail. Civilians remain in prostration in the middle of nowhere, just crying for their murdered children. Without mercury, the enormous war-grinding machine fuses humans, equipment, villages, cities, and calls for more victims and destruction, over and over again. <br /> <br /> In all this collective madness, a group of German soldiers struggle to Survive and maintain at least a minimum level of normality. They fulfill their duty and fight valiantly. But, as everyone knows, a battle is almost lost when people begin to lose confidence and faith. We see how all those people are abandoned, how they plan to defect, how they fight to take the last plane to Berlin (full of wounded), how some very bad wounded soldiers were treated as simulators and shot, how they were forced to do so. Run a small group of Russian civilians, including a child, how they later discovered a place literally filled to the ceiling with food and drinks, destined, of course, only to some "superior" officers. One by one, they fall dead. The end of the film is one of the most bitter, depressing and moving endings I've seen, all in the magnificent score of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The war destroyed everything in its path. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must see for all. A true movie lover should have it in his collection. The strong message against war should be a warning to all of us. Unfortunately, humanity never learns, nor politicians. Self-destruction is in our DNA and human pain seems to last forever. Can we be reasonable enough to stop THE WAR?
