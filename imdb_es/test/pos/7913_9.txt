Honestly, I can not believe that this movie is not more valued. Claude Chabrol could be described as something like a Frenchman Alfred Hitchcock, and although this film is only the second I've seen (the first is Le Boucher), I can already see that this guy is something special only in the strength of these two films . The film is a French and Canadian co-production, and takes place in Canada. The cast is made up of British and Canadian stars and the high-quality performances augur well for the rest of the film; Most of which is of high quality too. The film is a murder mystery and begins when a young woman covered in blood is taken to a police station. After being questioned by Inspector Carella, it appears that the girl, Patricia, and her sister Muriel were attacked by a man who killed the sister and only allowed Patricia to flee. However, as the investigation progresses, Patricia returns to the station to present new evidence, which reveals a much more powerful identity for the murderer. <br /> <br /> The performances in this movie are excellent. Donald Sutherland is submitted as usual, but adapts very well to the role he has here and would not hesitate to name his performance in Blood Relatives as one of the best. The film also features supporting turns from British stars Donald Pleasance and David Hemmings who give good turns; Pleasure in particular, which shows how great an actor can be and highlights the shame of being wasted in Halloween movies. The unknown Aude Landry also gives a great performance in her role as Patricia. The movie is very mysterious during the first hour and it really keeps the audience hooked. When the inspector Carella discovers Muriel's diary, the film becomes a drama in which the last actions of the girl are shown; And while this section of the film is not as good as the previous one, it is still interesting and leads to a great turn at the end! In general, Blood Relatives is a great movie that really deserves to be seen better. Le Boucher is a better known effort by Chabrol, but for my money, this is at least as good! Highly recommended visualization.
