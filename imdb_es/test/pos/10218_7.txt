The fame of Clive Barker of Hellraiser has written and produced a fantastic horror movie that is fun and exciting. <br /> <br /> The makeup made by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic. It took a lot of imagination to create these mutants that lived underground. It was really a pleasure to see the quality of the work. <br /> <br /> It was not particularly horrible, since the worst creature was actually a human serial killer. <br /> <br /> I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and he did a good job in this movie too. Nothing spectacular, but fair. This was only Anne Bobby's third film, and it was also good. <br /> <br /> The final was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts, as did David Cronenberg. Say ah!
