I must confess that I fell into the cynical trap of believing that Australians could not do drama unless it meant a lot of crying, and I am Australian. Sad is not Although this film implies crying, it is not a dramatic cry, but an honest emotion that shines. <br /> <br /> Also, this movie is a detective story. I knew what the final result would be when I started seeing this, so I tried to guess who was the one who was going to do it. I got lost for a mile. <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I discovered that the director, Murali Thulluri was only around 21 years old when he made this film. I would love to shake his hand. He knows how to make a movie. I hope more comes. <br /> <br /> All the characters that we met before the main title credit (around 12 minutes) are an antihero. All of them worried in their own way and all as selfish as the next. Even when they are understanding. <br /> <br /> The saddest scene in the movie, and there are some that are hard to see) is the final scene where we are formally introduced to the real main character and we are talking about his nephew. That scene made me cry. <br /> <br /> My faith in the Australian drama has been restored. We are masters of comedy, but I was getting bored with comedy. <br /> <br /> Murali, if you happen to see this, you touched my soul and that's why I can only thank you.
