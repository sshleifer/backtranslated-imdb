My God, this was a fantastic movie. Every time we see it, it takes us to another place in "WOW". Rhett and Scarlett were played brilliantly by Joanne and Timothy. They did a fantastic job reviewing the roles of our two favorite heroes. All the world! It's a must see ... Do not deprive yourself of this movie. If you loved Gone With The Wind, you will love this mini series. Go Rhett! See Scarllett!
