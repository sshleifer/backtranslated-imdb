I connected to this movie because there was nothing more to see. I was immediately impressed by the characters. <br /> <br /> Robin Tunney is nothing short of spectacular in this movie. His portrayal of a mentally ill woman is moving and 100% credible. Actually, this kind of thing is not easy to do. She does it fantastically. <br /> <br /> We know from the beginning that this movie will end tragically, but you can not look away from it. The characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies, where people do stupid things because the plot demands it, these people do stupid things because they are not right in the head, and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters. <Br /> <br /> This is just a great example of making IMHO movies. Good writing, great acting, great direction. A movie for people who think that the movie can be more than a senseless entertainment.
