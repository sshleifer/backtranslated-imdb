Spoiler Alert: although this is an argument almost as impossible to spoil as to explain it completely. <br /> <br /> 'Mulholland Drive' is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch's cinematic vision and style since the first season. from his TV series 'Twin Peaks'. As Lynch enthusiasts know, this is a style and vision that combine exclusively with black movies, horror movies, surrealism and parapsychology. with a good dose of postmodern self-consciousness and black humor in good measure. All these elements are in the work of 'Mulholland Drive', which makes it a fascinating, amazing and highly satisfying cinematic experience. especially if one does not become too obsessed with trying to make all the pieces of the plot fit together into a logical and uncomplicated whole. <br /> <br /> The film features wonderful performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the lead roles of Young Women whose lives intersect in various ways in the midst of a Hollywood setting that is itself a hallucinated mix of reality contemporary, retro nostalgia of the 50s and satirical self-aggrandizement. Their initial reunion, apparently random, takes place after the initial scene of the film, in which Harring's character escapes an attempt on his life thanks to a fortuitous car accident, not to mention. Going down the hillside from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard (the two most archetypal Hollywood highways), find the same apartment that Betty (Naomi Watts) is about to sublet her "Aunt Ruth", a supposedly successful actress who He goes to Canada to start a new movie. As we learned later, Betty came to herself from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug contest. <br /> <br /> A highly energetic and stylized flashback of the contest forms one of the two pre-credit prologue sequences that frames Betty's descent from the bright-eyed innocence of the aspiring star clich√© to the rampant madness of lover despised and without going anywhere actress. Unable to remember his own name, Harring's character adopts the name "Rita" from a movie poster for the classic of the movie "Gilda" that adorns Aunt Ruth's apartment. (Actually, it turns out that Aunt Ruth died a long time ago and in whose department we really find ourselves is a good question that must be resolved in future presentations). Anyway, Betty decides to help Rita discover what happened and discover the source of the problem. Rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that women find in Rita's purse. The two women begin to gather clues that seem to lead to Rita's true identity. By the way, they also become lovers, at a point that radiates a chemistry so incendiary that I can not remember that it is the same in the conventional treatments of lovers of lesbians (if ever a Lynch movie can be designated as "mainstream" ). <br /> <At the local restaurant Winkies (a recurring place full of dreamy meaning behind its dirty realist facade), Rita's attention is caught by the label with the name of a waitress reading 'Diane'. This brings her to a memory of someone called 'Diane Selwyn', in whose apartment the two women soon visit her and, at Betty's insistence, burst in. I will not reveal what you find inside, but suffice it to say that the scene is represented by the chilling life of Lynchian. Later, Rita wakes up with night sweats speaking in Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show / theater called 'Silencio', where the arts of illusion and lip / instrumental synchronization are practiced with manic intensity and where The Lady with blue hair As pointed out in the final credits, she reigns like the Muse she presides over. Framed by the Silent Theater, with blue lights and red curtains, the lady with blue hair occupies the last shot of the film, perhaps a symbol for the control of the artistic imagination? rather like the "man with the blue guitar" of Steven, filtered through the surrealism of the bad drug. <br /> <br /> During the Silence sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio synchronizes with her own powerful Spanish version of 'Roy Orbison's Cry' '), a devastating epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own bag for Discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's purse. Even if we do not delve into the Freudian sexual symbolism of the portfolios, the timing is singularly Hitchcockian in the sense that the combination of the key and the box leads to a complete reversal of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of relationships. of character and meanings. No less important is the discovery that Betty is the one sought by Diane Selwyn and the rejected lover of Camilla Rhodes (ie, Rita). Camilla, in turn, is a female Latin movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to obtain and, more importantly, to which she is emotionally subjugated. <br /> <br /> After these and other discoveries In the last third of the film, the problem of taking into account the first two thirds of the film is not solved as directly as in "Vertigo". Although the fragments of images and dialogues suggest that much of the previous material, if not all, is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself, other fragments and pieces suggest the supernatural intervention of a cast of characters that are inspired directly in "Twin Peaks", including Michael J. Anderson, who repeats his powers as a dwarf and a variant of Bob that hangs behind Winkies and is the definitive repository of the blue box and its identity associations. <br /> <br /> However, nevertheless, one fits the pieces, is the set of 'Mulholland Drive' much larger? And more mysterious? than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative and pleasantly disturbing mental journey. In addition, the cinematography of the film is impressive, the soundtrack full of atmospheric evocators, excellent acting and masterful direction / editing. This could have been the Best unrecognized Movie of 2001 among the main American releases.
