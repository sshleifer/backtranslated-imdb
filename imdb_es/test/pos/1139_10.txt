If you listen to Ween (The Pod, God / Satan), then you know what is going on with "Split" and I discovered that watching the movie under the influence of LSD helped deal with the audio / video trackers of a fantastic editing work . The plot was only important from second to second. The acid helped interact with the sounds, subliminal and general rhythm of this masterpiece. Do not bother to write about something that is beyond your comprehension ... There simply are not enough of these great independent attempts at expression at its crudest and amateur level. I dare anyone to make a film that can get in my head and change my way of seeing the visual arts and the reality of the world. Not to mention the many realities that have not yet been explored by this human mind. I love the vision of Chris Shaw. I also appreciate the terrorist film of textures "The Begotten" by E. Elias Merhige.
