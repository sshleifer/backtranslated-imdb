This epic brings together a gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to that of most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to life that I find hard to explain. Immersing yourself in Die Zweite Heimat is similar to a spiritual experience for me, similar to the fear one has when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language and use of color and monochrome segments add to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the places, including Edgar Reitz's office. From then on, I promised to improve my German skills; After Die Zweite Heimat I feel almost German, as if I was in the head of the characters. I also try to match the piano of Henry Arnold (Hermann), but this is the only thing that always eludes me! This drama is unparalleled and I have been lucky enough to see it on BBC2 in the UK and on SBS in Australia. The sequel, Heimat 3, is currently filming in Germany.
