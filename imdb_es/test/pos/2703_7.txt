Yes, this is one of the best-made television movies and I would not expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this critic is that he was also a big fan of The Carpenters, I was able to sing all his material in elementary school and the high school choir and I was able to do a lot of the solo material that Karen sang about. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70s, and being a girl / teenager singing these songs and learning music, all I expected was to meet this woman. I never got to do it, she died three weeks before that happened. And yes, that affected me because I did not know anything about anorexia, and I could not fully understand what happened. <br /> <br /> When this film was produced for television, I understood a lot. Maybe not everything in the life of Karen and Richard is open to the television audience, but when I opened the parts that were shown, I had to understand a lot about the music industry of that time. What bothers me is that I'm writing "from that time" and seeing "now." Nobody has learned anything, although this was a very informative and sincere look at the problems of a family in the music industry. <br /> <br /> These films are not made for fun, they are ready to open. A door and shows us something. Here was a wonderful woman who got caught up in the idea that her talent was based on weight. She was ok. I did not know, I did not know it. He received contradictory messages about his weight from the brother he loved, the parents he loved, and the music industry who cared more about his appearance / weight than about his inner talent. With the start of MTV, it got worse. With 'American Idol' it's like a sleepy puss with an English accent. <br /> <br /> A wonderful television movie. I'm sure that later someone can give you an HBO treatment, but either way, there are many lessons to learn and the absence of another wonderful talent.
