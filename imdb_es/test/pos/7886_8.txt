I remember so many things about seeing this movie again during its original theatrical release: the afterglow of peace and love of Woodstock, along with the tension of fear and paranoia before Watergate. It's hard to believe it's thirty-seven years later, and I can still remember the thoughts that went through my head as I watched the movie with my best friend. As if marveled at Peter Boyle's characterization of the perfect redneck, he will surely pigeonhole the rest of his career (Oh, how bad!), And how the culture of the countercurrent shook the sensibility of most of the country. To this day, my friend and I still use Joe Curran's line from my previous summary when we faced a dilemma; It's funny to see how a simple line like that can stay with you for decades. <br /> <br /> It's funny to read the comments about the other movie in this forum, in particular those who claim that the movie has a past quality and how the top characters were. Even so, if it was present during that time, the image offers a fairly accurate representation of the opposite poles that existed at that time, quite next to the events of the story. If you really want to have an appointment, when was the last time you heard the words of Macy and Gimbel in the same sentence, or in a phrase like Joe's: "Come on, contact the Pepsi generation." For a historical perspective, you have that big Nixon poster in one of the background scenes: "Would you buy a used car for this man?" With such small complexities, director John Avildsen captures many of the subtle but always present details of what life was like four decades ago. <br /> <br /> Today's viewing was only the second time I've seen the movie, and I have to admit that I do not remember Susan Sarandon in one of the main roles, but, again, this was her first image. The scenes of nudity and free love were something really new and bold at that moment, shocking in fact, as the filmmakers began to experiment with their ability to push the envelope of property and convention. "Joe" made a great leap in that direction, particularly because it was a "conventional" image. <br /> <br /> With the passage of time, what impressed me the most about Peter Boyle was how he overcame Joe Curran's stereotype to appear or star in some of my favorite works. I mean, how do you go from "Joe" to that hilarious performance of "Puttin 'on the Ritz" in "Young Frankenstein"? And my absolute favorite episode of 'X-Files' has Boyle as Clyde Bruckman, in a cute and tragic, funny and serious portrait that changes the Scully and Mulder charts more than once. And as race director, Frank Barone has to be one of the funniest characters in television history. Even the episodes repeated in syndication are funny, since he, every time the old Barone releases one of his observations. He is an actor that this viewer misses a lot.
