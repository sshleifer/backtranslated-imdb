Boogie Nights was undoubtedly the best movie of 1997. I could watch this movie again and again and still love it. I'm in no hurry to see the exaggerated romance / epic disaster of the Titanic again. The fact that Boogie Nights did not even receive a Best Picture nomination only serves to show how predictable and close the Academy is. Only The Sweet Hereafter by Atom Egoyan and Robert Zemeckis's Contact were close to being as cool as Boogie Nights. No other filmmaker in recent years has even remotely approached making a film as good as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, until now. Paul Thomas Anderson accepted the challenge and succeeded. Just as Tarantino kicked John Travolta's career, P.T. Anderson has given Burt Reynolds the kick his career needs. Boogie Nights will also undoubtedly star in Don Cheadle, Heather Graham and John Reilly. In general, a wonderful movie. The best from Pulp Fiction. Maybe even better.
