Matthau is a widowed hospital doctor who enjoys his status as a bachelor and nurses in freedom and available on staff, while colleague and friend Richard Benjamin observes with amusement and amazement. His boss has difficulty listening to the senile Chief of Staff Art Carney, who is in a position to be reelected for that position. <br /> <br /> Matthau is happy to play in the field without commitment until he meets single mom Glenda Jackson who insists on being the only woman in her life while she is in her life. At the same time, he is pressured to respond to the love advances of a potential litigant in a professional negligence lawsuit, and to support the battleship and incompetent Carney in his bid to be re-elected as Chief of Staff. <br /> <br /> This is an old-fashioned romantic top comedy that features four Grade A actors and an excellent supporting cast that works with a dry, caustic and sarcastic script of the first order. Carney steals all the scenes he is in and, in the language of IMDb, makes us roll on the floor laughing loudly every time he appears on the screen. Otherwise, we are entertained by the on-off relationship of the two potential customers and several subplots. <br /> <br /> It lacks the ambition to be a great movie, but it remains one of the best of its kind and is observable and re-winchable for its comic value alone. It deserves more attention than it seems to have received and it's worth the cost of the DVD or videotape.
