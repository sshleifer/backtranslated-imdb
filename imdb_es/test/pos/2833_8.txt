... I saw this movie when it first appeared in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine years old, and today I still remember every picture in black and white, especially blacks, because it was very tense, terrifying, those sneak attacks through that dark passage on the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the discovery of the car with the Gatling firing, the last fight between Peck and the Chief, and the Happy ending that allows me to catch my breath. I have not seen him since, and I do not know if it would be a good idea to see him again today, it was a fabulous moment for the child he was.
