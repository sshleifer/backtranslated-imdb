This is a short comedy by Laurel & Hardy with some great and funny moments, but in general, the film is based too much on a single comic premise. <br /> <br /> The comic premise on which this film is based is very simple; Stan Laurel does not wear pants. Laurel plays a young Scottish naive who arrives in the United States at full speed. For some reason, he gets the spotlight because of this and his uncle played by Oliver Hardy thinks that because of this it's time to put a pair of trousers on Philip. <br /> <br /> His humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a little tired after a while. Although the film definitely still has its great comedic moments, at the same time it is also far from being the best of the many comedy shorts of Laurel and Hardy that still exist. The film is simply too simple to be considered one of the best, although it is definitely well executed for the most part, for the most part. <br /> <br /> Very good, good and clean, just nothing very remarkable or memorable for everyone. <Br /> <br /> 7/10
