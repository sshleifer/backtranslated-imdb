A rough thriller that sought great philosophical heights that could not reach. I still enjoyed the movie immensely. I had great elements of suspense, leaving me with the delicious chill I expected from the thrillers, and achieved it purely psychologically, without resorting to an escalation of blood and blood. The soundtrack and the stage add perfectly to the suspense. Sometimes, it was a bit unpolished, particularly the acting and development of the character. It could only have been a better movie if we had known more about the nightmares of the past that the characters see when they close their eyes, and why they felt this desperate need to search for the "answer" that is so integral in the story. After all, they seemed to keep looking for him, despite knowing or at least having an idea of ​​what might happen when they found him. I would recommend watching this movie if you are prepared to look beyond the arena to see the potential of a rough diamond.
