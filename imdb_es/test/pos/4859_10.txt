This movie has a punch. There are some from time to time that make me think deeply and bother me a lot. I could see myself in this same situation: passively allowing things to happen around me, not defending the right and the decent, but trying to avoid problems. How often do we avoid making waves or pulling our necks? How often does our inaction condone the bad actions of others? We would never join them, we say to ourselves, we recognize that what they are doing is bad, but do we do something about it? <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macey) is a low profile nerd clerk who has paid for his home in Brooklyn, NY in the last days of World War II. She rarely gets involved in what is happening around her, she has never married, she rarely socializes, she only goes to work and worries about her invalid mother. Then, a series of events in his small "white" neighborhood pull him out of his shell complacent to a maelstrom of events. It begins when he witnesses from the window of his room the rape of a Puerto Rican girl by the son of her neighbor. Soon after, he gets glasses due to poor vision. As he can now see better, he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life. The only bright spot is a new love in his life, and he marries, hoping to continue in his normalcy. Then the virulent anti-Semitism in that street catches him, despite his credentials as Presbyterian WASP. As things get out of control, you discover that you must make an important decision: take a position or simply leave. <br /> <br /> I can not see how anyone can see this movie without being affected and without thinking much about themselves and what they really represent. Post-war anti-Semitism is the scenario here, but there is injustice at all times and in all places. It is for the individual to decide where he is.
