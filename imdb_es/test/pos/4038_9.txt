"Snow Queen" is based, of course, on the fairy tale of the same name, compiled in (at least) Andersen's Fairy Tales, and, unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, it retains the Faerie spirit. an achievement not easy and not well understood by many, especially among Americans. The talking animals, the arbitrary prohibitions, the appearances of goblins, dragons and demons should not be questioned in a fairy tale; they are such a natural element of Faerie as, say, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is completely outside the point of history. Nor is history limited by the modern rules of Hollywood composition: direct, often to the point of being grotesquely linear in minor works, and obvious (in retrospect, at least). <br /> <br /> With this defense against the common. Criticism of those who do not understand fairy tales, "Snow Queen" is a charming movie with wonderful visual effects, skilful performances and a great feeling. I think the only flaw in the film was not that it was too fantastic, but that certain parts of the dialogue were too evident in terms of language and expression, a tide in its timeless nature.
