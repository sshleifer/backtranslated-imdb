*** SPOILERS *** For some strange reason, "Talk Radio" by Oliver Stone, based on Stephen Singular's book "Talked to Death" and the work of movie star Eric Bogosian, about the 1984 murder of the presenter of interviews from Denver, Alan Berg, has never got the recognition he deservedly deserved. The 1988 movie was prophetic enough to recognize the clandestine movement that was unfolding on the farm and inland America. A movement that spawned, some seven years later, as an angry and disgusted veteran of the Gulf War, Timothy McVeigh, who hates the actions of US governments. UU In Wacco Texas he leads his and his friend, Terry Nichols, to the detonation of the US federal building. UU In the city of Oklahoma. on April 19, 1995, which claimed the lives of 168 people, the worst act of terrorism in the US until then. <br /> <br /> The film is, as far as I know, the first time that any major branch of the entertainment media mentioned and developed the rural militia novel "The Turner Diaries" by William L. Pierce . that since then has become a chilling underground classic. "The Turner Diaries" predicted a domestic and absolutely disastrous terrorist attack, like the Oklahoma City bombing, at a facility of the United States Government that was the FBI building in Washington DC <br /> <br /> The presenter of the KGAB's talk show on the Dallas radio station, Barry Champlain, Eric Bogosian, is the best-rated program in the audition area of ​​Dallas and is now about to become national. Barry gets his high rating for his sharp wit and abusive behavior when he is in the air. Abandoning all those who come and dodge without problems, no matter how unpopular or taboo they are, has made Barry the most listened and hated man on the radio. Barry is a showman in the background and not thinking that his conversation can lead to violence keeps his harsh attitude towards his call listeners while his qualification goes up in the cell. But there are people in the audience who listen, mostly right-wing types, who do not take their attitude to you very seriously. One of them decides to take matters into his own hands at Barry's expense. <br /> <br /> The performance of Eric Bogosian as the tragic Barry Champlain that crossed the line of entertainment to harsh reality in his actions on the radio. Thinking that it is not so important that they look for him and kill him for his opinions in the air, which is what enemies do not like, he discovered too late that there are people who are crazy enough to do external things. Also in the movie "Talk Radio" there is a very young Alic Baldwin as the head of Barry, Dan, who tries to soften his tone but in the end he continues with his talk show style as he is killing the competition without realizing that in the end it is him. that will end up being killed. <br /> <br /> Both Ellen Green and Leslie Hope are the two women in Barry's life, his ex-wife Ellen and now lover and talk show producer Laura, whom Barry uses to his advantage and almost ends up losing them both at the same time. The 1988 film "Talk Radio" is well advanced by the time that even if you see it now in 2005, you still think it is too disturbing to be shown to an overly sensitive and sensitive American public.
