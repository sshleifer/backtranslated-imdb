Even from the beginning of the title of this film, I love the artwork and the canvas of one of the national islands of Japan. We see some large green hills and some oriental houses of a coastal city. We are instantly seeing the beauty of the Pacific on the panoramic screen of the theater. And to show how great this film is, I must say that Charles Darwin would be proud. The classes of evolution teachers and school sciences such as biology would fantastically favor the new Hayao Miyazaki film entitled "Ponyo". The character of the title, as you will see, can be the perfect animation icon of the media that will be represented in all the classrooms and auditoriums. <br /> <br /> In addition to the scientific aspect of all this, let's dive into the blue waters of this exciting story We have a skinny, old and powerful sorcerer named Fujimoto who lives in a submersible and is cynical about the urban expansion of humanity and its industrial waste pollution. He wants to have complete control of the seas and the peaceful looking aquatic life, including fish and organisms. Fujimoto, whose blood is composed to be half human and half amphibious, resembles an antihero and antagonist lover of the oceans; similar to the villain of James Bond, Stromberg in The Spy Who Loved Me, who operates an underwater city called Atlantis. <br /> <br /> His daughter, whom he treats as a much-cared for pet, is called Ponyo. She is a big fish of colors that already looks like a pretty redhead girl. The father forbids her from the real human world, claiming that it is dangerous and that it is too much for her. But frankly, Ponyo's exploratory curiosity is as strong as his loving nature. Finally, with construction strength, similar to the wonderful scenes of Nick Park's "Chicken Run", he frees himself from his father's fossilized and rocky aquatic city and swims to the surface of Japan's water, and for his luck and joy, It falls into the careful hands of a young tanker captain named Sosuke. <br /> <br /> Sosuke, who lives in a beachfront house on a clean beach (or a beach full of rocks), has two overworked parents, a working mother in the home, Lisa and the First official of a Koichi tanker barge. Lisa seems to be angry at his wife for being away on a boat and leaving her with all the household chores. Moreover, the black magic exerted by Ponyo causes a chain of apocalyptic events to occur: the moon gets too close to Earth and the waves arise from the imbalance of the interaction forces of the tides, and the gigantic waves of the tsunami assault the city peaceful but evacuated. . However, what seems to underestimate this curse and seems literally more powerful than the supernatural power is the love and close friendship between the infant Captain Sosuke and the adorable redhead Ponyo, who wants to be a sensitive human than a simple preserved fish. Like the frizzly-haired and free-spirited hobbits in The Lord of the Rings, Ponyo grants me a slight reminder of that. <br /> <br /> I could write about and about this amazing animated movie, the best since "Coraline" that was in theaters in February. And right now, Hayao Miyazaki, delight your eyes with another 10 star rating from your animation fanatic, Graham Abraham. The year 2009 can be filled with dozens of animated films; However, Ponyo is the most imposing film of many environmental beauties and must be dedicated as a new wonder of the world.
