Sharky's Machine is a crime drama that takes place in the early 80's in Atlanta. It stars Burt Reynolds as a renegade policeman who is determined to stop crime and corruption in his city. The story is about a dirty politician who is on top of a criminal gang that has been ruining the city. The bond of Sharky to demolish this union is a prostitute of high price that falls in love during the course of the film. The action sequences are well done for the early 80s and the soundtrack / score are pretty good. The performance is level B, but this is a pretty decent movie to have in your DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Overall 7/10 <br /> <br /> Peace <br /> <br /> Buggieblade
