I recently published in IMDb in this series, giving a postal mail address in the commercial arm of the BBD where one would write to appeal the publication. I wrote to that address, mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity prominently. I just received the following response: <br /> <br /> From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 1:44:00 PM MDT for: kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Dear Kate, <br /> <br /> I work for the BBFC, the British equivalent to the MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos, as well as movies in this country. Anyway, I am currently in the process of giving a certificate to the 1980 miniseries 'Oppenheimer'. When researching the work in IMDb, I noticed your publication and I thought you would like to know that the work is about to be published (hence the need for a certificate). <br /> <br /> I do not know what company is distributing it, but keep your eyes wide open! <br /> <br /> Best regards, <br /> <br /> Emily +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br /> <br /> I also want to contact Netflix to buy this again. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew <br /> <br /> kk2840@earthlink.net I recently sent an email to the BBC about whether their excellent Oppenheimer series had ever been released on video or DVD. I could not find it. I received the following response. If you write the BBC, be sure to mention that Sam Waterston is very popular in the United States. You can also enter "Oppenheimer (1980)" on amazon.com and look for a box to mark the owner's request (BBC) and receive notification when it is published. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Here is the response from the BBC: <br /> <br /> Dear Kate <br /> <br /> Thanks for your email regarding 'Oppenheimer'. <br /> <br /> I was interested to read that you want a copy of this program that you have enjoyed. I have reviewed the BBC store and online retailers and can not find any records of it being available. We are not aware of the current plans to launch this program on DVD. However, if you wish to make a suggestion, I can suggest that you send it in writing to the BBC commercial department: <br /> <br /> Commissioning Editor BBC Worldwide Ltd Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TT <br /> <br /> Thank you again for taking the time to contact the BBC. <br /> <br /> Greetings <br /> <br /> Elaine Hunter Information from the BBC ______________________________________ <br /> <br /> - ---- Original message ----- <br /> <br /> {Comments:} I am trying to find a copy of the excellent production of the BBC "Oppenheimer", a six-part series made in 1980 with Sam Waterston from a book / script by Peter Prince, I saw it later on PBS American Playhouse , but I can not find it in any video. <br /> <br /> http://www.bbc.co.uk/
