This movie was one, if not the best I've seen in the last year. I highly recommend it, it starts as a very funny movie, but as the progress of the film becomes much more. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. I saw a movie of this movie, but I'm going to buy it not only for myself but for several true movie fans. I have the unfortunate feeling that this great movie will not be recognized, as is the case of so many other non-commercial films. The comic and heartbreaking movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you think and yes, you will think when it ends and it is not what a good movie is!
