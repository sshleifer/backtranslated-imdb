"Comprometido" has to do with Graham as an irrepressible optimist who goes in search of her husband who has distanced himself and who has gone looking for himself, which leads to a kind of funny and fun comic odyssey that involves to a group of secondary characters and problems. A small fresh, funny and unpredictable film, what "Comprometido" lacks history, makes up for with good nature, subtle morals and maxims. If you enjoy this little film for girls, which received criticism slightly above the average of critics and audience, you may want to see the success of Lisa Krueger, "Manny & Lo" (1996). (SECOND)
