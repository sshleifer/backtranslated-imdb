More entertaining than all the gay orgies in "300" combined. More heartbreaking than a Shakespearian tragedy. More poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah, blah, blah. And on top of all that, the biggest garbage that has ever been made. <br /> <br /> A black comedy that tests the limits of the human senses, John Waters' cult film "Pink Flamingos" is a story about the conflict between two families that ends with humiliation, death and, Of course, the consumption of dog droppings (yes, by the way, it's not really the humiliating part). No, no, this is not about impossible love, there are no Romeos or Juliettes in these 90 minutes. This movie is about the battle for prestige if I could call it that. The battle for the title: the dirtiest person in the world. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, we have Divine (interpreted by the dressing of regular Waters ... umm ... Divine) a loving daughter, good mother, cannibal Killer, pervert and current holder of that title. She loves her son Crackers a little too much. Crackers himself has a sexual attraction for both chickens and young women who sometimes mix in trios. Cotton, friend of the family and loyal accomplice, gets his satisfaction at seeing Crackers during some of his ... acts related to the objects of attraction mentioned above. Last, but not least, the mother and grandmother of Divine to Crackers, Edie. A 400-pound woman, who sleeps, eats and basically lives in a crib. She is addicted to eggs and loves the man-egg (the man who brings the eggs ... hahaha). <br /> <br /> The four live in a caravan on the outskirts of the city until the moment they become a target for marbles. Exhibitionists, manipulators, cheaters, really bad people. Its main source of income comes from the kidnapping and impregnation of young women. For the impregnation part, they use their trusty and loyal butler to provide the semen. After that, they sold the child born to the highest bidder. <br /> <br /> It was the envy of the Marbles towards the Divine and its title that will lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. An epic battle of filth, perversion and violence. <br /> <br /> "Pink Flamingos" is an unsurpassed masterpiece in the trash film genre. Loaded with oddities and strange acts, the John Waters film is hated and hated by traditionalists, critics and the average public. However, for the few who remain unmarked by these generalizations, flamingos are an unforgettable experience. Funny and sick, violent and poetic. It really is an exercise in bad taste.
