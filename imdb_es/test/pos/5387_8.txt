What is your damn problem? Do not you have anything better to do than sit on your fat asses and blog about finding something in bad taste? Here is an idea: go outside. That's right: walk outside your mother's basement where you have been living for 13 years and GO OUT. "But I can not leave! Star Trek is ready in 30 minutes and I still have not married that avatar in World Of Warcraft!" Oh my God, in that case, stay inside! Very well, I could have gone overboard there. I mean, Star Trek is fine, but I do not see it that much anymore. Either way, you really have to write a shit about Mind of Mencia. It is a good show. Maybe you're just downloading your anger because that girl left you in World of Warcraft. Or you are constipated. Try to put fiber in your diet.
