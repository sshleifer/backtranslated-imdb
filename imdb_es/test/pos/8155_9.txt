Hi boy, this movie is all about the options. Every time in your life you must choose something or it will just disappear ... And this movie proves it! Of course, life, in fact, is not like a beautiful image as this movie shows ... it is not shown, but some may realize that. I am trying to say that it is full of pain, love and profound life lessons. Aaron, the Mormon missionary is the true shepherd who digs the beautiful thing deep in Chisthian, the man who feels the skin ... <br /> <br /> It's a great ending and you always believe in destiny because it will surprise you . a turn or in another part of your life like the Last Days ... <br /> <br /> What a problem!
