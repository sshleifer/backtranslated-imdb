Darr is a brilliant movie ... It's one of my favorite movies ... SRK has done an amazing job in the movie ... <br /> <br /> this role could not have been interpreted by anyone else because this guy Role only fits SRK ... <br /> <br /> SRK plays a mental villain in the movie ... <br /> <br /> SRK's performance in this movie is the best interpretation that It has never been made in capsule wood. .. <br /> <br /> SRK deserves an honor and an encouraging attraction for its fantastic performance ... <br /> <br /> Juhi also offers excellent performance .. <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol looked strong and physically fit in the movie.
