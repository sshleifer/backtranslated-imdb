This is a film by Brett (a barbarian ninfo in the dinosaur of hell) Piper, low budget, and offers what you would expect from such production: a casual dialogue (although corny), some pretty actresses and a lot of stop motion creatures. That's why I've given the movie 10 out of 10, because it offers what I expected it to deliver ... and a little more: Brett does not make a dime when it comes to putting his creatures on screen. He throws many bugs at his cast for the finale. And, anyway, I LOVE the stop motion monsters that, compared to CGI bugs in higher budget movies, seem to be very fun to watch.
