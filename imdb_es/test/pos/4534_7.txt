I guess I do not have much to add. I discovered that comedy is still fun after more than ten years since it went on sale. <br /> <br /> The only thing I noticed was that the music during the dialogue distracted and that often made the movie very good. it should have been. The use of the songs is fine during the film, but the orchestral background is too busy, too ingenious and, if the film was ever edited for a DVD, I would seriously recommend that the background music be reduced to an almost inaudible level . It has cheapened the general feeling of the whole movie and I can unconsciously see why many people have let it go. <br /> <br /> The film had many levels of work in the script, the plot and the comedy. level. It is a pity that the producer and the director felt that they needed musical ingenuity to improve the mood. Now that I know it, it's hard for me to see it and I curse in silence to whoever has participated in the musical edition of the film. He had all the subtlety of a pneumatic hammer.
