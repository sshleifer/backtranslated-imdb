Great, just great! The West Coast has "Dirty" Harry Callahan, the East Coast has Sharky. Burt Reynolds plays Sharky in "The Sharky Machine" and I enjoyed every minute of it. Playing a dissident narcotics cop in Atlanta, GA, is what everyone wants. Instead of suspension, it is sent to the squad vice. Like in the Dirty Harry movies or in any other police movie, the captain will always be the jerk. When I was a kid, I was curious about what that movie "The Sharky Machine" meant. Well, I knew who was playing Sharky, I wonder what his machine was. It was his group of fellow policemen. After discovering the murder, he goes to great lengths to find the perpetrator. When he turns out to be a big mafia boss, Sharky does not play. When he puts the other prostitute to safety, Sharky defends himself with strength and well despite having lost a finger for the bully. And I also like the part where the bad comes out of the building through a glass window. That was the bomb! Randy Crawford's "Street Life" really put the movie in the right frame of mind, and the movie itself is really a big hit for me, ALWAYS! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
