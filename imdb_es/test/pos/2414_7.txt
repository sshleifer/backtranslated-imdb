<br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie, shortly after it was published in a video in 1995, I discarded it immediately, saying that Julie was not Daniel, I had never really given her a chance and she said that was horrible <br /> <br /> But here it is, 5 years later, it's at Disney and I'm seeing it again. And I'm discovering that it's not as bad as I did it to be. Miyagi is still Miyagi, like Kool as always, the musical score is still nice as always. And Swank's character is not that bad, his acting is pretty good considering the script. The third installment expires by a wide margin. Therefore, my original rating of 4 has been raised to 7.
