Here is another entertaining action thriller by Clint Eastwood. I'm not particularly fond of him, but I have to deliver him: he knows how to make entertaining movies. This is one more example. Nor did it hurt to have John Malkovich as his co-star. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays a murderer, and it is fascinating to see him, thanks to his different disguises and the excellent dialogue they gave him. He also has an interesting voice. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is quite discreet (for her), but it's fine and Eastwood plays the usual role of a solitary cop, he's not appreciated by his superiors, but he shows them to everyone. at the end. I guess he could not stop playing the figures of the "Harry Dirty" type, but he played them well. <br /> <br /> There were some negative aspects of this movie, namely: credibility in some parts, since there was a couple. Occasionally, if this had been in real life, the killer would have ended Eastwood. The climate scene, in particular, had too many holes. There were also too many abuses of the name of the Lord in vain here. <br /> <br /> In general, however, this is a good and escapist one.
