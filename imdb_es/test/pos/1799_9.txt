"Valley Girl" launched Nicolas Cage's career and was an 80s version of "Romeo and Juliet." It is a clear example of a classic 80's teenager. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily have brilliant performances in this film, but they will never surpass "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as the teen movie of the 80s because If it were not for "Fast Times," then the 80s generation of teen movies would only be a big blow to the head. That is sure.
