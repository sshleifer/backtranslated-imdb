In fact, I turned to the Lifetime channel by mistake, just as this movie started, and I ended up watching it. <br /> <br /> It is certainly a serious problem, probably more frequent than we realize, in terms of this type of attack by a young woman by an ego-maniac study partner, who feels which is above the system, and, unfortunately, often is. <br /> <br /> The cast here was credible, and the performances credible. Many of these Canadian / Lifetime films are decidedly "exaggerated". However, this is a label that could be labeled "below the top". <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the fact that it was not presented in an exaggerated way, this movie somehow looked like a record that was playing at a slower speed than appropriate, the 96 minutes seemed like many more, and they had the effect of appearing to be a shorter film, repeated over and over again, seemingly again and again and again ON, before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion. <br /> <br /> However, the attractive characters and performances did better than the average movie of this type, despite these criticisms. <br /> <br /> And although these images often "milk" the climax, this One could have given it a little more detail and length.
