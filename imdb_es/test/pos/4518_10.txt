The Kite Runner should win an Oscar! It is perfect in every way, history, script, acting, cinematography ... One would never say that it was filmed in China. The story of two childhood friends and what goes on in their adult lives will leave a lasting impression. The representation of life in Afghanistan under the Taliban is too real and horrifying. I have not read the book, but I have seen comments that leave the film because "the book is always better" ... It really does not matter. Nobody stopped writing "Gone with the Wind" because he was not faithful to the book! In fact, he won the Academy Award for best film and several other Oscar awards. I think this film is brilliant: BRAVO for the writer, the director and the actors!
