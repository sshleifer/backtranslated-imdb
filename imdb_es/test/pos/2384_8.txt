cool movie nice to watch. I hope to see more of Fred Carpenter soon. I really like the location setting with all the references of New York. It was interesting how everything develops at the end. the suspense factor was effective and the performance, although simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. There are a lot of little clean tricks built into this movie that do all the best. I think the supporting actress did a great job in her role. The casting and direction in this film seem to be linked to perfection and the quality of the shoot is quite impressive. The film is not exempt from soft moments, which gives it a good sense of balance.
