I do not see many 'horror' movies, but one night I sat down and watched this with my cousins. Now, we are teenagers, so we tend to make fun of a lot of things, but honestly, the performance here was not really good, especially at the beginning. One line that stood out was when Scarlett tells Jill and Tiffany: "This is so ... high school!" while the next scene shows Jill walking by a sign with her name of High School ... Many parts at first reminded me of a cheesy, badly written, misinterpreted episode of Lizzie McGuire. However, as the story progressed, and the cast progressed to just Jill most of the time, I could appreciate the film more. Camilla Belle did very well in this movie, and I think the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her. And I must admit that this was one of the most terrifying movies I've seen. Well, no, there were no big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls, but what made this movie more frightening than those that contain those things is that it really could happen. And this movie really reminded me of what is really scary ... We all know that we are not likely to meet the undead at any time in our lives, but the idea of ​​having a murderer inside the house where you are taking care of Kids could really happen. The only flaw in this movie is that it is one of the most cliched movies I've seen. It has everything a horror movie has had: turn the keys and start the car, shadows in the corner, turn the corners of the stairs with suspense, turn and see a corpse, end a fatal scene quickly when waking from a dream, etc. In the suspense scenes, it was very predictable, but in general, I would give it a 7/10. Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is my first review, so I do not know if any of those things were spoilers ... But just to be sure ...
