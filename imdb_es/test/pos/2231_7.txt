There is a good note on the price of a silk dressing gown. The bimbo in the office shows the bargain he got for $ 22 (close up of the tag). Later, Mary Astor finds the label in the boss's bedroom (proof that Bimbo slept with him). Even later, Mary Astor is about to have an affair with Ricardo Cortez, look at the price of her HER silk robe ($ 14) and remember how upset she was about the bimbo, as well as the fact that she has spent $ 8 less than the "most obvious" woman he has ever met. It sounds an obvious moral turn, but it was well done. The film would be stronger if the character of Robert Ames had been played by a more powerful actor (it is too discreet for a self-made salesman and spends most of the film with his face away from the camera), and if Ricardo Cortez had been given more to do than to smile ironically. Both male drivers are insipid and forgettable, and are hampered by the male pancake makeup so popular at the time of this movie. However, the character of Mary Astor is interesting, attractive and credible. Behind closed doors is worth seeing.
