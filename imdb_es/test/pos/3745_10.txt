Before talking about the end of this film, I will talk about the plot. A guy named Gerald breaks his engagement with Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months, Kitty and her aunt venture to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle, Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has become more evil. Gerald has certain rules for the castle (the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay, but Kitty insists on staying with excuses. One night, her aunt glimpses the monster running down the hall. It scares her so much that she faints and (another excuse) they must stay longer. Kitty cares more for Gerald after she tries to go to the maze, but Gerald catches her and is even more cruel to her. Kitty then sends reinforcements, she calls her doctor who is really her friend and hers wide. Then, to make things look suspicious, invite a couple of friends (who really do not do anything). Blah, blah, blah, Kitty and her aunt end up in the labyrinth where the biggest suspense in history is. Somehow they separate and try to meet. But the aunt stumbles upon the creature ... here is the moment we have all been waiting for, what is the creature lurking in the shadows? ... it's a giant FROG !! My God, what is better than that! After seeing the aunt, the frog literally goes crazy and runs, oops, I mean to climb the stairs to the top of the castle. The frog then jumps through an open window. Then, we take a shot from the ground and we see the frog towards us (oh yes, this movie was in 3-D). But what is fun is that the frog that falls through the window is actually a toy because it is 1/10 the size of the frog before jumping. Then it is revealed that all this was the fault of the evolutions, blah, blah, and Kitty and Gerald get married. Then, the last shot of this masterpiece is the tomb of the frog in the labyrinth, the only place where he was really happy;).
