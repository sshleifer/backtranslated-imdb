Spoilers: this movie has its problems, but in the end it transmits the message. I liked it because it ends the way they really do things. The good guy tries and tries, breaks his heart several times, but in the end there is no typical Hollywood ending. It ends in the way that such things always end, or at least they always have my own experiences and those of my friends. Anyone who thinks that the end of this is not what really happens, as seemed to make the first comment, believing that the girl would come, he realized that he is dating an asshole who treats her badly because he does not care about her at all. . He is naive or lives in a more perfect world than me. I give 7/10, additional points simply because he was not afraid to end with a low note, I do not give a real resolution, only the main character was disconsolate, confused and only as many men of countless generations have been before.
