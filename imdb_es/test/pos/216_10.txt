The inspiration for the "Naked Gun" films projects Leslie Nielsen, who recently started making comedy *, as the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin, always with the need to solve an absurd case. Like "plane!" and in the movies based on the series, the humor is based on jokes and silly comments of the Mel Brooks style (namely, the "yes" comments), along with the fact that Nielsen is still very serious despite of the nonsense that surrounds it. And, of course, the final frame, in which something moves. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that the program has only had six episodes. At least he spawned the movies. You can not go wrong with Leslie Nielsen in this kind of role. I suspect that everyone had fun filming it. Really fun <br /> <br /> * Before "Airplane!", Leslie Nielsen had starred in such films as "Forbidden Planet," "Harlow," and "The Poseidon Adventure." In 1987, he co-starred in "Nuts" alongside Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss. But since the first movie of "Naked Gun" has been a comedy all the time.
