This is one of the best performances of Cassavetes. The full cast is outstanding, as is the underestimated direction of Martin Ritt. The anger, the anguish and the despair of the urban labor battles are told magnificently in a way that is neither annoying nor condescending. In a way, it is dated with its time, but in many ways, it is gloriously timeless.
