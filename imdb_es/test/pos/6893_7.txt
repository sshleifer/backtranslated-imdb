I saw 'I Smell the Dead' (sorry, 'I SELL the dead') on a press screen. Glenn McQuaid, the writer, director and editor of the film, is a young Irishman who presented the screening by announcing that, while it was in progress, he would be "going for a pint". I do not envy her a drink, but when she told us about it, she seemed to feel that she needed to certify her status as a woman or her Irish, or both. When the opening credits began, there was, as usual in the press screenings, strong ovations for the names of all the actors or crew members who had friends in the audience, and silence for those who did not. McQuaid returned for an ingenious question and answer session afterwards. <br /> <br /> This horror movie is not taken seriously, which is good because its humor is considerably stronger than its horror. Only one scene is even remotely terrifying, and most of the "horror" is merely crude, but I laughed throughout much of the movie. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be set in Ireland around 1850 (because most of the time the robbery was deceased). The story is told in flashback: we get flashbacks inside flashbacks, and the narrative material of the character's flashbacks could not know him, because sometimes he was not present or (in one case) because the action develops behind his back. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine. Guillotines were not used in nineteenth-century Ireland, but, for once, we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence. The prisoner fights on his way to execution, the ropes are precise and the prisoner manages to look up and see the blade above. (And then there is a reward to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself). <br /> <br /> The characters are apparently Irish, but an important character speaks in Cockney's lingo: use phrases like "the game of a cup" and "take a butcher" (to "take a look"). For once, actors in nineteenth-century roles show 19th-century dental hygiene, but almost all of women's clothing and hairstyles (and women's makeup) are decidedly 21st century. I'm not complaining in the case of Heather Bullock, who wears a very attractive black miniskirt that looks like PVC. Phworr! <br /> <br /> The main actors (except Ron Perlman) are excellent, but most of the cast cast has no sense of the Victorian period. The worst offender is Joel Garland as a publican, whose characterization is firmly rooted in the 21st century. Just when I thought that Garland's performance could not be less Victorian, he used his fingers to make "ironic" air quotes. <br /> <br /> The sets (especially the Angus Scrimm lab) are detailed and impressive, but I could not convince myself that people really lived and worked in these places. Almost all interiors contain burning candles, but I never saw what would have existed in the case of real Victorian homes or workplaces: leftover drips from previous candles. <br /> <br /> A scene presents an extraterrestrial: I was upset that McQuaid accepted a stereotyped "gray" alien Schwa, instead of something original. <br /> <br /> There are splendid mounting sequences, but McQuaid opts for striking effects (split screens, shots at the top) that do not serve the story. I was impressed by a recurring blue screen device that superimposed the heads of the main characters on other backgrounds. Less effective was a recurring "Creepshow" style motif of camera shots that transforms the faces of the actors into drawings that resemble the panel art of the 1950s horror comics. I'm a fan of EC Comics, but I do not they belong to the 19th century Ireland. The money that McQuaid spent on the eye-catching F / X photo - showing his editing skills without serving the story - should have been spent on precise costumes. <br /> <br /> GREAT SPOILERS NOW. Ron Perlman gives an "Oirish" performance full of acting school tics. Apparently playing a 19th-century Irish priest, he writes with his left hand. (In Victorian Ireland, left-handed children were punished for using "the hand of the devil" and were forcibly retrained to become right-handed). But Perlman's character seems to have a reason to hide his right hand. Elsewhere, a character is bitten by a zombie but has no adverse effects, so he knew there would be a reward later. Several scenes that would be carried out more logically at night are recorded in daylight, apparently only because it was easier and less expensive. (Since McQuaid is a competent editor and editor, he could have shot "day by night" ... but using a process photo effect to help tell the story seems much less interesting than showing his striking editing techniques). <br /> <br /> McQuaid seems to be paying homage to those great horror films of Hammer. But those Hammers were great because actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in 1888 Whitechapel, or anywhere else. 'I Sell the Dead' almost fails to evoke the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Glenn McQuaid shows talent as a director, screenwriter and editor, but in all three capacities he makes strange decisions here ... then largely not justify those choices But I enjoyed 'Selling the dead'. I will grade it with 7 out of 10, and I look forward to your next movie.
