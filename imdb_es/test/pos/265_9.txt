A vg Brit rom-com, one to see if you can get a copy. Peculiar and, often, surprising, this is not the best of Brady's films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the most fun), although it has a unique charm. Well written, the story is diverted to a few dead ends, but mostly emerges with a new plot. You know from the beginning how it's going to end, but when it comes, it's honest and very open, a realistic and credible ending, the end seemed like a start, nice and left me with much desire.
