There are one or two other shorts from the Shemp era that I like the most (ie, BRAINED WRITINGS), but I think it can be said, without much discussion, that in this particular episode, Shemp gives his best comic performance as a puppet after rejoining the team in 1946. <br /> <br /> Scene by scene, this episode barely stops: from the voice lessons of Professor Shemp Howard with the shattering Dee Green, to his futile attempts to win the hand of a lady in marriage (this is Your little snookums ... will you marry me * click *) until the final fuss, will never stop having stitches. <br /> <br /> It would be remiss not to mention that immortal scene with Miss Hopkins (the always lovely Christine McIntyre). By the way, are you not dressed up and too loving to greet the man who thinks he is your 'Cousin' Basil? Who knows, maybe the current Basil was a "very" distant cousin, which makes it legal in some states (to my knowledge). >: -]
