Hello to all of you, lovely fans of Dirty Dancing !!!! I came across this message board when I got bored one day and I think it's great. I absolutely love DD! I saw it for the first time at my friends' house when I was 13 (now I am 17) and I was hooked! I saw it there at least 10 times more and, soon after, I bought the DVD. In this stage, I have memorized most of the script and I can recite it every time someone asks me about it. '' I brought a watermelon ?! '' It has become so bad that I bought the soundtrack and recorded the song of Micky and Sylvia, and now it's the ringtone on my phone! Most of my friends think it's a fucking movie, but I do not care what they think, I know it's great! I was reading the comments above and I have some questions for you a lot: 1. Why do you ask trivial questions such as the age of Lisa and Baby? I do not think it matters much. They are teenagers in the 60s, is not that enough? 2. Where did you get this special edition you're talking about? It sounds VERY interesting ... Please, respond to this. I would like to see the opinions of other fans ... Greetings! charliesangel415 xxx
