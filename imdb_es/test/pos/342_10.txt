I am a great follower of Indian Movies, especially Malayalam and Tamil. <br /> <br /> Shame on India for not sending this film as its official entry to the Oscar. I have seen this film and it has revealed to me clearly the maturity that Tamil cinema has had in its script and narrative with which Bollywood can catch up. By the way, for all Westerners, Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood, which is everything. about the good glamor look and the promotion. <br /> <br /> What did India think when they sent a movie like 'Devdas' to the Oscars? That was really a masochist movement. I think they're trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges overthrew Lagaan last year. <br /> <br /> 'Devdas' is just a melodrama of color, bright and predictable of Love, destiny and destiny. I would stay away from it. Anyway, the failure to send a film like Kanathil Muthital shows how much renewal the Indian administration needs to save it from poor administrators who lack intelligence. Now I know why this country has so many problems. They are very talented, but they do not show properly.
