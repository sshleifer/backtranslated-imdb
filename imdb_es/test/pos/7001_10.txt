This film is about the crew of a spaceship that crashes on a strange bright planet with three suns. Among the passengers is the convicted serial killer, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), and his enemy, Johns (Cole Hauser). While the survivors of the shipwreck are oriented, an eclipse of the three suns occurs. Soon after, the frightening creatures begin to appear and begin to kill the crew members one by one. During the eclipse, Riddick enters in his place, since his eyeballs have been surgically shone, giving him nocturnal vision. The team has to trust him to try to make them safe. <br /> <br /> This is a very elegant film, with the color of the sky changing scene by scene, giving it a very strange appearance. Vin Diesel is brilliant as Riddick, really threatening but forced to help people who would otherwise only see him as a threat. There is also an underlying humor in his performance, which adds another dimension to the character. This is the kind of role in which Vin stands out, the antihero, whose character is not as one-dimensional as it seems. I can not imagine anyone else in this role, it could have been written specifically for him. <br /> <br /> Roll on Chronicles of Riddick!
