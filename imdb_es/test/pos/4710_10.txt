Exuberant cinematography, beautifully written and edited, Beyond Rangoon by John Boorman is a must for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation. It interweaves a personal and political story that continues to persecute me, appearing frequently in my mind. The story line is exciting, and the internal and external journeys are carefully and delicately paralleled both cinematographically and in the story line. I've seen this movie at least six times, and it really holds the scrutiny. It is particularly relevant today, given the world events. Take a look, you will not regret it! By the way, NetFlix still does not have it, but you can request that they do so.
