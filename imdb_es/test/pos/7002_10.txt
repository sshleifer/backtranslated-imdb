This is without a doubt the most exciting and satisfying movie I've seen in years! The plot seen in printed form is almost banal: a ship crashes on a desert planet with three suns, the survivors have to adapt to the landscape and to each other, then the darkness falls and the monsters appear. Pilot Fry, after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere when she almost threw the passengers, takes over the group and requests the help of the convicted murderer Riddick to guide them through the darkness to the escape ship . Improved eyes that can see in the dark. But in reality it is not so simple: all the characters are complex, three-dimensional, with conflicting features, so you never know who is good and who is bad. <br /> <br /> The performances are uniformly excellent. Radha Mitchell shows Fry getting ready. for leadership, overcome their own fears and try to avoid further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, as the man who takes Riddick into custody, shows that he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards. But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick, it has the most magnetic screen presence I've seen in years. For much of the movie his face is in the shade, and it does not really say much, but it catches his attention anyway. Sometimes it catches your attention by not talking, or by not moving. And Diesel does not trivialize the character, as could easily be done, by giving him a "golden heart". Riddick is still a cruel and evil man when they approach the ship. It simply allows us to glimpse the first tentative steps of taking care of only oneself taking care of others. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is very good. Lighting effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum: triple sunlight and total darkness. Special effects that show both Riddick's and monsters' point of view add to the suspense, as do the sound effects of flying monsters and use ultrasound to "see" (monsters are anatomically plausible and conveniently frightening) ). The editing is so tight that sometimes it is almost discordant: there is literally no filler in this movie, it does not fade, there is no time to reorient. <br /> <br /> From the first take until the end of the credits you have to keep your wits about you. Each scene, each line of dialogue, each camera shot is important. Look three times to understand everything. <br /> <br /> My only warning is about science: the solar system, as shown in the model, is impossible (the planets revolve around the suns, not the other way around). However, that does not affect human history, so I have not removed any points.
