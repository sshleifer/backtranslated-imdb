Any fan of Batman will know how great the movies are, they have been a great success. Batman Returns, however, is the best movie of the series. A combination of excellent direction, brilliant performance and adjustments makes it worth seeing in one night. <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, who directed this film, specifically made sure that this film provides a realistic and finished environment. a great job. Danny Devito (penguin man) is a man who has inherited the characteristics of a penguin when he was a baby, and grew up to become a horrible and ugly thing ... Michelle Pfiffer plays the elegant and seductive 'Catwoman' after the Cats had given her genes so they would not bite her. The result in both character changes is excellent and both Catwoman and Penguin play a very important role in this excellent film. The mysterious Catwoman is very funny to watch, her classic sayings and a funny part in which jumping with her whip in a jewelry store adds so much fun to the movie. Danny Devito is also doing well, his ability to impersonate a strange creature was vital, and adds a great atmosphere to the film that takes us back to the boring sewers where he lives. <br /> <br /> You can not forget Batman though. Micheal Keaton once again pulls a comfortable performance, and shows us a different side to Batman. His affection is unleashed when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the film, and his meetings with her when he is a normal person, Selina Kyle, make him seduce him in his own home. There is a smart part after this when they leave, and the movie is full of great scenes. It's worth noting that Bruce Wayne's mobile is not used as much as in other Batman movies, since combat and storytelling scenes make up this movie. <br /> <br /> The winter environment is perfectly created in Gotham City with most of the scenes set at night and the city is filled with snow. Therefore, if you watch this movie during the summer like me, it does not feel the same. It is best to see it during the winter. <br /> <br /> In general, it is an incredible movie. All the credit is for Tom Burton and the cast, they have done an incredible job.
