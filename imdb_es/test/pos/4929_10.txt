This was one of my favorite childhood movies. I saw it so many times, eventually my tape wore out. I was a big fan of this program and I still am. What I like most about this movie is that it attracts many people, both young and old. Now I watch this movie and laugh as hard as the first time I saw it. Now I can appreciate all the jokes for adults that I never got when I was a kid. My favorite characters are Elmyra and Foulmouth. Almost fifteen years later, my father (a great fan of the film too) and I continue to quote the lines of this film. I love the part where Foulmouth and Shirley go to the movies. "You keep the seats, Shirl and I will snag Daddy's sandwiches." I also loved the story of Plucky, Hampton and his family at Happy World Land. Wade Pig reminded me so much of my dad. I love the part when they finally arrive at Happy World Land and all they do is travel on the monorail. This movie is hilarious and attracts boys and girls. The animation, the jokes and everything related to it are first class. If you have not seen it, rent it. You will not regret.
