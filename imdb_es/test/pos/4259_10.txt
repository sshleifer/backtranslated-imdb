This movie had everything one could wish to see originally, in the late sixties. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary insight into the many changes that occurred during that period, and were still ongoing, in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam and the volatile movement that followed the calmer years before the postwar period. from the 50s. <br /> <br /> All this and one of the funniest movies, then or now. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as fascinating as I originally saw it. His humor is so funny and his message so strong. <br /> <br /> And seeing it now, you get all this, while at the same time you gain the additional enjoyment that it is a "period piece". and a magnificent chronicle of its historical, turbulent time.
