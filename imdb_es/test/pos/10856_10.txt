Of the 24 best lesbian movies in my library, I must rate this as the number one movie of all time. This film will go down in history as the best of its kind. It is a story about a girl (Rachael Stirling) who goes from wealth to rags and clothes to wealth, with her first love (Keeley Hawes) coming and going from her life. It is set in a Victorian context in the 1890s, which makes it the ideal setting for some of the best entertainment in the industry. This film spared no expense for music and costumes, and the makeup that Rachael and Keeley wore while onstage at the Halls only contributed to the film's diversity. <br /> <br /> No matter what kind of movies you prefer, I can guarantee that this movie will not only surprise you, but will keep your attention on all three episodes. This movie will be played and enjoyed in the coming decades. The collector's version of unrated DVD is a must for anyone's library. Rachael Stirling and Keeley Hawes were the best choice for casting in these two roles, and they played extremely well.
