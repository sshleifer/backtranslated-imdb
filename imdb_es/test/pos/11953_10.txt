I really love everything done by Savage Steve Holland, the writer / director of this great movie. Also see "Better Off Dead" and "How I got to college." Wonderful! Anyway, this movie is really funny and offers some unexpected things. Where else, in this movie, can you see Demi Moore as a talented singer and Bobcat Golthwait as a twin? I recommend it to anyone looking for some old-fashioned slapstick comedy (George with the turtle raft), not to mention a really well-written sarcasm (the Christmas tree on the roof of the car). This movie constantly throws unexpected things to you even after you've seen it 100 times like me! Enjoy!
