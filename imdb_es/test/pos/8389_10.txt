Inglorious Basterds does not apologize, does not ask for forgiveness, it is an assault on the senses. Tarantino does not care if he offends, if he steps on all the stereotypes and clich√©s, this is the purest part of the movie. It's great to see a filmmaker whose work is clearly not related to the powers that be. Tarantino is a master at effortlessly increasing the immense tension and mixing it suddenly with moments of laughter; you're not sure if you should be looking away with disgust or rolling laughing, in any case it's a roller coaster and you can not miss it! It's not for everyone and I'm not sure how the Germans will take the film, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this can be a bit difficult to swallow, but, nevertheless, it's a movie that you just have to see. A self-respecting movie fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph Waltz ... Oscar, do not you dare ignore it!
