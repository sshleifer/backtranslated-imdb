And with those words, one of the great movie advertising campaigns came to an end. 'Garbo Talks' and she uttered those words in her first sound film, an adaptation of Eugene O'Neil playing Anna Christie. <br /> <br /> Unlike other players and other studios, MGM was concerned to find the right vehicle for Greta Garbo. Many players who were well in the universal medium of silent movies would lose their careers because of the announcers. Their strong native accents would get in the way, some did not know any English. <br /> <br /> It was no coincidence that Anna Christie was chosen for Garbo. First, it was written by one of the leading dramatists in the United States, it was the kind of literary property that would have attracted it. Second, since the main role was someone who was Swedish, the accent could be explained. Finally, many problems of the first fans were solved, even though Anna Christie still used the title cards. <br /> <br /> Like most of O'Neil's work, it does not have much action, but it's long and deep. characterization. The story takes place on the New York waterfront, where Garbo as Anna has come to live with his father George Marion. Marion escaped to the sea years ago, when Anna was a baby and Marion left his wife. Anna had to do what she could to survive in the adult world and that includes prostitution. <br /> <br /> Marion, of course, is glad to see her, even throws Marie Dressler, the old brac√≠a of the shore that has been living. With years to accommodate his flesh and blood. Of course, both Marion and Garbo have their problems adapting, they are not facilitated when they shelter a sailor played by Charles Bickford who is proud of Garbo. <br /> <br /> Marion is repeating her role from the original Broadway Production. Anna's role on stage was made by Pauline Lord. Anna Christie ran for 177 shows in the 1921-22 season on Broadway. It is one of O'Neil's best-known works and is frequently revived. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo's performance with perfect diction even with a Swedish accent was acclaimed and his future in sound films was assured. Greta Garbo received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and the film also received nominations for Clarence Brown as Best Director and William Daniels for Cinematography. Daniels should especially receive a lot of congratulations for the way he photographed the scenes of the coast. And Brown created the environment in the riverside area where the film is set. <br /> <br /> Eugene O'Neil's work is timeless, so Anna Christie, even with many of the pitfalls of early sound films, is not that old. of that era to do. Garbo also shows that he mastered the subtlety necessary to work in the medium of sound. Anna Christie is a classic, in every way.
