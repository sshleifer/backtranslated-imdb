I can not imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than that of Quentin Tarantino. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since then, it has been a disappointment for some. Well, I'm relieved to say that Tarantino has not lost his touch. It brings us the best of itself from Pulp Fiction and fortunately. <br /> <br /> We know the story, a story from the Second World War that only tells how Tarantino can do it. (Fictional, of course) A war movie has not been done like that before. Brad Pitt as Lieutenant Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi-occupied France. Your goal - kill the Nazis. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He is known as the "Jew Hunter" and deals with his business as ruthless as any other. The third secondary story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the massacre of her family. And she, of course, wants to plan revenge against the Germans for their devastating defeat. Actually, here are three stories that intertwine and connect with each other. If you know something about Tarantino or his movies, this is nothing new to him. <br /> <br /> War has never been so fun. The Basterds are disturbing, but at the same time, very funny, sometimes even fun. The dark aspect of comedy plays a big part in this as in many other Tarantino films. Entertainment and hilarity are in charge of Brad Pitt. I found it extremely fun and entertaining. I could not wait to see him again on the screen. Even with his crazy accent, he works in these types of movies. I was also very impressed by MÃ©lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was full of remarkable representations. <br /> <br /> The story itself has so many historical inaccuracies to tell, but so what? It is not meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with us, as we should. The cinematography department deserves great accessories with beautiful vibrant colors that highlight the film. You really must love the last line of the movie ... but Pulp Fiction is still his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino, among other things, is an artist. World War II is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino somehow manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a funny movie, tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful and fun at the same time. With everything you're looking for in a movie, made with that true Tarantino style, it's worth checking it out. It is time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.
