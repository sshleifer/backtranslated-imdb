He's probably too old for this movie, 16, and since I'm a boy, the story is too feminine, but I really thought it was a great movie in general. All the girls in this movie are such great and really cool actresses, from Alana, to Adrianne, to Deena, Kimberly, to the cute little girl who plays Alana's little sister, Rachel. I'm not a big fan of pop stars with love songs, but I thought Aaron Carter did a great job on this, and it seems he was really interested in this movie, and it made it look real. My mom liked all the older farts she grew up with, so that's great too. I kept thinking that I liked people very much and I wonder if I will see them again. A sequel would be great. I rented this, but I could also buy it, since I have a lot of DVDs and would like to go back to see something that I missed. However, I could not buy it at Blockbuster, so I do not know where I could buy it right now, but I'll investigate. Anyway, I am a 16 year old boy, I already said it, I know, but I would like to have an appointment to see this. It's really good for all ages, really. I think even my stepsister who is 6 years old could see this. That's what's good, it's something that all ages can see. I'm sure it was done on purpose, but it really works. Girls can dream of being with Aaron Carter, and guys like me can dream of all the good girls in this movie. There is something for everyone.
