Travis and Sandy (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.) are horse dealers forced to sell their animals to a Mormon group and guide them across the border to a settlement. What they do not expect is to meet the notorious murderers of Clegg, with his wounded leader, Uncle Shiloh (Charles Kemper). Ward Bond plays Elder Wiggs, the lead voice of the Mormon group that moves the wagon train toward the Lord's destiny. Along the way, they also meet "Doctor" A Locksley Hall and his "Hoochey Koochey Wagon" and give them help. <br /> <br /> Directed affectionately by Ford who pays close attention to details with realistic problems that any group would encounter. during a road of steep wagons. The film has a wonderful cast made up of actors without a real star in the film, which is really a blessing to watch, if not for a change of pace. Young Johnson and Carey, Jr. come out very well, but this is the Bond movie to shine as it has the best lines. Johnson is the one who seems to understand the ruffians and the brutes as Shiloh, and will undoubtedly be useful when certain conflicts develop when the Clegg boys accompany them in one piece. <br /> <br /> I would have to say this It is one of your best and most appreciated westerns and it seems to flow very well.
