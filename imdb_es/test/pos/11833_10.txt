I just saw this movie for the first time today, and I loved it ... <br /> <br /> Yes, it's simple in its history, the sweetest love story and how a woman could not fall in love Callum Blue beats me. .. <br /> <br /> The landscape in Italy was as expected, beautiful, the bad guys lost at the end, and that the two lovers met at the end, it was wonderful, but that scene in which a certain Italian I was sweeping the confetti after Eric and Wanda's wedding, perfection! <br /> <br /> Have a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yes, better have a handkerchief ready and you will be captivated. I know it was and I hope I can burn it to DVD very soon. All the actors played their role perfectly, this was a World War II film that could be believed, as it was as realistic, and without exaggeration as in other movies ...
