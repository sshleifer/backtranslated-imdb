Considered by many as a strangely overlooked Chabrol, it seems to me that the reason it has cooled down is its sordidness factor. Not as openly sexy, violent or bloody as many films of this period, however, it begins quite surprisingly and, although increasingly measured, it still gives off a rather unpleasant smell. Mrs. Audran, not here, the ice maiden but a drunk mother, Donald Pleasence makes a cameo as a child molester, David Hemmings has his eyes on sex with minors and the central issue is the relationship between a brother, a sister and a niece. No, it is not very nice at all and Chabrol treats everything as if it were something very normal (as if it were a small French town!) Instead of the New York City of Ed McBain. If this had been treated in a more sensational way, then it would have been a more acceptable but less important film. Here we really have to choose between the possibility of several unpleasant options before the final outcome. Very observable
