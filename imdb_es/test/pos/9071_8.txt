Very exciting, surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students who line up and then are resurrected to share their experiences of death and what's beyond. Joel Schumacher directs with some skill, creating some very strange scenes, as well as especially beautiful ones. The visions of death are not what viewers can expect or what awaits us all when we go, thanks to screenwriter Peter Filardi who really did an excellent job of creating this story. While the creativity of the story is impressive, the story also has many holes, particularly in the department of logic and credibility factors. Despite all that, Flatliners is a good effective film because of the script, the direction that is sometimes very surreal and the performance that brings together four very talented actors and William Baldwin. This core of actors acts and reacts very well to each other. Keifer Sutherland does an impressive job as head of the group: the one who has the idea of ​​dying and being born again. He also manages to portray a man, a young man, with a harmful and destructive secret of his past. Kevin Bacon is fine as the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group. Oliver Platt is really good as the voice of reason and human fears. Platt has some really good lines and plays paranoia well. Yes, Julia Roberts is here too and very well. However, the actors perform better and make themselves believe that they are good friends. I was impressed with a lot of the Flatliners, but more than anything, the story affected me more. The scene with that dog walking around the street just one of those powerful images evoked like many of the "flashback" scenes.
