This wonderful movie is a love story, and shows that not all relationships are destined to last. Even so, they can be excellent and be worth the pain and suffering of the break. <br /> <br /> Director Pieter Verhoeff gives us an idea of ​​the period around 1900, the way in which society treats women and how it is very strong. The woman (Nynke) deals with. With magnificent costumes, landscapes, charming music and good actors and acting, this set of photos attracts you throughout the film. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the ending is a bit sudden, a page that describes the rest of your life. Scrolls Reflecting, this is an excellent (the best) way to make your own fantasy create the rest of your life. <br /> <br /> This was the second film for me that made people sit down while the final titles moved (The first being Schindler's list). Apparently the film had this effect all over the world.
