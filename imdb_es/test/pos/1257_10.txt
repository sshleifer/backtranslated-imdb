From the perspective that it is possible to make films that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, it is definitely worth it. This is Bruce Willis' second consecutive film that manages to tell his story without nudity, faded humor, blasphemy or gratuitous violence. (I mean, of course, The Sixth Sense) Both films are interesting on more than one level. This is also appropriate for children, although, as others have pointed out, it is not a children's movie. <br /> <br /> It bothered me that the time travel device that manages this plot is never explained, except that we know that Russell himself started it at age 70. Also, why his dying mother has to come to school to look for him when he wins the fight; Why, if, as his older self says, he has to fight against that child over and over again over the next few years, his mother does not have to come looking for him every time, and why he does not learn to kick his ass in the process. I also found the score quite annoying and not always appropriate for the action on stage. <br /> <br /> However, a good use of the red plane as a metaphor.
