This movie would have embarrassed the typical "farmers" of Hollywood. The emotions portrayed are moderate and underestimated in a very comfortable way. The plot is clich√© enough with a lead role that has a terminal illness (this is not a spoiler and was well established in the movie) The execution method is somehow unique to most of the love stories you've seen, He was not even kissing. You will exchange, and yet you will feel the enormous current of love between the two drivers. Initially, I assumed that this "restriction of emotions" was somewhat analogous to the typical "oriental values", but then I decided not to do so. <br /> <br /> This film is so discreet that if you compare it with movies like "Cinema Paradiso", CP would have felt openly manipulative in comparison. So, it's definitely not a cup of tea for everyone. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I have a strong feeling that Hollywood love movies (or love movies, to be exact) glorified romance or passion and labeled it "love". I am sure that we all have our own definitions and I would not say that these qualities are mutually exclusive. But, I would venture to say that the movie will allow you to wonder if there is any additional dimension you have with your loved one. <br /> <br /> It is very obvious that I really enjoy this movie. Considering the fact that the movie is so simple in appearance, paradoxically it is one of the most "cinematic" movies I've seen lately.
