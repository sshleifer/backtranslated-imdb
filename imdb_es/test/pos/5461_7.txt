THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting HBO movie that analyzed in detail the struggle for power that took place between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This fight is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who do not know the story and know where Letterman is now, it might be interesting to know that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world But Letterman discovered that her dreams were falling apart when the frequent guest Leno had one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, Helen Kushnick, in her corner and working tirelessly to get her client's job. It is not often that we can see behind the scenes the Hollywood machinations recreated for their entertainment value, but for the fans of these two nocturnal superstars, this film provided a fascinating look at a very turbulent period on nightly television. According to this movie, Carson himself practically promised Letterman, while NBC had promised Leno the job and that's where Helen Kushnick came in. he ignores some of Helen's determined manipulations of some of NBC's most powerful players and presents Letterman as this intelligent and intelligent businessman who, despite having Carson's support, was criticized by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly recreate Letterman and Leno, respectively, but it is the interpretation of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Helen Kushnick that keeps this film bubbly. Bates controls the screen in one of his best, if not so well-known performances, like the poisonous Hollywood agent who breakfasts the executives of the television studios. There's also a wonderful twist on the part of Impressionist Rich Little like Johnny Carson, but it's mainly a fascinating story and Bates' powerful performance that makes it worthwhile to take a look.
