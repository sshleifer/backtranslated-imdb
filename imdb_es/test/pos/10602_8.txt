When I first heard of this movie, I became interested a little. The plot seemed an opportunity for hilarity and Bam Margera as an actor and director seemed something that could be good. When I discovered the movie starring Ryan Dunn, I became even more interested (I was a Homewrecker fan when I was in ... Yes, I'm a bit silly). However, I did not have much faith that it was too good. When I sat down to watch it, I was afraid of wasting my time. <br /> <br /> But only in five minutes it became clear that I had made a mistake. <br /> <br /> I thought the comedy of this movie was deliciously idiotic, and it definitely was not suitable for all kinds of people. The performance was quite good, much better than my expectations. I thought it was easy enough to relate to Ryan's character, who gave the film a center that was credible. This is key in a film as outrageous as this one (and it's probably why he was not a Borat fanatic). <br /> <br /> The film is not suitable for young people, DUH, and will definitely create more than what is a fair proportion of uncomfortable turtles if observed with parents. But it's good for you and your friends in a movie night.
