I just watched this movie 2 days ago. A very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine. I have no special interest in wine, and yet this seemed very enlightening to me. The director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people who they are. While exposing many things that are below the surface, he manages not to take a position and leave that to the viewer. Shows a lot of compassion for people (and dogs), sympathy, lets people tell their story and at the same time exposes what they do not want to tell. <br /> <br /> The movie shows us where our world is going to be, what the benefits are and what the high price we pay. It is a film about the love of wine and the love of making it great, personal and global, character and formula. <br /> <br /> For me, the real stars of the people are the oldest wine makers with their disillusioned looks. in the world and in themselves. <br /> <br /> It takes some time to get used to the movements and editing of the camera, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
