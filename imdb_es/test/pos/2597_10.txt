I can only think of a movie that could be as good or better than this one in regards to Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck: ALI BABA BUNNY. However, determining what is best is irrelevant, just look at both of them and enjoy. <br /> <br /> I compared this with ALI BABA BUNNY because they both present Daffy at his absolute worst moment: greedy, unpleasant and very funny in the process. However, I think I prefer RABBIT SEASONING simply because Bugs is also pretty horrible at this - doing horrible things back to Daffy every time Daffy tries a dirty trick. <br /> <br /> The movie starts when Daffy leaves the rabbit. crawl to the Bugs hole with the hope that a hunter (naturally, it's Elmer) will blow up the rabbit and leave Daffy alone! Not to be outdone, Bugs takes all Daffy's tricks and turns them over and over again, and in most cases, involves Daffy getting shot in the face! Everything is very, very smart and funny, and I do not care how old you are, this cartoon will make you laugh unless you're a grump. Especially I love the great and unexpected end, but I will not say more, since I do not want to ruin the surprise.
