I had never read any of Sarah Waters' novels, nor had I seen Tipping the Velvet. I only heard about Fingersmith when I was flipping through the "The L word" websites. The story of Fingersmith interested me, however, I spent thinking "Lesbian in the Victorian period, which never ends well, I have enough of those series of lesbians and movies that do not go anywhere". <br /> <br /> Without However, during Christmas, my local DVD store gave Fingersmith a discount, I brought the DVD and my life has never been so colorful. <br /> <br /> This miniseries deserves to be appreciated and appreciated. The acting is so big that I call it weird. Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans, Imelda Staunton and many more that I can not name all, brought light and darkness to their characters. Only with a small gesture, a small look, a little touch, they made their characters real and, as a spectator, I could not help but take them home, keep them close. <br /> <br /> Fingersmith, set in the Victorian area, is a story about Sue, a thief who loves and lives with her "Family" of pickpockets. Little did she know that her destiny is linked to Maud Lily, a timid and shy girl who grows up in a mansion miles and miles away. Maud's mother left her a fortune, but Maud can not touch her, unless she marries. The worst of all is that Maud's uncle makes sure that he will never do so by keeping her prisoner in the house. <br /> <br /> Enter Mr. Gentlement, a charming and attractive thief with a heart as bad as anybody. He wants Maud's fortune for himself, and to do so establishes Sue as Lily Lily's maid, and asks Sue to convince Maud to elope with him. as time goes on, things would be simple if Sue did not fall in love with Maud. <br /> <br /> And things would be simple, if the story were what I just told. I do not want to spoil myself, so I'd like to stop there. But I can assure you that everything is twisted and turned before you can realize what has happened. Once it happened, then you ask what would happen next. Besides that, history is full of passion like no other. There is no search for oneself, nor does sexuality question the moments "Oh, my God, I like girls", because the Fingersmith girls are buried so deeply in their own darkness that they can hardly worry. The story with such a twisted plot moves as smooth as water, running passionately, but strangely quiet. <br /> <br /> It has been weeks since I saw "Fingersmith", but Maud's eyes still haunt me, and Sue's words still warm my heart "You, pearl, pearl, your pearl," he said. And such a pearl is.
