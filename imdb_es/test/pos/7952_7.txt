Korean "Romance" about the owner of a camera store that is diagnosed with a deadly disease. As you go through your daily routine and prepare for the end, meet a young woman who is a client. Friendship and romance grow, although none of them expresses any kind of affection for the other. The good movie is different from everything you are likely to see remade in the United States simply because the studios would insist that the "couple" act on their feelings. He will not say anything because he does not have so much time to live, she will not do it because it is not what he does and he does not respond as she thinks he should. Of course, it's much more complex than I imagine and, honestly, it's the kind of things you should discover for yourself. It's a great movie? No, but it's a good one that will move you emotionally. The final lines of the film still haunt me: "I always knew that love would vanish like a photograph, but you will remain in my heart as you are in my last moment." Thank you and goodbye ". It may seem strange out of context, but in the context of the movie it is very moving.
