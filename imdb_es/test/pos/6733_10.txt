The first time I saw this movie on the nightly program of one of my favorite television channels ... I was hooked from the first minute. Nothing is what it seems at the beginning, a lot of suspense, great performance from Mr. van Dien, and I did not mind the "heat" in that a bit ;-) ... and, best of all: a surprise awaits you! Ending !!!
