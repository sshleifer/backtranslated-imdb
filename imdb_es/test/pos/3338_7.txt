George Sanders playing the Saint for the second-to-last time does a good job with a good script: with the usual good RKO. It is also a story that is not Charteris, full of murders and good fun. <br /> <br /> Topic 1: In New York, the police inspector Fernack, the friend of the Templars, is framed in a corruption scandal and disgraced. ST comes from London to try to fix things. Nice and simple so far, but is there really more than $ 90,000 in the world? Thread 2: Another story of a woman who takes revenge on the people who murdered her brother, Wendy Barrie likes to run into some unsavory men and make the Santa fall in love with her. Including a villain who was under his direct protection and in Fernack's hold, there is a spooky shot of him (dead and staring) and of them in a car when they take him back to where they had taken him. Paul Guilfoyle as Pearly Gates must have been homosexual in this (witness the robe at the beginning and ST's last deceptive comment that he was thinking about keeping him as a pet) and also did it for "Palm Springs"! Fernack was played by Jonathan Hale as usual, but this time with such a disillusioned attitude that what he really needed was a good blow from the Templars to cheer him up. <br /> <br /> The Hays Office also made sure that you received the image on the right, all the threads are tied without unequal bits. It's worth seeing for all of us who like this kind of thing, but if the Val Kilmer version is your criteria, then do not bother.
