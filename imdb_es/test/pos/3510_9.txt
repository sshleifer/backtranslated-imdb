I saw this movie for the first time around 1990 when I was a little boy and that scared me Jesus. I loved it and I was dying to put my hands on it. <br /> <br /> In 2002 I remembered that this movie existed, but I had no idea what it was called, so I went to I I need to know in the IMDb section and explained what the movie was about and tried to get its first name. Anyway, eventually someone at IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie. So I finally got it on a DVD, and now I keep this movie as one of my most valuable horror films. I really love it, and I think anyone who sees it will be very scared in the woods the next time they go. 9/10.
