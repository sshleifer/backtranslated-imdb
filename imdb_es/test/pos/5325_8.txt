There are subtleties in this movie that I think a lot of people can get lost if they're not careful. You really need to follow what Leland says and read his character to discover the "why" that the film presents at the end. Nothing solid, it is not definitive, it is about what the individual spectator gets out of it. I think that was the plan from the beginning, people do not intend for everyone to understand it in the same way, it's about forming your own personal relationship with Leland in order to feel a little better. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting but his summary could never explain what the movie really is. It is dramatic and stimulating, many heavy ideas, but the pace of the movie is almost relaxing, even with its most intense scenes with screams. I think it's probably Leland, he's calm and almost serene, even with all his sadness. The film personifies Leland in a way. <br /> <br /> Of course it is captivating and it appeals to you if you leave it, but there are some recycled ideas. I mean, Leland has many impressive dialogues, he's anything but typical, but he's not a prophet. Everything he says is not a revelation, many people I know have mentioned things that he mentioned, I have even observed some things he has observed. Leland is the unique and attractive character that is probably mostly for the Ryan Gosling performance. <br /> <br /> In the end, the acting is exceptional, there are no really bad guys, there is no way to evaluate Leland psychologically, just maybe understand him and life a little better. <br /> <br /> Compared to Igby Goes Down, I think it's not comical, but similar in its overall outlook on life.
