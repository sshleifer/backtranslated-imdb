The Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors I have loved. I love almost all the shorts that they have made. I love the six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are fun and also star many other great actors and actresses, many of them in many of the shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the best actors in history and is the funniest comedy team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Brideless Groom! All that appear in this short film are Dee Green, the beautiful Christine McIntyre, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great performances here! There are so many fun parts here. This is a very hilarious short. There are three other similar nuts, like this one called Husbands Beware, and I recommend both!
