Darling Lili is a mixture of Perfection and Magic! The stars; Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson could not have made a better attempt if they tried. It is full of all the magic that a young girl wants and makes it look like everything can happen to you. The brilliance of the Director; Blake Edwards is shown to be at his best. I was really capturing the woman I loved on the screen! <br /> <br /> The combination of each song was perfect with the moment in the movie. The film began with Julie Andrews singing Whistling Away In The Dark and closed with the same song by Andrews. <br /> <br /> For a film of this excellence to have been a failure when it was released, it's a total shock ... <br /> <br /> As it is: "Inspirational ... Purely .. Inspirational! " ~ One of the most memorable lines of Andrews in this movie!
