I was disappointed with the recent American remake (2000) of this miniseries in English. Although it followed the line of the plot very closely, it seemed to leave out the heart and soul of the original. Not to mention the addition of sarcastic and shallow 'messages'. My advice is to omit the modern remake and continue with the original. It is much longer, but exciting and totally well done. Interesting, complex and textured, without the preacher's complacency ... and it's very well filmed, too. <br /> <br /> I find it irritating that these ruthless rowers of great foreign films receive so much Hollywood fanfare at the Oscars (Although I liked that Benicio del Torro received some well-deserved accolades ...)
