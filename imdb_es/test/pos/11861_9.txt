Well, maybe this movie is not a revolution. But it's a very good piece of entertainment, and it's Liv Tyler's variation of Alicia Silverstone's "Clueless" or "There's Something About Mary" by Alicia Silverstone. <br /> <br /> Liv plays a fatal woman, who only wants to have a house of her own and all kinds of material comfort in her. And well, she does everything possible to get that ... even the crimes. Many crimes. And drop all the boyfriends who do not cooperate to get these things. Also, she really does not mind having more lovers with her current boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is even more fun to see if one knows that Liv is actually a cancer of the zodiac sign, and cancer is reported to be very domestic. So the character that Liv played here is in actually a parody of a cancer! <br /> <br /> I was alone in the cinema when I saw it. That was quite comfortable because I could laugh as hard as I wanted all the time, but I also felt strange, as if no one was interested in this movie? <br /> <br /> I really liked it. The performance was from very good to excellent, especially the main actors where it was brilliant. There were enough jokes there, many of the black type and good dialogues. <br /> <br /> This is a garbage movie, and it's full of black humor. If you like this kind of movies, try this one!
