I saw this movie with an open mind, not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was written, directed and acted in such a way that every minute is a lovely watch. People do not seem to be acting, rather they are real people who actually train dogs and lead the lives represented in this film. There are some wonderful moments in which he laughs or laughs, some jokes can be dry but they are presented in a very visible way. Highly recommended!
