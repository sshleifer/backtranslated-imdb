I think it was in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and I saw in the newspapers that one of the theaters was playing 'Deviyan Teen'. We decided to go alone for the pleasure of doing it without expecting anything good. But a pleasant surprise awaited us. The film was made in 1965, but even by today's standards, the plot was quite modern and well ahead of its time. The music was wonderful and Dev Anand, as a servant of the city, looked and acted in the best way. I still remember that exalted feeling when we left the cinema after the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Who thought of this story of a man in love with three very different girls at the same time? No, he does not have three times or cheat, but he really likes all three for different reasons. One is homelike, one is an actress and the third is a "high society" girl who can also help Dev in his career as a poet. The question is what is the "One" for him. What makes the matter worse is that the three of them like him too. When things come to a standstill, a hypnotist takes it and, in his hypnotized state, dreams of his future with each of them and comes to the right decision. <br /> <br /> This dream of yours, which is the only one colored. part of a film otherwise black and white is the crux of the film, but surprisingly it has been edited from most of the versions available today. If you want to see this movie, make sure that this part is intact. In case you see this movie without this part and you get confused, do not worry because you just watched an incomplete movie.
