This film marked the end of the "serious" era of the Universal Monsters (Abbott and Costello meet monsters later in "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankentstein"). It was a somewhat desperate but fun attempt to relive the classic monsters of the Werewolf, the monster of Frankenstein and Dracula a "last" time. <br /> <br /> I say desperate, because in the previous movie, "House of Frankenstein," both Dracula and the werewolf are killed according to the way the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be (Dracula by the sunlight and the werewolf by a silver bullet). However, they somehow return to the House of Dracula without any explanation. This movie could have been a prequel to House of Frankenstein if the plot of the Frankenstein monster did not continue chronologically in House of Dracula of House of Frankenstein, and if the werewolf was not cured. Then there would be holes in the plot. But since this is not the case, the plots of Dracula and the werewolf have no meaning. <br /> <br /> However, ignoring these holes in the plot, House of Dracula is a classic atmospheric horror movie that is fun to watch. It has many high points. Especially watching the werewolf heal. I know I just said that this should not have been included, but it was nice to see him get well after all this time. And the scene with the lady playing "Moonlight Senada" on the piano and suddenly playing a disturbing melody when she was under Dracula's spell was very strange. The transformation of Dr. Edleman into the character type "Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde" was also performed very well. <br /> <br /> And it's great to see Dracula, Frankenstein and the werewolf together, one "last" time. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
