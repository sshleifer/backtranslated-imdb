I love this movie, one of my favorites of all time. Ann Blythe as Sally O'Moyne is sweet and hassle free. She believes that praying to Santa Ana will solve all her problems and those of her friends. The secondary plot of the evil evil man to obtain the properties of his father is fun and intelligent. His brothers are the kind of brothers that any girl would love to have. Also, look for "Aunt Bee" as her mother, a strong Irish woman who will not leave her house where she brought her family. They do not do it that way anymore, that's for sure.
