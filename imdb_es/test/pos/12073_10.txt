I have nothing but praise for this film and the cast, especially Ann Margaret. But the most important thing is that I praise my in-laws who were (are) the adoptive parents of Warren and Frank in real life. I met most of the "kids" at Warren's wedding in 1989. This is an amazing story and it's even more amazing for me to get to know the family and what they all went through. It's also nice for me to see how they portrayed my in-laws in the film. It was quite accurate. My wife even enjoys seeing some small details like a toaster that she remembered from her childhood. Yes, it is a difficult movie to watch, but incredible and sincere. <br /> <br /> For me, the story of this story is the number of children who passed for my in-laws and, as a result of marrying my daughter, and having Warren as my brother-in-law, how many I have met in mine . For the past 20 years, this story has been part of my life because of what my mother-in-law has shared with me. That and knowing Warren. For what it's worth, Warren lives in California with his family. He married his high school sweetheart, with whom he reconnected at his high school reunion for 20 years. <br /> <br /> There was a show in the 1980s called "That's amazing". They had a family reunion that also met the cast of the show. <br /> <br /> For the interest of all, the DVD is available in Great Britain and Australia. It's a difficult video coming here in the United States and I still have not been able to find a DVD here.
