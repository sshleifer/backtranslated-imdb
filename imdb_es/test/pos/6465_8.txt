Even though this little movie was lost in the wake of On The Waterfront, Edge Of The City can certainly be sustained with that star-studded classic. It's another story about the docks and the code of silence that governs it. <br /> <br /> Alongside the corrupt union that Lee J. Cobb ran on On The Waterfront, Jack Warden is really a petty corruption. But he's real enough as the gang boss on one of the docks that intimidates the other workers by being skillful with his fists and the safety hook and receives the rest to kick some of his hard earned money. And everything is difficult to earn money in that job. <br /> <br /> One man that Warden can not intimidate is Sidney Poitier, another gang boss and when he tries to intimidate the newcomer John Cassavetes, Poitier takes him under his wing. The two develop quite the friendship and Poitier and his wife Ruby Dee even arrange Cassavetes with Kathleen Maguire. <br /> <br /> Warden is truly a disgusting creature and it is sad how, by sheer strength of personality and physical prowess, he almost cowards. all others in submission. In that sense, it's tougher than Lee J. Cobb, who had to rely on a collection of thugs to enforce his will at On The Waterfront. <br /> <br /> Edge Of The City marked the directorial debut on the big screen of Martin Ritt, who did a great job with a good cast of players based in New York and a place in location cinematography. The low budget of the movie does show, but you're so impressed with the cast that you really do not care. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes as the loner with a past and the hip and the tough Poitier are fine, but My personal favorite in this movie is Ruby Dee. He should have obtained some prize for his performance, his final scene with Cassavetes is exceptional. <br /> <br /> Get this if possible. I would like it to be on DVD or VHS.
