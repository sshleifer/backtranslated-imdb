Currently at the Australian Film Festival of Australia in 2007 http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm thanks to Peanutqueen and especially to AriesGemini for their summary of the actors of this cast . <br /> <br /> In Australia these films were subtitled in English and while French films here often get a general release, German films still have to gather that kind of commercial audience. But like the BMWs and Mercedes when the Germans do it well, I like their movies a lot. Like PQ, the time here was so fast, lots of laughter from the audience when each of the 9 men and 9 women moved down the line of speed dating 5 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> Although many films are too long, this One that could have seen much more of Had the type of characters and the development of the character for a series. Over time I will read the review of AriesGemini100 and I will refer to the actors that I liked and their other works with a view to keeping them attentive. I agree ... most of these actors will go to bigger and better things. Some very good character actors in this good movie. I saw it in the program listed as a mockumentary. Simulation or otherwise it felt very real. And quite romantic in its way. <br /> <br /> Live the Deutcsh!
