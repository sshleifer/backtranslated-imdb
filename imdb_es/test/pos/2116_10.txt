Everyone interested in Texas needs to have this DVD. It's just a good movie about the real Texas with great scenes. It took a lot of Texans to do this well. Hollywood would never have made it. There are so many subtle things that Tubb put into the movie and maybe he has not even thought about it, but he makes the show. <br /> <br /> The cameos of the guests do not look like cameos at all. Each star fits perfectly and does not distract from the film. Many of the guests' places mix so perfectly that when the credits come back, you'll come back through the movie to find the character. The Strait roll is underway, it could not have been done better in real life. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is completely different from the first, it's a bit "silly", but it's fine. . Somehow the plot works. "Hokey" is like a special program for after school, but it seems credible and natural. <br /> <br /> I have never heard anyone use the Sonny Pruitt line, apart from the places I grew up with. That was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Definitely a collectable, along with Pure Country, Sugarland Express, Jr. Bonner, Texasville, The Last Picture Show, Giant and, of course, Hud. <br /> <br /> Gig'em Aggies '86
