Three children are born during a solar eclipse and become vile murderers who are above suspicion, with the exception of Joyce (Lori Lethin) and her younger brother Timmy. That is the story in a few words. The performance in this is tolerable for the most part. Notable for MTV-J Julie Brown (not the "Downtown") showing some skin, and a very early part (small albiet) for Michael Dudikoff. It's not a great movie for any kind of imagination, but in the subgenre 'killer kids' it's a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Julie Brown shows T & A (the only film so far, to claim that honor); Sylvia Wright goes topless <br /> <br /> DVD Extras (R1): 16-minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg (where he insults the director AND Canada, great things); Biography of Ed Hunt; and trailers for "Kiss of the Taratula", "Do not open the Door", and a red band for "Homework" (that shows nudity) <br /> <br /> My rating: B-
