While watching a modern and worldly movie (The Runaway Bride) with my granddaughter (22 years old) he asked me: "Since you've been watching movies since 1938, what is the best movie of your life?" Boy! What a choice that is! It took me all summer thinking and re-invoking some movies before I made my decision. It is "THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES". This movie has no flaws. It is a film in which each of the secondary characters and dialogue is essential for the whole story. There is not a single part in the movie that can be left out. Fixing the young woman with the lack of hands of her brothers, the man who comes home to the young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrait of a young man whose only responsibility was like a fool who became in the leader of a Group of men, and was awarded medals for his action. A woman who must now adapt to the husband whose life has been away from her for years. The realization of the people who were in the safety of the homes assured of the sacrifices that these common men made in their name. The look to life to love and live with a man without hands. Parents first look and react to their child's new deformities. A man used to make life or death decisions in an instant, having to go back to the way of groping through the credit structure of a conservative bank. This is not an act of sympathy, tears, scratches of the heart. This was real life! It could not have been represented differently. This, my friends, is HOW I WAS! This could easily be considered a documentary. On this day of the film in color, do not go off with black and white because it is one of the best B / W filming, editing and direction you will ever see. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would make it mandatory for anyone who takes history, makes movies, writes creatively, sociology, family counseling or psychology to see and report on this magnificent example of the art of filmmakers.
