There is a common thread in the film comedy that all the great comics are not complying with the law or going to jail. Think of conman W.C.Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, or the Marx Brothers in A NIGHT IN THE OPERA, or Chaplin in THE ADVENTURER, by Mae West in SHE DONE HIM Long. The deviation of the law is inevitable, and when they finish on the side of the law, the results remain hostile between the forces of law and order and comics. Think of Lloyd on his first talkie, WELCOME DANGER, trying to "help" the San Francisco Police Department in the middle of a crime wave, and making police sergeant Edgar Kennedy want to kill him. Think of Laurel and Hardy as unhappy cops in MIDNIGHT PATROL. It seems to me that this kind of hostility is so obvious in the comedy of all these giants (and their peers) that even a fake title for a movie deals with that. Think of Jerry Seinfeld in an episode of his series creating a short of Three Stooges, SAPPY PAPPIES, where the guys end up being electrocuted for murder. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton tends to pull the forces of law and order to be His opponents in his comedies. Look at STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., Where he tries to get his father out of a dungeon. But in reality he had more conflicts from the police forces in his shorts. In CONVICT 13, he is dragged back to prison when he is mistaken for a convict who escaped. In COPS (perfect title: if you see it, you would understand) the police force of a big city is repeatedly looking for Keaton, confused with a terrorist). And in LA CABRA he can not avoid the police for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Keaton is a vagabond looking for food. But he is totally unfortunate. When he sees a stranger throw a lucky horseshoe (which Keaton ignored earlier) over his shoulder, and then find a wallet full of money, Keaton tries the same thing, and hits a cop in the head. The police pursues him, and Keaton (as luck has it) runs into another policeman, tries to act normally, but ends up throwing the other policeman on the path of the first. Soon he has three policemen chasing him. Shaking them briefly, he walks through a window in the local jail where the local killer "Dead Shot Dan" (Malcolm St. Clair *) is being photographed. When passing behind the barred windows, Keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight ahead. The desperate one notices this and crouches down when the photograph is taken. When Dead Shot runs away from the police, it's Keaton's face on all the wanted posters. <br /> <br /> (* St. Clair would eventually become a successful director of silent and early sound comedies, though in his last biography it would be a season at 20th Century Fox, where his work with Laurel & Hardy was less than par .) <br /> <br /> Keaton flees to another city by train (disconnecting the passenger cars containing his pursuers from the locomotive and the tender). This is the movie (by the way) that has two famous Keaton jokes. His arrival at the locomotive takes place in a distant plane, with a closer and closer approach, and suddenly the audience sees Keaton sitting in the cowcatcher. <br /> <br /> The second famous sequence goes later (and may have influenced Chaplin at the beginning of CITY LIGHTS). Keaton had accidentally hit a man who was arguing too violently with a pretty woman with a dog (Virginia Fox). When he sees that the poster calls him a murderer, he believes he killed the man. A suspicious police chief (Joe Roberts) is chasing him in this city, and momentarily loses Roberts in the park. A statue of "The man of war" is being built and the sculptor is discovering a clay model of the horse. Keaton is seen sitting on the clay model, trying to maintain his dignity while the clay legs of the horse begin to collapse under his weight. <br /> <br /> Keaton manages to meet with the beautiful Mrs. Fox, who invites him to dinner at his home. Only he does not realize that his father is Roberts. The last five minutes of the film are about Keaton running away and avoiding Roberts while he and Fox escape together. <br /> <br /> It's a fun comedy, and a wonderful example of Keaton's work at its best.
