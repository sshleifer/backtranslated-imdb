This DVD usually sells for around $ 20. I would not pay so much for the DVD if I had known what I was getting, but despite that, this is a pretty good record. It shows the Knot in all its splendor, with images of his concerts ... playing Surfacing, Wait and Bleed and Scissors, among other tracks, including the music video "Spit it Out", which apparently was banned on MTV. <br /> <br /> Slipknot, for those who do not know it, is essentially a symphony of the condemned: nine masked men who show total chaos on stage, with machine guns, guitars and voices that will tear your face and tear you apart. they will leave wanting more. For those who have never seen Slipknot before, I can not recommend it enough to get this DVD ... probably off eBay or Amazon, so I can get a better offer. <br /> <br /> A brief, though well-made sample of the knot. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten.
