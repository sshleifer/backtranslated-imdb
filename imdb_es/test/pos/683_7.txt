I saw him for the first time as a child (THE LITTLE RASCALS first appeared on television the year I was born) and recently I bought it on DVD. In between, I saw him on the occasions when he was on and I took careful notes on 1) the cake fight itself and 2) how racist some of these parts were: Farina as Nubian slave, doing voodoo, for example. I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if they had tried to do it now. <br /> <br /> Look at how the cake is fought in HALFWITS HALFWITS HALFWITS FROM THE THREE STOODES and IN THE SWEET FOOT AND FOOTS look like this ... and this movie came out a few years before its initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. Obviously there was some inspiration from THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY OF SS and Laurel & Hardy for these films ... remember, at that moment, they all stole the best, one from the other! <br /> <br /> One more note: the fans of Laurel and Hardy, that lady of the cake sales, was none other than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared in TBOTC, the 'fin' that entered her car and I put it in the back. Does it always escape me why it was never accredited?
