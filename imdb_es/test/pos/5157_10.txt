Minor Spoilers will follow. <br /> <br /> This movie is even stranger and unconventional than the "second floor songs". There is not a main character that we continue around. There is no "plot" in the conventional way. There is no emphasis on a happy ending. There is no crowd to please. In other words, Roy Andersson is back with a vengeance. Instead of resorting to the convention and the fixed formula, Roy Andersson concentrates his film around an idea. I'm not going to go into what that idea is, but even if you do not "understand" I promise you'll see the greatest visual depth ever seen in a movie. The majestic scenes of "songs" pale in comparison here. A work of visual splendor. <br /> <br /> So, be kind to your neighbor, because after all "we are the living", and only you and I have the power to change our lives. That is at least what I thought when I saw the final scene of the film, with the inhuman bombers' planes that glide over the city in the film to take our lives. <br /> <br /> And, of course, do not forget to watch this movie when it opens in a limited way near you. This is one of those movies that really have the power to make you a better person, like De Sica's "bicycle thieves". A very warm and humanistic film.
