Everything about "Choose Connor" was top = drawer, especially the script and the excellent work done by 21-year-old director, writer and producer Luke Eberl. . . A talented young man from whom to expect great things. All the action was credible, the dialogue intelligent, the important issue. I loved! <br /> <br /> I saw it at the Woodstock Film Festival in 2007, where it was screened twice and it went wildly to the public. It is more than a simple old film: this child learns a difficult and harrowing lesson about trust, politics and the "system": how things work to adapt to the personal agendas of those in important positions. <br /> <Br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone with a functional brain.
