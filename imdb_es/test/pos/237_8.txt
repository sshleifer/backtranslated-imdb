Another great musical of the Golden Age of Hollywood! I liked this movie story about a trio of friends who perform in a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its brilliance. Although it is not the big moment, they are very happy with their lives and with the small club where they perform. Gene Kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of her dancers, Rita Hayworth, who happens to get some attention when given the opportunity to be on the cover of a magazine. The problems begin for Gene Kelly, since his girlfriend is now the talk of the city. Phil Silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job. Of course there is music and dancing. Highlights a dance performance by Gene Kelly. He is walking down the street alone at night and sees his reflection in a shop window. His reflection soon begins to dance with him in the streets, great cinematography. Do not miss it, great entertainment.
