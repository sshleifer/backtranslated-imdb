Just before Dawn left during the golden days of the Slasher movie. The backwoods slasher practically started with movies like Friday the 13th, The Burning and Madman. Just before Dawn is one step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher movie. The cinematography is beautiful. The acting is first class. The heroine of the movie is not your typical 'final girl'. <br /> <br /> Constance is a 'forest' girl, but when it comes to the primal instinct of survival, she is one step behind. It is not until it is about saving the life of her and her boyfriend, the primal idea of ​​survival is activated. There is a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the hidden sexuality of the final girls, coinciding with their will to survive. <br /> <BR> Just Before Dawn is not for everyone, but for the slasher fan, it's the most perfect thing you can get. The murderer (s) are very threatening: almost as if it were a game to maim and kill anyone who crosses their territory. The final scene is a little out of place. For the viewer for the first time, it can be a bit shocking. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the backwoods slasher. Even non-slasher fans will find something they like about it. The environment is strange and makes you feel uncomfortable. The death sequences are not particularly bloody, but I'm not sure the movie was necessary. Look at it!
