The 08th MS team has two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict. Aina, the officer of Zeon, and Shiro, the new pilot of the Federal Forces, are in a battle in space, throughout the series of 12 episodes (and a "movie") the two debate their mutual love while They try to face them. The war that surrounds them. It has a Romeo and Juliet romance and an unbeatable animation. By far, one of the best to hit American Shores. Put on your clothes!
