Help that the characters on which this program is based are among the best that Disney has found. Writing is what this show really does. It is a total classic. Given, you need to appreciate the kind of humor to enjoy it, and this is hard to explain. The humor is similar to the scenarios of the old school of the 40s and 50s of Disney, with modern twists. It never degrades into fart jokes or anything of that kind. Nor is Adam Sandler's mood, although I liked that. It's exactly the same mood as the movie, it only expanded during the time that a television program allows. So, if you did not like it in the movie, you will not like it here, but the new rhythm of the IMO emperors was the best thing that came out of Disney from Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> A +
