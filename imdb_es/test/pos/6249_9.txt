One of the most bizarre, astonishingly strange and spooky horror films of the 70s, "Tourist Trap", even by the standards of "anything goes" loose, relentless, improvised from the convention of its time rates like a real rarity. However, the image is very strange: a strange atmosphere masterfully assembled of omnipresent supernatural fear that from the beginning registers as powerfully spooky and becomes increasingly opaque and frightening as the film progresses, offering a large number of shocks in medium Scattered moments of an incredibly charming dreamy elegance that ends in a bitter and crushingly nihilistic note with a disturbing final image that is difficult to shake, which makes it a unique and singularly disconcerting experience. <br /> <br /> Five Teenagers who travel by car through the desolate desert of California are irretrievably lost. They run into "The Lost Oasis of Slausen", a sordid and neglected road to the road that is a part of a service station, three parts of the wax museum, and all parts of the city. The solitary, seemingly harmless and harmless owner of the joint, Slausen (juicyly exaggerated with Chuck Conners' infamous hammy brio) turns out to be a deranged psychic killer with lethal telekinetic powers. Slausen brings to life his strange variety of mannequins uncomfortably human-like and chooses children one by one to add to his growing collection of victims. <br /> <br /> Director David ("Puppermaster" "The Arrival") Schmoeller skillfully squeezes every ounce of tension that can squeeze the pleasantly ambiguous and open script he co-wrote with J. Larry Carroll. (The stubborn refusal of such a script to provide some rational excuse for all the strange things that happen throughout the film, often mischaracterized as one of the main weaknesses of the film, is actually the key force of the film, that gives the image fear, anything and everything - it can happen, the common logic can be the damn quality of a real nightmare that has become a horrible life that would never have been achieved if there was some kind of credible explanation offered by what's happening.) Pino Donaggio's beautifully spooky and discreet note, Nicholas von Sternberg's cinematography in the shadow and Robert A. Burns' overcrowded production design add immensely to the deeply disturbing mood of the film. The excellent performances are another significant advantage, since the beautiful and cheerful Jocelyn Jones (Ellie-Jo Turner in "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase") is particularly good and pleasant as the most resistant and friendly of adolescents in danger of extinction. Even Tanya Roberts does well as an unfortunate girl who has a levitated knife in her head. Extraordinary and unusual, "Tourist Trap" is well worth visiting.
