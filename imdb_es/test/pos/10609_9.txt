I had no expectations (I never saw any progress for "Marigold") and I enjoyed the characters, the contemporary music and the sharp dance in this cheerful film. Even though 98% of the dialogue is in English (something very good for me), I want the DVD to have subtitles to help with some of the quick moments in which the character's accent may be difficult to understand. I would not judge this movie for Bollywood films, but only on its own merits as fun entertainment (a movie of musical people). <br /> <br /> I am hooked on Ali Larter as an actress (and her interviews in the Bonus Material indicate she is a good person). Since then I have seen this movie several times (it improves every time).
