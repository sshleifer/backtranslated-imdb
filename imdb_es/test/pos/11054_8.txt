This is a surprisingly well-adapted adaptation of the work of Eugene O'Neill. Its main drawback is a static camera, and as a result it appears most of the time that it is the filmed reproduction, which is a shame, since it is a good piece of creation of primitive films, made at a time when the sound presented all kinds of technical problems, and as a result, most of the films were experimental, whether that was the intention of its creator. Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films, and her entry is still classical. His voice is strangely deep, almost youthful, which only enhances his seductive and eccentric personality. As her boyfriend, Charles Bickford is appropriately manly, she was apparently born sheer, and a perfect complement to the divine Garbo. His Irish accent is not bad at all, and he seems to be always a man of natural sea, much like O'Neill in his independent and melancholy nature. As the (very) confused father of Garbo, George Marion seems truly from another era. He has the kind of face and voice, open, without manners, totally without deception, that has disappeared from the earth. Marie Dressler is also on the swing of O'Neill's things. His expression in white and intensity around the eyes says a lot, since he interprets his drunken character as a woman who sometimes rubs psychosis. Poetic license, perhaps, since this is not in the script, but we can forgive the excesses of Miss Dressler; She is too good not to do it. The story ends with a move to the next thing, other than the resolution, which is not the author's teacup; And those who like their carefully crafted films will ultimately be disappointed by the absence of a real surprise. In Anna Christie we are in the country of O'Neill, a place of sea, storms and mists, a feeling of omnipresent and condemnable uncertainty, which we would now call ambivilance or neurosis of anxiety. Instead of analyzing this state of mind, the author presents it in a simple and wise way, since the climate, the land, the ocean and people intertwine and direct each other in a unique language that seems privileged to have listened to.
