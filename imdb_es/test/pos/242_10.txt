I really like this movie because of all the stars and the dance and the story that goes with it. Rita Hayworth was in her greatest glamor in this musical and the costumes were beautiful. Although it was a musical, I thought that Rita Hayworth also made a good representation of the dramatic acting in this film. As for your dance, I think it was excellent. Even Betty Grable supported Rita's dancing a lot in this movie when she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dance and let's face it, Betty Grable was an excellent dancer. Also highlighted are cinematography and bright colors. Rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine, but she is also in love with her mentor played by Gene Kelly. Leave Kelly to fulfill her dream and elude Broadway love and stardom or stay to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever? You will have to see the movie to find out!
