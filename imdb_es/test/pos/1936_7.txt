This relic from before the days of the Production Code and the Hays Office is very funny, not very good but entertaining. <br /> <br /> Based on a song by Rogers & Hart that was a great success at that time, the story revolves around the dancer Barbara Stanwyck, who has an affair with the wealthy businessman Ricardo Cortez (who he was indecently handsome), but whose heart belongs to his neighbor Bookroe, Monroe Owsley. She and Owsley get married, but keep the secret, while she fired Cortez, who still has hope. She helps her husband get a job in Cortez's company, but conjugal happiness becomes bitter as Owsley acquires a taste for the good life and leaves with a boyfriend of the university and plays on the bridge of the high bets (Yes! ..). Finally, embezzle $ 5,000 from Cortez, and he's about to go to the trash, when his devoted wife goes to Cortes ... and I will not reveal anything else, although the ending was certainly a surprise. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the best of this movie; in one of his first roles he has achieved a lot. Owsley is the weak point; He is unattractive and grumpy, while Cortez is incredibly soft and sexy, while his performance is serious but nothing remarkable. <br /> <br /> Although it is apparently a drama, it is full of laughter, many unnoticed, since some elements of this film have aged a lot. wrong. But there are many good ingenious lines; In a moment, Stanwyck says to Cortez: "I have the brain in my feet, while yours is in ..." That is very suggestive for 1931! There are a lot of obscene and suggestive things in this movie, in the last days, before the Code was closed and whitening everything. A fun antiquity, a good reminder of how far we have come in 70 years ... this story could easily be modified to fit 2003, but it could keep the basic plot, with the original ending, in place.
