It is the best film released in Bollywood to date. The best comedy, the best performance and the best direction so far! The writing and direction of Rajkumar Santoshi proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry. Aamir Khan was absolutely amazing, Salman Khan looked good as he acted. Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdeep acted as usual! This comedy is still copied by people and no other writer and director has been able to do this again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi has not been able to make this cult classic again! This movie was a failure when it was released, but it has been a cult classic since it was launched and loved by all kinds of people. <br /> <br /> STAR. <br /> <br /> ACTING 10/10. <br /> <br /> DIALOGUES 10/10. <br /> <br /> SCREEN 10/10. <br /> <br /> ADDRESS 10/10. <br /> <br /> MUSIC 9/10. <br /> <br /> LETTERS 9/10. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is highly recommended. If you have not seen it until now, you have missed something big! It's an uproar of laughter and the best comedy I've seen to date! Classic movies like Hera Pheri, Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro are not half as funny as this.
