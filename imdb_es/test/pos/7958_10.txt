Palwol ui Christmas is very Korean, if you've been to Korea or have Korean friends, you should know what I mean. Koreans are very traditional people, they see love very quietly. A kind of feeling that you do not find in today's world. I think that's why this movie is so special. It is a mistake to compare this film with Shunji Iwai's "Love Letter", the Japanese are very good, but they could never make one like Palwol ui Christmas. If you have the opportunity, please watch this movie for yourself.
