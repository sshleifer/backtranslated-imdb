I have seen the beginning of the movie Muppet, but only half. Because I only saw him in the house of Mrs. Kelly's friend. The songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious. They learn that if they believe in the end of the rainbow, anyone can do it, no matter how small, no matter how green (which was included in the trailer). <br /> <br /> Kermit is my favorite protagonist (which means he describes the main character) and so are the other Muppets. Mel Brooks was amazing when he played Professor Max Krassman. The scene where Miss Piggy saves Kermit doing Kung Fu on those guys. It was great. <br /> <br /> The movie Muppet is Jim Henson's best movie with the most hilarious characters and people will appreciate his hit movie.
