This thriller has so many twists and turns that it had me on the edge of my seat. I saw it on video, part of the landscape in "the lantern" could have been a little more spectacular on the big screen. The cast has Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin (from "The Truth About Cats & Dogs"), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker in "Dawson's Creek") and Ryan Gosling (???).
