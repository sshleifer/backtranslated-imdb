Unlike the previous poster, I liked the celluloid treatment. It looked good, and made the movie so much more enjoyable to watch. For me, it did not affect at all the power of the content of the documentary. In fact, I felt that the elegance of the look allowed me to lose much more in the content. The previous poster was just to compare the style with a Nike commercial; It definitely has that look. But for my taste, it worked very well (and I'm far from being a fan of Nike commercials). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the way the documentary should be made. I can not wait to see the upcoming installments of these promising filmmakers.
