In any case, William Girdler was an opportunist who wanted a part of the action with respect to what was popular at the time. I mean, a blaxploitation movie in Louisville, Kentucky ... Who would think?!?! I can only imagine the enthusiasm he should have had with Pam Grier, a pretty good article, to star in his photo. If you're quite familiar with the genre, Girdler's Sheba, Baby does not necessarily stray too far from the formula. Despite a change of venue, the film is still about a ruthless businessman nicknamed Shark who is engaged in lending companies, and uses henchmen to threaten them in order to obtain their signatures. <br /> <br /> Grier is Sheba Shayne, a former Louisville police officer who works in Chicago and returns home at the request of her father's partner, Brick (Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13). Sheba's father, despite Shark's harassment tactics (... his man in the city is Pilot, an aspiring gangster, equipped with henchmen who are not so threatening, rather of a foolish nature, so thin that they hire assassins to get out of the city to shoot the Shayne Loan building), he will not give up his company, and this eventually costs him his life when a warning through the use of brute force, leads to his death. Sheba will take revenge on all those responsible for the death of his father. In other words, Shark's ass is grass ... can you dig? <br /> <br /> Seeing Grier with a magnum is enough to sell this particular movie, the novelty of the Louisville stage is part of the package. You can even see a chase in a speedboat, Grier in gunfights with gangsters (not necessarily the most polished type that one might be used to seeing in Chicago or New York during this period of blaxploitation), a lot of blood sprouting from bullets bodies smashed by gunfire, and colorful characters (like a money shark lender in pimp's clothing named Walker and Pilot, who is one of the least fearsome mobsters you're likely to see) who appear during the movie, most having the misfortune of coming into contact with a very angry Sheba. The plot itself is nothing special, but Grier is always worth seeing, and Girdler organizes many action sequences to keep his target audience entertained. A modest success for Girdler, and one of his most accomplished films.
