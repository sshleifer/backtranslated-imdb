Directed by Jacques Tourneur (Cat People, Out of the Past, Night of the Demon) and written by Phillip Dunne (How Green was My Valley), Anne of the Indies is a very interesting adventure pirate movie. Its main character of Captain Anne Providence is based on a true pirate woman, Anne Boney, who really lived and sailed the 18th century Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the naval battle where the pirate ship of Anne (Jean Peters) attacks a commercial ship that was heading to Europe from South America. As a result, a treasure of great value is captured along with the handsome French officer Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan), who is taken prisoner. Anne ends up falling in love with him and, apparently, his feelings are reciprocal, but it is only until he releases him when he discovers that he has a beautiful young wife, Molly (Debra Paget), of whom he is quite enamored. Anne begins to plan the revenge of both, but in an unexpected turn of destiny ends up making a great sacrifice to save them. The figure of the cliché of the pirate film 'Black Beard' also makes its appearance here, this time played by Thomas Gomez. <br /> <br /> Although Anne of the Indies probably seems to be nothing more than a review of the clichéd pirate movie, it still has its classic moments in beautiful images and sequences of sea battles filmed in Technicolor, as well as in some aspects of History and, above all, in personal touches when directing all this by Jacques Tourneur. 7/10
