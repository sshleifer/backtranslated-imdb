Apart from the nightclub scenes that personify the sixties (especially with the dances of the instrumental versions of Monkees' hits), I am surprised at how good this lighthouse farce is held 37 years later, but in fact it does thanks to the sucker execution of its deception based argument and the acute interaction of the three drivers. Directed by the fearsome screen phase expert Gene Saks, this 1969 comedy is about Julian Winston, a successful Manhattan dentist and confirmed bachelor, who claims to be married to avoid long-term commitment to his young one-year-old girlfriend . Toni In response to Toni's half-suicide attempt, Julian agrees to marry her, but Toni first insists on reuniting with his wife to ease his conscience. Enter Julian's devoted nurse, Stephanie, to play the wife, and the inevitable complications stem from the white lies becoming large whoppers that lead to alleged links and uncoupling. Deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic style, but he lets his two co-stars go with the image. In her big screen debut, Goldie Hawn, 24 years old and pixyish, still retains her smiling "Laugh-In" character, but offers an unexpected experience and depth like Toni. She and Matthau have a great unforced chemistry in their scenes together. Screen legend Ingrid Bergman, still serenely majestic at age 54, obviously has a game of Stephanie playing, initially starched and witty but blooming in a liberated spirit as the story evolves. I especially like how casual it looks after his nighttime romp. There's a good job of supporting Rick Lenz as Toni's bohemian neighbor, Igor, and Jack Weston, as Julian's handsome actor, Harvey. The long-time collaborator of Billy Wilder, I.A.L. Diamond, provides the brilliant script and opens the story beyond its origins in scenarios for Saks, who is not the most cinematic director. Apart from a couple of trailers, there are no significant extras with the DVD.
