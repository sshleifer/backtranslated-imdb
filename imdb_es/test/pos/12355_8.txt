Sheba Baby, is another Pam Grier Blaxploitation movie. It was one of Pam's less visceral films of this genre. Pam plays Sheba Shane, who is a Chicago gumshoe. Sheba's father owns a small loan company in Missouri. When the local mobsters try to direct their business father, Sheba chases the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier had already made her mark in the Blaxploitation films, by the time Sheba Baby arrived. Fans of both Coffy and Foxy Brown know that Pam is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress. In Sheba Baby, the fierce performance that viewers expected from Pam was not so evident in this movie. Not that Pam does not kick to the top of Sheba Baby. She is not as good as a train watcher out of control, as she was in her previous Blaxploitation films. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast in this movie is a different disappointment. So Sheba Baby is Pam's movie, until the end. And even though Pam is a bit more subdued than in her other films, she still has a convincing performance in Sheba Baby. This movie is definitely worth it, if you're a Pam Grier fan.
