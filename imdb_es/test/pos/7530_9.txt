I just watched this movie, and I must say it surprised me. It was very well done, with good acting and a deep look at the high school students of Japan, in the love of teenagers. <br /> <br /> The appearance is very different from many movies, and you can easily access them. the movie. Much of the emphasis seems to be on the story itself, which is extremely subtle. The main theme and the relationships with other characters are a bit complex. But the general sense of realism and dimensions still attracts him. <br /> <br /> A main disadvantage is, of course, to those who like something simple. What is not here You have to be open to many things, including a new culture, to be able to participate more in the film. <br /> <br /> Even though I enjoyed this movie. Worth seeing.
