I really do not know what Dirty Dancing is about ... there's some kind of absolute magic in this movie ... I can not count the hundreds (yes, hundreds) of times I've seen it, from start to finish ... But every Once I find it on TV, I feel fascinated and bewildered and I feel and for two hours I am loving the movie as if I was watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray hated each other during the filming of this film, they have a beautiful chemistry on the set ... it makes the viewer enjoy it much more, to see this passion and commitment ... and I can not. It helps to break a bit at the end, when Patrick approaches Houseman's family and says to his dad: "Nobody puts Baby in a corner". (classic moment) For all those people who believe that this movie is corny and silly, maybe it is somehow, but it was the peninsula of the movies of the 80s, and put Patrick Swayze on the map; His performance was immaculate. <br /> <br /> Three cheers for Dirty Dancing !! <br /> <br /> Ps- The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece
