Actually, I was about 13 years old camping near the McCloud River, near Shasta when this movie was being filmed. My family was paid to leave our camp in the afternoon, when they filmed Vincent floating downstream. A small trivial ... the scene in which they took it out, it was actually where it started to float downstream. And if the double could not reach the net, there was a 20 foot waterfall approximately 1/4 mile below. <br /> <br /> Anyway ... I saw it at that moment, and I did not understand it. It was not until years later when I saw the film and really understood the meaning of it. It's a pretty powerful movie and certainly a good job for Jan at such an early age. His film career never took off as expected, but, of course, he later found success on television. I would like this movie to be available, because I would love to see it again.
