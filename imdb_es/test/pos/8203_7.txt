When "The Net" was announced for the first time, the ads seemed ridiculous. Then, when I saw it, it was actually pretty good. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) spends her days working on the computer and has never met her neighbors. Then, through a series of events, her identity is erased by a clique of people in the shadows, and she can not prove that she exists. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the movie are a bit exaggerated; You would probably know what parts if you saw the movie. However, it is a good look at what the existence of the Internet may have produced in trusted people. I recommend it.
