I saw this on a screening test in Chatsworth about a week ago, and I went with a group of my friends. We all really love him very much. James Franco is amazing and very hot, I would see him only for him !!!!!!! but Sienna Miller is also very good and plays a southern girl who is in love with him so much that she can not let him go. David Caradine, who was in Kill Bill, plays a cowboy and is perfect for that. The story is strange, but if you believe in the power of love and magical things, you will love it! It's really original, and it's also very funny and everyone laughed a lot, but in the end it got more serious and we all ended up crying. I'm going to see him again with my friends as soon as he comes out, it's really good!
