Soul Calibur has always been my favorite series of fighting games of all time. And SCIII is my favorite of the series. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very well done. It improves much bigger than the intercut polygons in Soul Edge / Soul Blade. The characters have facial expressions, blows of hair in the breeze and even blink. <br /> <br /> Soul Calibur has always been known for its interesting graphics and characters, and SCIII is no exception. Each character has a background story that is detailed and well done. My favorite character is Chai Xianghua. She's cute, she's funny and she's a strong female character. Yes, I know she gets pink and has a boyfriend (whom she ends up saving by the way), but there seems to be more to her than that. Xianghua, like all other characters, has flaws and advantages in their personalities, so that no character is perfect, not even the good ones. <br /> <br /> The music is beautifully composed for a series of fighting games. It does not sound kitchy (the Vampire series) nor does it sound like the soundtrack of an old-school porn movie (Mortal Kombat). The characters have their own themes and many of them are made to fit the culture of that part of the world. I do not think there's a song on this soundtrack that I do not like. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about this game is to create your own anime-like character (Create a Soul). You could make it look so cute or sexy or even ugly if you want it. However, if you find a character customization that you like, remember to take notes or you will not remember how you created that character. I found myself very addicted to CaS. <br /> <br /> In general, I think Soul Calibur is my number one fight series of all time. It has everything I asked for. What else can I want?
