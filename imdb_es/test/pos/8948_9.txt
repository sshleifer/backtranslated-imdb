I saw it in a preview and it seems that it was not released in the USA. UU However, it was one of the most enjoyable comedies. It's about the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small British town. The plot [of the film] is a bit out of control in the third act, but the characters are very nice and memorable. <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent in all areas. Surely it is overlooked in the crisis of blockbusters, this is a movie worth watching. I know I will try to capture this again in theaters and / or buy the video.
