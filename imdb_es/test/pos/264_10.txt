I rented this at my location because it was the only new British movie available this week. I have never heard of the filmmaker or his other films (thanks IMDB). It was about time someone did a good British comedy that was not the main character of Hugh Grant or forty-something. The story is a tale of morality but never preaches, completely enjoyable of a young and fresh face cast. Luke Goss's cameo was surprisingly good, but then he surprised me with his excellent performance on 'Blade'. I loved the color classification, especially in the sequences of nightclubs. Good music and a truly original voice at work here. Nine out of ten and well worth the rent.
