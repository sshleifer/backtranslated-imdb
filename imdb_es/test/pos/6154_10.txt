This is the movie that finally pushed me to enroll in IMDb so I could vote (and comment). I've recently come to appreciate well-produced "war" movies, and this is one of the most thoughtful I've seen. <br /> <br /> "Impressive" is the word that comes to mind when I think about this visual experience. My husband and I watched this movie last night for the first time. It moves smoothly, but at the same time it is exciting (it is not a contradiction). This story in the hands of Hollywood could have become a small, elegant, wasted, time-wasting action of Top Gun. <br /> <br /> The two main actors who play Frantisek and Karel are excellent from each other; and Krystof Hadek is a very "pretty" child without seeming to exaggerate or exploit that fact. As for Hadek's acting ability and appearance, my husband said (jokingly): "Well, it's not Tom Cruise." I answered: "Thank God!" If you like the beautiful and discreet performance, look at this one.
