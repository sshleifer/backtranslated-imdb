At a time when Hollywood thinks that stronger, faster and bloodier is better, Manna From Heaven is comical and moving, something we all have thought about: what would you do if a lot of money fell from the sky? <Br /> <br /> Interestingly, the characters took many years to realize that money had not made a single difference in their lives. Everyone becomes what they were meant to be. Unfortunately, in most cases, they became unhappy, despite their good fortune so many years ago. <br /> <br /> While Manna offers Hollywood's family history of good versus evil, or in the case, generosity vs. Greed, what sets this film apart is that Good triumphs by turning Evil, not crushing it. <br /> <br /> I think the important message of this movie is that you can change the world ... even if you do it one person at a time
