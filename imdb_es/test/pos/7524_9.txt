This short, a formative caricature with Pepe Le Pew, refers to a cat that thinks it will solve all its problems pretending to be a skunk. The problem is that it attracts the most unpleasant attention of an honest and, to put it in truth, that Cat Cat (our hero, Pepe, entering the left) is decidedly more attentive. Every great plan has its drawbacks, but this is a corker! I wonder if Jack Warner received a call from Hays's office about the fact that Pepe and the object of his worship were men. After all, Betty Boop was partly responsible for the existence of the Production Code. The later "conquests" were clearly and definitely feminine. Very good caricature, but Pepe is a character who works better as a focal point, instead of supporting. Well worth seeing. Recommended.
