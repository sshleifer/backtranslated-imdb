Wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining Wrestlemania, if not a totally successful one. The Ultimate Challenge, of course, is worth the price of admission alone, but once again, as with many of the early Mania, there is too much filling in between. The crowd appears for almost everything, and as always, gives us the reliable ad team of Gorilla & The Body. Having a face-to-face match as the main event for a Wrestlemania was absolutely unknown at this time, it only made things much more tense. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Koko B. Ware / W Frankie Vs "The Model" Rick Martel. For a game of 3 or more minutes, this is the best that can be achieved. I wish it were a little more, but what I got was pretty good. Martel wins, with the Boston Crab. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Tag Team Championship. Demolition Vs Colossal connection | C | / W Bobby Heean. Huge Pop for Demolition. The match itself is pretty boring, I often had trouble paying attention. Andre really did not do much, so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1. Here is a solid talent, and it's a shame they can not produce better. The demolition wins those titles, with Pattened's maneuver out of the top. Crowd blows the roof for finishing. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Earthquake / W Jimmy Hart. Vs Hercules I got what I expected here, a standard boring fill fight, with Earthquake doing his thing. I'm not really a fan of either, so it did not really interest me. Quake wins with his splash. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Brutus Beefcake Vs Mr.Pefect / W The Genius. Deafening pop for Bruti. Very good match, unfortunately there has not been enough time to develop further. It really kept my interest, and it's still one of my favorites on the card. Beefcake wins with a sling to the post, much to the approval of the public. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper Vs Bad News Brown. Huge pop for Piper. Nothing more than a boring fight, he does not know what he wants to be. Some entertaining pranks of The Hot Rod, but nothing more. It should be noted that Roddy painted himself half black and called himself "Hot Scott". <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation Vs The Bolsheviks. It breaks record, but apart from that, there is nothing to see here. Harts wins with, The Hart Attack. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The BÃ¡rbaro / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Tito Santana. Average for the time it arrived, but still can be seen. The crowd was quite dead for it, except for Heenan's interference. The hilarious cracks of Jessie, about Tito's food is more entertaining, then the match itself. Barbarian wins with an unpleasant clothesline that flies from the top. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed Tag Match. Dusty & Sapphire / W Elizabeth. Vs Macho King and Sherri. Big pop for Dusty, and an even bigger one for Elizabeth, who looks absolutely awesome, I might add. I thought it was fine. It was animated, at least, if nothing so great. I'm not a fan of Dusty. Dusty and Sapphire win, when Ella rolls Sherri. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> The Orient Express / W Fuji. Vs The Rockers. The crowd is quite anemic for this, surprisingly. Decent without a doubt, but with these guys involved, it should have been better. The constant focus with Fuji, takes something away from the game. Express wins for granted, when Janetty is nailed with salt. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Jim Duggan against Dino Bravo / W Earthquake & Jimmy Hart. Duggan like an idiot, take out the American flag in Canada. Duggan also has some solid benefits, but that may also be due to the Canadian heritage of Bravo. Regardless, I do not care about Duggan, but that's not why it stinks. Too short at the end, to really matter. Duggan wins when he hits Bravo on the back, with two for four. Duggan is splashed by his problems. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Million Dollar Championship. Ted Dibiase | C | / W Virgil. Vs Jake Robers / W Damien. Some slow points, but when everything was said and done, I had a good time. Two solid fighters who gave everything, resulted in an entertaining confrontation. However, the crowd remarkably attracts Ancy during parts of her, making the wave. Dibiase wins in cash. Jake has the last laugh, giving away some of his money, much to the delight of the crowd. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Big Bossman Vs Akeem / W Slick. Good pop for The Bossman. Too routine, and too short to really mean anything, in the end. Akeem was a trick, I never liked it too much. Bossman wins with his hit. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The segment of Rhythm & Blues was almost a failure. The crowd was not interested in this. <br /> <br /> Rick Rude / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Jimmy Snuka. For a filler match, before the main event, this was not too bad. If I had had time to go more, it would have been excellent, sure. Rude wins, with the Rude Awakening. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Title by title. Ultimate Warrior | IC Champ | Vs Hulk Hogan | WWF Champion | This has to do with the atmosphere of the crowd, and the reaction of the divided crowd, for the most part. Warrior got a pretty decent pop, but in my opinion it was a bit disappointing. Hogan dwarfs him completely, with his. It is one of the best Wrestlemania games in history. With two people, who are not really known for their wrestling, they managed to create an incredible combination that was talked about for years. I have seen this many times, and my level of respect increases for each one, for their effort, considering that I am not a fan of either of them. Even uncompromising fans who crave pure wrestling can not complain about this! Guerrero wins with his splash. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entrance, but nothing special. It's memorable for the main event, the location and the crowd, but it's not one of the best if you ask me. Having said that, I enjoy it and recommend it to other wrestling fans. <br /> <br /> 7/10
