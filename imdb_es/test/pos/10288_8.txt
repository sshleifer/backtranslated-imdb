All the merit of the writer / director Gilles Mimouni, who created this sinuous and twisted tale of deceit and betrayal. While maintaining maximum control, it keeps the public at a distance, without allowing them to become fully aware of what is happening. Even its intelligent outcome makes you guess. <br /> <br /> The three central performances are also first class, with Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci doing their best to add to the mystery. Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey complements the strength in his supporting role. Giving details of the plot or details of the characters would not be fair. <br /> <br /> Thierry Arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma, and the Cardine Biggerstaff edition keeps the story one step ahead. The theme of Peter Chase is sublime in his marriage to the ideal of the script. <br /> <br /> Many may say that Gilles Mimouni is trying to confront several deeper problems about those of love. For me this is simply a disturbing and elusive enigma that weaves a fascinating network. Only the French are capable of such a temptation. Hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Monday, March 2, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon <br /> <br /> Nobody does a thriller like French. When they do it well, they really do it well. <br /> <br /> Vincent Cassell is intriguing as the deceptive Max, Romane Bohringer obsessed as the new Lisa, and Monica Bellucci is mysterious as the first Lisa. The plot of Gilles Mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deceptions and fatally crossed cables. <br /> <br /> All the credit must go to his manipulation of the intelligent plot, and the actions of the three drivers. Like Lucien, Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video
