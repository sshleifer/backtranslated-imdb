OK ... time for a bit of ranting, I think. It's been 2 years since I submitted my original comments praising this best-rated comedy ... and the damn thing has not yet reached a video or DVD (or has even been repeated on TV!)! !! <br /> <br /> Does anyone know why not? Has there been an error in the style of the BBC by which the original copy has been deleted / lost / deleted? <br /> <br /> Listen a lot in charge of the ITV: add this to the DVD now! Do you realize how much fun this program was? It makes "Mike Bassett" look as bad as the current Spurs team in pants. <br /> <br /> Rant over. For the moment.
