I still remember seeing Satya for the first time. I was completely impressed. Here was a movie that was very different from the other Gangster movies I had seen. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so credible. Despite the fact that "Company" (which was a very good effort) and "Vaastav" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) that approached, no film from the underworld could be up to Satya. <br /> <br /> When I looked at Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself "The Indian cops have their own 'Satya' now." Nietzsche's quote at the beginning itself tells him that this is not an ordinary movie. What surprises you about the "encounter" at the beginning of the film is the relaxed way in which it takes place. There is a cold and frightening feeling because you realize that it is part of your routine. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop, but of a policeman who is ready. to do what is necessary to get rid of criminals when all legal means are exhausted. With simple shots and camera angles, director Shimit Amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough to the film. The edition seems not to exist and therefore is effective. The music is also impressive and disturbing, and it stays with you long after you leave the movie theater. <br /> <br /> But for me, what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative performance of each and every one of the characters. . Sandeep Srivastava has done a brilliant job as a dialogue writer. If I start listing my favorite dialogues, I'm afraid I'll end up rewriting the whole script of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film boasts of some stellar performances. Yashpal Sharma is detestable as Sub-Inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and so is Jeeva as Joint Commissioner Suchak. Revathi, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles that they play to perfection. Nakul Vaid as the rookie Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene where you have to shoot the wounded gangster hesitantly? Oh my God! Learn under the tutelage of Sadhu Aghashe and firmly believe in him. <br /> <br /> Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is awesome. His conversations with Sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing. Never before, in Indian cinema, has a movie brought out such a beautiful relationship between a policeman and a gangster. <br /> <br /> It's not like I was not a fan of Nana Patekar before this movie, but this movie took me from a fan to a devotee. Nana, like Inspector Sadhu Agashe, offers the performance of a lifetime and one of the best I've seen in Hindi cinema. Because of the way he talks to his expressions, the way he hits his cigarette and drinks his tea? It's almost as if Nana could not do anything wrong. He is at his best in every scene, especially when he is teaching Jatin how the police force works. His cold and composed way of doing things is sometimes scary. His dialogue and body language convinced me that he is one of the best actors in the country. It is a pity that I have not won any popular prize for this one. <br /> <br /> Finally, but by no means, Shimit Amin does a brilliant job of bringing all these talents together and exploiting them to the fullest for Up with a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry that is sickly used to raising stories here and there, Amin takes an original script and gives it life with a beautiful treatment. I just hope he continues with the great work and does not surrender to Bollywood-isation! If he can do that, I am sure he will be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years.
