Seeing Laurel without Hardy in a movie seems strange, but at the same time it's entertaining. It is a well-made parody of what became a classic silent film and shows very well the talents of Stan. While his photos with Oliver Hardy were great, these first solo efforts give him an idea of ​​how skilled he was in his craft and how great it could have been if he had continued in the tradition of Keaton and Chaplin as an individual star for his account. The dance sequence with his real-life wife in the coffee scene is the best part of the picture, and he has some very funny snippets to accompany Laurel's excellent dance steps. And the highlight of the bullfight is a gem, since even the bull takes a pratfall. And I like the irony in the scene where he is buried in hats and appears with his well-known hat Laurel and Hardy. As much as I love the team of Laurel and Hardy and feel that there was never a more funny comedy duo on the screen during its heyday, it's good to see them on their own from time to time (check out THE FIGHTING KENTUCKIAN that Hardy did with the Duke as another good example.)
