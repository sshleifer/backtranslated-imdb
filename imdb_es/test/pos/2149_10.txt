I saw this movie in Santa Monica on August 23 and it has stayed with me. I want to thank the filmmakers for delving into the details of Harry's enigmatic and eccentric life. And also for showing the flaws and failures of Nilsson the man. Thank you for showing the good and the bad, the ups and downs and for discovering that amazing video from the BBC. The film is also a great showcase for a lot of music by Nilsson, very well placed throughout the film. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries, especially if you're interested in Harry Nilsson or the music scene of the early 70's. A critic of the website Is not It Cool wrote that this was the best movie they saw in the Film Festival of Santa Barbara, and I believe it. The film is informative, funny, sad, moving and full of incredible music. It is successful at all levels. Really very good.
