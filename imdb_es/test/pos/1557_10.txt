"What Alice Found" is the best movie anyone has ever heard of. I underestimated it when I found out, and I thought it would be all sex, no plot, and really stupid, but in reality, it was really good. They say that all independent movies suck, but this one, and "Napoleon Dynamite" does not stink. I asked my friend, who had seen it before me, and she said that Alice has all three ways, and that you see all this nudity, but no, there are no three ways that I remember, and little nakedness. The movie had a point, and it taught me to never trust the hitchhikers. In the end I liked it, they gave Alice a little dolphin. In the end, I walk to Flordia. I totally suggest watching this movie.
