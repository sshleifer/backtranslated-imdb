The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner' that went on the air was at least to the beginning with most episodes of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' and had me in "My Maisonette". I hope I continue the good work of 'faux terrible' on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new generation of "alternative comedy" (I hate this phrase, but I'm too lazy, think of another one.) Comedians on television today. I'm glad that on a trip from local DVD retailers today. "The dark place of Garth Marenghi" sold out in all areas. Even for his brief stint with Nathan Barley, I knew that Ayoade was a serious talent and I'm sure he would have been as good as Dixon Bainbridge in 'The Mighty Boosh' for continued success! In line with these programs, I also felt that it was necessary to extend my review to ensure a place in this public domain.
