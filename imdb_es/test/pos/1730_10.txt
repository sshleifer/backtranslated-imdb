I saw all the doctors that the episodes I played at my local PBS station while I was growing up ((I was introduced to the doctor by John Pertwee), as well as the "camera copies" of the doctor that UK fans sent to the United States. I had a great time with the program, but it never seemed to be taken seriously, I mean as seriously as a science fiction program about a time traveler, I went to the NOCs, I did the costumes a bit (the doctor # 5,6 and Tegan were my costume characters), I loved it, then everything stopped suddenly.The program's policy and the lack of interest and financing converted the doctor who became a 25-year-old senior who went into the spirit. <br /> <br /> When I heard that the science fiction channel had caught the new doctor, my first thought was "Great, now my 11-year-old son can see what I've been babbling about all these years, and know what the hell is a TARDIS "(I have several phone booths and TARDAS of various sizes in the house) I did not Do not expect the excellent quality of the story, the development of the character and f / x. I must say the least - pleased. For the first time, I found a doctor who was not an uproar, a clown, a fop, a hollow head, a kitten or an idiot. Christopher Eccleston is by far the most credible doctor to date. Now, now, relax the fans of Tom Baker! Do not get me wrong, I loved almost all the doctors and their quirks, but Christopher gave something to the doctor he had never had before: true credibility. I'm just sad that he's decided against another season. I'll try David Tennant as I would any other doctor, but now the level has gone up ... <br /> <br /> the bad rules of the wolves !!!!! <br /> <br /> update of 2008 - I love David Tennant! Your "mod" person is something my generation remembers, my son's generation can deal with, and gestapo fashion can relax! He's a little more human than Christopher, but not as human as other doctors before him. I miss Rose, I dig Martha, and what did they think with a noble donna? It is still the best television tour.
