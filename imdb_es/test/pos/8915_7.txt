Why do I give this 1974 porn movie 7 points? Because I saw it. And I found it hilarious! The aliens, their strange spaceship, their strange helmets ... My God, that was quite a spectacle. And all these desperate alien women need is the semen of the earth. <br /> <br /> And where are you looking for it? In Upper Bavaria, Germany. And that's where the main fun comes from: in Europe (and more in German-speaking countries), Bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region. And then the actors are so helpless with the alien women. Well, there have been films about people who can not deal with women like the "American Pie" series. <br /> <br /> But what this film achieved is a real and funny rarity. You constantly wonder how these ideas came about. But it was in 1974, and looking back 35 years filled one with a kind of nostalgia. You have never seen a movie like that. <br /> <br /> And if you do not mind seeing the occasional pubic hair and breasts, look at them once. It's essentially a comedy, not a porn movie.
