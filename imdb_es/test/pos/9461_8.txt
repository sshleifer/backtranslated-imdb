I think it would be better for a person to read or see (I prefer to read) "Twelfth night" before seeing or seeing again "She is the man". The movie is good by itself, but comparing the two, and looking for the jokes makes it much more fun. Shakespeare was inspired by others. I think he gave his approval. <br /> <br /> Harld Bloom said in "Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human Being", that most people in "Twelfth Night" need to be locked up. Malvolio, the person Malcolm is based on, does not have a good reason. The people in "She's The Man" are healthy in contrast. For example, Duke Orsino is much taller than the Duke of Orsino. It also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay. It shows a lot of self-control. <br /> <br /> It's a teen comedy (a clean one), so it does not have the dark edges of the play. For example, Olivia in the work is mourning the death of her brother. In the movie, she has been abandoned. <br /> <br /> If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the play, they do not have the same attention in the movie. <br /> <br /> The jokes are often fast. The surname of the hairdresser Pauls is given once. It's Antonio Many people who have read the work say that Antonio has more love for a man than friendship. In those days there was a deep love among men. Some see their sexual side: homosexuality is illegal. <br /> <br /> The only line of the work that I caught is where Duke Orsino cites the coach about greatness during the game of soccar. In the work, it is said by Malvolio, citing Maria).
