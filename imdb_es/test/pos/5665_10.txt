Giorgino is a long and unbearable journey from bad to worse in the life of the protagonist who gives his name to the film. The young lieutenant of very delicate health, demobilized and poisoned by gas, of very delicate state of health, who previously was a doctor in an orphanage for children with some mental deficiencies, looks for his new location and finds much more than what he never wanted. A different nature Depressive atmosphere of utmost despair, where the insane are much less horrible than the healthy, where madness is a kind of poetry, will keep you hypnotized from the first frames of this film to the last. And all the beauty: the beauty of winter and the mountains, the beauty of the snowy landscapes and the wild forests, I do not even know how all the sadness and sadness of the last days of war could be so beautiful.
