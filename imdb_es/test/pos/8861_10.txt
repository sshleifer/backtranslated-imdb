Many people have a movie that they consider their favorite movie. My movie will always be John Carpenter's Thing. The main reason why this movie is a cult movie is perhaps the splash effects created mainly by the genius Rob Bottin and that this is the movie that made Kurt Russell what it is today (along with Escape from NY). opinion, this is not a great movie because of the effects, it has to do with history, atmosphere and, of course, acting. I have seen thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day for the last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me like this, not even the great "Das Boot". <br /> <br /> Here is My suggestion for you who likes science fiction and horror films: place yourself in the good chair of your house. Make sure you are not interrupted by anyone. If you do not have a projector, sit near your television and see this miracle of a movie. Let me absorb you, and you will see it my way. <br /> <br /> Best viewing time: end of February, between 5 and 9 at night.
