I like to see Linda Blair playing again in a "horror" movie. I had been disappointed with her in almost everything from the "Exorcist" films (which I loved). What happened to all those "B movies" he did? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, David Hassellhoff, all he could do is laugh. He is not made to be a horror movie actor. David needs to continue with "Knight Rider" or "Baywatch". <br /> <br /> This is an incredible movie. Even for the eighties, this was an awesome movie. It has horror, action and drama. It's a suspense, and I loved how Linda Blair turned out.
