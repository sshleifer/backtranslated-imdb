This, unfortunately, is a little known movie ... I say "unfortunately", because it is at the level of the "classics" of the American silent screen! <br /> <br /> It is a legend of a "ghost car" that travels around the world, collecting the souls of those who have died. The legend says that the last person to die on New Year's Eve is condemned to drive the car for the next year. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of the sequence of the "Ghost of the future to come". The famous "Christmas story" by Dicken. <br /> <br /> The effects of double exposure of ghosts (especially when interacting with "living" people) are EXCELLENT! <br /> <br /> If you like silent movies, you MUST see THIS; "It will devastate you"! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel <br /> <br /> Norm's Old Movie Heaven http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html
