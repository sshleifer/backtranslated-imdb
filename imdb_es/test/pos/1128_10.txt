When I sat down to see Greek for the first time, I did not expect a show with complex characters, intriguing plot lines and impeccable writing ... but that's exactly what I got. <br /> <br /> The Greek follows Several university students who are in the Greek system at the Rhodes University of Cyprus. Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus Rhodes as a student of polymer science that aspires to be in a fraternity. His older sister, Casey (the entertainment center and the future president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the most prestigious brotherhood on campus), does not exactly support his plans. In fact, none of her friends knew she had a brother until he set foot on the college grounds! In addition to dealing with the fact that her dorky younger brother has been forced to return to his life, Casey's boyfriend, Evan Chambers (soon to be the president of LA on campus fraternity, Omega Chi) tricks her with a new Commitment from ZBZ (Rebecca Logan), the devilish president of ZBZ, Frannie, is pushing her to stay with him, and she still feels something for her ex-boyfriend Cappie (president of the party house on campus, Kappa Tau). These characters are joined by Calvin Owens (an athletic and intelligent friend of Rusty who turns out to be homosexual), Dale Kettlewell (an intransigent Christian and possibly racist of the room and Rusty's best friend) and Ashleigh (the best friend and confidant of Casey)). <br /> <br /> Throughout the two Greek seasons (or four chapters), viewers are often reminded that university life is not in black and white, but "in shades of gray here onwards". Each character commits his fair share of the mistakes, but each of them has redeeming qualities. Casey and Cappie have a complicated relationship, but beautiful, throughout the series. The friendship of Rusty, Dale and Calvin is not always perfect, but they manage to survive all the obstacles that are thrown at them. Even Frannie, Rebecca and Evan (the "villains" of the show) appear as humans from time to time. <br /> <br /> The Greeks show college students at their best, worst, and middle. It is a program that reveals the university as what it really is: a four-year adventure in which one's morals, beliefs and willpower are tested, committed and sometimes even changed. <br /> <br /> The Greek has at least one season Left, if not more, before it ends. I can not wait to see where the characters end next. Greek is not your typical ABC family comedy. If you want to tune into a program that shows the truth behind human motivation, Greek is the program for you.
