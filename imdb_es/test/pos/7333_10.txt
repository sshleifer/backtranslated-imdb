This is one of the few movies with excellent acting, wonderful history and worth seeing. It's about changes in life. It is about how happiness can be found when one is true to oneself. It is about accepting oneself and others. It's about life's challenges. It's about coming to terms with reality. It's about courage. It's about love Both actresses are very faithful to their role. The actresses had very good chemistry with each other in the movie. This is the key to the movie that made the movie. It's weird to see an independent movie like this one. One could say the hard work that the film crew had to have while producing this film. I want to see more films by this producer / writer. Watch the movie, you will love it.
