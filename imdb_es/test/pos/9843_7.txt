James Cagney (The Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) was just beginning his career and was able to perform as a gangster and also as a social worker for a Children's Reform School, which is run by corrupt politicians. The inmates of the Reformed school are lower-income children from the streets of New York, such as the "East Side Kids" who were poor and who were not cared for during the Great Depression. In the final scenes, there is a trial held by the boys of the reform school with flaming torches and a barn that catches fire and a great leap by the corrupted director. I noticed that first they let the horses out of the barn. This movie is not shown very often and I can really understand WHY!
