This is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say: "I did not think they made movies like that anymore". Walter Matthau offers his usual superior performance, but instead of leaving tooth marks all over the stage, it leaves endearing grease spots. It's like the great-uncle that we all know still uses plaid polyester and embarrasses everyone, but we still love it. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's performance reminds us why he had more Golden Globe nominations than anyone (22). It gives a realistic interpretation of the basically "good and ordinary man", even in the middle of a farce. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably not attractive to people who prefer direct humor designed to confront or offend, but it will attract people who appreciate the broad farce that plays with a serious face. <br /> <br /> The entire cast of support is excellent in its ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character. <br /> <br /> Brent Spiner offers a wonderful performance as a professional version of a living room lizard. Anyone who has met professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the guy who is playing. Perfectly nails the guy. His interpretation of 'slime' deserves to be studied as a perfect example of the contrast between the absurd and the pathetic. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather a simple "let's get rich" theme that has the usual results. The fact that a theme of the plot has been done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated, but that it is a timeless subject. <br /> <br /> The rest of the support cast shows what can happen when professionals expose their image. skills in the roles that are written for them, instead of competing for the spotlight. In this film even the second level actors shine. It is also obvious that they enjoyed making this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot can be standard and thin, but it allows artists to shine. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real pleasure for people who want to see professional actors committed to their craft. The plot falls and the artists shine.
