I thought this was a really great movie, especially because it was just for me. I was bored, I took it out of the library and I had a lot of fun. I've seen it twice in the two days and the more I see it, the more I like it. I thought the plot was going to be really corny, but in the end you could say it would be true. I liked the main characters and I thought they were well chosen and you could see a real friendship. I thought everyone did an excellent job. The end was good. And you really hate bad guys and you really like good guys. Which is how it's supposed to be a movie.
