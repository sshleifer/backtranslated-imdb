One night I listened to talk on the radio and they had Leslie Nielsen on the show. He went on to explain why there were only 6 shows. '<br /> <br /> With TV shows like MASH, you could go to the fridge for a beer and, while you were listening to what was happening, you did not miss anything. But with Police Squad, you had to watch the program, with the looks you missed a lot if you did not see them. Who could forget "... the part of the city known as" Little Italy "..." with the coliseum in the background. <br /> <br /> Even the movies were largely based on visual gags, but then they came back to being In the theater, you were a captive audience. <br /> <br /> Leslie also said that the only reason why the program, movies and other movies like Airplane were fun is because they did not try to say what was funny. It is up to the viewer to get the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well, that's just my 2 cents.
