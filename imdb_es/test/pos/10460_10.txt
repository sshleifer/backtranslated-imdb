It is not necessary to repeat Glenn's synopsis. The interpretation in black and white is even more powerful in portraying the desolation of rural village life at that time. The deep measure of friendship shown by Babette towards the two older sisters touches the strings of the heart. The cast is excellent and their performances excellent, it would not be fair to single out a single character, since the whole story depends on the cast as a whole. I can not pinpoint exactly why I rate this film so high since I am not a professional critic; Individual viewers may or may not agree with my rating, since the enjoyment of this type of film is always in the eye of the viewer.
