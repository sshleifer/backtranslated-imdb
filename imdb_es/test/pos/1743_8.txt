I was very disappointed when this show was canceled. Although I can not vote. I live on the island of Aruba. I sat down to watch the show on Tuesday. And I was very surprised that it was not issued. The next day I read on the internet that it was canceled. <br /> <br /> It is true that not everyone had as much talent as the other. But there were very talented people singing. <br /> <br /> I find it very sad for them. <br /> <br /> They worked so hard and the dreams collapsed. <br /> <br /> It's a shame <br /> <br /> Ariette Croes
