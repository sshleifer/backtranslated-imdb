One of the biggest crimes committed against science fiction television was the cancellation of Farscape. One of the best written programs, well acted and above all to honor the waves, established new standards for science fiction television. Once the flagship, the critically acclaimed and critically acclaimed Sci-Fi show, it defies explanation why programs like Buffy, Tremors: The Series and even StarGate: SG-1 have lasted as long as have made. Yes, even Buffy. But I'm going to save my Buffy for another time. Farscape was badly treated by the Science Fiction channel, it was continuously launched into the programming, the replays are rarely shown and never actually announced. But while the program has been canceled, everyone involved in the production of the program wants to recover the program (including the CEO of Henson Company, Brian Henson). There is also an extensive movement based on fans to return the show. In general, things look very far from the dark, and we hope that fans get their season 5.
