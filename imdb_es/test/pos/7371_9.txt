This was the Saturday before Halloween this year (today, at the time of writing this article) and it has to be the best anthology of terror that exists. Normally I'm not a fan of horror movies, largely because of the volume of trash that has recently been released. However, the director of Campfire Tales has the gift of suspense of Hitchcock-esquire, which unlike other contemporary films, does not take every opportunity to scare him, but uses incidents and "near misses": incidents that seem to be the instant in which the climax will occur in the previous instant, but it turned out that it is not. <br /> <br /> I did not catch 'The Hook' or the first main segment, but from what I've read here, it was the two you could miss. <br /> <br /> 'People Can Lick Too' was full of suspense - this short keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for something to happen to the girl as she wanders around her yard and home looking for her ball soccer and then your dog. She meets so many faults that the suspense reaches overwhelming proportions before the climax of the short, when the girl gives up and goes to bed, thinking that her dog is underneath. She lowers her hand down to let him lick it, and she feels the touch of a tongue in her hand ... before noticing that in her mirror, written in blood, is "People can also lick". I'll leave you the last seconds for you to find out, reader, because at this point the short could have taken several turns. <br /> <br /> 'The Locket', however, was the undisputed masterpiece of this film. Start with a man on a motorcycle, simply driving ... towards what you do not know, but you can feel closer and closer. While driving, a storm breaks out and he is forced to seek refuge in the house of a mute girl. The two quickly settled down, but before they could do anything more than kiss, the girl reveals through the writing that the ghosts live in her house. They quickly begin to pack to leave, but are caught in the middle of a recreation of a scene decades ago: a father, who returns home with his daughter and boyfriend who are preparing to escape, murders them both and then commits suicide. I will also have to leave you to discover the ending here. In any case, I can not hope to do justice to the story, and what I have said so far is only a brief summary of the story. I could not. I hope to transmit the nuances and sensory details that are added. <br /> <br /> 'La bongata', being the common thread among all the stories, is a very interesting rehash of the theme of the car accident, and the girls are very attractive, in fact, most of the girls in this movie are beautiful. Anyway, despite the fact that it is cut out, history is done with justice, and the end is hard to predict if you are worried about the other stories. However, if you pay enough attention to the segments of The Campfire that are spread throughout the film, it is possible to predict the end, especially if you have seen movies based on the same premise. (Fans of MST3k, remember Soultaker? The same premise, but without the terrible writing of Vivian Schilling and most of the film.If you've seen the first 30 minutes of that, you should be able to predict the end). all, the best horror movie I've seen in a long time, and the only horror anthology worthy of a purchase.
