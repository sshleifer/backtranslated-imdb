Peter is top notch, he's acting and he looks great. It feels like watching a live play, a great camera works, and I was sad that everything was over. I can not wait until I'm on the big screen. Super deal, this could be a great success. I like the way children interact as sisters and two brothers, it really made me think of my own brothers going through a situation like Peter's, the happy father who thinks he will end his life after a big party ... colors and scenarios was a delight for the eyes, it helps a lot to attract him to the movie / the game ... I was so happy to see that Peter is not Colombo, this guy could always act, and now this is a movie that gives him that range. I recommend you take your family to this movie. Maybe teenagers will not get much of this, no weapons, fast cars, nonsense, stupid jokes ... but your adult children will love it. Good show for a night with them. <br /> <br /> Jason
