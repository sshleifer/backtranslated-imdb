This is easily one of my favorite musicals of all time. Bette Midler is as close to the real magic on the screen as anyone who, in turn, has the violent, busty, brave and very frightening mother of Gypsy Lee. She evokes a sense of despair that is sometimes both comical and tragic, but always genuine and quite beautiful. Such charm and agility is, in fact, a pioneer woman without borders. That border is discovered for children. Who, in turn, must forge his own in a world ruled by his dominant mother. <br /> <br /> This particular version is, as I understand it, in its entirety, including the brilliant choreography of Jerome Robbins, as well as the original version. annotations.
