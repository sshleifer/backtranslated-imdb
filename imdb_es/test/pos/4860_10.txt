Most people who attend this film will have no idea of ​​the great novel by Arthur Miller that is the basis of this. It is a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and alters the lives of people. <br /> <br /> At first, Lawrence Newman is an ordinary man. The glasses that his boss makes him change everything he has worked for and his whole world collapses around him, little by little. There could not be an actor better prepared to take this intelligent interpretation to the screen than William H. Macy. Not only is he a talented theater and film actor, but he projects honesty behind every character he plays. He is a daily man trapped in his own insecurities. His anxiety intensifies when he takes a position and leaves his job. Suddenly, he has to face the problems he has tried to avoid throughout his middle-class existence in the Brooklyn of the 40s. Is he Jewish, or not? The cinematography in this bright and atmospheric film, directed with a firm hand by Neil Slavin, reminded me of some Edward Hopper paintings, especially a sequence at the beginning of the film when Newman comes out of a building and nightly filming when he and his wife are being followed by long black shadows behind the couple, threatening and anticipating the confrontation with the thugs. Laura Dern, David Paymer, and especially Meat Loaf, which infuse incredible depth to the next bully, are excellent, but they all pale in comparison to William H. Macy's stellar turn (H must represent HONEST ..) If you have not I read the book, I would sincerely recommend it because no one has written more real and convincing than Arthur Miller.
