There are no failures in this production. Perfectly entertaining, fun and worthy of respect. <br /> <br /> This is what the theater is about. Definitely not for the very young, but slightly older children will have a lot of fun watching it and will be able to be introduced to the theater in this way. <br /> <br /> Amazing and surprising.
