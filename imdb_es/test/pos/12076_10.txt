Originally I saw it at its premiere in the United Kingdom. I was fascinated by that, and it had me crying for its entire duration. I recorded it on the TV to save it, but over the years it has worn out. And television never seems to show it. Therefore, it was a pleasure to discover that True Movies owns the copyright and showed it on their channels. This time, I recorded it on a DVD, to be able to enjoy it again and again. <br /> <br /> Lucile Fray (played magnificently by Ann-Margret) discovers she has cancer and is terminal. Her husband has arthritis and, although he loves, is an alcoholic and would be unable to care for his children after she has left. Therefore, he has to find new homes for each of his children before dying. <br /> <br /> The acting is top notch, the music beautiful, and it has stood the test of time wonderfully (it still makes me cry!) If you ever have the chance, it would be foolish to lose this. It's a wonderful movie! A must see for everyone !!!
