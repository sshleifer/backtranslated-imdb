I always felt that I was a child, I loved this movie. I've always been a fan of Joseph Mazzello. The boy had pure talent in both this movie and Jurassic Park. I have been looking for the DVD or VHS to buy in a store near me. It seems I can not find it. I hope it comes out on DVD! Well, anyway a great movie. If anyone knows where I can find this, contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net. Can someone also really explain what happened with Bobby. Was it real or was it fake? Was he an imaginary friend and his escape? lol I'm clueless. My favorite part had to be definitely where they made the monster juice and spilled it all over the kitchen. It's fun, but also sad, because of what happens to Bobby because of the disaster. I would have liked to see the couple. Cara because he played his part pretty well. I think the mother was a great actress. I think her name is Lorraine Bracco or a name like that. Well, that's it, please, contact me <br /> <br /> wrp24
