This is seriously one of the best low budget movies, B I've ever seen. I'm not a person to get up and cheer during a movie, but it was definitely worth it. Obviously, the premise is that there is a bed that eats people, well ... eat is a subjective term, I suppose, actually secret acid bubbles to suck the victims and dissolve them in their acid goodness. The best part of this movie is that William Russ is one of the main characters. The typical family man started his career with this movie ... and an afro. There's a lot of nudity in this movie, so obviously not for children, but that should not deter anyone from watching this movie. I think everyone needs a little Deathbed in their lives at some time or another, it's better to get it sooner rather than later.
