An introspective look at the relationship between Hawking and the space / time contingent. This film presents Galilean and Newtonian laws and their relation to Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. <br /> <br /> The film is methodically directed, exposing details of the man (Hawking) and his work (Black Holes). The interviews with your family are too long, so unfortunately there is less development of your theories and ideas. <br /> <br /> A soundtrack by Philip Glass complements the film perfectly. Only another man could compose those disturbing dream melodies (Jean Michel Jarre). <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend this film based on Hawking's "nuggets of wisdom" and its proper explanation of an event horizon.
