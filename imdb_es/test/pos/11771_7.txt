The first half hour of "Homegrown" was quite boring and not absorbing, but as the movie progressed, so did my interest in the characters and the plot. Several scenes are really terrifying and you are afraid for the main characters that you really get attached to. The story is about three hands hired at an illegal marijuana farm hidden in Southern California. They witness the murder of the farm owner, Malcolm (John Lithgow), and take over the brush on their own. The three hands of the fairly simple minded farm are soon dragged into a terrifying world of mafia and local interest, while trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. While the film had several flaws and a slow start, it turned out to be worth it. 7/10 stars.
