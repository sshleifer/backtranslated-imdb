I really enjoyed this movie for what it is: a funny little movie that does not take itself too seriously. The summaries of the plots are available everywhere, so I will not go into details. Michael is not about a complex plot anyway. It is simply based on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road trip. <br /> <br /> John Travolta's performance as a cake-eating angel, a ladies fan, a bar fighter, eaten in bars is just perfect. And who does not love Sparky? <br /> <br /> Look at this if you want to laugh a little and have a good time. Highly recommended
