This BBC series is excellent. I'm not a paleontologist, but this series offers the best historical representation of dinosaurs I've seen. 3D animation and animatronics are very good and make you believe that you have traveled in time. The BBC deserves a pat on the back for such a good series, as well as Tim Haines, who must have spent a lot of time making this series aired.
