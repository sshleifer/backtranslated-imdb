Probably, this movie is not the most fun I've seen in my life, and CERTAINLY it does not have much redemption value. In fact, it is really just a collection of vignettes linked by a loose plot. However, this "make-up as I go" attitude actually works to the benefit of the movie. "Tommy Boy" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that SNL plays Farley and Spade: their extemporaneous nonsense and chaos make them comical despite their immaturity.
