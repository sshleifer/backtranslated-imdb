*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, since I'm a big fan of H: LOTS, maybe I liked the movie more than I did to normal people. However, this movie is still excellent. It had many surprises and gave a little more closure to the series. While I was sad that Bayliss would become a murderer, the general feeling I felt was satisfied.
