This must be one of the most horribly titled movies of all time. The type of title that ruins a movie because it does not evoke the plot or the characters. A title like this makes a film flop, even the French title is not much better. Too bad: Truffaut and Deneuve must have been enough to sell it. <br /> <br /> This is a long movie, but it's very much worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal advertising bride, her rich husband, a steal, a change of identity and an obsessive love. The plot here is really very good, and it takes us on an unexpected journey. <br /> <br /> What works for and against the film is the focus on the relationship. It is an interesting study on how these plot developments develop into "real life relationships" with these two people. Unfortunately, this is what jams the film and, ultimately, makes it unsatisfying. We like that movies have a true sense of purpose, and that is missing here. <br /> <br /> In many of his films, Deneuve became a canvas for directors to make their fantasies, and this time it does not work so well. What is unpleasant here is the fact that the Director clearly only wanted Deneuve to take it off a couple of times. Deneuve is an actress who always seems to be very deliberate and thoughtful, so these attempts to make it seem spontaneous fall. <br /> <br /> Basically, the script had to be made better before shooting, to make this film narrower and shorter and to fit. But Truffaut did not break, right? So, it wanders a bit, but it's still interesting.
