I have spent many years studying all the great directors, like Kurosawa, Lean, Fulci, Lenzi, Deodato, Peckinpah, Kubrick and I admire them a lot. My favorite movie was Once Upon a Time in America. <br /> <br /> I've recently become a fan of D'Amato, and although I was not a horror master, his films were extreme, whether they were soft core, hardcore or extreme. <br /> <br /> Holocaust Porn is now one of my favorite movies, the way it is filmed is brilliant and the music is catchy. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato, was not a horror master, it's not Fulci or Bava, but since he was a master of erotica, no other director could film erotic movies like him, nor did he try to do any movie out of this genre. <br /> <br /> Long Live Joe D'Aamto-Master of Porn and Erotica!
