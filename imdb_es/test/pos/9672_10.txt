Family Guy has to be my favorite caricature of all time. It's definitely the funniest TV show ever made and it's better than The Simpsons. I have never laughed so much about a television program in my life. The things that make the show so fun are the plot, characters and themes that are covered in the program. There are very few issues that have not been addressed in Family Guy. <br /> <br /> I have seen almost all the episodes of Family Guy that have been done and would do it. I have to say that the program was better in the first two seasons. My favorite characters are Peter because he is very funny and he is the best character in the program. My second favorite character is Stewie because he's the funniest villain on television. Show. If you love Family Guiy, you should visit American Dad because it is very similar and was created by Seth McFarlane. I hope this program never ends because he is a comic book genius. 10/10
