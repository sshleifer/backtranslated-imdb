I recently saw this movie for the first time. I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD. This movie is pure genius and it only becomes more fun with each visualization. Anyone can write funny jokes or dialogues and have the actors memorize them, but the basis of this movie is to improve! How they did it? Thanks, Christopher Guest!
