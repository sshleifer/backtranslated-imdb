Wow, this movie is amazing. It is an excellent movie. It has some sick scenes (not as sick as Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie) some nudity, and this was the debut of the penis monster in the movie! This has set the scene for many of Troma's films, this is a very thrilike movie. Mix comedy, romance and my favorite, HORROR / GORE! Not so much gore in this movie, but enough to satisfy. This is the best adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Much better than any other version. They make it so entertaining, and fun to watch. And we have Debbie Rochon ... hehe ... I like it. :) All I have to say is that this is a great movie, very funny, and Lemmy is a good presenter for her. The acting is good, and Kaufman directs with style as always. Must be seen by all the fans of TROMA!
