I saw this movie in a small projection. Even though I had a low budget, the creative direction and the intelligence of the cast helped make this a little gem of a movie. It is April 8, 1994, each of the characters is in his "mid-20" and pursues some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of the suicide of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain. They are quickly inspired to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. This is where the film really collects and presents a series of fun and emotional scenes. Highlights include: a visit to the tomb of Jimi Hendirx, the original home of Kurt Cobain's childhood and a bonfire singing. An honest and original work.
