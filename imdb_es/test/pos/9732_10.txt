This is the kind of movie you rent when you're incredibly tired or damaged in some other way ... The acting in this movie is so bad that it seems intentional, and to let you know how bad the special effects are, there's a scene in the that the puppets come alive where you can see most of a hand that holds the puppet and moves it. The film looked as if it had been filmed with a video camera. When I saw this movie for the first time, a fistfight almost broke out when my friends and I called each other names in this movie, that's how terrible it was. If you like to get angry with movies, I recommend this, otherwise, run away as if your own life depended on it.
