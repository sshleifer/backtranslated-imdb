Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really caught me from the beginning. This movie was not. He moved at a slow and deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there really was nothing he was terribly interested in. There is an intriguing and mysterious quarrel between the character of Jean Reno and an old man, but more. of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the ramblings of the main character, who did not know much and with whom I could not really relate. He wanders alone for most of the time, he does not know anyone; I imagine that the director was trying to represent the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world or something, which is fine, but I still wish I had cut it from 40 minutes to 15, because it can be incredibly boring. <br /> <br /> But after those 40 minutes, things start to get very interesting. I guess I really will not say more than that because I do not want to spoil anything. So, if you've seen the first 15 to 30 minutes of this movie and you're thinking about turning it off (as I was), stay with it, it gets much better. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting things I found about this movie was the fact that I did not have any kind of dialogue, which really made me think about what was going on, how the characters felt and what they were Your motivations, why things were as they were in this post. -the apocalyptic world, all of which gives the story a lot of space for audience interpretation. And it's amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors do not tell you exactly what's going on.
