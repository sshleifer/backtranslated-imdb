This movie hits the heart with a reality like no other I've seen. It shows us what we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and what we are fortunate not to experience. The acting in the film is excellent, sometimes you have to remember that the film is a dramatization, and not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all functions) by making the interrogator completely dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of "in the round theater". What does not add or remove the emotion of the action. This film seeks to open the eyes of the viewer, and I would say that they have achieved the success of that objective. .
