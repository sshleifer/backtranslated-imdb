Thirty pieces of silver and a lucky kiss. This was another totally unexpected gem. Usually, I'm not even a fan of suspense / suspense. This satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a seafront pretzel. It has an exciting erotic romance, reminiscent of "corporal Heat" in more than one sense; He has police and crime; Political intrigue and only a little soap during the day. It has the fair touch of harsh violence that any professional criminal work "by numbers" should employ. Emma Thompson, (FBI AIC), performs her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for the best fake southern accent from a Limey. Alan Rickman, (local police), who always seems to steal the show, is excellent but not overwhelming. They work well as a couple. Much deviation from the plot that never gets out of control and reconnects consistently to the end of the movie. And who is this amazing woman, Carla Gugino? I want her to take my children. Carla, if you're there, let's have lunch.
