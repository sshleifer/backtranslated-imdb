Two sisters, Su-mi (IM Soo-jung) and Su-yeon (MOON Geun-young) return home with their father (Kim Gap-soo). Eun-joo (YEOM Jeong-ah) welcomes you, but Su-mi's attitude is bitter for her. Su-mi hates Eun-joo because the father let her act as the wife of the house after the mother of the sisters died. Seeing her attitude, Eun-joo is treating the sisters with coldness and a tense atmosphere grows between them. <br /> <br /> As if the atmosphere called it, a series of mysterious things happen in the house. When Su-mi is hanging her dress in her wardrobe, she has already hung many dresses of the same design. When you put your journal in a drawer, find another journal of the same type there. When she is sleeping in her bed with the frightened Su-yeon, a nightmare wakes her up and finds a woman standing over her, and a hand hangs from the woman's skirt! <br /> <br /> Mysterious things happen to other people, too. On the night of next weekend, Eun-joo's brother and his wife visit the family and have dinner together. Eun-joo talks happily about a crazy man she knew when she was a child, but no one is interested in talking. She says that the madman bothered the brother, but he says he does not know anything about the man. <br /> <br /> Upon hearing their conversation, the brother's wife has a panic. <br /> <br /> After dinner, the conflict between Eun-joo and the sisters becomes worse. Eun-joo pulls Su-yeon in a closet and locks it in him. Su-mi saves the weeping sister and complains to her father about what Eun-joo has done to her daughter. But his answer is unexpected. "Give me a break." he says angrily: "Su-mi, please, do not tire me anymore". <br /> <br /> And the next words that come out of the father's mouth are more shocking than what they have seen in the house. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, I hate horror movies. Although I sat in a theater because my intuition told me that the movie was something different, I regretted what my curiosity had made me act when it started to show. Repentance, however, became joy by expectation ten minutes later. <br /> <br /> This film is a tragic mystery rather than a horror, more painful than horrible; Bella more than sensational. That can make a horror fan feel disappointed, but for a mysterious fan like me, this movie is a must. (9 out of 10)
