What do you do if you're Aishwarya Rai, coming out of a hit movie like 'Devdas', with some skeptical critics still relentlessly unsatisfied with your amazing performance or convinced by your strong presence on the screen and your stellar acting skills, what are you doing? Go home, sit down and pout? No. If you are Aishwarya Rai, you register for the next piece of the strong period that is presented and you continue to prove to be worthy of all the praise, praise, great scripts and equally important roles. And that's exactly what she did with and in 'Chokher Bali, a work of passion' where she stars and shines as Binodini, a young widow who causes controversy long before her time. Directed by Rituparno Ghosh (who then directs it to direct it in the stellar 'Raincoat'), Prasenjit Chatterjee {Devdas in Bengali}.
