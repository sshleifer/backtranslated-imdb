A brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time, and certainly far ahead of everything that was being thrown into mass production at the same point in history. The influence of this work on Tim Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas" is evident. You can only imagine how Starewicz enslaved in each beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> There have been very few animated movies of this caliber. It is a pity that more people have not seen this gem. <br /> <br /> Apparently, IMdB now requires that comments have at least ten lines, so this is the tenth line. This must be something new, but I really do not have anything else to say!
