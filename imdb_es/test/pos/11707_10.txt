VALE FOR: If it's not for the work of Mick Molloy, by Judith Lucy. She brings her classic style with unbridled wildness to the role, and steals the show in parts. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion I am not a great autograph hunter, but I have collected 3. The first is from Samuel L. Jackson, the other 2 are in this movie: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Altho Martin only makes an appearance, Molloy not only stars but co-writes and co-produces this film. I've been a fan of them for years (apparently, I was the only one who laughed during urination on set in the first episode of the short life of The Mick Molloy Show), so I went into this with great expectations. I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed. With Mick doing a lot of work on this thing, there are many of his usual trademarks. Phrases like "blow your ass" and "these bowls are a fucking house" are everywhere, as well as a lot of Winnie Blues that are being absorbed. It's also the kind of stupid and original story you'd expect from someone like him. This is like one of those American sports comedies, clicked, where they make a baseball team with prisoners or something like that. But instead of trying to make a boring American sport like baseball or grilling interesting, this film focuses on a sport that is usually left to the gray army: Lawn Bowls. But the main difference between this and other sports-type comedies is that this is really very, very funny. What is even better is that even though the subject of this film is a young man who joins a game of old people, it is never insulting to the elderly, and it never becomes sick or anything. It's just a good laugh at genuine 1972 prices. Mick is great in the first real actor role I've seen him in, like Judith Lucy and the rest of the cast, but most of them have had a lot of practice. This is the best Australian comedy I've seen. I have seen in a long time. Go see it and learn the joys of Lawn Bowls! <br /> <br /> IT'S A LITTLE TASTE: Major League? <br /> <br /> SCORE: 8/10
