This was the second cinemascope show that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are corrected to pass to the Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all the first class elements, a beautiful photograph and a moving soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann, see if you can determine which composer scored specific scenes). However, the main performance is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and it is not interesting to see. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and the Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress "Nefer". I think that this film in general is strong in the plot, which is rare in these great shows produced at that time. All in all, the film makes an interesting and entertaining social comment work on how Egyptian society could have been.
