I saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival and I was also surprised that it did not generate more news because it was not only powerful and beautifully designed, it was also very original. The audience was totally engaged and the best part of watching a movie like this at a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and broadcast in the question and answer session afterwards. They literally had to throw us out of the screening room for the next movie, we could have continued for much longer. The film is stimulating and hilarious at the same time. It will be a pity that this film is not chosen for a wider distribution. I hope that it is at least available on DVD because I want to see it again and share it with everyone I know.
