After the business coup of the year 1941, Max and Dave, the Fleischer brothers were removed from their own studio by Paramount Pictures Corporation. Former employees, such as Seymour Kneitel and Izzy Sparber, were put in charge of the new operation, now called Famous Studios by Paramount. At first, the Famous finished product was indiscernible from the recent Fleischer production. The existing series (Popeye, Superman) continued as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> The theme of TODAY, JAPOTEURS is one of the first SUPERMAN shorts from Famous Studio. <br /> <br /> AS had been the custom, the SUPERMAN cartoons were a great combination of fine music and well adapted in the score. This applies to both the theme (overture) and all the background music (incidental) of multiple moods. It was as if each cartoon clip had its own background music, since everything was kept fresh by apparently recording it again with each image. <br /> <br /> With regard to JAPOTEURS, we must remember that this was filmed during the first year. The participation of the United States and the characterization of the enemy was very stereotyped, of little importance and frankly evil. The dialogue and personality of the Japanese saboteur villains came strictly from the common characters of the old stories of the pulp magazine, and each word was spoken with sarcasm, a totally insincere courtesy, since the characters displayed their coldness by doing the most demonic. Threats and scandalous acts towards the western world. <br /> <br /> JAPOTEURS is visually bright and stimulating, incredibly designed and uses some multi-plane or table animations to give your flight sequences a real depth. <br /> <br /> MAKING good use of links between animated cartoons, the SUPERMAN radio program was heard through Mutual Broadcasting Network; The cartoon looks a lot like the comic page and uses the same talents of voice actors Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander from the radio show. <br /> <br /> We rate it with *** Â½ stars. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
