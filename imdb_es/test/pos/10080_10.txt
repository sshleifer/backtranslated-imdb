This was a great movie! It was a thoroughly nice teenage fantasy. So, what makes a movie great? Technical details? I think that if that were the only criterion, our culture would be the poorest. So this movie is for "The Godfather" as is the new wave music for Mozart. The point is that it is one of the best movies of its kind I've seen. All women are beautiful (as they only look on California beaches when movies are made). It has a bit of everything, a kind of battlestar gallactica meets with baywatch and is on the central page of playboy with Wayne's World. There is a lot of charm and a reasonable plot (although predictable) that keeps you interested until the next touch of sweet eyes adorns the screen. Joe Est√©vez may not have his brother's career, but he does a good job of focusing on the story as Uncle Bud, eternal teenager. It contains a lot of expected absurdities, like the female rock band playing without the guitars plugged in. (Was it intentional?) If the box attracts you, rent the video, you will not regret it. As promised, it's good non-violent erotic fun!
