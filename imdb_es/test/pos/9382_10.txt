See "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is like waking up in the hospital, two days of suicide, disorientating but strangely stimulating. There are few cinematic equivalents of this disturbing but often humorous lesson about mythology, morality and surrealist ideology. <br /> <br /> The "Blood of a poet" by Cocteau and the experimental works of Maya Deren evoke a taste of the strange atmosphere found in BED DEATH. A close comparison is the dark adult fairy tales of literary author Angela Carter, the short and disturbing stories of Unica <br /> <br /> Zurn or E.T.A. Hoffman <br /> <br /> THE DEATH OF DEATH has many recognizable elements from the past <br /> <br />, but it shows a completely unique and original story. <br /> <br /> As a story, the DEATH OF DEATH is an incredibly simple but original vision <br /> <br />, something that only one in every thousand independent launches will achieve. This unpretentious film has its technical flaws, but it surpasses them all with a cast of beautiful actors, not actors, and spooky, lost places, a true independent classic of the 70s. <br /> <br /> THE DEATH OF DEATH also shows a three-dimensional personality, unique and subversive: a deep and continuous layer of images of dreams and ideas that give it a "fun-house" type of construction. The passage of time narrated in flashbacks and in the historical history of travel, the bed with its sinister black humor, the rich and underestimated symbolism used in his images. The most pleasant thing is the image of Aubrey Beardsly, the suffering artist, trapped forever within the framework of his own painting while commenting and caressing the "offerings" of the murdered victim that have been given as offerings of love for the spirit of the demented bed. - A sick refrain and a wonderful element / metaphor for the "trapped artist" - Nothing that is not the strangest thing in POE or MALARME can match that. <br /> <br /> Who values ​​the spirit of independent cinema and longs for the multi-layered symbolist experience, or craves the surrealistic concept of "convulsive beauty" and the Gothic horror inclinations of Low-budget film exploitation will exploit this totally unique vision. A simple and funny movie with deliciously deep psychic currents. VERY RECOMMENDED. *****
