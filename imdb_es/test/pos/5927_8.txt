I've seen this movie several times over the years and I always find it an entertaining experience. As a retired airline pilot, I am interested in most aviation movies and this is one of the best. I know that Lindbergh was only 25 years old when he made his historic solo flight to Paris and that James Stewart was almost 50 years old when making this film, but I can ignore this fact because Stewart has always been one of my favorite actors of all time and he makes one of his usual outstanding performances as the "lonely eagle". <br /> <br /> There is a good mix of comedy and drama throughout the film and good use of flashbacks. It also helps that James Stewart has been a pilot in real life in both military and civilian life.
