I can not believe there are people who did not like this movie! I thought it was the funniest movie I had ever seen. He was my biggest fan of Mel Brooks ... I know almost all the words and I get very discouraged when they censor them, when playing on a family channel. :) This is one of my favorite movies, so I do not know why anyone would disagree! thank you Kristina
