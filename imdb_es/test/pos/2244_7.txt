Age of Steel follows the previous episode, Rise of the Cybermen, which was excellent in some aspects, and in others it does not. RotC had some positive elements, the most important being the excellent portrait that Tennant makes of the Doctor. In fact, his kind of vertigo, for this writer, is the shadow of Tom Baker's doctor, with his kind of subconscious margin (like when the time periods are marked when Mickey is pressing the button on the Tardis), however, It brings its own distant attitude. superiority to the McCoy's Doctor since it allows the events to unite around him. Some critics and fans whose works I have read seem a bit dismayed to see such an young actor portraying someone who must already be over 1000 years old, but I do not agree. The Tennant Doctor really "bears the weight of the world on his shoulders" as he points out in this episode, and one can see it in his almost smug characterization, as when he finally faces Lumic / The Cybercontroller at the climax. His attitude "anothermaniacherewegowegowain", tired by the world and with his eyes open, is refreshing, especially after the excellent interpretation of the character of Eccleston, padaudo-class, more the man of action than the pseudo-doofus of fresh face of Tennant. The best moment of Tennant is perhaps after the end, when he is restoring the Tardis with his great Baker-esquire smile when the Tardis begins again. Here we begin to feel for this new Doctor, a character that is little more than the different facets of the personality of an average person divided into 13 different people; some contradictory, some more pleasant than others, but all are part of a whole. Apart from this, these two episodes were passable, but weak. The concept of reviving the Cybermen is very welcome, and they look fantastic, but the plot that involves a parallel Earth where this action takes place does not seem to work well. It is true that the allegory that humans trust technology and its need to serve it, as the Doctor points out, is outstanding, but this could easily have been placed on contemporary Earth or elsewhere. Some other weaknesses are, as others have pointed out, the ease with which the Doctor and the Company leave crowded places, namely. the death ray of the Tardis component, the seemingly endless variety of uses of the Sonic Screwdriver (my wife laughed when they used it to burn the rope ladder at the end, she has hardly seen Who, so I had to explain to her that it was used traditionally as a plot device to free characters from situations of which there is no other escape, used here with sadness). Some of the performances were missing, especially Mickey, who really needs what he deserves, and part of the cast. Lumic was eerie, as he needed to be, his voice even sounded Cyberman-esquire. However, the score was horrible, since the volume of the music often overflowed the scene. In general, I found Rise of the Cyberman more entertaining, although the second half was passable. The accumulation of what we knew was inevitable takes place well, however, the resolution was disappointing. Too many improbable leaks, no development of supporting cast, and not enough Tennant in my opinion. This new show is outstanding, and Davies is taking it in a good direction, but the dialogue (beyond the Doctor) needs to be stricter, as illustrated by the farewells of Mickey, who were pure ham.
