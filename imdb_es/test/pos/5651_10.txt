This film is a knockout, Fires in the plain that is referenced is, (burning at the end of harvest time) A happy memory for Tamura. Relive this in your mind many times, and at the end of this gloomy film, I like a man who dies of thirst, thinks he is at home and this last illusion is all that he has left. The great Billy Wilder Carnival (Ace in the Hole) is the only movie (which comes to mind) that is as grim as this little Kon Ichikawa masterpiece. While I think the whole movie is brilliant. Two scenes that come to mind are when a squad of Japanese soldiers trying to escape (crawling in the belly) are ambushed by Americans and massacred, True Horror, and as an American soldier and a beautiful Filipino girl. the soldier is smoking a cigarette on the side of the road, she smiles as she flutters with the pull, then her face turns to fury when she sees two Japanese soldiers trying to surrender, she grabs a gun and kills them with joy, the American soldier try to stop it, but it has no chance, for me, this says a lot about the atrocities committed by the Japanese in the Philippines, in general, it's a great movie, if you have the stomach for it.
