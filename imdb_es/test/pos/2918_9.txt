After having been interested in Akhenaton for many years, I was surprised to know about this film through E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the movie, the twists and turns in the plot and the file was mostly about the main character, Sinuhe makes it more of a "family saga" instead of an action movie. The costumes and attention to detail were remarkable for their time (1955). The rear projection during the car trip now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaten and his monotheistic religion. In this film, he was described as "Jesus," as in his refusal to go to war with the Hittites even through the invasion of Egypt and in his final speech about the futility of materiality and political power. Initially, one makes a connection between Sinuhe, who was thrown adrift on the Nile River in a basket of reeds, and Moses of the Old Testament. But there is no doubt that this connection will be made in a new film in which a character of Moses type moves the monotheistic religion of Akhenaten to a wider world, if it will ever be politically possible to make a film of this type . It is universally accepted that women are concerned that men are stupid creatures, but the relationship or lack of one between Sinuhe and Merit, the character played by Jean Simmons, is difficult to accept. And that Sinuhe, an educated doctor, would be so beaten by Nefer, the "femme fatale" of Babylon, to the point of giving him his house of adoptive parents and the Tomb is not really credible, nor that his parents even had a grave. In real life, Nefer (Nefertitti) was the wife of Akhenaten. And although Horemheb became Pharaoh, it was after some others, including Tutankhamen, who was the son of Akhenaten. <br /> <br /> But, of course, this is just a trifle and the movie is nice to see and it is about Akhenaten and his monotheistic religion are a great advantage. Maybe after the book and the movie "The Vinci Code", this film will be remade with the central secret as the basis of our current monotheism! I look forward to such a film, there are already numerous books on the subject.
