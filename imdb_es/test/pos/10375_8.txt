David Suchet is the mustache detective of Agatha Christie Hercule Poirot in "After the Funeral", produced in 2005. Anyone who has heard David Suchet speak with his own British accent knows what a shock is, because his accent as Poirot is so Perfect and organic for the character. Suchet is the Poirot of the books of Agatha Christie, and although I confess a love for Peter Ustinov on paper, his interpretation does not have much to do with what Christie wrote. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Poirot is solicited by a lawyer lawyer to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. En route on the train, the lawyer recounts the events after death: a strange will disinherit the expected heir and the pronouncement of the man's sister who was killed. When Poirot meets the family, he discovers adultery, many secrets, another will and murder. <br /> <br /> The story is excellent, with rich production values ​​and a wonderful and detailed description of the period. The whole performance is excellent, particularly by Monica Dolan, who plays Miss Gilchrist. Poirot here is without Hastings, his beautiful office, or Miss Lemon, but it is effective nonetheless. <br /> <br /> I had the privilege of seeing David Suchet on Broadway in "Amadeus". Amazing. What actor: when he plays Poirot, all I see is IS Poirot.
