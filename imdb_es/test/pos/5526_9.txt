The trick, so to speak, of this 1934 Paramount comedy are the six comedy artists, grouped into three teams of men and women, all appearing together. W. C. Fields and his screen mate, Alsion Skipworth, appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as sheriff and innkeeper in a small town. Fields seems to have been given the latitude to inject a lot of his own unique and surrealistic misanthropic comedy on his part, and it works wonders, especially when allowed to make his famous pool table routine, a digression that is Completely welcome as it is hilarious. <br /> <br /> At first it was thought that it might seem a mismatch to conceive a film to be carried by the subtle domestic comedy of Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland next to the broad, jokey Vaudeville patron of the great comedy team of husband and wife of George Burns and Gracie Allen, but here it works perfectly because of the parts that George and Gracie are given in the script. There are those who travel for free hooked to California on the Ruggles and Boland honeymoon trip and constantly find ways to annoy them at every step, even brilliantly, while each clings to the side of a cliff to save his life. <Br /> <br /> Making the comic nuisance of Burns and Allen into two friendly characters turns out to be a perfect way to adapt comedic characters larger than life to a real-world setting: comedy People who react to it in a credible way turns out to be just as much a gold mine as Gracie's famous naive delivery. <br /> <br /> Charlie Ruggles deserves a special mention for his performance as the fussy banker "Pinky" Whinney. It is wonderfully subtle and unimportant, and it draws laughs from lines that, in the hands of another actor, may not even have been heard. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully witty at all times, and most of the time it's a perfectly extended comedy of frustration is that our sympathies are with the poor Whinneys who can not have a moment alone, and the Additional advantage is that what frustrates them is more premium comedy material from Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> For the observers of previous codes, there is some pretty suggestive material in some of the most entertaining scenes, while Whinney tries to communicate with George. WHY does he and his wife want to be alone? Just a moment. <br /> <br /> There are some signs of a rushed production here: the occasional jump cut, one of the most obvious drop sets you'll ever see in a movie (up there with WC Field himself). short "The Golf Specialist"), and the knot in Field's tie changes shape constantly. However, these do not bother me, and should not bother anyone who is enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> "Six of a Kind" is a true little-known gem and one of the funniest movies I've ever met. I have seen in a while. If you are thinking about seeing it or not, the answer should be yes.
