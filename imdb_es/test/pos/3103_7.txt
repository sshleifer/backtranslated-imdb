The film begins when an old and bad-tempered Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran actor Richard Carle) is led by a man who hopes to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a strong storm and your car gets stuck in the mud and, therefore, you are forced to look for somewhere to spend the night. Fortunately, there is a mansion nearby, although it seems strange that people inside know the writer and he says he did not realize that this was the home of a man he knew (and despised). However, while this seems to be malicious writing, it is not ... since all this is part of a cunning elaborated by the writer so that a group of actors in the home represent their plot. However, halfway through the trick, the producer and his grim assistant discover that the mystery of the murder that is being committed in the house is false and that the whole affair is quite funny. However, what nobody notices is that a fugitive maniac is loose and is about to enter into this little contrived plot, which makes some twists and turns are wonderful. Then, when there seems to be a real murder, the actors are really terrified, while Carle and her partner are convinced that everything is a hoax. While I have explained part of the plot, there are many more aspects of the movie that you will have to solve yourself, and it will surely keep you entertained and guessing. <br /> <br /> Considering that this is a B movie in the public domain, I certainly did not have much hope in this little movie. However, I was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better movie than the average one, with a very interesting and novel twist on the old clich√© about a dark and stormy night in a mansion. Also, although the plot of the film was very good, the dialogue was even better, with a lot of brilliant wit and a good happy rhythm. Full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time.
