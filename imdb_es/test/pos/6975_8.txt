I have a letter from Mrs. Knight, who went to college with my older sister. In it, she talks about the difficulties of making this film. She herself was pregnant, an interesting conjunction with the plot of the film, and the novice director was not sure, it was quite green and had great difficulties with all decisions, logistics, etc. They were in motion all the time, and it was a very difficult filming. <br /> <br /> The film, however, with a strong debut for James Caan, remains effective and affective. It is a great showcase for the talent that Ms. Knight has demonstrated throughout her career: on television, in movies and on stage, where she won the Tony for "The Children of Kennedy." <br /> <br /> This movie has aged well
