Bergman and comedy do not go at all together. Some of his comedies are so unpleasant that you almost make a face. This movie has a strange moment: the last 30 seconds are the nadir, but in general it is a lovely piece (more than fun) that can be enjoyed at all times. Bergman casts several of his usual suspects who perform well. There is a big scene on the train between David, Marianne and a rude salesman that will stay in memory. Part of the marriage material is the typical, cynical Bergman, but this is Bergman in a more than dark mood. <br /> <br /> This movie has its moments and it's worth 90 minutes. It's not one of your classics and it's not the place to start if you want to fall in love with Bergman.
