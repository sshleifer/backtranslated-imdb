"Dead Man Walking" is a film that does not deal with the death penalty, but about the people involved in a death penalty case: the murderer, the families whose children were murdered, the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor and what happens. Tell the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD, and every time I watch it (not often, it's never an easy movie to watch) I'm more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the entire cast did here. So revealing that it could be a documentary, so compelling that you can not look away, so subtle and so powerful ... "The walking of the dead man" is nothing more than a masterpiece. It does not matter if you are for or against the death penalty (or you do not even have an opinion), this movie will make you think about the issues for sure. It is necessary for a courageous screenwriter and director to see this material in his face without flinching even once, and everyone involved in the film succeeds, there is not a single scene that sounds false. A masterful film, but do not wait for the light to be seen ... for some, the final scenes could be more graphic than you can imagine, even if there is no blood or violence. You get involved in this movie and you become a participant, and there is a character so that almost everyone identifies. 10/10.
