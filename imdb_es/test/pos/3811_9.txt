Little Gus is a delinquent of ten years. He escapes from his parents and decides to go on a trip. Reaching the petal is difficult for him, so he creates a device to help him. Your goal is to win a trick-or-treat lottery card game called Motorama. You have to find the eight letters to write M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. The dark laughter continues as it becomes the road trip from hell. He runs into some characters like crazy Lynch. The most memorable is the person in charge of the gas station, who puts his picture on a kite with the hope that God will see it. Later, Gus gets a tattoo and an eye patch for the injured eye. He becomes one of the 10 most rebellious and evil children you've ever seen on screen. This is not a movie for children! Look for cameos by Jack Nance, Flea and Drew Berrymore. Be careful, although Drew is on the cover, he only appears in the movie in a sequence of dreams for a couple of seconds. In addition, the film is confused towards the end coming to David Lynch's territory, you may want to see it a couple of times. "Motorama" was written by Joseph Minion, best known for his screenplays of "After Hours" and "Vampire's Kiss." So enjoy this depraved and fun surreal journey!
