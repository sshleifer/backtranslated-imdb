Unfortunately, many great movies on IMDb like this have their scores "adjusted" by IMDb. This is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of Bonnie and Clyde, Little Big Man, Night Moves, Mickey One and The Chase. <br /> <br /> If you click on the user rating area, I will see that the real median for Four Friends is 7.6. However, IMDb has "adjusted" (attenuated) the rating to 6.4. <br /> <br /> By IMDb: "IMDb publishes weighted vote averages instead of raw data averages." Several filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts to "fill out votes" by people more interested in changing the current rating of a film than in giving their true opinion about it ... The exact methods we use will not be disclosed, this should ensure that the policy remains effective. " In other words, we will not reveal our methods, so you can not question how we got to the score! What a shame to see good films that provoke reflection, like Four Friends, are no better than false comedies due to the "filters" of IMDb.
