This movie has enchanted me tonight. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it without interruptions. John Voight, this cast of little-known black actresses and, above all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday night. How wonderful to see the early work of this experienced actor, as well as the excellent performance of Paul Winfield of Mad Billy. I can not see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is a mistake in the role of superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The actor of garish characters, Charles Lane? Although his career is praiseworthy, an actor such as Lane would have reduced the role. Cronyn was an excellent choice for the role. I will tell this movie like a real treasure to keep in my memory.
