Just three and a half years after having eliminated the one-month race (October 7-31, 1953) at Broadway's Coronet Theater (on West 49th Street, since it was renamed O'Neill), MGM relied on the solid previous success of the work in London. to lavish a wonderful cast and, for the most part, carefully "open" the production in a sadly trimmed script of this cunningly subversive boulevard comedy and were rewarded with a modest blow. <br /> <br /> Ava Gardner is the increasingly frustrated wife of Stewart Granger, an internationally successful and totally complacent "workaholic" (before the term was coined) using the perpetually frustrated David Niven to try rekindle your spouse's passion. When the cruise for the "second honeymoon", Gardner invades Granger to leave the trio (and the dog of Granger) abandoned on an island in the South Sea (were there other survivors? That is for developments of later plots) , Granger continues to direct the world around him: Great hut for him and his wife, and a small title for Niven, or for the unattached man. <br /> <br /> The core of the real plot of the play only reaches the middle of the film when Niven proposes that Granger and he alternate as tenants of Little Hut, sharing the only woman on the island since Granger has been willing to share the only pair of shoes (his). <br /> <br /> Reason (which Granger considers his strong point) reigns and the frustration is supreme - for a while. <br /> <br /> David Niven and Ava Gardner are superb in their designated roles of aspiring seducer and seducer, and Stuart Granger, usually called simply to Be handsome and manly in action roles and in the strange spice of errors . lty (a pretty boy who sings like Apollodorus in Caesar and CLEOPATRA of Shaw in 1945) - gives one of the best performances of his film career as the husband who can be as smart as he thinks he is. 33 years later, he would again show this soft urbanity in front of Rex Harrison in the first (and BOTH his last) Broadway engagements in a successful resurgence of Somerset Maugham's THE CIRCLE, which only ended with the death of Harrison. We would be much richer if Granger had used these skills more frequently. <br /> <br /> As promising as the name is, this is, after all, a very British comedy Boulevard and Hollywood in the 1950s, that is to say that (unlike the game source) very little sex actually continues. To be honest, if you do not give yourself to the ideas that drive the devices, it becomes a bit silly (the same basic plot develops much more successfully three years later in Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr / Robert Mitchum / Jean Simmons (The real wife by Stewart Granger) THE GRASS IS GREENER, based on an even less successful play, but for some reason, that superior littleness failed at the box office). <br /> <br /> As splendidly as MGM established the piece, there were unfortunate lapses: the stupidity that ends with the stay on the island is presented comically in what should have been a moment of genuine emotion: the sinking of the yacht that puts them on the island. Ultimately, we'll only get approximately three quarters of an hour from the real Little Hut, but ninety good minutes from David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger that make the movie fun. It is not high culture, but a guilty pleasure worthy. <br /> <br /> We even got a very nice garrison in Walter Chiari (it is said that she was Ava's true lover at that time). As one of his best speeches says: "Boola, boola!"
