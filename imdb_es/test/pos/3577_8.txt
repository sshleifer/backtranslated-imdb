"Bad dreams always come back again as unwanted friends," says Marion Fairlie, who with her stepsister, Laura, lives on a vast rural estate in the Victorian environment. "And last night I found myself in the Limmeridge cemetery Normally, people who are dead are dead, just as it is usually the criminals who are locked up in place of the victims, but then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us ... "And we're going to a first class Gothic story about madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great Victorian mystery novel. It is a good idea to pay close attention, because there are plots within the plots, but all focus on a clever and ruthless scheme that involves, what else, money, lots of money. <br /> <br /> Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister, Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell) are dedicated to each other. Marion is fierce and protective; Laura is softer and much more romantic. Marion does not have her own money; Laura will inherit riches when she is of age. Marion has no prospects for marriage that we know of; Laura has been engaged some time with Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), a too charming aristocrat. They are the rooms of his uncle, a restless, condescending and immensely egocentric hypochondriac (Ian Richardson). Everything seems to be quite routine, but then a young artist, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln), is dedicated to teaching them the drawing and the artistic appreciation. And when it arrives at night at the local train station, there is no transport, so it goes to the farm on foot. In the dark forest he meets a strange woman, dressed in white, wandering and talking about things he does not understand, which then disappear. Are we restless? Yes, and also he and the sisters when they realize that the strange woman looks a lot like Laura. Later, does the love between Walter and Laura arise? Does a bud bloom? Is there a misunderstanding that dismisses Walter and makes Laura marry Sir Percival? A canker gnaw? And the secrets slowly come to light about the relations between Laura, Marian and the woman in white ... we learn to deeply suspect Sir Percival's intentions ... we come to enjoy the style and manners of the intimate friend of Sir Percival, Count Fosco (Simon Callow) ... and finally we realize the depths of depravity, as well as the power of honor and true love, that humanity is capable of doing? Do we visit Victorian insane asylums, see falls from tall towers, dig open tombs in the middle of the night and observe how punishment comes in the midst of the flames of a locked church? <br /> <br /> Well, of course, and it's a great trip for us. <br /> <br /> This BBC / Masterpiece Theater program features excellent performances and outstanding production values. Adjusting Collins' novel of more than 500 pages to a television program of less than 120 minutes means that it had to be reduced or abbreviated a lot, and some changes were made with the greatest likelihood of having a greater impact in the limited time available. Still, in its own terms, the production of The Woman in White, in my opinion, works very well as a dark, romantic and bad-tempered television story. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a dominant performance as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever feat of letting us slowly see the depraved slime under the skin, which still has charm in the midst of villainy. Ian Richardson as young men's uncle almost steals the show. It gives a performance so authoritarian and penetrating that almost unbalances the story every time it appears. Perhaps the weakest of the main parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco. The Count is simply a monster, however, a highly civilized and charming one. Collins described it as an immense circumference. Callow does a good job, but I'm missing a bit of the monstrosity of evil. <br /> <br /> At one point, Marian tells us: "My sister and I are very fond of gothic novels, sometimes we act as if we were in them". Little did he know what awaited Laura and her.
