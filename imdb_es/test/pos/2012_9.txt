I enjoyed this show, I was in the UK, but not at rush hour, and they seemed to move it at all times, so I could not see them all. I was surprised when he did not come back and I had no idea why, I still do not know, but I think that's not important. <br /> <br /> Great performances of the two potential customers, they were very credible as friends. The two supporting actresses also added well to the mix. I guess it was part of a lot of shows that were focused on lifestyle, with Friends being the obvious one, but sex in the city appeared a few years later. <br /> <br /> The characters, have a coffee, drink in good bars, that kind of thing, a little woody in some way.
