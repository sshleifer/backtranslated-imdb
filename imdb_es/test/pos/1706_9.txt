To paraphrase Thora Birch: "I like this movie, it's exactly the opposite of everything I hate in a movie." <br /> <br /> This dark film was too discreet and smart to get a theatrical premiere, any chance of success would have needed an expensive promotional campaign. And a story of coming of age where nothing spectacular happens, where, instead, the focus is on the development of the character, has a limited target audience. Who has heard of a movie for mature teenagers? <br /> <br /> But if you have the opportunity to see this or if you can get rid of a few dollars for the DVD, you could do much worse. "The Wife of my teacher" is not revolutionary, but it has a lot in its favor and it holds up well in repeated presentations. <br /> <br /> Jason London (as high school student Todd Boomer) is the star and fits this character as well as his parts in "The Man In The Moon" and "Dazed and Confused." He is helped by the exceptional work of his supporting cast. Tia Carrere in the lead role is a revelation (she can act) as Todd's calculation tutor and amorous interest. Christopher McDonald as the teacher in a good self parody performance. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee as Todd's best friends, and Jeffrey Tabor as his father. <br /> <br /> As someone commented earlier, this is a "mature" teen movie because romantic relationships are universally unsuccessful, at least by traditional standards of happy ending. Even Todd's parents are indifferent to each other, with his father panting after the title character and his mother (Leslie Lyles) literally on the phone throughout his time on the screen (a device that provides increasing relief in comedy with each successive appearance). The romance between London and Carrere has an unexpected charm and is much more believable than any other story of an older woman I can find. <br /> <br /> But the true strength of the film is the evolving relationship of the three friends. There is not an overloaded melodrama here, only three immature people who alternate between trying and trusting each other, subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing. In fact, they manage to achieve a "credible" relationship of three people, perhaps the first in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
