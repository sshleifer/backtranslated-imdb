My family and I usually do not see local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack depth and are simply not worth it. <br /> <br /> The trailer for "Nasaan ka man" caught my attention. Attention, my daughter-in-law and my daughter's, so we took some time to see him this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the performance impressive. Jericho Rosales was really very good, also Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo shows that he was effective in his role. Never before had I been so moved, moved and affected by a local movie. Imagine a cynic like me cleaning my eyes at the end of the movie? Congratulations to Star Cinema !! All right, Jericho and Claudine!
