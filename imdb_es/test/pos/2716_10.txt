I resisted seeing 15 Park Avenue despite the recommendations, dismissing the film as a clich√© subject of extreme emotional dramas and exaggerated performances. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, movies like 15 Park Avenue come and sweep their feet. <br /> <br /> The film captures your attention very soon and there is not a moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job in hitting the audience to every line of the film. The impeccable development of the character, the "correct" amount of emotions and an enigmatic ending to match everything ... <br /> <br /> I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly interprets the schizophrenic mithi . He again exceeds expectations after page-3 and Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. The role of Professor Anjali is very well developed and Shabana does full justice to the character. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chaya, Waheeda Rehman add an incredible flavor to the film. <br /> <br /> I define "shower moments" as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you think about your shower incessantly, until your wife / girlfriend / mom knocks on the door. 15PA offers many "shower moments", especially the conversation between Anjali and her mother, where the mother is cautious when talking with Anjali about her thoughts. Immediately reveals the personality of Anjali to the public. <br /> <br /> The ending is a very bold statement by the director; probably too westernized for the Indian audience; however, it offers the elements to promote the film from a "good" to an "excellent" state.
