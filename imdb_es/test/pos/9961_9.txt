The Merchant of Venice is a fantastic movie. He is very faithful to the original work of Shakespeare. If you saw Jeremy Irons in Casanova and you liked his performance, this is a movie for you! If you saw Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare in Love and enjoyed his performance, this is a movie for you! If you saw Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco and you liked his performance, this is a movie for you! It's a very nice movie and if you're studying Shakespeare like me, this is a great movie to watch! The only problem with this movie is that you can not let the little ones see it because it has a bit of nudity. But other than that, it's a really good movie!
