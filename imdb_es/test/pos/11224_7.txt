The images control this movie. The characters, although interesting, finally take a back seat. The first scene I remember is a black and white framed photo of the ocean, which then opens to full screen and color. The bubbling of the water gives way to a small coffin that breaks the surface. The theme of the film here is that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the living. <br /> <br /> Water as a final conscience, as a tool of God, is used here to force people to put their "houses" in order (day of final judgment). The dead must be taken into account and raised to a better place. What one has left unresolved or unresolved will be eliminated. There is no clinging to the past, to a hidden memory of what it was. <br /> <br /> This movie has been compared to O, Brother where you are, and the threat of water and its use as a cleaning force is similar to that movie. What is different in this film is that the arrival of water is knowable and, again, the emphasis is on what to do with the here and now. <br /> <br /> I agree that some of the scenes are reminiscent of a work by David Lynch. Take, for example, the segment of the dinner with the androgynous waitress and deep voice. One has the same surreal feel of the configuration and the strange character as the one with the upside down speaker in the Fire Starter scene. The difference is that Lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of a character with problems, while this film seems to use surreal elements to create a moral message. Men in black suits can not have what they want, they must be patient and accept what is available.
