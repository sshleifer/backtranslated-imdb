"I know I'm human, and if you were all these things, then you would only attack me right now, so some of you are still human." He does not want to show himself, he wants to hide in an Imitation, he'll fight if necessary, but it's vulnerable to the weather, if he dominates us, then he will not have any more enemies, there will be no one left to kill him, and then he wins. "<br /> <br />" The Thing "by John Carpenter is one of the movies of terror more entertaining? Fast, smart and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all the films of the genre should be made. <br /> <br /> The film, which took place in Antarctica in 1982, focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. No introduction is given to his mission, but we are pushed into his existence when a pair of seemingly insane Norwegians appear at their base camp, chasing a dog that escaped. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way to the colony, which is when things really go crazy. <br /> <br /> It soon becomes quite clear that the "dog" is actually a change of form. A strange organism that manifests itself in the physical form of its victims? In other words, he begins to eat Americans and imitate them so well that the remaining humans can not discern the difference between their friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> The group of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for their own survival, using ingenuity instead of muscular strength. If the thing is really between them, then how are they going to reveal it? How many things are there How can you kill the thing? (Or can it be destroyed at all?) <br /> <br /> The origins of the creature in the film are easily explained: thirty thousand years ago, a spaceship fell to Earth and froze in the Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered on the ice by the Norwegians, who unknowingly freed him from his natural prison. <br /> <br /> "The Thing", the movie itself, is similar to the iconic "Alien of Ridley Scott." (1979) Many comparisons have been made: The protagonists are stranded in a desolate area, harassed by an enemy that is rarely seen and who manages to kill them one by one, however, "The Thing"? practical purposes ?? came first. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous story "Who's going?" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (written under the pseudonym Don A. Stuart), the film was adapted Originally as a feature film production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby, the result was "The Otherworldly Thing," an undisputed classic, but to be fair, it was little like the short story, and Carpenter's remake makes him more justice. <br /> <br /> The idea that the Thing is able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this film so Cool, and is the most vital link to the short story. the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably represent the organism that ca mbia of form, but thirty-one years brought many advances in SFX. <br /> <br /> Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily turned into a cheesy gore-fest into an alarmingly frightening (and realistic) blood-and-scare mess. The Thing, although never really takes a specific form, is constantly in a stage of transformation, and the effects are simply excellent. They still have a good blow twenty two years later. <br /> <br /> The score of Ennio Morricone (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit too electronic and small, but nevertheless it is disturbing when used correctly. <Br /> <br /> From the fact that its cast consists entirely of men, even the fact that its ending is one of the most appealing and most atypical conclusions of all time, "The Thing"? by any standard? Hollywood is unconventional at its best. It's no wonder that, at the time of its release, "The Thing" performed poorly in theaters and in "E.T." ?? Launched the same year and presenting a much more friendly extraterrestrial ?? it became the highest grossing image of the two (by far). <br /> <br /> However, in the long run, "The Thing" is superior in almost every possible way. Spielberg's story is outdated and unsuccessful during its Relaunching of its twentieth anniversary. "The thing", on the other hand, has it gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics? It is one of the most famous non famous movies that have been made. <br /> <br /> Carpenter is famous for having a very uneven career. from his amazing "Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the disappointing and foolish "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" is still his best movie. Although his reputation over the years has never been honorable enough to get a place on most "great movie" lists, "The Thing" is still one of my favorite horror movies, and ?? after a close inspection? masterfully done by hand. Is it an exciting and ingenious adventure that, at the same time, is unique and chilling? a genuine relief for moviegoers who are tired of old horror fakes. This, at least, is really unpredictable.
