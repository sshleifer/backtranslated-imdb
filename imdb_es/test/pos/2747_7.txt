Many of the previous comments are right, but some, well, not so much. <br /> <br /> This is not a 'B' movie ... it is well produced, the live flight sequences are really excellent, and the model sequences are first class. It is not a "cheapie". <br /> <br /> Ricard Barthelmess is quite good at this, and is a good companion piece for "Only Angels Have Wings". <br /> <br /> If you want to locate John Wayne, first to J. Carrol Naish, finish together. <br /> <br /> Tom Browne is quite young (and somewhat boring), but when saddled with the most pathetic pencil mustache in Hollywood history. It makes your character even less believable. Sally Eilers is much more. <br /> <br /> Regarding the later influences, this is Wellman in the initial zone of Airliner-in-Distress ... the opening sequence of this film, with the type of Operations of the airline arriving at the " Grand Central Airport "would fit very well in" The High and the Mighty "... imagine Regis Toomey ... and a 1955 Buick.
