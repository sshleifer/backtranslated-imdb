From the opening sequence, full of black and white shots reminiscent of the photos of Gordan Parks, this film takes the viewer to a sense of artistic rebirth. The backdrop of a poetry caf√© called "The Sanctuary" provides just that. The jazz that permeates the film and the cinematography will seduce you. <br /> <br /> This love story allows love to grow, evolve and finally mature, a rarity in Hollywood. Everyone can identify with some stage of their journey to the other. This story of two artists who simply can not get together provoked a debate among their viewers. Should I have left? Should I have stopped her? Who know ...? <br /> <br /> Starring Larenz Tate (Darius Lovehall), and Nia Long (Nina Moseley) with a performance by Isiah Washington (Savon) and Lisa Nicole Carson (Josie Nichols) as Best Friend, this movie is a romantic jewel. <br /> <br /> Look at this with someone you love (wink).
