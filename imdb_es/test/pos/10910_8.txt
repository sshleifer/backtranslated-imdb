Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches English in high school in a small town in Indiana. Finally he is going to marry Emily (Joan Cusack), to the delight of his parents. The town is also full, because one of their own, Cameron (Matt Dillon) has been nominated for an acting Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, is watching the Academy Awards on television while Cameron is declared the winner! In his acceptance speech, Cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay soldier, in part, because of the lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school. You guessed it, it's Howard! But, Howard has never "left"; In fact, he believes he is straight! With the whole city and members of the media, waiting and watching the events, will Howard and Emily go ahead and get married? Or is Howard really gay and realizes he can not continue with the ceremony? This is a wonderful, fun and human movie about a gay man and his situation. Like the man who did not realize he was gay, Kline is excellent and moving. The rest of the cast is just as good, with Cusack a stitch like the mixed boyfriend and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck and others, also to delight the audience. The costumes are very beautiful and the setting in the lovely heart of Indiana is beautiful. Then, too, the script, the direction and the production are very, very nice. But, undoubtedly, the insightful, humorous and reflective vision of the gay population is the best asset of the film. For those who would be offended by a gay-themed movie, yes, just skip this one. But, for all those who want to laugh with gusto, and get a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time, this is definitely the best movie that exists.
