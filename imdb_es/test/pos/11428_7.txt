If you want to see a movie starring Stan Laurel of the comedies Laurel & Hardy, this is not the movie for you. Stan would not begin to find the character and rhythms of those movies for another two years. However, if you want a good farce of Rudolph Valentino BLOOD AND SAND, which was made the previous year, this is the movie for you. All the stops are removed, both in physical comedy and in the title cards and, if the film is not held together by the character, the plot of the Valentino film is used, more or less.
