Personally, I consider "The Egyptian" in an extremely favorable light. <br /> <br /> I was introduced by a well-known Australian film critic and commentator named Bill, who was recognized for his insight and broad vision of the people. And places and particularly movies. This film fit perfectly with Bill and I came to appreciate his comment and enthusiasm for this film that came up even more as I watched it, as I was literally attracted to it, minute by minute, beyond its introductory comments, in my initial visualization Many years ago. <br /> <br /> For me, it was propelled, layer by layer, in half an hour, to a fascinating and fascinating production! Yes, I am aware of your shortcomings! But was it so tempting ?? The young man of idealism learning and inspired by his father? The peasant treated as garbage in his suffering? the opportunistic friend however defective but loved by his friend, the central character Sinute? and, no doubt, a defective hero too, like many in the humanity of all societies and at all times, but also worthy of being loved and worthy of love! Yes, I believe in a Christian God, but also, I recognize the rights and respect that are due to ANY good-hearted human being, who would not or will not respect the rights of their fellow men without a just cause. As such, I support this film and its presentation of a man with a good heart and conviction in his belief in the sun god he was dedicated to. Such people will always be welcome in my vision of the world and, hopefully, in many beyond. <br /> <br /> So also, the drama in the movie that I have often seen as surely as it has touched my heart and my soul. As sure as he seems to have infuriated critics in his time. It is captivating, to observe the struggles, the grief and the loves of Sinute, the doctor! When I see him again, I always remember my heart friend Bill, the film critic, who dared to oppose ALL the critics who despised him a long time ago. Did you add criticism to too many critics? they make statues to honor the stars, on the screen or in the story, but they do not make statues to honor the critics! And beyond all this, it reminds me every time I watch a SUPERB & TOUCHING show, a beautiful and well presented drama, which was not only relevant for the 1950s or in a bygone era. I was destined to YOU ​​and ME, through time and place, to every man, woman, child, and their personal aspirations of love and freedom and overcoming the obstacles to the misunderstanding and the injustice and tragedy that attract those of the the simple faith of many religions, which seems too much consideration as a cause of war! Take a night free of invitations or unjust violence, attacks of intolerance and judgment against others executed unjustly and consider the merits of this offer. Not the god of the sun, or the power that proves again and again to be so transcendent ... let this outstanding film bathe you, like waves on a beach, like the hands of time. how life was meant to be. And maybe, you will find yourself in your world of possibilities! The lost offerings no more! 9.9 out of 10!
