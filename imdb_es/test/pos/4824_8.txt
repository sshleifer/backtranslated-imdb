I saw part of this movie on the science fiction channel, but I missed the end. I bought the DVD to see the whole movie, and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> A young mother and her two daughters move into a house in an area of ​​forest that they inherited from their husband, who died of a disease. It is very deteriorated, but the three women take advantage of it. A local child warns the teenage daughter (Scout Taylor-Compton) about the zombies that come out at night. She ignores him, but since he has a nice friend, she joins his group. Meanwhile, the youngest daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) befriends a zombie girl her age called Mary. It turns out that Mary and several other children died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor. Now that they are zombies, they attack and kill anyone who is not a blood relative. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by J.S. Cardone, whose previous films include The Slayer (1981) and Shadowzone (1990), two films that I did not like in the least. That's why I was surprised that I actually enjoyed this movie. The movie is deliberately rhythmic, which I liked. This allows you to meet the main characters, most of whom are nice. Child zombies have been used at least since George Romero's 1968 classic, Night of the Living Dead. Even so, I found interesting the zombies for children that use tools in this film. It seems that Cardone finally found the correct script and cast. Only the stereotyped scenes of teenagers smoking, drinking and kissing in a parked car were boring. <br /> <br /> Taylor-Compton also appears in the Halloween remake. Moretz appeared in The Amityville Horror (2005) and in the horror film Room 6 (2006).
