A great movie about the triumph over all the negativists who try to kill your spirit, achieving the impossible. I will not continue with that, just to say that I liked to reflect on this film when I face something particularly disheartening, and realize that if Lindberg could do what he did, I can certainly face the task before me. . Definitely a "feel good" movie. <br /> <br /> See it. You will not be disappointed.
