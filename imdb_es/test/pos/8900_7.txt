I was a big fan of Asterix comics when I was a kid and I saw them all. I never knew about this movie when it was released, but I saw it with my children last night. I remembered the comic book well enough to know that much was added to the story of the movie. Some of the changes I thought were a little cheesy (like the "modern" dance of the nephew and the Viking chief's daughter, almost everything about her), but I found it funny enough. The most important thing, seeing the reactions of my children, confirmed that the film satisfied its target audience. As a family movie, it works better than other Asterix titles I've seen. Many of the names that were not in the book I found had the same appeal as the ones that were. In general, a nice family movie, regardless of whether you are asterix fan or not.
