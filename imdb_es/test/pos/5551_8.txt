The debut film by Lauren Himmel is well directed, with a nice polished touch. There is a solid story in progress with a significant point to all this, even if in the end nothing is resolved, hence the name Water to step on. The plot revolves around a lesbian couple and their battle with mothers for acceptance. 7.5 / 10
