Citizen Kane ... The Godfather Part II ... D'Urville Martin's Dolemite. This is the largest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed on humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that transcends stars of the Academy Awards as Dolemite, the most evil cat in the universe. Clearly, he does not take any jive from any turkey (I unfortunately am a turkey myself) and he shows it with his powers of rapping, procuring and cutting karate. This is the blaxplotaci√≥n in its maximum expression, a shining example of the sort with its low budget, its errors of continuity and its hatred to the people who eat soup of rats. The real godfather of rap (not this new nonsense of Ali) Moore is a kind of juxtaposition of acting technique; somehow managing to be the worst charismatic actor of the 70s, and that is saying something. This is the people highly recommended, if it were not for the one line.
