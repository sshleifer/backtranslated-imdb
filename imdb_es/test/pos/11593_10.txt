This small, calm and harmonious film becomes a masterpiece about human dignity. It is intelligently structured, full of small significant details and important lateral diagrams. Tells the story of a man with great humanity without positioning himself politically, but promoting life as a precious right (not an obligation) and underlining the right of the individual to choose. Enjoy the richness of different landscapes (mental and physical) and languages ​​(important detail). Outstanding performance of each of the actors, especially the incredible Javier Bardem. His presence on the screen has such a force that you forget that this is fiction. The movie has a wonderful rhythm, it is beautifully filmed and outstandingly directed. Real talent is needed to make a film about such a difficult subject with understanding, humor and heart. Six stars in five.
