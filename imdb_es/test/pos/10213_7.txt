I saw it years ago, and it's entertaining, but not profound. The basic story is that of a young man who dreams of Midian, although he is not sure where he is or even if he really exists. <br /> <br /> The Spoilers follow: finally he visits him, he transforms into a Nightbreed creature by being bitten by another. Then, he has to help the other members of Nightbreed because they are being attacked by Canadians. (Except for the accents, they all act like Good Ol 'Boys, not very in tune with the Canadian psyche, huh?) Someone observed by "monsters" or "Nightbreed", "substitutes for" Jews, "and by Canadians / humans, substitute "Nazis", and you're supposed to get an idea of ​​the monsters' fight against humans, well, maybe. <br /> <br /> One of the main objections I had was that while the The underground city was interesting, it was quite run-down and, frankly, it was dirty, this must be a convention for movies with underground settlements.One would think that if the monsters were good, some would have at least some decoration. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit thin, but that is to introduce characters, but it is entertaining enough for a repeated sight.
