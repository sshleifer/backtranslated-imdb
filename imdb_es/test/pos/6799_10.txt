It is a beautiful movie. The scenes are well represented. The dialogues of Anne Revere are very well written and inspired, the philosophy and thoughts that this film offers and the things it teaches make it great and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney is great in the movie and his role goes through a great emotional upheaval as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor looks very pretty, her scenes in the film are intrinsically poetic, the way the camera follows her and the way the music makes each scene feel its ethereal beauty. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great spirit and a precious and beloved classic. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is quite funny in her role although unrecognizable if she has seen her in the role of 'm' in 'the Manchurian candidate'. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp has played his father completely in justice and the script provides him with many things to justify his role. <br /> <br /> It is a very beautiful film and a must see for family and children, a favorite of always green Christmas.
