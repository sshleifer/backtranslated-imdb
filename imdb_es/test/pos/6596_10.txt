When the Bicentennial came, I was in Hershey, PA and part of the Middletown skating team. We did nothing, except skate, trying to learn what we were reading in the pages of Skateboarder magazine. A couple of local hills provided all the speed movements you could handle. At that time, Mike Weed was what was fashionable, along with the name of Russ, with hot Z-boys in the queue. It had a GT plastic board (GrenTech) with Power Paw urethane wheels (loose bearings). <br /> <br /> My parents told me that we were moving to California later that year and that they were going to make a trip to go home. hunting. That summer I was a very good son and he asked me if I could not be rewarded with a REAL skateboard from California. They were delivered. It was a fiberglass mallet with the Surfer magazine logo on it. Wide trucks and big red wheels (precision bearings, I do not know). They got it at Oak Street, a surf shop in Laguna Beach. <br /> <br /> When I arrived in California (all 13), Anaheim had the Concrete Wave and Carlsbad also had a large park. Soon Odyssey Skateboard arrived at Mission Viejo. An indoor park with all imaginable scenarios. All the time I was reading about Stacy, Shogu, Tony and Jay. This movie was right on the money and a wonderful experience to watch.
