When I was in the 10th grade, my friend and I woke up late at home, we went around the wire and started watching this movie. We saw it because it seemed kind of funny and because it had boobs. But then the end came and we sat completely speechless. I think after a minute of watching the credits roll, he just whined "Oh, man ..." Go from the teenage comedy of the 80s to a nihilistic realism so fast that it takes you by surprise. I have tried to rent this movie for years and I have not been able to find it, and nobody has seen it, except me and my friend, so it seems. But now it's available! I recommend renting it and get ready.
