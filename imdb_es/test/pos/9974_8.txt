'The Merchant of Venice' is one of Shakespeare's best-known works and is still performed regularly in the theater. Incredibly, however, this movie seems to be the first English version made for the cinema instead of the television. There were several versions made in Great Britain or America during the first days of the cinema, but all were silent. <br /> <br /> The reason for this abandonment of the work may be related to the sensitivities about the alleged games. Anti-Semitism, a theme that has been even more sensitive since the Nazis' rise to power in 1933. (This may explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era, in 1908 or 1922 it would have been easier to portray Shylock as a simple villain of what it would be today). However, in my opinion, the film is not at all anti-Semitic. It must be remembered that during the life of Shakespeare there was not a Jewish community established in England; the Jews were expelled by Edward I at the end of the thirteenth century and were not allowed to return until the time of Cromwell, some forty years after the death of Shakespeare. As far as we know, Shakespeare never traveled abroad, so it seems quite possible that he himself has never personally known any Jew or experienced the effects of anti-Semitism first-hand. The work is not simply about the Jewish question, but is, among other things, an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudices. In fact, it may be a codified examination of the mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England (something that Shakespeare certainly would have had first-hand experience) and a call for greater tolerance among them. <br /> <br /> Then, as now, traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes have always represented Jews as greedy, but Shylock's main sin is not greed; If so, he would certainly have accepted Bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats, twice the amount lent by Antonio. Rather, the sin that besets Shylock is anger, and the root of his anger is the way the Christians of Venice treat him and his Jewish compatriots. In general, Jews are not only considered second-class citizens, but Jewish moneylenders such as Shylock are particular targets of abuse, although the services they provide are necessary for the Venetian economy. The work shows the corrupt effects of prejudice. Opinions of this kind not only corrupt the Christians who sustain them, but they can also corrupt Jews who suffer abuse. Shylock's revenge is out of all proportion to the evils she has suffered. When he spits at him and calls him a dog, Antonio behaves like a grumpy fanatic, but grumpiness and fanaticism are not generally considered crimes that deserve the death penalty. In addition, Shylock seeks to take revenge on Antonio, not only for the undoubted mistakes that Antonio has made against him, but also for all the ills, real and imagined, that he has suffered at the hands of the Christian community, such as the marriage of his daughter. to lorenzo. <br /> <br /> It's to the credit of the film's director, Michael Radford and his star, Al Pacino, that they understand all of these themes. Pacino's Shylock has, initially, a kind of dignified anger about him that gradually gives way to a vengeful anger and, finally, after his humiliation in the judgment scene by Portia's reasoning, to pathos. We see clearly that he has been the instrument of his own destruction, but we can still sympathize with him. In my opinion, none of Pacino's performances that I have seen has matched those he gave in the first two films of "The Godfather" (not "The smell of a woman", for which he won an Oscar, and certainly not "Godfather III"), but "The Merchant of Venice is the one that comes closest to those points of reference. The other performance that stood out was the luminous Portia of Lynn Collins, who expressed her lines with great clarity and simplicity, and highlighted the intelligence and ingenuity that make her character more than a simple romantic heroine. I was less impressed by Jeremy Irons' Antonio, who seemed too passive. Antonio is a complex character; part loyal friend, contemplative melancholy part, religious fanatic part and enterprising capitalist part. Although Irons captured the first two aspects, it was difficult to imagine that Antonio would spit at someone of another faith or risk everything in risky commercial ventures. <br /> <br /> Radford's interpretation of the play was attacked by the film critic of the "Daily Telegraph" who, although he admired Pacino's performance, did not like the configuration of the period and argued that Shakespeare needs to be placed in a contemporary setting if it is to have 'relevance' for a modern audience, citing a recent theatrical production that established action in Weimar Germany. I would not agree deeply with this approach. Theater and film are quite different media and, although there have been some surprising modernist approaches to Shakespeare in cinema (Trevor Nunn's "Twelfth Night" comes to mind), a traditionalist approach is often the best. (I preferred, for example, 'Romeo and Juliet' from Zeffirelli to Baz Luhrmann). The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare in a modern way is pure intellectual laziness; we are not prepared to make the effort to see our best writer in the context of the Elizabethan society that produced it, but to prefer it disguised as an Ersatz man of the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Radford's traditional approach not only allows us to appreciate that fanaticism and revenge are ancient and universal problems, but they are also a visually stunning film. In the work, the scenes set in Venice itself are characterized by a turbulent action; those located in the country house of Portia in Belmont are happier and calmer. In the film, the Venetian exterior scenes were filmed in a place with a background of gray and cloudy skies, similar to the aspect achieved in "Do not look now". The interiors in the light of the candles, with faces lit on a dark background, recall the effects of chiaroscuro in a Caravaggio painting; I suspect that this was quite deliberate, since Caravaggio was a contemporary of Shakespeare. In contrast to the dark or foggy Venice, the scenes of Belmont (taken in a charming villa of Palladio on an island in a lake) were characterized by the light of the sun or the peace of the moon. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best adaptations of Shakespeare in recent years; An intelligent and visually appealing look at a complex work. 8/10. <br /> <br /> A couple of mistakes. We see a black swan in the water in front of Portia's house. These birds are native to Australia and were not introduced in Europe until well after 1596, when the film was established. In addition, Portia's portrait in the lead chest is painted in the style of the Florentine Botticelli, who was active approximately a century before that date. Lynn Collins may be reminiscent of Botticelli's beauty, but it seems unlikely that a Venetian lady of the late sixteenth century would have painted herself in the manner of Florence at the end of the fifteenth century.
