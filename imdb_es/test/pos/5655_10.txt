Every American who thinks he or she understands World War II should see this movie. Few Hollywood films about the war have challenged the stereotype of Japanese soldiers as emotionless brutes who obey orders without thinking. We like to think that every Japanese was ready and able to fight to the death, until the day we bombed Nagasaki. "Fires in the plain" shows a different reality: troops with little support, demoralized and hungry until cannibalism. Euphemistically they refer to human flesh as "monkey meat". The film and the novel it was based on also killed the myth that all Japanese soldiers preferred death to surrender: they had good reason to believe that their enemies were not in the mood to take prisoners. For me, a question arises that most Americans would prefer to avoid: if the Japanese army was so dejected at this time of war, why was it necessary to attack Hiroshima?
