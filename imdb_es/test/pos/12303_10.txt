Writers and directors, by the nature of their craft, back off a framework of action in their work to show ideas about characters and situations. Here, Huston and Joyce have retreated a larger picture to show us the definitive vision of what it means to be human. Until the end, the film seems not to be much, the kind of typical circumstances that fill everyday life. It is not until the end of the final scene that we realize that, in fact, it is all about. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to see this final scene without simultaneously feeling compassion and also a deep affection, because of oneself and the rest of the similar ones.
