This film easily rivals the emotional force, the dramatic impact and the excellent performances of "12 Angry Men". I rented it on a whim and I was surprised I had not heard it before. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this was Emilio Estévez's directorial debut, but the rhythm, interaction and development of the characters as well as the smart camera work that surrounds the character that Estévez plays, all They suggest a natural eye. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry that we saw on Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation of his characters in "At stake in the fields of the Lord". She is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are some moments in which I feel that the plot diminishes a little and the moments between Estévez and his ex-girlfriend seem written for someone else. In the film, Estévez comes out as another character all together. But those are minor complaints. <br /> <br /> This movie must be based on a true story or it must have been written by someone who has lived through these experiences. I rate it with 8 out of 10 difficult. <br /> <br />
