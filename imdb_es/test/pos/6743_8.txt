In April of 1947, the city of New York faced an epidemic crisis. Eugene LaBar, a carpet importer who came from Mexico, had arrived in the city, bringing with him the deadly smallpox virus. He tripped over a bus, complained of fever and headache, and soon died in a Midtown hospital, but not before infecting a dozen bystanders. The damage was already done; For the first time in decades, smallpox lurked the streets of New York. The city's health authorities acted quickly to isolate the sick and contain the virus, and a free vaccination campaign was approved that saw more than six million New Yorkers immunized against smallpox. Thanks to its rapid response, the virus was contained with a minimum of victims. The outbreak, however, must have left an indelible mark; several years later he was followed by two black film thrillers of a similar theme, in which doctors must locate a single contagious airline in a city of millions of people: The panic in the streets of Elia Kazan. (1950) 'and Earl McEvoy's low budget' The Killer That Stalked New York (1950) '. <br /> <br /> McEvoy's film takes place in an unattractive docu-drama style. Reed Hadley's narrative sounds as if it had been taken directly from a newscast, reciting facts as if they were reading the official transcript of the police. This technique feels a bit cheap at times, but fortunately the narration is largely limited to the bookends of the film, in addition to providing some explanatory padding during pauses in the plot. The "killer" that stalks New York, in this story, is not an importer of rugs from Mexico, but the beautiful diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Keyes), who has just arrived from Cuba. A few days later, Sheila has two parties that pursue her independently: a treasury agent (Barry Kelley) who seeks to arrest her for contraband crimes, and a team of doctors (led by William Bishop) who have identified her as the source of the smallpox outbreak. As in 'Panic in the Streets', an otherwise routine chase is given a greater sense of urgency, especially when those who chase it initially have no idea of ​​the identity or appearance of their suspect. <br /> <br /> 'Killer That Stalked New York, for the most part, manages to bypass its low production budget. Apart from a few select lines of dialogue ("we have to stop it!", Dr. Wood exclaims at one point, as if making a difficult decision), the filmmakers and cast members allow the story to unfold in a Realistic and fascinating way. In fact, in this sense, the low budget may help the intentions of the film, needing a documentary style that adds to the immediacy of the outbreak scenario. Evelyn Keyes is excellent in the main role, showing stubborn resistance to unimaginable torment; At the end of the film, she appears so brutally incapacitated by her illness that it is almost painful to look at her face. Apart from the virus, Charles Korvin is the main villain of the piece, since the greedy and adulterous husband of Sheila, who is calm, receives everything that comes close. And if all the nurses looked like Dorothy Malone, maybe catching smallpox would not seem like a bad opportunity, after all.
