When commenting on this film, one must realize that it is based on a true story and, therefore, should be reviewed for the quality and accuracy of its representation of events, as well as its entertainment value. It may be unlikely that Jack Shepherd surrenders twice to Jack Wild because Wild had captured Edgeworth Bess. However, it happened. It should also be borne in mind that the director was young and inexperienced, which explains why he relied on proven and proven techniques. There were times when Clavell did not have the confidence to follow the script as written. The movie would be better if it had. And yes, I used to have a copy of the script (copy of Stanley Baker, one of five), which I recently returned to my father, the writer, Rafe Newhouse.
