It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if someone is confused about his past (for example, how he ended up in the same hospital where Hurley was), then you should know that Libby died in season 2 and that the character it will be explored. more in season 3 and we will get answers to the questions that surround it. <br /> <br /> By the way, great episode. I had a lot of suspense and some interesting questions ... like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four-toed statue? <br /> <br /> I can not wait until season 3, ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ I can not wait until season 3, Lost simply rules! I hope all the unanswered questions are answered. I loved how they explained why the plane really crashed. Desmond did it when he could not write the numbers on time. 4 8 15 16 23 42
