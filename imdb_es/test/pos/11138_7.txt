I was surprised to see this on television on Friday, and I enjoyed it. Between the presence of Bobbie Phillips and the numerous references to everything that could be considered "cyberpunk", this was a fun movie to watch. I enjoyed the story, it reminded me of a book I read ("Earth", David Brin), and it was fun to watch it on TV. Bobbie looks great, but I also enjoyed his performance as Kam because he seemed different to everyone else. But the best thing about this movie was the atmosphere described in the books by Gibson, Sterling and others. It was fun to watch it on television.
