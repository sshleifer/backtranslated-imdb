Not all movies should have that predictable ending to which we are all accustomed, and it's great to see movies with really unusual twists. However, having said that, I was very disappointed at the end of the apartment. In my opinion, the ending really did not fit the rest of the movie and basically destroyed the story that was told. <br /> <br /> You spend the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings, but the events in the last 2 minutes of the film would have had a big impact on everyone's character, but the film ends and leaves it too open . <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was very well made and, unlike similar movies, like Serendipity All the scenes were believable and did not go unnoticed.
