I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a relaxing, fun and stimulating movie. The absence of sex, vulgarity and violence contributed to a very pleasant evening. I especially enjoyed the Buffalo scene, but probably because I live a short distance away. Even so, this movie could have been produced in any city; It is the issue that is so important here. I'm just grateful that Manna From Heaven fell on us. Try it ... you will like it!
