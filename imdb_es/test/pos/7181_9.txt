The second film (not animated) about the only people who still refuse to surrender to the Roman Empire is even more fun than the first film "Asterix and Obelix contre Ceasar". <br /> <br /> Where the first movie got all the laughs because all the cartoon characters were perfectly brought to life without losing their cartoon identity, this sequel (which is a separate story, like all comics) is even better. Of course, all the ingredients found in the first film and in the comics are present again: Obelix is ​​still dying to try the "magic potion" that gives his other members of the tribe such enormous powers, Caesar and the rest of the Romans. The empire remains the number 1 enemy, but some new and refreshing elements have also been brought to the stage. <br /> <br /> Not only is it a very idyllic setting (the most important part is played in Egypt) but it is more than just a replay of the movie. Number one, some extras have been added by making all kinds of references to other movies (Bruce Lee, etc.). All this is not very new, but the unexpected combination of the known history of the comic (with almost the same title as the movie) and the references to things that have absolutely nothing to do with Asterix and Obelix really work. <Br /> <br /> In this way, the film is based on a tradition of comic book writers Goscinny and Uderzo, who did not hesitate to bring Laurel and Hardy to the stage and even dedicate a complete story to Kirk Douglas. <br /> <br /> If all this does not convince you to watch this movie, I'm sure that Monica Bellucci will play Cleopatra ...
