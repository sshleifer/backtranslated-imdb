I've noticed that people have asked if anyone has this show. I have the 26 episodes that aired in the US UU And I will be willing to share them with anyone interested. All I need is for you to supply the VHS tapes or the blank DVDs I have in both formats and pay for the shipping. My email is creator67@pipinternet.net, just send me an email and your request, we will notify you and we can make the arrangements. The quality is very good and they are very nice to watch, especially if you have not been able to watch them since they were broadcast in the 60s. It was one of my favorite shows as a child and I have a very special place in my heart because it brings back many memories from my childhood, as well as other programs such as Ultraman and Astroboy. <br /> <br /> Peter
