The red powder is both well acted and well done, but what the film is about I think it bores many viewers like me. There was a movie that came out earlier called "in my country" with Sam Jackson and was not so well received, and both films were almost exactly the same, I think the red powder was better because of the most interesting performances, especially for the future winner Oscar, Chiwton Ejofor, but the plot is only non-existent, it starts quite strong, but then the film reaches the audience with innumerable sessions of uninteresting courtroom, this could have been a great movie if the writing was not so deficient. But see if for the performances.
