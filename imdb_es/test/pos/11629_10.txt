I can understand how Barney can be annoying to some, but the hatred he feels is very ridiculous. Barney was simply made from the start and simplicity is not bad, especially for the youngsters he entertains. Personally I find that this show is a very underestimated period. In my opinion, Barney & Friends is a very educational program, and even 17 years after its debut (and almost 21 years after the character's debut in the home video), it shows again and again that it still attracts young children. Maybe less than in the early 90's, where Barney was the Hannah Montana of the time, but it's still a classic. As a Barney fan, I think I should defend it in a way that does not look like spam. The way the purple man teaches things can be very simplistic and unrealistic, but would you rather hear about the war? Thank someone (a dinosaur in disguise, but still) is there to comfort the children and let them be children simply. At this time, I feel we rush our children to grow up and Barney is there to say that you can still be a child at heart. In addition, many of Barney's lessons about current episodes of plagiarism, being honest and yes ... even death, could attract everyone, not just your target audience. In addition, our children need to learn to be kind and respect others for who they are, and he helps them do it. In summary, Barney can be annoying for some people and I understand perfectly why, but I do not give much importance. Everything he and his friends (along with HIT Entertainment, his production company) are trying to do is help children not only to learn the necessary skills, but also to have fun and observe the positive parts of life. If more people would listen to their children's favorite character and see it through their eyes, maybe we would not be so negative with him and possibly with life itself.
