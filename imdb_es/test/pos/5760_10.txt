Why did I vote 10/10 for this movie that is completely foolish *? Simply, because if you allow yourself to find it funny, you can laugh until you hang yourself. Some people may find that it goes too far, it certainly is not for everyone, but every time I'm depressed and need something really stupid to laugh at, ruin Bottom or GHP and I can forget all my problems and be transported in a dark and strange magic world . <br /> <br /> * "completely out of the bowels" is an Australian expression, it has no literal translation.
