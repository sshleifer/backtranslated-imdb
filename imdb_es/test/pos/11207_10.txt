For those who are like me and are used to seeing and enjoying high-budget Hollywood movies, on giant screens with surround sound, this movie seems to be so distant. However, I was surprised at how close it can be to any human being while I see it. It is so natural that you feel that nobody wrote a scenario or that nobody directed it. You are the director and you are writing the scenario while you watch it. For me, the time I spend watching a movie is the only time I go to another world. This movie is the first show for me that shows that it is not always an obligation to see millions of dollars of budgeted movies, surround audio capabilities to go to another world. These movies send you to another world (or maybe they make you come back to yourself) without millions of dollars of budget or technical capabilities. I felt that I am reading L'etranger de Camus.
