I put this second version of "The man who knew too much" in my 10 main Hitchcock films. Along with "Frenzy," it's probably the most discussed movie among Hitchcock fans. I consider it much better than, say, "Rebecca," which has gained an excessive appreciation. <br /> <br /> The film contains many witty scenes (most of them have been mentioned in other reviews), but that is something for Hitchcock. It takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen, but that time is used to prepare the following events, which are full of intriguing suspense. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the clumsy projections later, the only weakness of this movie is the main villain, played by Bernard Miles, who is a fairly flat and underdeveloped character. Fortunately, there is a spooky killer in the form of Reggie Nalder. And Hank, the little boy, is not as irritating as most children in old movies.
