I thought this was a great action movie. A very good role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favorites with Angelina Jolie. In fact, I watched The Good Kiss Goodnight right after watching the new Tomb Raider movie. Did it make me think, Charlie or Lara? Which one would win in a fight? Either way, both women are very strong and intelligent characters that are fun to watch. Especially when they are kicking ass. I just hope to see Geena in another movie soon. It seems that she has been out of focus a little too long. It would be especially nice to see her in another movie with Samuel L. Jackson. Now they make a great duo. Watch this movie if you have not done it. You will not be disappointed.
