** SPOILERS AHEAD ** <br /> <br /> It is really unfortunate that such a well produced film turns out to be a disappointment. I thought that this was full of clichés (fools) and <br /> <br /> that basically they tried. <br /> <br /> To the boys (Americans): how many of you spend your time <br /> <br /> jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds <br /> <br /> ? To the girls (married): how many of you have suddenly gone from the prude to the nymphomaniacs overnight, but not with your husband? <br /> <br />? To the French: would you really ask for someone <br /> <br /> being "à la fac" when you know they do not speak French? Would not you use <br /> <br /> a more common word like "université"? <br /> <br /> I lived in France for a while and somehow I know and understand <br /> <br /> Europe (and I love it), but my roommate (German) and I found this <br> /> <br /> quite insulting in general. It looked like a movie financed by the <br /> <br /> European Parliament, and basically it worked too hard. He had all kinds of differences that he tried to unite (it's not a bad thing in itself) but the result is, at best, uncomfortable, but in fact it's ridiculous ... too <br /> <br /> many clashes that really would not happen. Then, the end of the movie <br /> <br /> - the last 10 minutes - ruined all the rest. Why does not Xavier talk to the Erasmus students he meets in Paris? Why does <br /> <br /> he just leave? Why did you just run away from your job, is that <br /> <br /> "freedom"? And in the end, is it supposed that the new Europe will rest on <br /> <br /> a group of people who smoke and fight all day long? Is this what it is made of? <br /> <br />? <br /> <br /> Also, the performance was pretty horrible. I can not believe Judith <br /> <br /> the role and performance of Godrèche. Why was it made to look like <br /> <br /> both Emanuelle Béart? At first I thought Xavier was fine, but with hindsight, I think it was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> And that's really very bad, because technically (opening credits, <br /> <br /> scenes when you ask what papers you need) it was really <br /> <br /> good ( except for the sound editing around the British brothers), and the soundtrack <br /> <br /> was also great. So the form was good, but the content <br /> <br /> pretty horrible.
