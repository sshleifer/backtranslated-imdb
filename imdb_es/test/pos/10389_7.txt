This is the last feature film that Michelangelo Antonioni directed, with the help of Wim Wenders, and adapts from his collection of stories "That Bowling Alley on the Tiber". Beyond the Clouds contains 4 stories with familiar themes that we have become accustomed to from their previous work, and summarizes these themes in vignettes that are woven through the scenes directed by Wenders that involve the character of The Director of John Malkovich. However, most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth to which we are accustomed in an Antonioni film, while the narration of Malkovich's supposed depth resonated with an unclear definition that sounded a bit pretentious and out of place . <br /> <br /> However, the four stories seem to play in casual encounters, and extremely fast romances that resembled lust at first sight, perhaps due to lack of time (since they are short stories) to allow more Focus on layers to define and carefully create the characters as we know from a typical Antonioni movie. And the obsessive approach here is for the characters to undress to show a lack of deeper connection sacrificed by the immediate satisfaction of the flesh. Maybe this is the point you want to convey with an observation of a more modern relationship? <br /> <br /> The first story, History of a love affair that never existed, tells the romance between Silvano (Kim Rossi Stuart) and Carmen (Ines Sastre), who meet when one asks the other to get to the hotel and then meet in a cafe. It's like Fate is playing games in them when they meet, but they split up and meet again much later, but like the games that people play, it's almost like an L'Avventura or a La Notte with a lack of communication and the expectations of Man. <br /> <br /> The character of the director of John Malkovich takes a central role in the next short film, which showed some really lustful looks towards a girl who works in a store, played by Sophie Marceau. She is deeply disturbed and uncomfortable, but somehow she got up the courage to get close to him, and in what I thought was to scare her, she tells her story that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times. But in an instant, these two are heading towards gymnastics in the bedroom. <br /> <br /> The next short film, Do not Look For Me, is the longest of all, with Peter Weller playing an unfaithful husband who has to choose between his lover (Chiara Caselli) or his wife, played by Fanny Ardant . Perhaps the most star-studded of the lot, with Jean Reno also taking a coda at the end, which expands the small universe in which this short exists. But, unfortunately, Reno's participation was also relegated to a chuckle, as it enters the unlikely domain with fast and romantic entanglements with lasers. There was a key element adapted from L'Eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel, while the introductory story about the history of souls was quite interesting. If there is a negative issue here, this short wants to play, it will be the duplicity of man. <br /> <br /> Between this short and the following was a small scene that brought together our couple from La Notte, Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau, where the former painted a landscape reminiscent of the Red Desert. Finally, we have the final shot This Body of Dirt, with Vincent Perez when he was young going after a girl (Irene Jacob) whom he has just met, and falling in love with her, only to realize that it is a love that is also late. It is a relatively talkative piece, like the first story, with the characters talking while walking through the streets of the city where they are, which reminds us of Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise. <br /> <br /> While in general, the film may have succeeded as individual pieces, it is never compared to a combined effort, since the "excuse" to link them was the exploration by the director of a movie of possible stories and an inspirational aspect for his next movie.
