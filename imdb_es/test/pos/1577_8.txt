If they handed out prizes for the most depraved and disorderly films in the world, Japanese cinema would be cleaned up: its exploitation cinema cleans the floor with most other contenders, the most extreme examples are the absolutely amazing exercises of bad taste and nausea. Gore, freak rarity and misogynistic sex. <br /> <br /> Guts of a Beauty is an excellent example of such filth, which offers viewers more than an hour of debauchery and gratuitous violence topped by some. The madness begins with a young girl named Yoshimi, whose search for her Missing sister has taken her into the hands of an unpleasant yakuza, who proceeds to rape her and shoot her. Full of strong drug called Angel Rain. After the gang members have finished having fun with the poor woman, he manages to escape and flee to a nearby hospital where the sexy psychologist Hiromi (Megumi Ozawa) tries to help. However, the anguished and confused Yoshimi ends up pulling herself from the roof of the hospital, turning into a water melon when she touches the ground (at least that's what it seemed to me!). <br /> <br /> Seeking revenge Yoshimi's death, Hiromi attracts Higashi, a member of the yakuza, to his office and, while lifting him, hypnotizes him to attack the members of his gang. After Higashi becomes happy with a knife at the yakuza headquarters, he is severely beaten and stabbed, forced to talk about his meeting with Hiromi and then hacked into pieces of bitty. <br /> <br /> The psychologist is captured by the gang, subjected to a place of forced buggery (while at the same time being forced to head a yakuza whore), and injected with Angel Rain, after of which she caresses her quickly. The gang members then place their body in the trunk of their car, along with the remains of Higashi, ready for disposal. <br /> <br /> Before they can get rid of corpses, however, the super drug has an unexpected effect on Hiromi. : she returns from the dead like a hermaphrodite monster with a penis with teeth and a voracious wound, and, engaged in revenge, begins to kill the yakuza one by one; this leads to some memorable scenes of outrageously bloody spatter, which includes a lanky head crush, a man suffocated by the vagina oozing from the monster and a woman being screwed by her giant, the phallus creaking. <br /> <br /> As most likely can be deduced from the previous synopsis, this is something crazy, fucked up, and probably not for the taste of most healthy people, but for those weirdos that are They have tired of conventional cinema and are already well versed in Asian excess. Guts Of A Beauty should prove to be diverted and diverted fun. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.
