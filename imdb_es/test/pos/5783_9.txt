The end of the suburbs, as it should be attractive to citizens in general and to mass consumers, is likely to become a state of cultural reform. The film uses a supercínico analysis of authors, politicians and social philosophers on the paradox created by the life of suburban style, mainly in the era of the postwar period. <br /> <br /> What we have created in the United States is a place with "none of the comforts of life in the country, and none of the comforts of urban life in the city." This is the recipe that is presented for the suburbs, and the film focuses on the unique idea of ​​"Oil". Basically, in the most general sense, the world is approaching or is at its peak of oil production, and when we realize this, there will be important changes in lifestyle, either because of our best interest or violently forced for a quality of living even the inhabitants of the slums of Calcutta could not describe us. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the end of Suburbia will divert the viewer to the depths of their bowels, creating a sick feeling. This is bound to happen. It is a grim perspective on our inherent way of life. The ambivalence is found particularly in each critical analysis of the film of the respective spectators. I foresee many unsuspecting spectators who slander the film as a smug and liberal propaganda, like a Michale Moore movie. What they do not consider is that a reaction like this is too normal when a message of this kind hits the lifestyle of the vast majority of the masses so incredibly hard. <br /> <br /> This is the truth, and as a student studying Urban Planning, I can tell you that it is better that we prepare now, because the small possibility that we have of maintaining the quality of life in this scarce pool of resources manipulated is fading faster than a race of people affected by the black plague.
