A vampire prince falls in love with a human girl, not knowing that his brother is a famous vampire hunter. That is the underlying theme of this martial arts game that takes ideas from "Underworld" and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer", but manages to maintain its own style. I was surprised by the title of the United Kingdom and Hong Kong "The effect of the twins" since there are no twins involved in the story. It turns out that the two main female characters are played by the Hong Kong pop stars who act as "The Twins". Do not let this discourage you. These girls can act (at least well enough for this kind of movie) and add a lot of charm to the proceedings. Jackie Chan shows up for a couple of cameo appearances that add a touch of their own brand of slaps to the process. In general, this is very fun for those who like their vampires to be served with a bit of ironic humor.
