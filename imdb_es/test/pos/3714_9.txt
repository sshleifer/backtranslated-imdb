Based on a story by William Faulkner, Two Soldiers is a first-rate short film, a film that has enough history, emotion and a great cinematography for a movie and definitely leaves you wanting more at the end. The story involves two poor Mississippian brothers, one just a boy, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by the newcomer Jonathan Furr, does not want to let go of his older brother, and embarks on a quest to enlist in the Army. Ron Perlman gives him a brusque but moving performance as the Army Colonel decides to help the child. <br /> <br /> Because it only lasts 39 minutes, this gem will be hard to find (most likely limited to the festival circuit for now), but remember the name Aaron Schneider, this image marks it as a director to see.
