Peter O'Toole, one of our best actors, is great as a quiet school teacher who is dedicated to teaching young children. Meet a girl and fall in love. The story is one of love and devotion. Petula Clark adds spirit and sensitivity, not to mention a remarkable voice too. You will enjoy this movie even if the ending is not happy. I loved it.
