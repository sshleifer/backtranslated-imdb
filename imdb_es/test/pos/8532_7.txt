The filming is corny. Some of the actors overreact. Some of the actions are inexplicable and inexplicable. But ... <br /> <br /> This movie is in the mode of the psychological dramas of the 50s. <br /> <br /> It is a work of morality. Like the movie in which a "method" actor becomes the evil character he plays on stage, Ed is forced to watch slasher movies because he is the editor of the movie. It gives you a nervous breakdown that leads to a complete psychotic break. <br /> <br />
