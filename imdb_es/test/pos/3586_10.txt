Full of surprises, beautiful, cruel sometimes. Like life itself. Leave one asking for more. The best parts are, of course, the scenes of action and persecution. I really have to wonder how much work these guys put into doing some scenes (whale chase, polar bear hunts, etc.). It is a wonderful experience and you can not miss anyone diving, surfing or going to the beach from time to time. The music is attractive and the narration is excellent and very well accelerated. Definitely, one of the best documentaries ever made and worth not less than 10 respectable (for its kind). Some of the images are very cruel and may not be recommended for people with weak stomachs (all images of killer whales are cruel).
