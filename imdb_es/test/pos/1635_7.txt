Tom Hanks returns as the symbol of Dan Brown, Robert Langdon, in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to do after The Da Vinci Code, given that the most controversial issue of the latter has an impudence in the faith. The Catholic Church rose up in arms during the first film, but apparently indifferent about it. And it's not hard to see why, considering that Ron Howard had opted to do a plain action action that serves as a great tourist video for Rome and Vatican City, and would probably increase the number of visitors due to the many beautiful scenes in the place, except for the Plaza de San Pedro and the Basilica, which was a scale model used. <br /> <br /> So I guess that with most of the budget allocated to the sets, the distribution of the set had to be correspondingly reduced. Ayelet Zurer tried to enter the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but since the character of Tautou had much more interest in the film, Zurer's scientist, Vittoria, had much less to do, apart from waiting behind the scenes to change some batteries Of battery. Boat full of antimatter. In the book, she is the food for Langdon, of course, to talk about his vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great dispute between the two, but here he has no love interest, nor his intellectual equal. <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, analyzes each scene in which he finds himself as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who temporarily takes over the papal office, while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel for choose a new Pope. And play Patrick with that brightness in the eye, with enough nuances for you to know that there is more than meets the eye. There are no surprises here for the readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film, since Hanks performs well, Tom Hanks. <br /> <br /> The book itself is rich in debatable content as always, and had many more plot points about science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and related in a attractive fiction work. While reading the book a few years ago, I thought that if you made a movie with it, it is easy to leave behind and stop more in the action pieces. Unfortunately, that's what this Ron Howard movie did, with a rhythm that does not allow a temporary respite. Unlike the first film in which the characters sat during a "discussion time" with a cup of tea, it advanced things so quickly, it's like reading the book again, page after page that is omitted only for get to the Behind the action. <br /> <br /> Catholic critics have called Angels & Demons harmless, because I believe they did not stop at their many controversies, unlike the Da Vinci Code, which struck a raw nerve at the center of the faith. And, in any case, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice sample of the many outstanding tourist spots that attract many around the world to visit. Naturally, certain areas such as the catacombs that lie beneath St Peter's Basilica and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Enlightenment is now almost free. <br /> <br /> Nothing new for those who have read the other book other than to see it come to life, but for those who have not done so, this film may force you to choose Dan Brown's novel just to read a book. Little more about the meaning of the landmarks and characters like Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini, which are intricately linked to the plot, but a lot without saying. Satisfy the entertainment of the popcorn without leaving anything spectacular.
