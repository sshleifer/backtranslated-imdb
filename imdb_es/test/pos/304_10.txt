Even with all the movies related to the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacob's Ladder, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver to some extent), one feels that we do not even know half of what happened. Even contemplating the horror feels inhuman. And a progression - or withdrawal? - The inhumanity you need is a key part of Apocalypse Now, Coppola's biggest film and one of the most important ever made. Loosely based on the 1902 classic by Joseph Conrad, "The Heart of Darkness," which narrates the loss of sanity and the corruption of morality that comes with the distance of civilization, an emergence of beastly nature, so to speak, Lord of the Flies, brings with it the story of a physical and psychological trip to Vietnam. The story is of Willard, a general commissioned on a special mission to Cambodia after his first service in Vietnam. Willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in Saigon, psychologically unable to return home, mysteriously repeating Nicky in The Deer Hunter. Then they contact him: his mission is to assassinate a renegade Green Beret that has been isolated in a remote position in the Nung River, and that supposedly has gone completely crazy, worshiped as a god by the natives, and killing indiscriminately. The name of this man is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (the best is Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). While Willard travels up the river in an army boat with some soldiers who accompany him, witnessing the horrors and madness, and the overwhelming uselessness of all this, leads to a strange sympathy and identification with Kurtz even before they meet. . The moment they do, Kurtz's methods really do not seem as bad or as they should, and they certainly do not seem to be too unusual or out of place. Apocalypse: a place beyond morality, the outpost at the end of the world. The loss of civilization, the loss of judgment, of the self. Kurtz's monologue about an atrocity he witnessed when he was a Green Beret and his subsequent revelation, is one of the most chilling and best-delivered speeches in the history of cinema. The film is about the trauma, the human spirit and its breaking point. Here, it looks a lot like The Deer Hunter, and it's just as good. Apocalypse, however, carries the limits of what we can support on a global level: Coppola's vast images of Cambodia's humid and turbid forests and a sequence of opening helicopters amid exploding forests and an orange sky. as well as chilling scenes on the river and an air raid in a village with Wagner shooting through the speakers (a scene that has become one of the most chilling war scenes, black humor and surprisingly useless) - all this contributes to the sense of Apocalypse, the end of the world, and not at a distant point in the future, but Apocalypse Now and forever. The deer hunter is much closer and personal, you can even say it for the title, and it shows the total effect of the trauma on the individual psyche, the breaking of the human soul and its ability to surrender completely to the forces of darkness. , or to limp. This is why both films are the same, they are two parts of the same thing. In "Heart of Darkness," Kurtz is shown as a conflict between morality (civilization) and his inner savagery. In Apocalypse Now, Kurtz has left behind all conflict. He is beyond good and evil. He has abandoned morality as a drowning man looses a saving hand in the moments before his death. Kurtz, in fact, is only waiting for death, citing T. S. Eliot in his temple for himself, lost in the jungle. His last words, and the words that echoed at the end of the film, are: "The horror ... the horror". It refers to the infinite void of existence, of the human psyche and to the black void of tone within their own mind, where atrocities are born again. It is impossible to express in words the experience one experiences when watching this film; In short, the experience that Willard experiences in his trip. The final part, in the outpost, almost in fact comparable to the scene of his brother in The Deer Hunter, is one of the most disturbing, calm and seductive things I have seen in my life.
