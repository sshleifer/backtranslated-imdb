Many terror fans complain that the horror has barely progressed in the last twenty years. I was inclined to agree to this until the advent of Asian horror films, a trend that has certainly become boring. However, it has produced some authentic classics, and A Tale Of Two Sisters, at least for me, stands out as an exceptional piece of film, and perhaps the best horror film in a long time. <br /> <br /> Based loosely on a Korean folk tale, it tells the sad story of two sisters with mental problems living with their father and stepmother. After experiencing some problems on their first night back home, they decide to stay together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship. The tension increases and there is an inevitable snap. But what happens after this requires more than a pair of eyes, since the story takes several turns and the fears become more emotional and quite real. In the end, you may need a few moments to absorb everything and put it together in your own mind, but it is exactly this combination of horror and mystery that pushes you beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic. One to see again and again, if only to solve everything.
