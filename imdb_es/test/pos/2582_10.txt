As soon as I saw the first trailer of Black Snake Moan I knew I would have to see it. I was not disappointed in the least of the film, written and directed by the creator of Hustle and Flow, Craig Brewer. It tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to heal not only for his sake, but also for his own ... but it is much more than that. It's complex and rich and manages to soak in a silky, sticky blue Memphis without making you feel like you need a bath later. <br /> <br /> The characters are (for the most part) multifaceted and very well written and performed. Accents and dialogue were taken to perfection. However, there was a weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best I can say about him is that he can cry ... he is a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. However, Justin's Ronnie was flat, but as an actor he was working hard. I would definitely give him another chance. <br /> <br /> Lazarus and Rae (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci respectively) have great chemistry and great respect for each other. This is one of those movies where it does not matter how good an actor is if the other is not up to the task and, luckily, both actors were up to the task. <br /> <br /> The music was as good as you would expect, especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson sings the blues. Phenomenal. <br /> <br /> On the technical side, everything was brilliant, from what I could see. It was well edited, well filmed and well mixed ... everything was great. The character and the set designs were correct, the casting of the supporting characters (including Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was perfect in ... I loved it.
