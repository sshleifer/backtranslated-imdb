Like all good art, this movie could mean different things to different people. For me it means that not opening your heart to others could rob you of happiness and leave you with an empty life. The comfort of selfishness is like junk food: it feels good, but over time it could make you sick. <br /> <br /> Almost everything I see in the US UU It's a massive commercial production of action junk, superficial dramas and stupid comedies, and this sensitive, profound and poetic film really touched me. Thank you, Nuri Bilge Ceylan (and everyone else in the cast)! <br /> <br /> Ivan Yanachkov
