This was / is an incredible movie, with an incredible cast, music, song, history, etc. It is a tragedy that some arrogant families (the Gerswhins or Premingers) can prevent it from being available for generation after generation. I've wanted to see him all my life again. I just found this site and read why it has not been available. Shame on these families for their pettiness. My wife is from Germany and has never seen the movie. Neither my stepchildren or my grandchildren. It is very sad that a film of this depth and quality is not available for viewing. Where do these families come from to make such a presumptuous, selfish, selfish and condescending decision to forbid generations to enjoy this movie, these stars, these performances, this music? Release the video and let them judge and enjoy!
