Taking into account Christopher Nolan's successful series of films, I have no idea that he wants to see his filmography, his first feature film, which was shot in black and white in England, with less than 70 minutes, made on a small budget, but with all the features that have made him a film and storyteller. <br /> <br /> Although brief, the film is no less exciting with its serpentine plot that will leave you guessing, because the premise does not even scratch The surface of this story, which is quite surprising considering the depth in the structure and characterization of the narrative. As it was said, we follow a writer who wants to be called Bill (Jeremy Theobald), who begins a habitual obsession by following random people who believe in the streets in a voyeuristic way, which at first could be conceived as an investigation, before Start inventing your own ideas. the rules, and breaks them. <br /> <br /> He meets the charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw), who turns out to be a thief with peculiar sensibilities and modus operandi, and soon finds himself hooked on dating him while they go on breaking and entering and speculating on the way of life of its victims, like the search for a fatal blonde (Lucy Russell), a mob of mobsters who rejects all their advances. <br /> <br /> He tells it in a non-linear way. that comes with scenes that do not add up at the beginning, this prepares the film for multiple presentations as it studies how Nolan sustains that suspense and intrigue with you as an audience that expects and desires more, which is duly delivered. There are enough twists here that make the film become a dizzying crescendo, where the loose ends begin to come together, and the brilliance of star history begins to shine. <br /> <br /> It's also amazing how, for the first time The cheapest feature is that you can think of something so smart and sophisticated from your own experience of being abused, with Nolan involved in every stage of production, from writing to shooting, production and direction, after having worked on the project for a year. Outbreaks can only happen on weekends. I suppose that here is an example of the humble roots of a successful filmmaker, who should serve as inspiration and stimulate the new filmmakers. Now, I wait patiently for Christopher Nolan's Inception to start later this year, whose trailer is already a joke.
