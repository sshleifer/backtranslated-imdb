One of director Alfred Hitchcock's best films is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day and his young son) who are on vacation in North Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world-famous singer. They meet with a Frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them get out of an incident on a local bus. Later, the Frenchman whispers something in Stewart's ear after he is attacked and dies. The rest of the film is an enigma since Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. The film is impregnated with mystery and strangeness from the exotic place to the strange occurrences. You never really know what is going on in this movie, why people appear, until the end and even then you are not sure. The final scene takes place in Albert Hall and is one of the most famous films that lasts 12 minutes without dialogue. Hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.
