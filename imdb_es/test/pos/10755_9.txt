What is often neglected by Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd had no background in Vaudeville / Music Hall and was not a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to act; and discovered that he had a special ability to act in a fun way: first in shorts and then in feature films. He made a name for himself as "Lonesome Luke", an imitation of Chaplin; With the "character in the glasses" that made him a completely American boy instead of a grotesque, Lloyd found that his step and his films became one of the best produced during the silent era. <br /> <br /> He developed a reputation as a "daring" in some shorts, and kept it in some of his best films ("Safety Last", "For Heaven's Sake", "Girl Shy"). It was more popular than Chaplin or Keaton during the 1920s and became very rich before the advent of sound. <br /> <br /> The first sound films were often disasters. To make the most of its "sound", too much dialogue was used in many movies. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's acting skills were, after two decades, aimed at silences. I did not have a bad voice; His high tone suited his "glasses" character. And his sound films were not the unqualified disasters of the legend. However, the silent films had been elevated to a high art (especially to Lloyd's, which was not limited to the budget and were extremely well crafted); With the introduction of talkies, the movies had to learn to walk again and made some mistakes. <br /> <br /> Although he tried to move with time and embraced the sound, Lloyd's best fragments of his first (too crazy) talkies were still visual, like the scene in "Movie Crazy" where he seems to be driving an elegant car, but actually "hooked" on his bike. <br /> <br /> Trying to recover the daring adventures that made him famous, as he did in "Pies Primero", was a bad step. (In "Safety Last," his best film and that, deservedly or not, put Lloyd in the box as a "reckless comedian," he played a determined young man, rising to the top. "Safety Last" had a natural talent The structure that ascended to the scale of his character next to the building, Obviously he was afraid, but his fear added to the humor, in "Feet First", he arrived by accident at a precarious position of scale construction, his frantic cries for help They reduced him from humor, his character was pathetic and trembling, an aspiration to save himself from the neck (possibly a precise statement from the 1930s, but not fun). <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd was not mired in the past, like some crazy Norma Desmond, embraced the sound and tried to take her films in different directions, growing and changing with the industry.When "Feet First" failed, she left the daring business and made a satire in the film industry, " Movie Crazy. "Jus When he had to go through many films like "Lonesome Luke" before taking his place in the history of cinema with the character in the glasses, he had tried several directions in sound films before reaching his rhythm in the sound, which made with "The Catspaw". <br /> <br /> In "The Catspaw" he plays the son of a missionary raised in China who, unknowingly, is elected mayor as a front for corrupt political interests. When he discovers the truth, the task of cleaning the city is imposed. Only at forty-some years old, Lloyd could still act like a young and cheeky man. <br /> <br /> However, "The Catspaw" was another failure of the box office, and Lloyd made only three more films, including "The Milky Way". Of his main competitors, Chaplin still had silent movies on him and Keaton was mismanaged. "The Catspaw" and "The Milky Way" suggest that Lloyd could have mastered the sound comedy if he had been a little younger, or if the public had given him the benefit of the doubt after his first sound fiascos. <br /> <br /> Although the film has been misquoted by the way Lloyd's character cleaned the city, it suits him. From his "short" days, Lloyd wanted to scare his audience, and the climax of "The Catspaw" achieved it once again, in a surprising way; until the trick is revealed, it seems awful, and then the laughter comes. <br /> <br /> Seen as a product of his time, "The Catspaw" is charming and fun. A well-written sound comedy, well performed by Lloyd. Directed by Sam Taylor, his curious mixture of drama and cunning humor makes it seem almost like a comedy by Frank Capra or Preston Sturges.
