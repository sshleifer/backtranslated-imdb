Well, my dad was driving Lee Evans from one place to another of the hotels, so I had the opportunity to see how they were done. It's a brilliant movie! Bob Pugh passed a shed with a lawnmower, accidentally let go, got into a fence and fell. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans was also funny when he saw me and said: "You're cold", I said "Yes" and he said: Well you put your hands in your pockets! I think it was very funny and it will be a well-known comedy. Like any other Lee Evans movie! They were really great people. They seemed to be quite polite and funny. I would like to see them again one day. Brenda Blethyn came out of her trailer with blood and twigs in her messy hair and I was very scared because I did not notice her until she was right behind me
