I just watched the movie tonight and I found it brilliant. It has no special effects that surprise you, and it's not violent or bloody, or terrorist or alien, but it's brilliant. It's just nice, sweet and it took me to a completely different, much simpler time, where people could take their time to walk down the street and look at the ocean. I think it was beautiful and I recommend it for myself. Nick was a great character and his friendship with Harry was one of the highlights of the movie. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think everyone should see this, mainly when they feel sad, or when they want to share something nice with their friends.
