I've only seen this movie once when it was shown on TV, but I can still remember it 15 years later, so I have to say something about it. I thought it was an intelligent look at education, friendship, harassment and the influence it can have on adult life. <br /> <br /> The title really refers to how being good or bad in sports can make you the lowest. If you're good at classes or private school in England, but it could be anywhere. <br /> <br /> The main character is bad at games, he seeks revenge in later life, which culminates in a climactic confrontation in a cricket field. I must admit that I was devastated by the end, it was powerful and sad.
