As listed and indicated in many previous comments, this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit. In fact, more than 20 years after its original transmission, it is still seen and seen again, and has a large number of followers worldwide, something that should indicate that the creators of this series without a doubt have something right. <br /> <br /> The root of the brilliance of the series and the remarkable appeal, however, has to be that it is based on a wonderfully written dialogue and eternal characters. all of which are brought to life by wonderful actors. The characters are wonderful in particular for their complexity. In contrast to many other adaptations of Robin Hood, and in fact many other film and television productions in general, the good ones in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have apparent flaws, while the bad ones, although presented as bad and ruthless Often can be understood and even sometimes seem quite nice. This makes Robin de Sherwood a story about real and multifaceted people. In place of good and bad people? something that adds much to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. In addition, although to a large extent it is an action-packed series with numerous incredible stunts (which are remarkable in themselves since they were done long before computer animation, green screens, etc.), so behind each one of those endless types Walls of the castle, horses and fire, in reality there is a real person who at some point fell from the wall of the castle or a horse or set himself on fire, there is always a surprising dialogue between the different characters in each episode. In the final analysis, however, they are usually the bad guys in the series. Nickolas Grace as Sheriff of Nottingham, Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne and Philip Jackson as The Abbot Hugo of Rainault. who gets the best lines and who most often steals the program with their arguments full of wit and song. "It's a wedding, not a celebration!" it is just one of his many eternal "pearls of wisdom" that seem to follow them throughout life :-). <br /> <br /> 20 years after the fact, is it really hard to believe that Sherwood's Robin was something originally made for television ?? And apparently not with a lot of money? in order to provide fleeting fun on Saturday afternoon for small children in Britain. Filmed in beautiful places, with intelligent and surprising scripts and with remarkable acrobatics and fantastic actors? Many of which give the performance of their lives in this show? This, in many ways, seems to be more professional and has more production value than many Hollywood movies.
