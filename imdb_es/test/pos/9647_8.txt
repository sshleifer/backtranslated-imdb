I do not have a really strong thesis here, so I'm just going to throw some observations. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie is absolutely beautiful. It is shot in high contrast in black and white, and some of the scenes are so well composed that they almost distract. <br /> <br /> At first, there was a sequence of some intense protests, and some of the shots were surprising. - Three guys throwing tear gas at demonstrators, etc. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think one of the biggest signs that this is a recent film that looks back in the 60s is that it really is about how the idealism of the revolution was transformed and transformed into something different. The taking of this change is really interesting: I believe that both the political phase of things and the artistic phase and more self-indulgent have strong points and weak points. The film does not necessarily take the position that things have declined. <br /> <br /> Third, I think romance works very well. <br /> <br /> Finally, really, really, I really hated the end. It was too melodramatic. You could even say that the ending is not worthy of the movie that preceded it.
