Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is being harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a terrorist terrorist who literally believes he will not be caught. At the opening, everyone's favorite modern serial killer, "John Kramer" (Tobin Bell) from the Saw series. Through intelligent planning and influence, Frank can make the arrest of Mendoza (Bell). <br /> <br /> Thereafter, it is a series of cat and mouse chases. Malkovich is a tremendous and incredibly versatile actor. Once again showing a different role in this movie, he surprises me with his ability to exchange his characters with the next movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen Malkovich play in Con Air as an incredibly intelligent and menacing Cyrus, in From mice and men like the tragically challenged bunny lover Lenny, to name a few. Play a very intelligent terrorist terrorist who is very sane, but deceives himself thinking that he can avoid his captures. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is not anyone special to me. He is too old to do much action in movies, so the only thing that can really surprise you is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simplistic and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo interprets Eastwood's love interest in the film and captivates me because his support is actually a more important role, to me, than Eastwood's. <br /> <br /> While this may seem like a blockbuster, it's relatively slow and plays with anticipation. You have to wait for the accumulation and in the end, and in the end it will be paid. Along the way, you'll be fascinated by the chemistry of Malkovich and Eastwood and their cat and mouse scenes.
