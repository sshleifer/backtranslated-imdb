'Wicked Little Things' really separates from other zombie movies. First of all, all the zombies in the movie do not exactly start biting you and tearing your flesh with their own hands. They kill you with a pick or shovel and eat after the rooms. Second, they can not die. In most zombie movies, you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but they simply will not die. In itself, all zombies are children. How exactly did they die to become zombies? They were working in a coal mine when, all of a sudden, they all died in a collapse. Now they roam the forest carrying their picks and shovels, waiting for someone to come so they can kill them and eat them. night. Yes, only at night. That makes the movie even more fun than it would be if they left in the morning. Despite all the violent and bloody chaos in this movie, 'Wicked Little Things' is an excellent choice if I'm looking for a movie about zombie children. Do not expect anything good like 'Dawn of the Dead' or 'Land of the Dead', but expect a lot of blood and violence that make this movie a real pleasure for zombie fans. Everyone Give Scout Taylor-Compton from Rob Zombie's 'Halloween' a great hand for delivering great performance like he did in 'Halloween'. You really need to start starring in more horror movies.
