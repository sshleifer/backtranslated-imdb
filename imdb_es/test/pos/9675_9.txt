> This show is the best thing that can be done in America since The> Simpsons. Not only do you have thousands of new ideas, but it is also controversial (see the Jewish joke, Season 1, Episode 1) and is not afraid to "mark" people. However, Fox's great minds have canceled it, along with Greg the Bunny and Futurama, so be sure to buy the game of Season 1> while you can. It will be the best money you spend. Definitely, it is a show that improves the more you look at it, since at the beginning the constant flashbacks can become a little annoying and do not always seem to fit properly in the story. However, after a couple of episodes, you realize how brilliant it is, and how well it compares to any other program currently on the air at this time.
