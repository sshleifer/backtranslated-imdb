By adding 2.6 million viewers, one has to ask what are the opinions of everyone about the plot or the plot. <br /> <br /> As I read the summary of life, they made me believe that this would be an advantage. Thriller your seat on a single mother who is harassed and finally confronts the harasser. Unfortunately I was wrong. While the main plot is quite interesting: a single mother left the road one night, then was harassed by the same guy, the reasoning behind the stalking did not leave more than a bad taste in his mouth. <br /> <br /> Laura Lightonon plays The Victim, and she does it well. Whether it's all those years at Melrose Place or not, she does well in this movie, playing a mother who would do anything to protect her son, and she also looks pretty good these days. <br /> <br /> Leighton is really the only good thing about this movie. I think many people will identify with the main character, after discovering why the stalker is stalking, it will be a kind of movie that can only be seen once.
