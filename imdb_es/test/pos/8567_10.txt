H.O.T.S. It is proof that, at some point, the film industry said "F-OFF" to the censors and made films with whatever they wanted. In today's world, this film would be too "exaggerated" and "extreme" for it to be anywhere that behind a velvet curtain. Although, BestBuy had several copies on its shelf for $ 5.99 (in case someone wanted to get a copy)! The film was brilliant in its own way, as it combined humor in a T & A movie loaded with Playboy Playmates! Unlike most skin movies, it had a plot. However, that is not exactly the reason why you would see H.O.T.S. <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. It's a college movie that reminds me of the movies of Revenge of the Nerds, in which it takes a group of "average people" and puts them against the elite rich preppies that most people can not put up with. The only difference is that the "Nerds" in this movie have a better chance to go to bed! I realize that there are some people who would rate this movie as low, and for me that is ignorant! Obviously, this is not intended to win an Oscar or break barriers in the movie. If you're looking for that, go see what the critics choose for you. You have to appreciate the fact that this movie really had a funny plot, a decent performance (mostly given the genre) and a lot of girls getting naked! H.O.T.S. is one of those movies that you look to distract yourself from today's problems and daily stress, and instead, laugh and have fun! If you're looking for a fun university-based movie that has enough skin to make a Miata go straight, then you really should take a look at H.O.T.S.
