Darling Lili is fantastic! It's by far one of my favorite movies! He certainly did not deserve the bad reviews he received. Julie Andrews, playing the lead role of Lili Smith (Schmidt) is the best part of the entire movie. It is fascinating and spectacular! As Julie Andrews is my favorite actress and singer by far, I was definitely not surprised at how impressive she is. This movie is just ... great (I'm running out of adjectives!), It's magnificent, wonderful, amazing, fun, terribly romantic, sad, and just a total emotion and all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews. And her husband, director Blake Edwards. Oh yes, Rock Hudson was also fine :) <br /> <br /> Julie Andrews is the beautiful and beloved singer, Lili Smith. Rock Hudson plays Major Larabee, who quickly falls in love with Lili, and she with him. But his adventure was not casual. The meeting was planned by the German government (I'm not sure if that's exactly what you would call it, but you get the point), because the warm, happy and singer artist Lili is actually a German spy. Lili is told to seduce Major LArabee for information on the new Top Secret Opertaion (later known as "Crepe Suzette"). Although Lili is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee), really, which makes her original quest a challenge. But Lili stops and completes her homework, after she discovers something that is not really true about Bill. The end will remain unsaid by me, as it is wonderfully designed. In any case, you will enjoy this movie a lot, without a doubt, I did it !!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
