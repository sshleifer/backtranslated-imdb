WARNING: Read this post after watching the movie! Like 'Easy Rider' released a year earlier, 'Joe' tries to illustrate what happens when the counterculture and the main America (although from the right) meet: a violent end occurs. Although this film is, for the most part, a slow display of traditional "old-fashioned" American morality versus the "do-what-feels-good" lifestyle of the 1960s, it is also a commentary on the upper class and middle-low. class and their inability to meet in the middle, as illustrated when the Compton meet the Curran. Boyle's Joe represents a generation trapped in the 1940s and 50s where 'Kill a commie for Mommy (or jap or hippie) is fine, as long as it helps and saves America. Joe and his wife Mary Jo are clearly the archetypes of Archie Bunker and Dingbat's wife, Edith. However, this film, which will always be known for its violent (but not bloody) blood is not seen at all, is uneven. Joe ruins (verbally) the hippie generation that then (literally) sleeps with them to infiltrate their numbers to locate Compton's daughter, when clearly the idea should have rejected him, but renounces the separatist idea of ​​sex. When they betray him through theft (read: trust of the generation before the most recent generation), he attacks a relentless chain of murders. Maybe it's because of the Hollywood Tarantinos that the observer waits for the bloody death in the final scene, but the bloodless shootings crave any kind of impact or realism. 'Joe' is not a great movie, but it is an interesting display of alienation of class and culture and the underlying animalistic extremes to the generation gap.
