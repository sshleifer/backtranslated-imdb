Based on the manga (comic) of the well-known artist Masamune Shirow, this animated feature was a slight disappointment to me. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but the animation is just "OK" while it could / It should have been amazing. The film is IMO suitable, but it seems somehow flat and uninspired, if you know what I mean. A wasted opportunity, if you consider that another work of Shirow, "Ghost In The Shell", is considered a classic in many aspects. Established new standards for Japanese animation and generated, among other things, a brilliant series called "GiTS: Stand Alone Complex". <br /> <br /> I think it's worth it to rent, unless you're a Shirow fan. and I want everything. Take a look at the original manga, which is highly recommended.
