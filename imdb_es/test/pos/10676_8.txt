This is an excellent Anderson production that is worth comparing with the best episodes of UFO or SPACE 1999 (first series). Of course, this is not an extravaganza of SFX or a pseudo-mystical Star Wars party, but a subtle film that has a slow pace, but conveys the creepy, mysterious and disturbing atmosphere of the best productions of Anderson: the lovers of the "cerebral". Science fiction. Lynn Loring's voice is ABSOLUTELY FAIR. SFX is good for this type of product and the acting is also good. Two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun, but instead land at home ... or not? Oh, videophones! From time to time it was sold as the next 'gadget of all for the next decade', but it must still happen 40 years later. The device of the Earth's twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in Gamera tai daiakuju Giron (1969), then who copied whom?
