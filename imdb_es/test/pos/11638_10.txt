From start to finish, this 1926 classic, two reeler of the Hal Roach Studios, seems to sum up the fun of the 1920s. It stars the now-forgotten comic book genius, Charley Chase, and was directed by the legendary Leo McCarey, who he was unknown at the time but he would make a living with Roach and graduate to greener pastures in the 30s and 40s. Recently released on video and disk, this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages. Although today her star has practically declined, Charley Chase was considered the leader in the field of short-subject comedy in the last years of the silences. He helped the careers of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before they met as a team, Leo McCarey and many other talents. It is a pity that you are not remembered today. Take a look at this little gem of a movie. Once you do, you will look for other movies from this classic comic. He had his hand in more than 300 films and many of them survived. Rediscover this lost giant of a movie from a bygone era and its giant star.
