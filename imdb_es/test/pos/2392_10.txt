I've been writing crime novels for several years. When a writer develops a story, he always has a character / actor in mind to bring the story to life. Last weekend I found a new one in Paul Vario playing Uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe. This was a highlighted film highlighted by the presence of Vario both on and off the screen (since its voice-over narration is also heard). I also especially liked the actress who plays Benny's niece and Eddie's ex-wife, although they all did a good job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double crossing that goes with it. A good job everywhere ... and Mr. Vario shone brighter. It has to be my Tony Gangi some day ...
