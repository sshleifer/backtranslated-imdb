This is a good movie, I will not go into details, since the comments of other users do a good job of taking care of that. However, I do not agree with the claim that this is Eastwood's best work. That is not a very defensible position based on the volume of strong films that he has directed and starred. I would like to point out that I find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this film, Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier, never appeared again in another film or television program, despite giving good performances. My curiosity makes me wonder what happened to these two actresses.
