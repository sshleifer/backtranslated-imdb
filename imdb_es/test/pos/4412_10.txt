A pile of human flesh lies asleep on a red pillow. This is the piece of naked flesh that is "Little Joe", a New York con man who lives with his bisexual wife and baby. The film follows a day in his life, after his wife woke him up and asked him to go out and do the traditional thing of men: be a breadwinner of the family. But the use he wants to give bread is to pay for the abortion of his new girlfriend. We are certainly not in the traditional family unit here ... <br /> <br /> After playing with his son, Joe goes out to look for John. Clients are thick and fast: the ordinary gay man who wants to meet him again because they "work well together", the old English classical scholar who pays $ 100 to see Joe pose as an ancient Greek athlete; the topless dancer who blows Joe then boasts of having been raped; the old gym bunny who does not think what he and Joe do together is weird. After a hard day of work, Joe returns home exhausted, only to be shot by his wife and girlfriend. He goes back to sleep while harping him and undermining him. <br /> <br /> The meat is fascinating, since it takes what is a traditional traditional traditional structure: it has an inciting incident (the money for abortion) and the configuration, a confrontation and a resolution (although very negative) , even a protagonist with a strongly motivated objective, and then concentrates on the details of the daily routine of these people who are perfectly normal for themselves but extraordinary for the majority. People "mainstream". Everything seems very authentic and natural: it is difficult to see the performance, the actors are playing their roles fully, but all this is a clever piece of artifice: a beautifully drawn portrait or an intricately carved statue. Director Morrissey carefully plans every incident, every encounter around his subject of human flesh becomes a packaged product, but with a cunning so slight that he almost does not realize he is doing it. The wife "packs" Joe's sex organ, the old English lament a lost classical beauty that created art and poetry from human beauty, the stripper's transvestite friends disguise themselves as women while reading a Hollywood magazine in the "real" women are packaged as products; The gym bunny buys Joe's friendship and affection, thinks that artificial pornography is real and can not say, as we can not, that Joe is making his friendship and intimacy for the money. The film itself is presented as the ne plus ultra of cinematic realism, but what we could well deal with here is fine art or an early example of conceptual art. <br /> <br /> The genius, a word that is not used lightly - by Morrissey was to find a way to bring Warhol's artistic pretensions to filmmaking, which were interesting but boring as hell, and turn them into salable products that are among the most fascinating works of cinematographic art ever made. Flesh "and" Trash "and" Heat "with a product label," Andy Warhol ", which sells an idea about the product as much as the product itself, but at the same time you resort to Morrissey's cynicism, you're enchanted for its ability to maintain the highest standards and depth of meaning What appear to be camera flashes continually attracts attention to the filmic nature of what one is witnessing, however, the illusion attracts him anyway: Flesh is without doubt one of the most extraordinary pieces of cinematographic magic that has ever bewitched an audience.
