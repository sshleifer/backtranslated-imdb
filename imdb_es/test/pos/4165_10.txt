I'm going to make this brief. This was a joy to see. It may or may not have been more effective if the characters resembled their real-life counterparts, but apart from this minor observation, I found that fantasy animal characters are the most pleasing. The visual effects were more impressive, except for the CG scenes of the second category, which could have been omitted. I do not like computer generated animation, however, it cancels the purpose of a biographical film like this one. Look at it, you will appreciate it too!
