I saw Ray when he first came out. Why? In part, because of the exaggerated publicity, secondly because I loved the music of Ray Charles. But by not being present when they passed their most important things in music and their lives, I wanted to learn more about the life of man. And in this movie, I did it. His addiction to drugs was something he did not know, and the movie let us know. <br /> <br /> But here's the thing, while this was a decent autobiographical movie ... I can not say it was a "great" movie. I have seen "Malcolm X" and I was impressed. The same with "What love has to do with that" and "Bird". The performances of each of those films were outstanding. I was not only attracted to the main characters of those films, who did incredible works, but also those around them. That helps me take a picture. <br /> <br /> I felt that in some parts of this film it was superficial and heavy for an emotional appeal. And yes, I will admit that in certain parts of the film I almost fall asleep. And the movie was too long. And the film omitted several "other" important details from the life of Ray Charles that would have made the film flow better. The movie got "choppy" in certain parts. And the movie seemed to end with a moan, not a pop - certain parts, including the ending, like a tack in the cable movie "Lifetime" for me. I expect more than a cinema. <br /> <br /> So, where does my ambivalence come from? With the performance of Jamie Foxx. In general, he did it - fine. No, the spectacular Malcolm X by Denzel Washington or the spectacular Tina Turner by Angela Bassett, but ... well. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but for me, there were several points in the movie where I saw Ray Charles' performance of Jamie Foxx. and in others, thanks to the wonderful angles of the camera and the lighting, it "looked" like Ray Charles. But I paid attention to the ... acting. An actor has to make you believe that he is the character he plays. Do not make a caricature of the character. Did you think Jamie Foxx was on the screen? Sometimes yes sometimes no. Did Jamie Foxx deserve a Golden Globe? You can bet. Do you deserve an Oscar ...? It depends on who you face. You have some important competitors there, and you may just eliminate them. But, again, maybe not. If Jamie Foxx does not win, I will not get up and say "they stole" him. Particularly I will not feel that he was. <br /> <br /> This was a decent movie with decent performances and a decent story. A "great" autobiographical film of the late Ray Charles? No. Somewhere, I think there is a great movie about Ray Charles that is about to be made, and an actor that will blow you away in doing it.
