I saw this title again in Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew who was 17 years old to see the same with me. I am 35 years old and he is 17. I liked it and I liked it too. It's still fun, a bit childish at times but still very clean. Satish Shah is hilarious in multiple roles. This sitcom would still be better than many of the recent series on television. But obviously some people like the mundane rates that come out today. It would have been nice if Shafi Inamdar had continued throughout the seasons. He is not alive today. I would like if someone could list all the episodes here. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the lines "Yeh Kya Ho Raha HAi" "What a relief" "Kaat Daalu Boss" "Vyavhaar hai Vyavhaar" "30 years Ka Experience hai" <br /> <br /> and the title song Yeh Jo hai Zindagi, teaching us to live life as it comes and to enjoy it. The life of ordinary people. <br /> <br /> I still like this comedy. It may not seem like so much fun sometimes, but certain episodes are still fun.
