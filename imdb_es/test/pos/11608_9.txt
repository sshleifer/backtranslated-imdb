Chokher Bali performed at the Washington Film Festival (DC) on April 15, 2005. The director, Rituparno Ghosh, was there to give a brief introduction and answer questions later. <br /> <br /> As always, I think Aishwarya did a fantastic job. I can understand those who think I should be more aggressive or more malicious, but would that really be realistic in 1904? Possible, maybe; Realistic, I'm not so sure. I think his interpretation was valid, although there certainly could be other ways of doing it. <br /> <br /> I hate to use the word, but this was the most "inaccessible" of the Indian films I've seen so far. . I know a good amount of Indian history, Hindu religion, etc., but the level of detail here was far beyond me. Clearly, you would understand the film much better if you were familiar with Hinduism and its customs, especially. how were c. 1904. I missed many things, one of them is the fact that the mother-in-law would like Binodini in the house as a kind of counterweight to her daughter-in-law Ashalata. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * Ghosh had several things to say that explained the movie much better to me. First, the original Bengali version was 20 minutes longer. So, what was left out? Apparently three main things: a start segment where Binodini (Aishwarya) leaves E. Bengal for Calcutta. According to the director, different characters are talking W. Bengali vs. E. Bengali - setting some of the political comments later. Of course, all this is lost in the Hindi version, and certainly for a non-Indian like me, it would not have mattered anyway, but a configuration of the Bengali situation surely would have. Next, there was a segment in which Binodini was writing a poem: a sign of his independence, etc. Finally, some more issues about jewelry. So, although some people think it was too long, I think the original, longer version would have been clearer. <br /> <br /> Women's hair apparently was another sign (Ghosh again): the mother-in-law had short hair (short hair for Hindu widows), her sister, also a widow, had longer hair ( More modern!), And of course Binodini / Aishwarya had very long hair to the waist (rejection of the state of widowhood). <br /> <br /> The end really threw me: suddenly, Binodini, who had never had a political thought, is writing a political manifesto? Whoa! Ghosh explained that he was in Locarno, at a film festival, when the subtitles were finished. The subtitles use the word "country" throughout Binodini's letter. Gosh said that a more appropriate word would have been (I forget her exact word) something like "I" or "independence", she was talking about her own liberation and "meeting", not Bengal, India and the British. . So, why does Binodini simply disappear the day after finding Behari again? Apparently, because during his stay in the Ganges he realizes that he does not need a man, no man, to define or complete it. She can be herself. Then she rejects Behari, whom she threw a few months (?) Before, and simply leaves. Of course, I'm not sure how you buy your next meal, but that's another question. <br /> <br /> The red shawl (Ghosh back) you buy represents both "revolution" and "passion". I'm not 100% sure why he puts the shawl on the dying woman, but maybe he's rejecting the passion / revolution? The binoculars, which Binodini uses throughout the film (to see Mahendra and Ashalata, the ship in the Ganges, etc.). She is being a voyeur to see a life that she longs for but can not have. In the end (I missed this!) She leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter, showing that she no longer needs them, she goes to take her own life. <br /> <br /> Finally, Tagore's quote at the beginning saying how he apologized for the end ... Apparently, Tagore wrote this as a series, hooking his readers with the sexy widow bits. But in the end he sold himself to conservatism and made Binodini kneel at the feet of Mahendra and Behari, begging for forgiveness. One of his students (?) Wrote to Tagore and criticized him for his end of liquidation ... and Tagore responded with his apologies for the end. In the movie, of course, Ghosh goes in the other direction.
