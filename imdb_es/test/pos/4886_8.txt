Having only seen five episodes of the program before this (I've been watching the replays on BBC Two) I have not really had much experience with the League, but as an incipient fan and a fan of British comedy, I can say that this movie is hilarious. Seeing Herr Lipp, (whom I had not seen on screen before the movie) Briss and Geoff on the big screen was a great comedy experience. Being on screen is something that the League takes full advantage of, with the heads exploding ((it will be a surprise whoever it is) and gruesome murders with battles in the style of the Middle Ages at random. <br /> <br /> Geoff he is easily the funniest character of the three protagonists of this film, because he has the best liners and the general behavior, as in the series.One of my only disappointments with the film was that I did not hear Geoff scream "Good , now I have this gun "even once, (although there is an accumulation in one part of the film.) The film itself in general is To use the phrase everyone does, Pythones reminds a lot of movies like" Brian's life "Tubbs and Edward's appearances were welcome, but the line from" Daddy Lazarou "Hello Daves" reprimanded me more than they said, (Lazarou is probably my favorite Vasey character after Tubbs and Edward). c moving with one of the main character is being eliminated and I can only hope that this is not the last adventure of the League on the Vasey screen. With Gatiss mentioning the possibility of another series or movie, now I am very excited. This is a film that I will see again, partly because the projector died towards the end, leaving out approximately 10 minutes of the film, but mainly because it is inventive and hilarious. It really does not bother me that it is not as good as the TV series, because I loved it. <br /> <br /> One thing, though, if you've never seen the League, you'll still love it, but Dave knows what you'll think about the people who invent these things. As Tubbs or Edward could say, it's a local movie, for the local people, and that's something precious. <br /> <br /> **** of ***** (4/5)
