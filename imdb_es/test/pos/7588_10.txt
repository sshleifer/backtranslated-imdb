As already noted, the short film "Todos los Domingos" (1936) could be considered the first music video. This was a happy accident as a result of MGM's need to produce a variety of short films to exhibit with their feature film material. They had a couple of young young singing talents (Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin) available and essentially combined a mix of musical styles in a kind of Norman Rockwell concert in the park setting. <br /> <br /> Who would have dreamed at that moment that he would capture the best collection of images from the sequence of "Steps of Odessa" by Eisenstein? <br /> <br /> It's Sunday with some inattentive people sitting around a small wooden band in the park while a tired looking group plays Strauss. The events take place and next Sunday Judy and Deanna save the day. The opera Deanna sings "Il Bacio" (The Kiss) and Garland continues with the contrast "Waltz with a Swing". The climax combines the two styles very well in a "Americana" duo. <br /> <br /> A must see. <br /> <br /> Then, again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
