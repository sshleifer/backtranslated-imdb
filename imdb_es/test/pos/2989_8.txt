I can barely remember what DECADE saw this movie. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started to see it as a night movie sometime between the mid to early 80s, and a lot of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had no idea that it was shown in theaters, or that someone else, even new, existed. I do not think he mentioned the movie to anyone else. <br /> <br /> But half a life later, I still remember a lot of the movie I saw late at night so long ago. I think the innocence of the characters, their situation, their mutual affection for a long period of time, left a long-term mark for reasons that I do not understand very well. Maybe it's because I was a teenager the moment I saw him, and he moved me in some way ... I really do not know! I also REALLY wanted to know what would happen when the end of the movie happened. Oh, the agony! <br /> <br /> I have not seen it before, or since, but I would love it. I keep an informal aspect, but now I doubt that it has shown itself and seems to have vanished into oblivion. But I would probably miss him in the TV guide, even if he showed up. Pssttt !!! <br /> <br /> Read the comments here has renewed my interest. If anyone knows about your availability in Australia, send me an email and let me know. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Sean Bury ... it's a pleasure to see his appearance in the comments here. I have taken a look at the history of your film and I noticed your last appearance in a James Bond movie. What are you doing today? Oh, and YOU have a copy of the movie? CHEERS!!!
