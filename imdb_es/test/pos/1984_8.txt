WARNING: PLOT SPOILER <br /> <br /> The always abnormal films of David Cronenberg are certainly an acquired taste. Fans of their previous films will like `eXistenZ ', but definitely not for the squeamish. All the usual elements are here. A game capsule made of leather (hooked to your back), blood cubes, a gun made of bones and a maniac mechanic, to name just a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts and simply strange in others. But one thing that the film has is its undeniable originality. <br /> <br /> Despite the excessive use of ?? Oddly enough, one point: virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. In the movie, a character shoots someone dead saying he was "upset" (assuming she was still in the game). But leave the question of whether that really happened or if it was an occurrence in this incredibly real game. 'eXistenZ' leads to a conclusion that can be answered in several ways. <br /> <br /> Despite some extra gadgets and gook, it was simply your classic `was it all a dream? or it was 'spin'. It's a smart surprise and answers some questions, but it's a little disappointing to imply that the whole movie was driving until this moment. In just 97 minutes it could have lasted a little longer. In a peculiar way, the film poses moral problems, but it responds violently and quite inappropriately. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first big role in quite some time. But your character does not have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a nice character. On the other hand, Jude Law (equipped with a curious American accent) is good since your average Joe swallowed this abnormal world. We see the movie through your perspective. <br /> <br /> `eXistenZ 'is far from impeccable, but it is certainly a cinematic experience to remember. There are tons of strange features that match the similar styles of David Lynch (what is next? Consumed by a question mark?!?!?!). Definitely not for everyone, but it is rewarding enough to recommend. My IMDb classification: 6.2 / 10.
