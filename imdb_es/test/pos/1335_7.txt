"Strike Force" or "The Librarians" is a fun action movie that does not take itself too seriously. William Forsythe plays Simon, who searches for the missing daughter of a wealthy client. He meets Sandi (Erika Eleniak) who is also looking for someone, his sister. But there are evil bad guys standing. The worst of them all is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have to unite to take down the villains. The whole cast is great, with Divoff stealing the movie. There are also cameos from Ed Lauter and Burt Reynolds. If you are looking for a good action movie, watch this and have fun.
