Kennedy-Miller could hardly have done a better job of facing a very challenging exercise: making dry political events work like a human drama, and providing unbiased representation of controversial and controversial issues. <br /> <br /> The key to your success at the first count is a brilliant performance, although I was less impressed with the performance of Max Phipps as Gough Whitlam than other commentators here. The most salient features of my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the easiest launch options in history: Hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. In the second recount, the series avoids the trap of the "myth of objectivity" through a narrator who expresses the director's sympathies (Phillip Noyce, who most recently demonstrated his left credentials in Rabbit Proof Fence), while It is carefully impartial. and sympathetic in its dramatic representation of all parties. Adherence to the Lady Kerr / Lady Macbeth theme, popular among Labor supporters, was perhaps a bit biased, though not ruinously. In particular, the credit is due to the sympathy shown to Kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position in which he was placed, regardless of what one may think of his actions. <br /> <br /> However, there is a bitter note for which the producers were. It may not be entirely guilty: the Jim Cairns / Juni Morosi affair. Those who go to the series with no history of these events will have the impression that Cairns and Morosi were the innocent victims of a smear campaign by a prurient sewer press. Producers may have been restricted in this respect by Australia's strict defamation laws, and the willingness recently demonstrated by Cairns and Morosi to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual (something Cairns would eventually admit a year before his death). ). However, more could have been done in the strange way that Morosi managed Cairns' office as Treasurer. <br /> <br /> Speaking of defamation, there are a couple of misleading occasions in which the dialogue is hidden due to the offended injunctions of offended directors - by a beep on one occasion, and a very loud telephone rings on another. Another curiosity: the release of the DVD separates a line from the comic scene in which a customs officer (played by Paul Chubb) attends Tirath Khemlani on his arrival at the Sydney airport. The next one in the queue is a disheveled looking hippie, who now only gets a disapproving look from Chubb when he presents his paperwork. In the original version, Chubb said something like: "drug bust in Bali, huh?" Obviously, this line no longer sounds true after the Schapelle Corby case, which illustrated dramatically that those arrested for drugs in Bali can expect much worse than deportation.
