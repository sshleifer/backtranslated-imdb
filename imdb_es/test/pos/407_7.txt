Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as "The Fox" in "Whistling in the Dark", also starring Ann Rutherford, Conrad Veidt, Eve Arden, Virgina Gray and Rags Ragland. Wally Benton, alias "The Fox" finds his plans to marry his girlfriend Carol (Rutherford) frustrated when he is kidnapped by the leader of a fake cult (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult, The Silver Haven, is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman's nephew, who will live on the interest. He wants Wally to come up with a perfect murder plan so that the man can die in the plane on the way to meet with his lawyer. As a backup, and as he is unsure of Wally's fianc√©, Jones kidnaps Carol and also the daughter of the radio sponsor (Gray). <br /> <br /> This, for me anyway, is a film superior to the second entry in This series, "Whistling in Dixie". The plot is better, the cast is better, there is less slapstick and less cheesy jokes. Skelton, when he's not making faces and rolling his eyes, is kind enough, and Rutherford is very good. Veidt always played these evil men perfectly. Eve Arden is Wally's agent, who arranges an appointment for him and Gray to make sure his contract is renewed. I had only seen Gray in films from the 1950s onwards. She was always a beautiful woman, but who knew she was a knockout in the 30s and 40s? This is a funny movie with a clean cast.
