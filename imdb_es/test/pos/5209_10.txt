This film is one of the historically most accurate war movies ever made, as it shows the reality of the soldiers in a battle situation, as well as the particular circumstances of the Battle of Stalingrad, obvious when this film is compared with works like the Anthony Beevor's book "Stalingrad". <br /> <br /> Unlike the well-known "Enemy at the Gates", where the plot deviates into a hunting / sniper story, this film shows what war can do to individuals. Although filmed by Germans, "Stalingrad" is anything but a nationalist apologetic film. It shows that war movies can be something beyond the jingoistic distortions of the somber truth of war, as Hollywood's "war" products seem to be. <br /> <br /> The scripts, the acting, the direction and others The film techniques in "Stlingrad" are of the highest caliber. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that everyone who is thinking of joining an army and obeying orders from any type of "FÃ¼hrer" should see it.
