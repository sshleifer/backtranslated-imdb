One of the best for TV biopics, I just wish he had told us more. I have read many biographies and have seen other things about the Carpenters, and this film did what it could, based on the restrictions imposed by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job of trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was no more information about Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done on the disease (especially the wonderful book by Cherry Boone O'Neill, Hunger for Attention), anorexia seems to be a control disease. Karen saw her weight as a thing in her life that she could control. She felt that she was being controlled in all other aspects of her life. Do not get me wrong, I thought he really loved music, but I felt he had little control over his career. She really loved her family, but they did not express it well, and she did not know how to make her family understand her. The movie could have played much more about that. I value the music that I have from the Carpenters and I wish that she was still alive to contribute more to music today.
