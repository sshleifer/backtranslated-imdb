This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a little younger, and I really remember that I liked it. However, I did not have much pleasure at that time (not to say that now), so I can not respond too well to my nine-year-old self. The movie was probably 7/10 but it had good music, so I gave it an extra point. Yes, it's worth seeing. I know that some fans of this movie are asking what is a certain song, the one that appears when it is in the car accident. The song is "Play a Love Song" by the Jaguars and it is VERY hard to find and get. In fact, this movie is, too. I can not find it anywhere online, on DVD or on VHS. I would like to see him again in order to evaluate if it really was a good movie. Oh good.
