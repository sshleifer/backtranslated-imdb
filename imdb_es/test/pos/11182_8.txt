Another fantastic offer from the Monkey Island team and although it took a long time to arrive and had to survive the departure of Ron Gilbert, is another worthy delivery. My only complaint is that it was a bit short compared to the previous two, although it could be due to a glorious lack of disk sharing. Roll in MI4.
