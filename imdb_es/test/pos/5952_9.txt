OSS 117 was fun from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It's hard to define why a movie plays or connects with you or not, and I will not try to analyze such a perfect comedy, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it :)! <br /> <br /> Everything is out of fashion here, from women's clothes (sigh!), mambo dance, the "hero singing" ... ("Bambino" sounds like an Italian Canzonetta sung at .. . Arab :)!). <br /> <br /> Hubert is physically imposing, but mute as hell. Of all the 007, he looks like Sean Connery, but he's definitely nicer because he's ... silly, he says what he thinks all the time, he laughs, he even has some homoerotic fantasies and there are rumors about him. In short, as an antihero, it's cool :)! Sometimes he just raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that's all you need to make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Bérénice Bejo is the real queen of the film. Graceful, treacherous but with ideals. Aure Atika, on the other hand, is reduced to a kind of fatal woman. It's amazing to see her "sexy bomb", you. <br /> <br /> You can not compare it with "Austin Powers"! I agree with Amazon's D. Hartley (Seattle, WA) in being respectful of the genre. <br /> <br /> What is your favorite scene? One of my favorite scenes is the "chicken fight" with the masked villain. But the truly perfect thing is when they chat at the cocktail with their contacts, how they murmur with total confidence ... This scene alone makes the genre of comedy worthwhile.
