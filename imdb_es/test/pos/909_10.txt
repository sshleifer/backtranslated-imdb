Transcendental, sophisticated, incisive, emotional, powerful ... I could think of hundreds of adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence, and even then I would feel that they were insufficient. All I can say is that I'm in love with this movie. Applause to Krzysztof Kieslowski, Zbigniew Preisner, Ir√®ne Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant. That "Rouge" live forever.
