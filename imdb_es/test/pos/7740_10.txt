I often heard people express their disappointment because Mazursky's "Tempest" has little to do with Shakespeare's original. In my opinion, that is true and false, but, above all, it is a bad starting point to offer a critique. A work of art should never be criticized for what it is not, but for what it is. The movie "The Tempest" is not at all like a faithful interpretation of the work, but in my opinion, is faithful to the work of Shakespeare in spirit. What is "Tempest" is, then, perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No, not experimental as in the handheld camera and murmured dialogue, but experimental as exploring the convolutions of a story without taking into account the box office profits. The tempest of Mazursky is epic, sad, realistic, happy, full of life, but above all, it is imaginative. The performance of Philip / Prospero by Cassavetes is worth 10/10, and when you add to Gena Rowlands, Susan Sarandon, a beautifully deep Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia, the dialogue, the music and the exquisitely suggestive little pictures scattered for the whole image ... I rest my case. One of the best movies of the 80s. Do not miss it
