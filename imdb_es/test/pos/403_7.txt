Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [# 4/10], with almost noiristic black and white photography and some splendid Spanish-American backgrounds and stages. And also a stranger story! <br /> <br /> A man who looks like the crazy murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner. The Crime Doctor is on the scene (apparently as a guest) to proclaim it immediately and with resignation, so we are presented with a series of strange people to reflect, since one of them did the fact. Was the sparkling brother of the first dead wife, the third wife and the wealthy widow Hilary Brooke, the brother and sister vampire dancers, the intense young man, the eccentric cabinetmaker Lloyd Corrigan, borrowed by Boston Blackie, the irreplaceable butler or odds - In Jerome Cowan? Police Inspector Emory Parnell had a great job, but Warner Baxter, like Ordway, was as imperturbable as ever to solve everything. One of the errors listed in the IMDb is wrong: when entering the homicide room, Ordway says "Right in the center of the forehead" and Cowan responds: "It was not lost this time". Favorite Bits: Baxter and Cowan travel through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to repair their interrupted dinner; The scene where the resting place of Braga is apparently twisted. The plot seems to wander a little at times and the way it was explained was perhaps more worthy of Monogram, but leaving it in the air as supernatural would not either! <br /> <br /> Well worth it Look if you already like the genre, you will not be disappointed unless you really do not like the genre.
