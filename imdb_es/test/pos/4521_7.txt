This film is about a deadly poison contained in small glass globes that are used to kill. Apparently, this is done to hide the attempt of an espionage ring to steal plans for a new American bomber. Now much of this plot was repeated in other films by Chan, THE JADE MASK and THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS. In addition, it was used for the first time in MR. WONG, DETECTIVE: everyone had the glass balloons that exploded, an element of the plot that has obviously been used in excess. It was interesting in MURDER OVER NEW YORK, but for these later films it was quite old fashioned. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the rest of the film was recent and the plot worked very well, with an ingenious conclusion where of course, the culprit is revealed. However, no plane could fly the way it did, especially in 1940. Such extreme dives and rapid ascents were pretty dumb outside this already obsolete aircraft. <br /> <br /> By the way, in a small role as a doorman you will see Frank Coghlan Jr., the same actor who played Billy Batson in the series CAPTAIN MARVEL. According to IMDb, Mr. Coughlan is 93 years old and withdrew from the film industry.
