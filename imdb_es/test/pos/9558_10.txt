In this offer, you only have to see the current annual offer of Westminster Kennel Club to see the parallels. Scandalously funny and captures the true essence of the competition. You can only imagine the ingenuity of the producers and the surprising ability of the artists. I would also have nominated this film for a Globe Award and I feel it is one of the most fun I've seen in my life.
