"Christmas in Connecticut" is an absolute gem, and a must for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, a forerunner of Martha Stewart, is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of housewives: the perfect wife, the mother and the domestic goddess. The only thing is that she is not any of these things, a total false. Unfortunately for her, she is about to be discovered. Its editor, Mr. Alexander Yardley (a brilliant Sydney Greenstreet comic) has the brilliant idea of ​​inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeth's "perfect farm" for the Christmas holidays. The only thing, there is no farm, "perfect" or not. The comedy is about how Elizabeth should keep her true identity a secret so she does not lose her job. Elizabeth's colleague, John, has a farm in Connecticut, so he solves that problem. However, he wants to marry Liz, but she does not want to marry him. He offers her marriage, although he knows that she does not feel the same for him as he does for her. He makes the offer anyway, and assures him that he is willing to wait. And here, Barbara Stanwyck, like Liz, offers one of the most devastating reproaches I've heard. With perfect innocence, she responds: "Could you wait so long?" OH! In addition, the scenes between Una O'Conner and S.Z. Sakall are hilarious. It seems that they do not like each other (although one suspects that they really do). They are rivals at home, and S.Z. Sakall's shattered English is matched by Nora's strangled pronunciation of his name ("Mr. Basternook"). "My name is FELIX!" It's amazing how these black and white films are at Christmas. Great work of character on the part of all involved. Do not miss it!
