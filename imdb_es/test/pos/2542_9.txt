Gray can make the English language jump through hoops like no other. It tells a series of events, united by his writing of a manuscript (the "Monster" of the title), some sad, others amusingly funny, all in their characteristic and sarcastic form. If you liked "Swim to Cambodia" you will love this one. In fact, I thought that this was a bit more interesting and better said "Swim to Cambodia". A true masterpiece.
