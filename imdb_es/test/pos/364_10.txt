This is another of Hitchcock's best rated movies and rightly so. This is the story of two men who are on a train and playfully exchange murder fantasies. One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously and this leads Guy Haines (Farley Granger) to have problems with the law. Another Hitchcock movie that moves fast with many great scenes (the carousel scene and the tennis match are worth mentioning). It's not a pity that it gets lost, it's a pity that nobody returns to this on DVD with a lot of extras, just a cheap DVD of Warner Brothers is all that now.
