with that, carry the same dark weaknesses that we all unfortunately have: lie, cheating, laziness, the list goes on. <br /> <br /> However, as an American, I was surprised to see that corruption and racism exist today. The police force is reflected in the horrible detective of the Duval County Sheriff's Department and the police are working on the murder of a white tourist and a young black woman accused of 15 years. I shook my head, ashamed that the detectives were protected from their abusive work, while the LIFE of a young man was in the crooked balance of justice. <br /> <br /> However, there is also a story of hope with our judicial system and how poorly paid public defenders trapped by their weapons (intentional irony) and forced the truth of the detectives. I wanted to fly to Florida and tell someone with influence what a great team of public defenders they have in Duval County; those lawyers care about the "little" man and, most importantly, about justice. <br /> <br /> The other line of the story is about faith and family. Praise to the defendant's family and their strong Christian beliefs (submit any dedicated religion) and the wonderful family values. I hope they win their lawsuit against the Duval County Sheriff's Department. <br /> <br /> Bravo for justice !!! Bravo for the little man!
