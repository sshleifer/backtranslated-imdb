Now that I'm a fan of science fiction, the trailer of this movie also looked a bit, how did I put it, Hollywood? But after seeing it with pleasure I can say that it has impressed me a lot. Jude is a class actor and Miss Leigh accomplishes it better than she in Delores Clairborne. It brings to mind movies like The Matrix, 12 Monkeys and The Cell, which may not seem so attractive, but it really is one of the best movies I've seen.
