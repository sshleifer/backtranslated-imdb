Sometimes it is difficult to define what separates a successful and charming comedy from a deflating one. In this case, the plot designed on a spoiled rich girl who tries to take her nieces away from the "bohemian" Greenwich Village that is raising them, only to fall in love with him, is not promising. And nothing in director Leigh Jason's filmography suggests that he was a great talent ignored. And yet, he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed and happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded in the film. <br /> <br /> He also had the good sense to cast this movie correctly. The only small flaw is Miriam Hopkins in a part for which Ginger Rogers would have been perfect. Hopkins is efficient but fragile, without the heat and sensuality that Rogers would have had. She is further hampered by a pair of strangely long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction. But a very young and very handsome Ray Milland could not be better in an exuberant and uninhibited comedy performance of great charm. <br /> <br /> And better than that, particularly for the residents of New York City, is the Hollywood description of Greenwich Village in 1937. Although it is completely synthetic and idealized, it is still recognizable to a contemporary viewer. The art director, Van Nest Polglase, created a jumble of thousands of shared apartments and backyards, which is the perfect setting for the collection of artists, wrestlers, addicts, addicts to smartlots and aspiring for this image. The best in the cast is Guinn Williams, who brings sweetness and lightness to his role as a sculptor-sculptor-dressmaker, and suggests the self-invention and fluency (sexual and otherwise) of life in the Village. Even more refreshing are Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby playing the girls. Simple, intelligent and full of humor, these girls look like real human beings and they do not look anything like the professional child actors of the time. <br /> <br /> Of special interest are a couple of memorable comics: Ray Milland's vacuum demonstration to a woman with a howling baby is played with more spontaneity than expected (the baby and its contortions are wonderful moments of "find") and a false domestic "game" in a window of a department store that degenerates into a free space. -all is fun too. The film slowly slides downhill with a hard-faced proof of custody and then never gets back on track when the action moves to Long Island, but this movie is still worth watching.
