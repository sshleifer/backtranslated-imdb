I can not believe how perfect this movie is. Great CG graphics, good story and fights, oh fights! This movie was great! The characters. They look real enough to be considered real. They definitely look like the ones in the game perfectly. The scene where ... well, all the scenes, left me speechless. Fantastic graphics 10/10 The story. Perfectly explained In addition, the way Aeris helps Cloud in different moments of the movie. They explain it very well and make your jaw fall from how perfect it is. But repetitive fights take away some history, but that's only a minor thing. Story 9.5 / 10 Everything else, great. The movie was simply amazing. I really do not know what else I can say, except that this movie was pretty perfect. I LOVED!!!
