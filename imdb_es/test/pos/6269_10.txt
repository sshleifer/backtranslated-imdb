Blademaster is definitely a memorable entry in the category of Swords and Witchcraft movies. I found Blademaster along with Quest for the Mighty Sword in a thrift store that was attended by people with mental disabilities and was very happy to pay 2.00 each for them. Credible sets and costumes, good fight with swords and a beautiful warrior, Mila makes this a nice watch. Some problems, however, there were many details in the plot that did not fit at all, as the men in the cave, for example. I did not understand his purpose. Also, this movie could have really benefited from some more monsters. The snake was great, but I think it lends a bit of Conan. However, any kind of primitive film in which someone ends up with a hanglider is fine for me (see Yor and Battle for Endor). I think Ator is great! Oh, and did someone else remind Gallager the villain or is it just me? I give Blademaster a 7/10
