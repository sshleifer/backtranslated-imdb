Although "They died with their boots on" is not entirely accurate historically, it is a very entertaining western. Flynn is not only the perfect Custer, the actors of the characters are excellent. In addition to the action part of the film, the love scenes of Flynn and DeHavilland are very moving and believable (Flynn and DeHavilland loved each other in real life). Flynn was always so tormented by not being taken seriously if he only knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play well!
