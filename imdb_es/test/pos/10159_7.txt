I hate to admit it, but I did not find it one of the best of Hitchcock, but at the same time it's a fascinating climatic thriller. In a new version of the 1934 Hitchock movie of the same title, Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart)? the man who knows too much, and his wife Jo McKenna (Doris Day) is on holiday in Morocco with his son Hank (Christopher Oslen) when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught in the network of a murder plot. The conspirators do everything possible to avoid interfering with their plan: kidnapping their beloved Hank. <br /> <br /> I found it surprising that Doris Day, whom I usually associate with Rock Hudson comedies, has been cast in a Hitchcock. movie. While I was watching it, I soon realized that it was more of a family movie compared to the other works of Hitchcock (example: Psycho) and that I had the singing ability necessary to achieve "Que Sera Sera", which he did perfectly . She was chosen as her and James Stewart had chemistry, which helped make the couple credible. <br /> <br /> Compared to the other works of the great director, I think this is not so good, but it is still Extremely Funny family / mystery thriller. There is also the additional advantage of Que Sera Sera, which turned out to be a great success for Doris Day. Well directed, well acted. A good movie.
