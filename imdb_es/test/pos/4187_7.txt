Unfortunately, this movie is relegated to the state of 'curiosity' that it seems. Many people I asked "Did you know that the Monkees made a movie?" he usually answers "no". That said, if you are one of that great number, I recommend you see it, but with the following warnings: If you expect humor in the Monkey style, it is there. It just is not everywhere, like television shows. <br /> <br /> Yes, they are trying to break their television mold a bit by making fun of it as a group of teenagers who are no longer the short end of many suits. <br /> <br /> No, you do not have to be drunk to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> No, you do not have to be drunk to understand it. <br /> <br /> If you like the classics, you'll love the interspersed clips. <br /> <br /> If you like the psychedelic era, you will love some of the cameos. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Monkees, you can recognize some of the hits that are taking in the great marketing of the band. <br /> <br /> In the almost immortal words of one of my best friends after watching 5 minutes: "This is a weird movie, man". In fact, it could be better if you do not try to understand it, just sit down and react. It's weird, it's fun, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (yet) ... it's a lot of things. In general, it is an experience.
