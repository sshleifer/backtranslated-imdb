10 respected directors each filmed a short film with operatic arias as inspiration (and music). I will do each one separately: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg (dir) - Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 in Vienna. Theresa Russell (wife of Roegs) plays a man! Not bad, very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - Verdi. There is no story, but there are some black and white images that fit perfectly with the music. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrific. Useless, boring, without plot, without anything. Full of free female nudity. Worst! <br /> <br /> Temple Julien - Verdi. Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo and Anita Morris star in this fun, though obvious story about an unfaithful couple. Fairly good. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - Erich Korngold. Short, exuberant and romantic. Very well. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - Jean-Philippe Rameau. Boring. A yawner. <br /> <br /> Fran Roddam - Richard Wagner. This has Bridget Fonda in her film debut. Beautifully made love story with a pretty explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - Giacomo Puccini. I really miss, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - Gustave Chapentier. Lyrical look at youth and old age. Very sweet. <br /> <br /> The last one is from Bill Bryden doing "I Pagliacci". He has John Hurt (!) Dressed as a clown who synchronizes his lips with Caruso (!!!). <br /> <br /> When this came out he almost got a grade of X (for the abundant nudity and the sex scene). He was given an R with a strict warning attached saying that the R rating would apply to a large extent. After the movie was bombed, the warning disappeared. <br /> <br /> The idea is not bad and 6 of the 10 segments were worth it. It's worth seeing even if you do not like opera. Just avoid the Godard segment. I give it an 8.
