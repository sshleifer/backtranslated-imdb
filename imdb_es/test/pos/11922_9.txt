This is one that is worth seeing, although sometimes it is corny, it is great to see a young Sean Astin, and this ends up being a very entertaining and humorous action movie. I saw it many times when I was young, and now I still enjoy it when I put the old vhs in the machine (I happen to have a copy). So sit down with this movie, let reality take a while and you can laugh for a while and enjoy a pleasant hour and a half.
