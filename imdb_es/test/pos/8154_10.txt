I've seen this movie on TV LOGO today. The powerful messages and the plot of this film completely captivated me. I do not want to spoil it. I will say this, I related to the internal struggle of Aaron and his education. As a gay man growing up in a small town, I interacted very well with the "big secret" and the decisions I made. This movie has had a great impact on me and I plan to buy a copy in the very near future for my personal library. I just finished the movie and started calling my friends to recommend it. It had such a profound effect on me. To those who read this comment. Look at it. Try to have as little distraction as possible. Also, keep an open mind. This is not a movie that can be seen as a Disney movie or the movie of the week. Instead, take the time to actively watch and listen to the dialogue, as well as read between the lines and participate in the plot. You may find yourself crying. Not since "Magnolias de acero" a film has moved me to tears. He did just that. Thanks to the cast, the writer and the team for producing a romantic film full of emotions about homosexuality and religion. It has been MUCH delayed.
