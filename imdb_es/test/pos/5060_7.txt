An Arab-American man is kidnapped at a US airport and taken to "somewhere in North Africa" ​​where he is tortured. The reason? His cell phone received a call from a known terrorist. The CIA decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the phone call is a consequence of guilt or just an error. After watching this movie, we can only pray that a terrorist does not accidentally enter a wrong number. <br /> <br /> In addition to the version, there are several related secondary stories. One involves the daughter of the intelligence chief (the secret police?) Who is torturing the suspect, and his relationship with his lover, who is in the night school of suicide bombers. This story is too artificial, but nevertheless intriguing, especially when we see its result. The Director uses an ordered timeline switch to engage the audience. <br /> <br /> The second complementary story is the suspect's wife's attempt to find out what happened to her missing husband. She gets an old lover to help. He (a silenced Saarsgard) is a senator's field assistant (Alda) and soon becomes cold when he realizes that his work is not worth discovering the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role. All she can do is look sad and pregnant, with a brief fit of anger. Streep is good and cold and stereotyped like the government. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) Officer who seems to be a clone of Cheney. <br /> <br /> Gylenhall is also wasted as a minor analyst in the area where he is on his head, although in the end he does the "right thing". <br /> <br /> I found The film was absorbing, although somewhat languid, but I thought it added little to the subject. It certainly should not be seen as definitive, and it certainly has an ax to grind. Like "The Kingdom", it brushes the surface of a very complicated subject. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to give us an idea about the interpretation, but it can only end up being a "caution story" about a failed one. one. The main objective of the delivery is not to "torture", but to make "suspects of terrorism" give their information avoiding legal barriers (therefore, obstructive). Torture, undoubtedly, can be used, especially if the interpretation is out of our hands, although obviously we are not innocent in this matter, but the intelligence that can save lives is vital in this "war in the shade".
