Someone definitely has it in The Wind and I can not believe that what I saw on the screen has a lot to do with it. This is a better and more solid film than most of the independents that I see throughout the year. The cinematography shows a genuine love and mastery of the trade and the casting was good. I would love to see more of these people, especially Zeke Rippy. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story and the script, I am not so sure that the negative comments that precede this publication were written with the intention of informing. Someone else about the movie. The extensive and long-lasting comments that must have taken hours to compose and are the only comments that the reviewer has left for any film on this site, are obvious slander directed at the producers of the film. I do not know the internal story, but it would probably be a good movie. What I do know for being close to this business, is that the productions that try to make everyone happy are usually terrible, and when the filmmaker has the guts, the drive and the common sense to "kill the babies", someone It always ends with feelings of pain. . That's also part of the business, and one of the best learning tools available to those truly dedicated to doing it in the movie business. Of course, the failures have nothing better to do than sit at home and write false comments on the internet as a form of vendetta against those who rejected them (read: they were honest and sincere with them). And that is my best guess to explain the unpleasant criticisms. Insofar as there is a grain of truth behind everything, there is a point that must be made, but these exaggerations of the grains are so exaggerated that they become obviously fictitious. <br /> <br /> It's not a joke. blood bath, if that's what you're looking for, it's more the psychological thriller of suspense, which is usually not appreciated by the lowest common denominators. The best way to see this movie is to try to erase any preconceived notion, insert it and let it develop. Seriously, the characters are defined by their actions and words, and when you see what these people do and what they say, I do not think you can come to the conclusion that these characters were underdeveloped. Maybe misunderstood. <br /> <br /> In general, I agree that this is a well-made and compelling film. Maybe I would not have given him a 9 under normal circumstances, but the serious negative comments actually attracted me to the image (I have a secret love for really bad movies). For me, ratings below 5 should be reserved for shlocky, inep, badly acted and stupidly written movies. None of that applies here: it's a quality film with a certain talent. I gave him the nine to tip the scales in the right direction. Watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong.
