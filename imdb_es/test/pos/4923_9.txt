I see this movie at the beginning of each summer, and it never stops having fun. Here the jokes are stored in almost all lines of dialogue, which gives more value than the average episode of the Simpsons. Some of the jokes do not work or only cause a slight giggle, but others will leave you rolling and then there are those that remain in your brain ... "The audience is now deaf." <br /> <br /> The video knows that it is a video, and does not pretend to be something else. It is easy to sit down and let the bombardment of humor begin. A good mix of slapstick, pop culture and ironic comedy ensures that there is something for everyone. I was in sixth grade when I first saw this video, and I must admit that I still find it so funny now that I started college. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch during the summer. in the same way you can see "It's a wonderful life" at Christmas or "Ten Commandments" at Easter / Easter. More than that, it's fun as hell.
