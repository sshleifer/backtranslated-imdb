Gene Roddenberry never disappointed his fans. His death ended with the legacy of science fiction that will never be equaled. Earth: The final conflict was a test! His pilot film and the first 2 Seasons were well written and produced meticulously, but somewhere along the way Roddenberry's touch was lost. The loss of leadership, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely affected the series as it was a vital part of what made it work. The story involves the human race that is being visited by the Taelons, an extraterrestrial race that they nickname themselves "The Companions". After 3 years, they have given Earth new technologies, useful information about the Universe and more. Many question their intentions here on Earth. The main link on Earth between the races is Da'an (Leni Parker) and is for many, the most reliable Taelon. Questions arise: why are they here? What are your objectives? Is Da'an aware of any suspicion of plots against humans? There is a clandestine group led by the industrial millionaire Jonathan Doors (David Hemblen) who uses his millions to investigate the Taelons. At the end of the first season, things are going well, Da'an seems reliable, Boone helps Doors in his research while working with Da'an and the Taelons as a liaison. In the middle of the 2nd season, things start to unravel and the series, which was once fantastic and fascinating, spirals, mainly because Roddenberry had died and was not present to guide the producers, of whom his wife, Majel Barrett-Roddenberry, was a co-producer. Still, the first season is still intriguing and fun to watch.
