This is a great movie of the night! What I mean by this is that I really enjoyed playing my VHS copy of $ 3.00 (now I have a DVD copy of $ 6.99!) Many nights before going to bed or if I have insomnia. There is something in this movie that makes it fun to watch it in repeated presentations. It could be the fun that Basil Rathbone has in "The Secret Weapon" with various costumes that deceive the bad guys and Holmes' assistant, Nigel Bruce (Watson), but not the housekeeper (Mary Gordon). It could be espionage, deciphered codes and the theme of World War II. It could even be the light touch that the director uses to handle the threatening situations in which Holmes finds himself while keeping the story moving. Whatever it is, "Secret Weapon" is simply a nice and fun detective story that takes us back to a time when the Nazis sought world domination and do so with the advantage of the camaraderie between Watson and Holmes. Whether you agree with the patriotic speeches and the noble "save the world" themes of this movie (I think they're right!), I think they only contribute to the flavor and fun of this adventure movie that it holds. to repeated viewings. I rate it with a nice 83/100 points.
