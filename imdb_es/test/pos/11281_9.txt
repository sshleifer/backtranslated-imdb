God cuts himself with a straight razor; later, she gives birth to mother earth, who then gives birth through the semen of the gods, son of the earth. <br /> <br /> This is a one and a half hour film that describes a dark version of how God created the world. It is surreal, dark and poetic. The most important aspect of the film for me is the visual aspect. It was filmed in a very grainy black and white film, using both slow and normal motion. Sometimes even fast movies and stop-motion. The scenes are long and dragged, which creates a very strange mood. No sounds were recorded when filming (I think), then sound effects were added, such as criccets, water and other environmental sounds, which are repeated over and over again. As you can understand, this movie is not for the impatient person ... <br /> <br /> I often felt that it was similar to David Lynch's Eraserhead, only that it is even harder to understand, and even more dragged, But that's fine with me, I like that kind of thing. It's certainly not entertainment (at least not the kind of Hollywood), so if you're going to check, I recommend you prepare for it. Be open-minded, and save something like the end of 2001: a space odyssey.
