For the first time people in making films, I think they did an excellent job. We have to support the emerging industry, especially from the north. It was very popular when I was at the movies, a good house and very good reactions and lots of laughs. It's a movie to feel good and that's how I felt when I left the cinema! He has a northern and positive humor about the community he represents. The movie has just started, I hope it goes well, people should support this little movie. I think this person 'vinny ...' is very bitter, for a reason! And becoming too personal? shame!! I say well done to everyone involved! Take me a drink! I look forward to your next adventure.
