Since so many reviews of this excellent film have been made, I will write in the form of a list and try to address issues that have not been discussed. <br /> <br /> 1. Dana Andrews was 38 years old during the filming of this movie. His character according to the script was about 20 years. Andrews, a very underestimated actor, brilliantly played a character who was supposed to be much younger. <br /> <br /> 2. Fredric March, like all the BIG actors, sometimes needs to be restrained by the director to avoid excessive acting. He was assaulting the cameras when he was drunk the night after his arrival and also the next morning, when he was looking at his mirror in the mirror. <br /> <br /> 3. Dana Andrews was excellent as she was in "Laura", "The Ox-Bowl incident", "A walk in the sun", "The purple heart" and many other movies. Why did Fredric March win the Academy Award and why was not Dana Andrews even nominated for her outstanding performance? <br /> <br /> 4. Harold Russell gave the best performance a non-actor has ever seen. <br /> <br /> 5. I realize that this was in the 1940s, but Dana Andrews did not seem to have any romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife (Virginia Mayo). <br /> <br /> 6. Ray Teal, who played the right wing mustache, years later became famous for playing the sheriff in "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> 7. The south teacher wrote that the film was slow, boring and bad acting. The teacher is more than likely uninformed about classic movies. The beauty and meaning of these classics without age is that they are studies of characters that move slowly and that avoid desecration, excessive violence and gratuitous sex. <br /> <br /> *** I was surprised that my opinion was useful to zero out of every 3 people.
