Really I liked this. (SPOILERS?) I had a really good plot, the main female in this movie is really cool. <br /> <br /> Even though she is the only one left alive and her lover dead, she seemed to be much like Ninja Scroll. Another kick kick movie. ;) <br /> <br /> Watch it in Japanese with subtitles. I do not know where the idiots who learned to speak English are, but for some reason all the dubs get an F in the translation techniques. The subtitles are more correct. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Playable: 9/10
