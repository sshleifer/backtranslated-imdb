Here is a film of adventure, determination, heroism and courage. In addition, it dates back to the end of the 19th century, which makes it even more interesting. It's a wonderful and adventurous story, and Alyssa Milano is wonderful to play Fizzy in a healthy, safe and sensible way ... a great role model. This is one of my favorite movies. It is a film to be seen again and again and will inspire and enrich your life without a doubt. Not only is the story excellent, but the film also has a fabulous stage and music and is wonderfully directed. This movie is as good as gold!
