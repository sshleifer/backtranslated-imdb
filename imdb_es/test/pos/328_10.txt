Kannathil Muthamittal is undoubtedly a great movie. I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for an excellent management job and A.R. Rahman for great songs. The work of the camera is excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I would be surprised if this movie does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Camera Work.
