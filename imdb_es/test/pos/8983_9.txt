This movie catches you from the initial scenes and never leaves you. You look with indulgence to see the emotion of Janos Szaby to come to the United States. He is a nice guy. You can not stop loving him, even when his enthusiasm is replaced by bitterness as his fortune changes. You know that in your circumstances, you would be forced to make the same decisions as him to survive. This film comments on the cult of society to beauty and all superficial things and is only more true in the culture of the 21st century. Janos himself becomes a victim of this philosophy when he tells his blind girlfriend "you are young and beautiful, if you could see, you would have the world". And like many other modern gangster movies, when his safety is threatened, he draws a powerful revenge. However, his innocence is not entirely lost, since he demands an equally high price of himself, knowing that he deserves his destiny. <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre is in good shape in this leading role. Only a few actors could convincingly achieve the transformation of this character from innocent to bitter criminal in sixty-nine minutes. Lorre is well supported by the entire cast, which makes this a real set image and not just a vehicle for a star. With a little less dialogue to preach, this movie would be a 10. Highly recommended.
