The Beguiled was one of the few Eastwood movies I had not seen until I turned the DVD around today. And from its opening in a shot sepia color to the macabre climax, I was completely captivated. Too many filmmakers these days substitute special effects, quick editing and dizzying camera work instead of character-based stories, but Director Don Siegel knew how to get the most effect out of this relatively simple plot, and the characters are believable and convincing <br /> <br /> The story concerns a school of ladies that is on the verge of several skirmishes during the American Civil War. The ladies who support the south meet a seriously wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood); returning health to health, he begins to manipulate sexually frustrated women for their own ends. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page is excellent in the role of the director with a secret, and her descent into madness is transmitted subtly. For a movie that takes place virtually in one place, it never loses visual interest. There is even the possibility that the normal status quo, abandoned for a long time when Eastwood's machinations are discovered, may return; but the lovers and the students go down a darker path ... <br /> <br /> This is a totally different film style from the same Dirty Harry from the same Director, made in the same year, and both are equally excellent . Eastwood is great at playing against his usual stoic anti-hero image, but there is also a mysterious quality associated with his character. We never really learn much about him before his imprisonment, and the viewer is free to decide on his well shaded person. Villain or victim? Whatever you think, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed it.
