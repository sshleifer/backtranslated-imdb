Good movie. <br /> <br /> I managed to collect this on a DVD at a local store. Â£ 2.99 seems like a good deal and it is. The thing is that the movie is called "To Kill For". It took some detective work to discover his original name. <br /> <br /> In the UK it has been rated an 18 and rightly so, although the standard of the films depends on the "selling capacity". After having seen Final Destination 3 last night, in my opinion, it should have been an 18. <br /> <br /> Maybe the fact that it's a treat, Traci Lords tends to make the leaderboard upload it to 18. It's a shame. <br /> <br /> Traci is a great actress and should be given the opportunity to appear in bigger and bigger budget productions. His ability to convert what is called a B-Movies into a good presentation is incredible. <br /> <br /> Long Live Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress.
