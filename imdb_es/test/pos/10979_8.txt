I saw the movie last night without knowing anything about it (nothing else seemed interesting to me and I had a Buffalo connection to this movie, a UB graduate). It was a very nice movie. I liked the rhythm (it recovers after a slow start) and the story. Good written plot and good development of characters and relationships. I recommend it to anyone who likes watching movies that have interesting stories. I found myself talking about this movie after a few beers, most of the discussions do not last more than a few minutes.
