The various Law & Order and CSI franchises should be happy that Dolomite does not pass. The lady cops, ADAs and forensic doctors would be captivated and the men would be subject to such soul tremors, logo-warp warp-speed kicks (would not you love to see David Caruso's Horatio and that's all in CSI to get Hush Dolomite puppies - taken from their respective donkeys) Ice T could start crying and return to Beach Trail. <br /> <br /> Low budget, bad acting but enthusiastic, and a vision of what the gutbucket nightclubs offered to their clients; funk bands soul singers, the last remnants of the old-style artists of the Chitlin Circuit (that strange dance company) James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding and many others came from those clubs to glory, while their companions they worked in local or regional stardom. Rudy Ray Moore came from that background and the Dolomite character is a mixture of the black bold that stood out. I should not have gone to the joint, the pig did not have an order, how his middle-aged and blubbery person maintained a loyal stable of kung fu wenches is a mystery that only a student of cults can explain, but all that is next to him point. It is a glorious home movie of a legendary performer who, in comparison to the actors' mirrors that range from Established Hollywood to indie snorefests, comes to an end. A funny silly movie!
