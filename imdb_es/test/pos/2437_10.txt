It was a sweet introduction for the smartest sailor soldier, Sailor Mercury. It consisted of a new "en croud", Merciurios. He, at first, wrote a love letter to Ami, which would be stupid (of course) and, now, Ami thiks is a chibi-Einstien, and is attractive (he ended up looking like Umino (Melvin)). This was a scene of halaries (especially of Minako "There is no skin on my neck (HOT!)) Well, I really like the series Sailor Moon by Bishojo Senshi, personally I think it's the best anime of all! Fun, but not as adventurous as Sailor Moon R- It looked more like the movie "S." I saw this @ Sailor Moon Univewrse, with Real Player, and it was quite good. (In general)
