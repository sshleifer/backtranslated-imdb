Yesterday I saw this black and white comedy at the London Film Festival. Structurally, it has been compared to Pulp Fiction, but it may be closer to the structure of Amores Perros and the more vague mood of Kevin Smith's employees. Four floors intersect in a restaurant on the French highway. The first vignette has Franck (Edouard Baer) pausing at the restaurant. The waitress, Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) takes pity and tells her story. The second has two incompetent kidnappers, Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere) take a teenager out of their rich family. Unfortunately for them, she is suicidal and her family does not seem to want her to return. The third is a dialogue between two aging rock stars who bump into each other in the restaurant (Alain Bashung and Arno playing themselves). The final part is about four ex-delinquents who smuggle their former companion from the hospital to visit their former hiding place, which since then has become ... dinner. An "epilogue" returns to Franck and Suzie to complete his story (it is not really an epilogue, more a conclusion). <br /> <br /> The structure does not really work. The stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in Pulp Fiction. The diner is also not crucial to the action of at least two of the stories in the way the car accident was crucial in the four stories of Amores Perros. The quality of individual stories varies. The story of the hiding place is a nice idea, with a couple of good gags, but it does not come off; and the meeting of the rock star is useless and boring. On the other hand, the story of the kidnapping is hilarious, although its connection with the diner is tenuous. The most balanced and successful story is that of Franck and Suzie. <br /> <br /> This movie is not entirely successful, but it has moments of interest and hilarity. I hope to see more of the work of Samuel Benchetrit, the writer and director.
