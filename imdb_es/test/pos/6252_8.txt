Do not you just hate slashers who never seem to start? Sometimes it takes a full hour of false false leads before real action takes place. "Tourist trap" is not like that! If what you normally want is a dreadful cut ... then you will get a sleazy cut! Lots of quantity and constantly from start to finish! This film contains what is probably the best opening sequence in the horror movies of the 80s when a teenager, on a walk after a motor problem, is trapped in a deserted house and is assaulted by a spooky collection of statues waxy. Four other slaughter lambs arrive at the house and meet a completely insane maniac who looks like a mixture of Leatherface (from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre") and one of those crazy sculptors of old wax-museum films. "Tourist Trap" is an exciting horror entertainment, with some suspense, spooky images, rarities, morbid humor and incredible makeup effects. The twists of the plot are not always original and the acting is pretty bad but, seriously, who cares? The fast pace and the wonderful killer icon caused this "Tourist Trap" to gain a place among my 5 favorite slashers. A little surprising is the total lack of nudity, however. Too bad, because all the girls look dazzling and after only 10 minutes, the obligatory line "Who needs a swimsuit?" is spoken.
