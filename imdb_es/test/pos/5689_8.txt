Gore hounds be careful ... this is not your movie. This little bitter nail has very little blood and guts. It is basically an Open Water version that is effective and worthwhile. But what distinguishes it is that we really like the three drivers (unlike Open Water) who are in a tree when a crocodile throws his fishing boat and chews on his guide. We do not want any damage to reach any of them. So when they start to get into dangerous situations ... we really care. <br /> <br /> Now I like killer animal movies, but I have not been very impressed with Lake Placid until Primeval (although I'm still waiting to see Rogue and I hope it's a good place like this!) but this little fag did the job and did it well. Their fears are creative and they just fall into the mill race crying frantically sobbing and arguing for brief periods of realism, so I never bothered. <br /> <br /> I remember reading the real story that inspired this when three guys went fishing and two ended up in a tree while their friend was killed by the crocodile. But what always struck me and stayed out of the movie was that the crocodile did not eat the friend. No. For hours and hours he swam around the tree and shook the dead body in his mouth to the friends in the tree. Seeming to stay, if you come here, this is what will happen to you.
