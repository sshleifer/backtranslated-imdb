"Edge of the City" is another film that owes a lot of credit to "On the Waterfront". From your New York City locations, to your score, or the belief that, regardless of the problems you may be in, you can somehow correct your mistakes. <br /> <br /> "Edge" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. In my opinion, that's where the movie does not succeed as "Waterfront." At 85 minutes, the film rushes through the establishment of relationships and ties everything together so fast that much of what seems forced and incredible. <br /> <br /> Possible Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have developed even more at the beginning. I do not think these two characters, from two very different places, have built such a strong relationship so quickly. <br /> <br /> I think that the whole subplot of love with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. It is so uncomfortable with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason she is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing in the end. There are other ways you could have shown this. I would also have liked to see some scenes of Axel in the army to illustrate why this is so. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Poitier is great in a beautifully written paper. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected and intelligent. Cassavettes, like Axel North, although it is very good, does not seem quite right for the part. Warden is fantastic as the boss who knows Axel's secret (although his fight scene with Cassavettes at the end is horribly organized - too many separation boxes). I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful in the role of Poitier's wife. <br /> <br /> In general, "Edge of the City" is a smart movie, with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style. Image, without taking the time to let the drama grow. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
