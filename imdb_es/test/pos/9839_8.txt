Frankie Darro was a wonderful child actor who stood out for being a bit aggressive with big chips on his shoulders. He appeared in a couple of the best films of the early 30s: "The Public Enemy" (1931), an innovative crime drama and "Wild Boys of the Road" (1933), a movie of the era of depression today about the children who travel on the rails. It was essentially a younger version of James Cagney. Although below his height, his willingness to do his own stunts kept him employed in a series of programmers when the larger studios no longer served him. <br /> <br /> It was assumed that "Crime School" was a remake of "The Mayor of Hell", but he had much more humor and presented The Dead End Kids and Humphrey Bogart as a very calm commissar. "The mayor of hell" is really a combination of "House of hell" / "School of crime" / "Child's city". Although Cagney did not make an appearance until around the 25th minute, its impact (as always) was immediate. He plays a hot-headed gangster who is on the payroll of a political group run by the Mafia. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darro) and his gang (including "Farina" from "Our Gang") direct a wash the car racket, but chop more than they can chew when they rob in a store and They push the owner through a glass window. Appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to go to the state reformatory. It is painted in bright terms, a model school where children have the opportunity to learn a trade. Actually, it is a hellish place run by a sadistic director, Mr. Thompson (highlighted by Dudley Digges). The only compassionate person is Dorothy Griffith, the resident nurse (played by Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> "Patsy" Gargan (James Cagney) received the position of new Deputy Commissioner, as a favor. Upon arriving at the school, he witnesses a failed escape attempt and, after speaking with Dorothy, realizes that the school needs radical reforms. He soon runs the school and presents a system of "self-government", rather like "Boy's Town". Even though Cagney does not have much to do, the image is brought to its climax by Darro's energy. After "Patsy" is temporarily offstage (he accidentally shoots a mobster and has to leave the state), Thompson returns and his brutal treatment, resulting in the death of a child ("Skinny"), converts the rest of children in an angry mob Burn a barn and Thompson falls to his death. "Patsy" returns just in time to reassure the crowd with a sobering talk. <br /> <br /> Sure, all the guys seemed to get tough talking to them. His crimes, but I do not agree with one of the reviewers: Thompson was more than a "villain". His sadistic treatment resulted in the death of a child. There is a scene at the beginning in which the children are served a small inedible portion: Thompson asks for ham and eggs and keeps piling butter on his bread while talking to Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Allan Jenkins plays "Uncle" Mike and Sheila Terry, although cataloged only as "a blonde" has one of the most memorable phrases when she pouts and says "I thought there were going to be youngsters here" . , where are they? "!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
