A MUST SEE documentary .----- This movie had many things to consider when watching it. It was a great documentary of an essay by a 15-year-old black boy named Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman about the description of the man who killed his wife. The husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing. Little police to investigate the crime. Brenton's lawyer, Patrick McGuinness, is meticulous in obtaining information to help his client. He tells viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use in the police to show his incomplete investigation and the beatings against his young client to confess. The camera goes with McGuinness to where Brenton was interrogated. McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is monitored. He asks a policeman on the stand and asks what Brenton heard from one of the investigators and he challenges his own words. McGuinness investigates with Ann Finnell every place where the police should have gone and the things they should have done but did not do. The film shows the mayordomos as a loving Christian family that has faith in the innocence of their son and in the faith that God will release Brenton. They visit him in prison and pray with him there to encourage him. There are group prayer scenes for Brenton, the lawyers, the judge and everyone involved in this case. I am white and I was surprised to see how black people in high police positions treat other blacks. It was very disappointing to see the black and white police hold together when they think they got their man. The police have a hard job and I think most of them are honorable, not like the ones in this movie. I think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the judicial system, including judges, police and lawyers and even possible juries to watch this movie and learn from it.
