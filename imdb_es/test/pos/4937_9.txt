Over the years, some of the most enjoyable movies have been about dysfunctional families. <br /> <br /> Bonjour, Monsieur Sholmi is a film of this type <br /> <br /> This is an Isreali film about a Moroccan Jewish family. <br /> <br /> This could be about any family, in any culture. We all know or would like to meet people like you in this comic gem. <br /> <br /> This delight of 2003 was written and directed by Shemi Zorkin. Hopefully you have a long career. <br /> <br /> The film is seen through the eyes of the 16-year-old son, who seems to be worried about all the members of the family. He is brilliantly played by Oshri Cohen (he was 18 years old when he made the film. <br /> <br /> He has been in a few since and I know I will look for them.I hope this young man will become an international star. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is magnificent, I hope to see you again. <br /> <br /> I loved everyone in the cast to a certain extent, I think everyone who sees this will agree. <br /> <br /> He has been nominated for many international awards and has won 8, he deserves each. <br /> <br /> Now that it is a film in a language other than English, he had a very limited career. that seems to me regrettable. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, you'll be glad you did. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Since the story is not new, this is the highest rating you can get.
