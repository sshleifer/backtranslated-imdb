The greatest tragedy that man faces is that, so often capable of the divine, he is content with the banal. From this fact arises such a great tragedy. Death in Venice is one of the few films with patience and courage to address this fact head on. It confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in its two most inevitable human forms: the negation and decadence of the human being. Undoubtedly, this is the best movie that does not have a perceptible influence in conventional cinema. Its austere and refined appearance, its echo sound, the mixture of languages ​​without subtitle and highly challenging subjects are impossible to copy: both an accident of its peculiar production and the vision of its director. The central performance, at once rigid, awakened and vulnerable to expression and decay, highlights Bogarde as if he were not the best British actor of his generation and, certainly, the most adventurous. Able to cling to sympathy when his desires dominate him and interesting despite the endless approaches and the score of Mahler playing on him. Not one for a Friday night with your girlfriend, but it's certainly fine if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitation.
