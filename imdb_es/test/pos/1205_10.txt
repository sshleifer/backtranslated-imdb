Now more than ever we need Peace & Love in this world! <br /> <br /> This movie really shows the wonderful music of the Broadway show and the fabulous choreography of the legendary Twila Tharp! I saw it again after many years, and it still stays well. <br /> <br /> Thanks, MGM / UA for putting this on DVD! I love the option to watch on Widescreen. MGM seeks to do this in many of its DVD releases. <br /> <br /> You have to love Treat Williams as Berger and John Savage as Claude. They could not have chosen better actors and actresses for this movie! Beverly D'Angelo is a "hot mom" in this movie. I had forgotten how hot! WOW! <br /> <br /> The cast is absolutely great, <br /> <br /> with the late great Nell Carter making a cameo singing in a couple of scenes, as well as the witty Charlotte Ray (Mrs Garrett in 'Facts of life') <br /> <br /> The story weakens a bit towards the end, but the anti-war sentiment of the late '60s still stands, and is relevant today. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed (pretty much in the location) and it's very colorful and charming, and it really brings the spirit of 1968 to the big screen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie when it was released in 1979 when I was 15, and it moved me then, and it still moves me to 40. Some other critics here say that they think it should have been done before, I do not think Hollywood was ready to make a film of this kind in the late 60s and early 70s. <br /> <br /> The Vietnam War ended in 1975, and everything was a little too close to home, I think this History will be filmed before. it was (as in 1969, 70, 71) <br /> <br /> Bravo to Director Milos Foreman! I love this movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It's good to see her again, this time on DVD. It never looked better!
