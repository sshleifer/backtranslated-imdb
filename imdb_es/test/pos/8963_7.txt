Summary: Based on the true story of Charlie Wilson, an American congressman, who (according to this film) was instrumental in the US secret war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Comments: A pretty funny movie about Not so funny things, especially because they were real. But focusing on the film, Hanks performs very well as a womanizing congressman with a good heart who becomes the champion of the secret war in Afghanistan. Hanks, and the whole movie, especially Philip Seymor Hoffman, has a rather comical tone. So much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate. But, the story that counts, and perhaps the end, is really serious. <br /> <br /> A story of what happened with some questions about what could have been. So the movie works like a comedy if you want one, and much more serious if you want that. Something for everyone? 7/10
