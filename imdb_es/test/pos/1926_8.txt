"Ideas are dangerous." Comment from an interviewee <br /> <br /> DVD Rating: B + / 4 of 5/8 out of 10 / It's worth it. <br /> <br /> A great story for adults / teenagers, but not for children. None of the violent criminal stupidities so often confused by Hollywood these days as "quality work". And it can be used as a training film about what is, or is not, about the proper preparation for navigation before "sailing the seven seas". The film begins somewhat slowly to develop the story as most documentaries do, but as it draws the viewer into the saga, emotions begin to seep into the head! Emotions include anger, sadness and disbelief. The era: late 60's. <br /> <br /> The fact that sailing alone around the world is dangerous is not surprising. The surprising thing is all the turns that the spectators did not expect. It's not your average group of guys in a sailing race! Each boat was different as allowed by the rules of the race. Each navigator only had different skill levels as allowed by the rules of the race. There were well-known sailors among them and some not so well known. One was considered a mysterious man, since no one seemed to have any knowledge of his ability. Each ship was allowed to leave at will as long as everyone was on the move by a certain date. And this was, of course, before the modern electronics that allow navigators to communicate with the coast about violent storms, etc. <br /> <br /> Real audio and video recordings are interspersed with interviews of family members and other people involved. The mood of the interviewees is always grim despite the years that have passed. <br /> <br /> The main character, Don, is the focus of attention and how his trip relates to those he not only wanted to overcome, but because of the circumstances of his own creation, he had to win. He had to win. The story was about what that circumstance did with his life when he moved southwest through the Atlantic Ocean for a year alone on the water. <br /> <br /> Do not forget to watch the "special features" section of the DVD once the movie is finished. The complete saga is not completely understood without seeing the 'extra' things. <br /> <br /> In the end, once you've seen everything on the DVD, it's likely that you just shake your head and exclaim, 'Wow.' And keep in mind that THAT is the reason why history has been alive for the past 40 years. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: DO NOT miss watching the "special features" section of the DVD once the movie is over. A sailor who was heading back to England after going around the world for the world decided on the spot that, no, he was going to take another turn and the film records the opinions of his spouse on that decision. The opposite story develops when another sailor wants the race to allow two on board in order to take his wife and his photos show a very warm bond between them. The interview with a former burley paratrooper who had actually CARRIED a ship across the Atlantic with a friend before the solo race was incredibly fun, as he described that he did not know how to navigate and that he thought the bad things were happening to him They were "normal". 'Too many people think that sailing in the open sea can be a romantic adventure without setbacks. Do not be one!
