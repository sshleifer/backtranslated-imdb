Terry and June were one of the classic British comedies in my opinion. You knew what to expect, and it's not that typical! :) Unlike modern sitcoms with totally invented plots, this show is still a breath of fresh air. How nice to see or hear comments on bodily functions or not see a family PERPETALLY late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers. And therein lies the secret: Terry and June were based on a middle-class couple living in relative harmony instead of the tense plots of the dysfunctional 'de rigueur' family (made to look modern). <br /> <br /> I vote for the episode "Bridge to Far" as one of the best. In a way, Terry's antics remind me of Basil Fawlty, both of them sometimes become embarrassing! <br /> <br /> Terry and June are highly recommended. Have your tea and cookies ready!
