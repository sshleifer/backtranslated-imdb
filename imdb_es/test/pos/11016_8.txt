Because it's late and I'm running out of vocabulary, I'll describe this movie as "beautiful and heartbreaking," begging forgiveness from those who shudder at such clich√©s. Robin Tunney does an incredible job representing a young woman in the grip of Tourette syndrome: his character was absolutely sincere and convincing, and I will continue his career wherever he goes because of this movie.
