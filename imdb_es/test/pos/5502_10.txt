For some inexplicable reason, Jerry's films often seemed to become diatribes of certain sectors, although they were rarely disappointments at the box office. It is one of the great mysteries of life for me because his films have always had a "feel good" factor about them for me. But this movie is not only not bad: it is an extremely good and intelligent comedy. For those who are tickled by crude or cruel "modern" humor, do not watch this movie: there is nothing like that and you will waste your time. <br /> <br /> I've only seen it This movie once on TV. I have waited since then to see him again and a few years have passed. You would think that the idea of ​​an arrogant millionaire businessman leaving to win the war against the Nazis with his own small private army of servile employees would be boring, would not it? Well, only Jerry Lewis would dare to try a plot for a comedy and it works, I have to say it brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I think that, as with 'The Nutty Professor' and most of his In other films, this film is a testament to his comedic genius, both in concept and in execution. I think Buddy Love could have said: "True comedy can not only make a six-year-old boy hysterical, it will also be for his father." Maybe some crazy Nazi generals with monocles and a limp would dislike this movie, honestly. If you only see one more comedy in your life, look at this one. But be careful, you could die laughing. And I'm not kidding!
