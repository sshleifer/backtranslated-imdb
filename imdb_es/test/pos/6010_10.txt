This movie is a wonderful example of the quality dramas that Channel 4 and the BBC have produced over the years. Ted Danson offers a powerful performance of a man tormented by memories that no one will accept, and a society that believes he is crazy. It is a remarkable performance of a man best known for his role in Cheers, a television comedy. The cast is very well chosen, among them Mary Steenbergen, Danson's wife, who acts as part of Gulliver's wife in the film. But above all, it is the perfect and very delicate changes between our world and the world of Gulliver that make this film. The difference in perspective between the giants and the dwarves, all played by real actors, is captured perfectly. A rare quirk of cinematography and direction.
