I am really sad that this film has received so many negative reviews. I think it's a nice little comedy and very funny. The humor in this movie is warm and innocent and I like it. I also like Madonna's character and I do not agree that she played herself. She has created a character and a nice one. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes were the fight scene at the top of the sinking car and where Madonna climbs over the fence with an elegant dress to claim her love. The humor in the film has a slightly realistic touch and may not be to everyone's taste. But it's your problem, not the movie. <br /> <br /> I found this film healthy and sunny. In fact, the day I saw it for the first time I felt incredibly sad and this movie lit up my day. And Madonna can act. Just take off your negative thinking glasses.
