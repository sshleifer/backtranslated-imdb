The MST3K guys roasted this movie, but it's really a piece of low-budget black cinema. The plot is tense, the characters are credible (within the genre of the good guy is obsessed with the bad girl), the rhythm is solid, the climax is well managed and the cast is reinforced by several actors of excellent characters. . It is true that most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but in reality it is quite spooky when playing against the brain. The scenes between him and his father are quite powerful, in a minimalist way. Of course it's depressing, but that's the point. Good movie.
