When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a very strange movie. But I know that the director almost always has a purpose when he makes a movie. So I decided to see it one more time. The second time I saw him I realized that Albert Puyn is a very original and very talented filmmaker. At first the viewer was told that the film took place a decade after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. But they had clothes and cars with a typical design of the fifties. They had plutonium, which I think is a symbol for futuristic trade. I think it means that the actual time of the movie is not specified. The music in the film is creating a long music video that tells some parts of the real story in the lyrics, especially for the introduction and the outro. <br /> <br /> Albert Puyn is using the red and blue background color when He is showing the symbols for communism (red) and capitalism and the western world (blue). One can notice that Ice-T, has the name of Mao (communism) and that when it is focused, the background color is red. The American policeman, starring Burt Reynolds, is always filmed with a blue background. The club where Mao and his gang meet is also dark red. Crazy six is ​​hanging between red and blue. <br /> <br /> The little white dog that Mao had at the beginning symbolizes, I believe, the controlling force. Mao had the dog at first, but the policeman took it at the end. I suppose that symbolizes the fall of communism and the replacement of capitalist thinking in the Western world in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I think Crazy Six is ​​a very well made movie. Albert Puyn creates a science fiction / action film with a political depth. It is a different but very special film about the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I really want to see another spectacular film by Albert Puyn.
