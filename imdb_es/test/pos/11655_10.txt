Susan Sarandon is, for lack of a better word, incredible. In my opinion (and yes, I understand that not everyone will agree with me), she is one of the best actresses in history and should have at least 2 Oscars to her credit. I mean, that was an INCREDIBLE performance at Lorenzo's Oil (but then I think every one of his performances is amazing) and they gave it to Emma Thompson ... what was that? And when he got this Oscar, he had been in the industry for about 25 years. He could not think of anyone who deserved it more, especially for such a brilliant performance as his portrayal of Sister Helen Prejean. But, again, she is above all the artificiality of Hollywood and does not need an Oscar, people know she is good anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie contains some very deep messages that provoke thoughts, so it is not necessary. Say that it should not be taken lightly. Tim Robbins, of course, can not escape the credit here. You would think that, due to your personal feelings against the death penalty, the representations made in this film would not be accurate. However, both sides of the debate on the death penalty have a uniform weight. On the one hand, you see the interesting side of Matthew, the human side that makes witnessing his death more heartbreaking. At the same time, you see the way he attacked his victims and the constant torment of the parents, understandably affected by the grief. A word for Tim - BRAVO. <br /> <br /> A brilliant film and, as I said, an Oscar well-deserved and awaited for Susan.
