Hey, it's just television. Sure, it's STAR TREK, the most loved blah blah, and this is great, but everything is relative. What it comes down to is a guy with elf ears who huddles with a piece of pizza-colored stuffed carpet. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of novelty of THIRD MAN in the search of the tunnel, and it is more spooky than many episodes of what is after all one of the best television programs. The suspense is really suspense. Danger really feels dangerous. As a small child, I think I cried when Spock told me that this horrible creature was as sad, scared and horrified as the people who ate. This was one of my first lessons on empathy, a lesson reinforced by the EMPATH episode that was, though less exciting, even more melancholy. <br /> <br /> What bothered me when I was five years old was this thing, which seems like meat and tomato, somehow actually consists more or less in rock. Now, that kind of choice may seem visionary, the idea of ​​a hippie designer of a single university through the mirror, but it could also be an anecdote of the era of drugs.
