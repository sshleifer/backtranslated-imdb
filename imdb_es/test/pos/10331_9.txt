This film should have been easily described as a movie <br /> <br /> that promotes better human understanding among people. <br /> <br /> It can be quite annoying to even try to understand that a young Jewish woman from the south could give shelter to a German prisoner of war who escaped. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol represents an amazing portrait of the unhappy young woman who longs for acceptance and love. Michael Constantine had a remarkable performance when his difficult father and Esther Rolle, as the maid, Ruth, had an excellent Emmy-winning performance when a sympathetic maid met with these events. <br /> <br /> Bruce Davison plays the German who is supposedly not guilty of Nazi atrocities. This is how your paper appears. He has escaped, but joined the German army and could have been a member of Hitler's youth movement. <br /> <br /> The action takes place in 1944 Georgia, in a rural area. The townspeople are full of prejudices. Even the FBI inspector acts as if he would like something from the Jews. Notice the opposite interpretation that, while McNichol is in bed, Davison is hunted down and, finally, shot. It is interesting to see that the society considers McNichol as a traitor for harboring a escaped prisoner of war. The film is also about an extremely complex relationship between father and daughter. The outburst of Constantine towards his daughter at the end is something of acting. As the mother, Barbara Barrie, has little to do. It was annoying that she was stereotyped like the typical Jewish mother with that lipstick tone on her lips. <br /> <br /> Made in a memorable way and well worth seeing.
