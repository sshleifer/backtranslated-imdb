One of those films that I found through The Criterion Collection and, as usual, was allowed as a change of pace. That turned out to be a great decision. I was almost captivated by the quality of the film, the story it told and the way it was told. The almost minimalist feel of the film with a sparse dialogue and almost constant music has just added an evocative level to the film. This is really an excellent movie to hang out and enjoy.
