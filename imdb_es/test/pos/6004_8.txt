Despite its many shortcomings, the Hallmark version of Gulliver's Travels in 1995 remains the best adaptation of Jonathan Swift's classic satirical, largely because it not only includes ALL of Gulliver's many travels, but also includes satire that is often overlooked. Unfortunately, the twin problems of the highly episodic structure of the book and a television budget (even a rather luxurious one) remain. The book is a rather confusing collection of tales of travelers moving simply from one surrealist landscape to another, but Simon Moore's adaptation attempts to impose a certain order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot in which Gulliver returned to England clearly deeply traumatized and trying to prove his exit from the asylum where the rival for the affections of his wife has committed. The scenes from England at the same time reflect and comment on the trips, elements of which occasionally extend to the real world. The problem is that during the first hour, more or less, it acts more as a distraction, steadily moving away from the story, just when it starts to be interesting. The scenes of Lilliput suffer worse here, with the feeling that home scenes are too often designed to prevent them from filming the most expensive elements; This must be the only version in which we do not see Gulliver pulling Blefescu's fleet behind him. <br /> <br /> However, once Gulliver escapes, the tone becomes more consistent as he reverses his situation and becomes the mascot of the giants of the utopian of Brobdingnag, a guest of the wise from the floating island of Laputa. those who are so absorbed in science that they no longer have common sense, the guest / prisoner of a historian who supports history directly from the source, offers immortality with all its terrible consequences before finally finding the world to which it wants to belong, if It is that you can convince him. the sublime horses that speak, the Houynhnhms that it is not an uncivilized Yahoo, each new destiny convinces him of the absurd and petty that humanity is. For the most part, it is a darker travel set than expected, with only curiosity and common sense and Gulliver's disappointment preventing him from immersing himself in an irreparable desolation, and even this is countered by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth, he could very well have made him really crazy. It is in these last scenes that Ted Danson's Gulliver really shines, never more than in an extraordinary speech in which he turns his judgment into a disappointed judgment on the entire human race. <br /> <br /> Made for television, the Yahoos are more or less literally eschatological here on the page, but for the most part it is a treatment for adults more than you would expect without a real problem. The star cast is certainly impressive, and for the most part well-used (albeit briefly in some cases): Mary Steenburgen, James Fox, Peter O'Toole, Edward Woodward, Omar Sharif, Shashi Kapoor, Edward Fox, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, Kristin Scott Thomas and Isabelle Huppert among them. It's hard to imagine that the next version of Jack Black comes close to being a fraction as impressive as this one.
