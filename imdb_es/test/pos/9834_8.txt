It is true, there are some mistakes, for those who want to find them. However, they are not important. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this movie is to see expert veteran experts do their job. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays the role of a strong woman, but one that has been hurt. The same for Harrison Ford, who, for the ladies, is as beautiful as Kristin is beautiful to us. <br /> <br /> Their pain at the hands of their adulterous wives unites them in an uncomfortable way, but one in which they find support among themselves. The way they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity on the screen is the reason why these are the most sought after artists. The viewer can not help feeling what he feels, nor can one want to encourage them when they are together. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt policemen, but they only give it flavor. a little, and they are not a significant part of the movie. <br /> <br /> For the music lover, Dave Grusin offers a magnificent background based on jazz, with trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Like the actors, Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought-after musical consultants in the film business. Blanchard shows why he is one of the premiere trumpeters on the scene. <br /> <br /> It is not a movie for lovers of gut, blood and blood. But for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, look at a beautiful English actress with big blue expressive eyes that can act, like Harrison Ford, with the endless and gentle accompaniment of Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard. Move to look with someone you love. Preferably in bed. <br /> <br /> I thought I deserved at least an 8.
