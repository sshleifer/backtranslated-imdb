What can I say about Kramer vs. Kramer? On the surface it is quite simple, but below it deals with emotions larger than life itself. It offers many fantastic moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You sympathize with the characters and you care about them. Many films fail in this, Kramer against Kramer is a success. <br /> <br /> I think everyone would agree that the performance is excellent. Once you see Kramer against Kramer, for a while the acting in most of the other films begins to feel plastic and emotionless. The actors seem to get along with their roles and the characters really live on the screen. There is a beautiful chemistry between them. I think the best performance in the movie comes from the young Justin Henry. It's different from any other child actor I've seen. It is incredibly natural. <br /> <br /> Also, there is some kind of neurotic beauty in Meryl Streep. And Dustin Hoffman offers one of the best performances of his career! The story is very well written. It's simple but complicated at the same time. The concept is the simple part, the associated feelings are the complicated part of it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, you are definitely missing it! Watch it now!
