The Royal Rumble has traditionally been one of my favorite events, and I've been a fan of the fight for some years now. It is possible that the other programs have better games, but I have always found that the real game of rumors is full of emotion. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to reveal the winners of any matches since I do not see It's fair to ruin the results in a review. However, I will comment on the quality of them. <br /> <br /> We have the 4 standard matches, and then the big rumor event. Two of Smackdown and two of Raw. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Edge open for Raw. This proves to be a good match for two talented boys. This is a match I would recommend seeing. It is difficult to summarize without delivering the winner. <br /> <br /> Next, we have the usual Undertaker against an unpleasant monster, I know who he is. Giant Gonzales, Yokozuna, Kamala ... well, this time it's Heidenreich. It is also a coffin party. Typical Undertaker rate. Look if you're a fan. I have to admit that I am, purely because of the entertainment factor. It can hardly be considered as a classic fight of struggle. <br /> <br /> The next two games are the matches for the title. For once, Smackdown manages to climb the Raw stage. His match for the title is quite exciting and pleasant, but with an anti-climax and disappointment in the end. Raw's game is a boring and boring affair, which is a shame because I'm a fan of the two guys involved. <br /> <br /> Now, to the main reason, I love the event, the rumor. It's a very good this year. When we got to the event, we all had a good idea of ​​who could win, and it may not be a big surprise, but hey, it's very nice. There are the various habitual ways of eliminating people. There is a symbolic guy who does not get to the ring, the participant who is ridiculous and we all want to be beaten, and someone is eliminated by a previously eliminated fighter. It has its usual ups and downs, and I loved the end, particularly the entry of Vince McMahon. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this show. Not WWE in top form, but still good. Add it to your collection.
