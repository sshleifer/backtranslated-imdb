I saw this movie in 1954 on a double sign with "Valley of the Kings". These films helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, "The Egyptian" suffers from a plain dialogue and some gaucho touches, but it is a glorious movie to watch, the kind of things that Hollywood, unfortunately, simply does not do anymore. - and it has a great story ... not only the usual matter of boy with girl or revenge is mine. Too bad that 20th will not issue restored copies of this again to see them on the big screen.
