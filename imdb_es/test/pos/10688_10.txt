I had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable science fiction network. It reminded me of the Irwin Allen television series of the late '60s (Time Tunnel, etc.). Excellent effects (they beat Star Trek 5 20 years ago, but that was not very difficult to achieve). <br /> <br /> I found the script very interesting and mature for this type of production. They would have needed some tweaking to tie some loose ends to the character level, but for a children's film it's surprisingly interesting (especially the glimpse of futuristic Euro-politics, surprisingly similar to the current European Union!) <br /> < The plot reminds Twilight Zone in general (as other users have pointed out), but in this case it is a compliment. <br /> <br /> Great sets, by the way! <br /> <br /> 7/10
