I remember seeing a movie by Elizabeth Montgomery when I was maybe 5 years old (if so) and to this day I can remember this movie (in pieces and pieces). It was the movie that I remembered all my life because I was very scared. I think I remember the part of the story and the house constantly dark. The main part that caught my attention was that Elizabeth walked through the house in the dark and then there was someone outside in the field. At that time I thought I was an old witch, but her memory is now very blurry, so I really can not remember who she was, but definitely someone in a field outside was lurking ... and that part is what scared me. the most I really wish I could see this movie again. If anyone knows how to get a copy, send me an email to valid908@yahoo.com
