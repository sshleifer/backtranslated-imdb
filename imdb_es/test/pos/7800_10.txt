This is my favorite Indian movie of all time. The genius is funny. Salman Khan is hilarious. But Amir Khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. The costumes of Karisma Kapoor tell their own story: it makes you wonder if the stylist forced her to wear some clothes just to make the movie more fun (at one point, she seems to be wearing a diaper). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie that makes me laugh from the beginning to the end. There is not a dull moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will make you laugh. I especially loved the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) 'regains his memory'. I've seen this movie so many times that I've lost count. And I'm pleased to say that this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic film as far as I know A.A.A is not a replica of a Hollywood movie (THANKS TO GOD). In general, I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindi / Urdu and loves good comedy. <br /> <br /> Look, you'll love it !!!!!
