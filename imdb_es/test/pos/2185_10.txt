George Hearn really did everything he could and on top, which in this case was great. I've listened to Len Cariou's version but he was too docile. George was great in that character, very expressive. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury was perfect for the role. She gave a great performance. He gave Mrs. Lovett a great twisted and comical personality that balanced the dark story. <br /> <br /> I love dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs, her physical expressions and George's angry emotions. I listened to his songs of rage, revenge and anguish. <br /> <br /> I have seen this work 20 times since 1985, when I saw it on PBS. I bought it on video (after copying it in 1985 on my own) when it came out in 1990 and I definitely bought a copy of the DVD when it came out in 2004.
