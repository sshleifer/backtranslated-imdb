* MINOR SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Need more proof that Tsai Ming-liang is among the most original and provocative filmmakers working today? See this movie <br /> <br /> From slight variations of a theme that develops in most of his work, THE HOLE represents a study of alienation and loneliness, in this case between a man and a woman who are up / down. - and how the varied structures (real or psychological) of modernity move people away from each other. Here, the woman (the neighbor below) tries to hold on while her apartment is flooded by a prodigious flight from above. A plumber tries to locate the source of the problem, then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor. They are already isolated and desperate (both characters are among the few residents of a housing project who have not fled before a mysterious almost apocalyptic epidemic). The hole that joins the two apartments works first as another in a long line of indignities, but soon begins to acquire a meaning of almost mythical proportions. <br /> <br /> Tsai's sense of humor and the sense of film history are shown a little more frankly than usual, as the woman's occasional dreams revolve around her neighbor on the floor of Above they are visualized as musical numbers (set in Grace Chang's music) that explode from the screen in brief fragments of sensuality, surreal romance and humor. Pretty reminiscent of the big screen pennies of heaven. And despite all the boredom and alienation that is shown here, Tsai's bias of the pre-tense tensions of the late 90s is fun, absurd and gives this movie a very attractive attitude. The final scene is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tsai, typically, subverts most of the usual expectations or preconceptions that Westerners bring to Asian cinema with a frankness and candor revealed by chance, focusing on the absurd tendencies of The Mind human, and the most absolute of worldliness. There is a total and unconcerned demystification of almost everything about its characters, eluding the background story or most of the cultural signifiers (which amplifies the isolation of the characters), making THE HOLE and its other films quite misleading, but also fascinating and insightful.
