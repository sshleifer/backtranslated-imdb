Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray into science fiction, a genre he will return to fourteen years later with "The fifth element" (1997). Even if this movie was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still very nice. In 1983, "le Dernier Combat" reveals Besson's own approach to science fiction. He takes up a threadbare theme and his efforts are perceptible to do an elegant job. Filmed on a wide screen and in black and white, a disaster has destroyed almost the entire population of the Earth and we will never know what this disaster was and why men can no longer speak. Some barbarian hordes were formed. In parallel, a man (Pierre Jolivet) lives alone and arrives at an unrecognizable Paris where he receives a doctor (Jean Bouise). <br /> <br /> There are no words in Besson's work. The actions of the characters and the progression of events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are disconcerting, the film never looks like a dejected person. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to humanity before the disaster. The movie begins with the man who has sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him talk through a machine and is a painter in his spare time. It is all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, it could be argued that the bearded giant (Jean Reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by man and doctor to recover what a human being eventually did. The same goes for the band of bad guys at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> The pessimistic breath that such a film could convey is not really at the forefront and gives way to a ray of hope. Personally, the movie could have won without music, except the one that the man can listen to with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was going to make better and even fascinating films like this, he also promoted the career of Pierre Jolivet as director who will leave an irregular work behind him in the future: "Force Majeure" (1989), "Simple Mortel" (1991), "ma Petite Entreprise" (1999) or "Filles Uniques" (2003).
