Alex North (John Cassavetes) has problems in his relationship with his father and flees home to join the army, from where he will desert very soon and will come to New York with the intention of starting a new life, taking advantage of the fact that nobody know about your past. Find a job at Waterfront, where he meets Tommy Tyler (Sydney Poitier), a cheerful young man, who is happily married and is a living contrast to the sad and unhappy character of Cassavetes. They quickly become good friends and Tommy goes out of his way to help his friend. The only problem is that his superior at work, a hard worker Charles Malik (Jack Warden) feels a kind of envy of their friendship, as well as the happy and constant disposition of Tommy in his personal life. He really manages to make his life difficult when he comes to know the truth about Alex's past. <br /> <br /> A good drama skilfully directed by the director and producer Martin Ritt (The Hud), nominated for an Academy Award, and with wonderful performances by Sydney Poitier and Jack Warden. 7/10
