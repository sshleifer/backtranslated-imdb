Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, Addams Family Values) wrote this frothy tale of a moderate-mannered school teacher (Kevin Kline) who was exalted at the Academy Awards by an alumnus-turned-actor (Matt Dillon). The rest of the film is about the absurdities that revolve around this configuration - the effect on the city, his fianc√©e (Joan Cusack), himself - and ends with an end of everyone loves everyone. <br /> <br /> If you are an angry rights activist for homosexuals or a naive young man looking for an accurate picture of a man's struggle to leave or a "true" representation of gay life; then, save yourself the problem and rent something else (maybe Hermosa) or read a book (Giovanni's room). If you can understand that this film was inspired by the piety of Tom Hanks' speech at the Academy Awards when he won for Philadelphia and mocks the Hollywood culture and the ignorance of small towns, and you like the comedy of 30's (Bringing Up Baby, Holiday, The Palm Beach Story) then enjoy it! Far from being a scathing satire, the film tries the exuberance of a farce by Preston Sturges and gets very close. No, it is not "deep" or "powerful", nor Romy and Michelle, from 9 to 5, or Young Frankenstein, and it does not pretend to be; He keeps his tongue firmly on his cheek. He becomes too preacher and sensible for his own sake towards the end and sure that some of the jokes are a bit past (there is also a wardrobe scene that could have been cut), but after sitting through innumerable comedies that fail, It's like a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck are wonderful games, while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley add good support. The excellent award-winning performance of Joan Cusack is stellar and the great Bob Newhart is, well, Bob Newhart. <br /> <br /> The fact that many have been offended by In & Out is as absurd as the mentality of the people of the town that he mocks; Personally, I was more offended by Philadelphia. I will take harmless fuzz about holiness at any time.
