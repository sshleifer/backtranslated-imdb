Oz is established in the Oswald State Correctional Facility. Tell the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hatred and survival at all costs. In a place like Oz, you have to have eyes in the back of your head. <br /> <br /> This completely original, intelligent and compelling drama tells how twisted life becomes as soon as you enter the gates of Emerald. City. <br /> <br /> What is supposed to be a state-of-the-art correctional facility is, in fact, far from being such. The program brings to light some of the many failures in the prison system, the underestimation of humanity that hard, cold killers are capable of retaining, and the only true fact: prisoners are those who control prison. <br /> <br /> This magnificent and somewhat surreal spectacle teaches about the importance of each life and helps to understand the reasons why most of the prisoners are there. This show may seem shocking at first, but to really say it as it is, such a thing is necessary. <br /> <br /> Oz is a great representation of hell on earth and how such a place teaches you some of the most important lessons you will learn.
