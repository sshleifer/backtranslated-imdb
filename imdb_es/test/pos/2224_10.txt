This is one of the best films of Peter Sellers. Why is it never shown on television or in movie theaters? Will it ever be released as a home movie? Is it too derogatory for the medical field? I would love to see this movie again. I would like my son, who is a doctor, to see it. Laughter is the best medicine and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for this.
