I must admit that, when I started watching this movie, I had no idea what was going on. So the beginning was a bit confusing for me. However, that did not diminish my enjoyment of the movie. The characters reveal themselves more complex than they appear, and that is what makes this a memorable film. At first I heard that this was a true "Hollywood" movie. While obviously lacking the stereotyped element of "guns and fists," compelling interpretations of talented actors such as Martin Sheen and Sam Neill make up for it. I prefer to watch a movie with more substance than to shoot any day.
