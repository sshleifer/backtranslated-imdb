The Falcon and the Snowman is the true story of two rich college-aged children of L.A. who become spies of the Soviet Union. One, played by Penn, is already a drug dealer up to the eyeballs in trouble. The other, played by Hutton, gets a position in an aerospace company where his job is to deal with a top secret cable installation. There he finds out some of the dirty tricks used by the CIA on foreigners that the United States does not like. Do not forget that the film is set in the early 70's, the time of Vietnam and Watergate. Frightened by what he has learned, the Hutton character decides to betray his country and convinces his friend to join him. Neither of them has a lot of brains, it does not take long before they enter over their dead ends. <br /> <br /> This is not a thriller, and it's quite slow. If this is not a problem for you, then it is worth renting it.
