In one way or another, you can not get away from the basic message. The strong survive. Those who are psychically or emotionally sensitive, leave. They leave a hole in the lives of those who love them. A hole that is seen in its purpose as selfish. That's what Phoebe realizes in the end. Just before helping Wolf heal from his self-blame. She can accept the closure of the disappeared ... of her sister. Beautiful european landscape. Much truth about idealism and addiction to the next great moment. For a moment, I thought about the Baader-Meinhoff gang that was in the early 70's. I liked this movie, since it reflected the moment when I was of legal age.
