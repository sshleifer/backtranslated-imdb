Tromeo and Julieta are perhaps the best modernization of Shakespeare that I have seen, not that there is much competition, but anyway ... <br /> <br /> In general, Tromeo and Julieta are definitely one of the best films of Troma, one of The pearls hidden in an imposing pile of manure. It's a funny bloody version, full of action, of the best love story in the world, but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as possible from this kind of movie. Well, except for the end, where Tromeo and Juliet kill Juliet's abusive father and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their horribly mutated children. <br /> <br /> THIS is the highest movie School literature classes should show instead of having poor students read hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare's scripts. Thumbs up!
