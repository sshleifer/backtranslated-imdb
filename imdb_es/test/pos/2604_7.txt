After "The attack of the fifty-foot woman" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other films to pick up and carry the torch and what a charming actress Dorothy Provine from "It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" to play the role. The size is that the cute and blonde Provine may be too sweet and innocent to get into the size 50 shoes of Allison Hayes. This role really needed someone with a quantity of hot sexual attractiveness; Provine is more the type of girl next door. She may have taken and done this role to show that she can be sexy, but the material disappoints her. Lou Costello, however, proves that he can make a film without Bud Abbott offering him lines and even plays a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he does not address Gale Gordon as his gag boss. Gordon, however, states that everything that can be is windy, disturbed and aggressive, almost the same character that creates later in "The Lucy Show". Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does: a heterosexual man, and his screen time is limited. The special effects are convincing at the moment, but I would have liked that Dorothy would have been a little bit more than cheesecake and dressing and, at least, would have been allowed to be dangerous. As the main character of the film, she takes the second billing to Costello, who is in the whole movie with Dorothy several times disappearing as a secondary plot. The whole movie can not decide if it's supposed to be science fiction, a comedy or just a parody of Allison Hayes' classic. There are many good scenes, a very funny humor and a very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the movie. Still, I like this movie for its empowerment of women; There are not enough movies like this. If this movie had a chance to be remade today, I would strongly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely rewrite the original script. Courtney tops my lists of actresses that I think could and should play the magnificent giantess; Although, I have to admit that if any of the titanic beauties Allison or Dorothy came looking for me, I would leave quietly!
