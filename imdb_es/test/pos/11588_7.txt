THE SEA INSIDE a film by Alejandro Amenábar. <br /> <br /> Almodóvar has always been alone in the flag of Spanish cinema for years. Out of nowhere, Amenabar reinvented the genres and injected some blood into the Spanish industry that otherwise did not work. Now, in a big bet, change from psychological terror to social drama, well, the big ones would be, are the audiences ready to embrace the swing and, more importantly, can they hold the flag? This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor who in his twenties was paralyzed by neck in an accident at sea and his fight with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has the traces of an afternoon made for a television melodrama and the only way this will work is through honest words and performances, and both are presented in spades. Mateo Gil and Amenabar co-write in a way that the public should not be blind at the end of death, but they are encouraged to make their own decisions in the process and that's a brilliant blow, this is not a professional movie . Death, but a movie in favor of the latest illusions of our time LIBERTY. There are a few laughs long, like when the church comes home in a wheelchair to deconstruct Sampedro's beliefs, but it's mostly a valley of tears, blows from all fronts, even when you think you're safe, his father, who up to that point, does not make any sense, comes with the most moving line of the whole movie. It is a heartbreaking experience, especially when Sampedro seems to be more alive than most people who roam the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life, even those who are helping him to die. But when you take away a man's dreams? The film is built almost exclusively in close-ups, which generates a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic to Sampedro. That is for the actors a great challenge that must build their complete performances with their eyes and eyes do not lie. Bardem was not granted his second Oscar nomination, probably in favor of Eastwood, but in my opinion, he was the only one who could have followed Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in KILLING A MOCKINGBIRD where the acting It seemed easy and I think that Bardem has reached that state in which the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blurred. I was never fond of his initial work, but since Almodovar's LIVE FLESH is on a roll, LOS MONDOS AL SOL, THE UPS DE BAILE and the Oscar nominee BEFORE THE NIGHT OF THE NIGHT made him an international star and although he and Banderas come from the same Almodovar. The background is fascinating to see the different paths they took and how Bardem has become a real reference for Spanish cinema around the world. A golden globe, 14 Goyas, a jury prize in Venice and probably an Oscar with the permission of THE CHORUS BOYS, Amenabar directs, co-writes, edits and puts music in a high-caliber drama, has he achieved it? What's up with something science fiction now? Whose life is it anyway? ****
