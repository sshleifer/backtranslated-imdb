I saw this movie recently and I fell in love with it. I loved the story and the actors. It has a little bit of everything. I was completely surprised by the development of the story. It has so many surprises along the way. I highly recommend it. In fact, I loved it so much that I ran out and bought the book. I felt I had to read it to appreciate the art in the writing behind the film. I also wanted to make sure that I did not miss anything that was in the book but that I stayed out of the movie. I recommend people who love the film to read the book because there is enough difference in the book, especially in the second episode, to want to read it. It has become my favorite movie. Now I'm a fan of Sarah Waters and Elaine Cassidy !!
