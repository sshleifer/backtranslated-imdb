This movie was incredibly good! It was hilarious! There are so many jokes that you can watch the movie over and over again and not get tired of it. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were great as Pete Hogwallop and Delmar! I love those guys! I love the adventures that followed, too. I definitely recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Also, the music in this movie is excellent! I love singing along with all the songs!
