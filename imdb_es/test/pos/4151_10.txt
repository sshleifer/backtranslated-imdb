This movie was played in Lexington KY for 7 days. I saw it on the last day of its execution and I regretted not being able to recommend it to others because this is a movie that cries out for the experience of the big screen. The aerial shot where the overcrowded ship moves away from the equally crowded dock is a masterpiece, as is the scene in which the two main characters flirt on the deck: almost a ballet and more attractive in its suggestion than many other explicit films in these days. I just shudder to think that more people will not have the opportunity to see this good movie in a theater; The DVD experience will not be the same. Here's an idea: if you live in a university city, see if you can press to appear at a campus film festival.
