I grew up in Baltimore, so I was exposed to the John Waters films, since I was too young to see them. And if you know that John Waters is limited to Hairspray or Cry-Baby or other family movies, then you must prepare for the Pink Flamingos. <br /> <br /> Explicit sexual acts, incest, an old woman who eats nothing but eggs, and unhealthy acts with chickens are only part of the depravity in this film. The film ends with Divine, Waters of 300 pounds. Dressing of star droppings. <br /> <br /> The premise is about two families: one, a couple of pure trailer crap, which includes Divine and Edith Massey as the egg lady; And the other is a rich, swinging couple. Both families are competing for the title of "The dirtiest living person." Enjoy the best John Waters movie, but only see it if you are an open-minded person with a strong stomach, because some scenes from this movie will haunt you.
