This is a typical Sandra Bullock movie in which she plays a mousy (but profane) woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> There are many holes in this story. Things just do not add up and part of the suspense is a bit corny. But - that suspense is very good. There is a lot of tension in this story that has a strong paranoia that runs through it. The story begins slowly but begins very soon and remains so, which makes it a movie for the viewer. That's why I give it a good grade: the film involves you. Bullock is prettier than annoying, which is usually for me, so this is my highest rated movie with her in it.
