I liked this, probably a little more than Terror by Night, although not enough to give him the extra *. The beginning is simply brilliant, when we observe the Nazi agents trying to get an image of a new bomb and its inventor in a small Swiss town, only to be frustrated by a disguised Holmes who takes the scientist to London. Once there, he does everything possible to prevent the scientist from falling into the hands of the man behind everything, not Hitler, but, worse still, the archenemy Moriarty of Holmes. Of course, the scientist disappears, leaving a coded and seductive note, and Holmes continues to persecute him, once again disguised. A climax in the lair of the Moriarty pier is suitably exciting, and we can all guess that everything ends well, right? Patriotic message a bit exaggerated as credits accumulate. Now that I think about it, the good sense of the place despite the obvious sets, the use of Rathbone's costume and the way the plot gets so complicated in just over an hour, what the hell does that extra get * and it's my favorite of the 5 Rathbone / Bruce movies that I've seen to date. <br /> <br /> Seen on DVD, part of the set of "50 Mystery Classics" by Mill Creek Entertainment. Many of the transfers in these sets of cheap boxes are of very poor quality, but Holmes fans take note that the Rathbone / Bruce movies (there are 4 in this set) are all quite visible and reasonable.
