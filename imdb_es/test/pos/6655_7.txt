I entered this movie thinking that I would not like it, but hoping to surprise me, but this, like the movie, ended up being grim and desperate. But do not get me wrong, Minghella offers everything that is a great epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes like that, then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the best movies of the year in your opinion. The performance is of high quality and most likely comes out with a lot of prizes for Law, Kidman and Zellweger, although Portman's few scenes are the most powerful in the film. The places are beautiful and Minghella has a good eye for a good shot. <br /> <br /> However, for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going voluntarily, they can be disappointed mainly because of Minghella. and its adaptation. The film is so grim that what I consider a punch bag epic is a film that tries to hit hard with emotion, but it does it to an extreme and so often that during the film I did not have the opportunity. the time to invest emotionally, or had not recovered from a previous blow, and became unrealistic and, therefore, too difficult to really care for, not to say predictable. In general, the "Cold Mountain" almost left me too exhausted to even think about the positive aspects of the film, since all I remember is death, which may have been an original motif, but ends up being the focus instead Of the characters.
