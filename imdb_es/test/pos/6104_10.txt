The main point of the film, IMO, is the fact that Joanna's whole life has been no more than a series of facades. The movie begins with her secretly dying her gray roots, and hiding the used kit in an empty tissue box. What is strange is that she is hiding this from her HUSBAND. If you have to hide mundane things from your loved one, you can bet that you are hiding even bigger things from other people involved in your life. <br /> <br /> When Joanna accidentally hits Cory, she leaves the scene to call the police. When she returns, the police and the ambulance are there, as are the people in her community, commenting: "What kind of person hits a child and then just leaves her there?" Well respected in her community, she makes the decision to remain silent about what she had done. But, he never realized how difficult it would be to maintain his facades ... <br /> <br /> Great movie, I've seen it many times!
