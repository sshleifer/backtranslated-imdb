Next, a brief review without spoilers. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival. My initial reaction is amazement and happiness. I am very happy that films like this one are being made in our era of blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Roy Andersson's new film "You, The Living" is nothing short of a complete masterpiece. You, The Living is composed of about 50 vignettes recorded with a static camera. I will not reveal the content of the scenes here, because I hate when people spoil even the smallest details. But, yes, most of the scenes caused the 1000 people in the Claude Debussy theater to be absolutely disconcerted and surprised. When the movie ended, we applauded for several minutes, we had no other choice. <br /> <br /> So, what is the result with "You, The Living"? Hm, Andersson is not afraid to take on the heavy questions; History, guilt, gand The Holocaust during World War II are big issues (and these issues work very well together). <br /> <br /> The images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes exceeds the "Songs of the second floor". <br /> <br /> Well, sorry for this review, praising review. Beware of the Flying House in the beginning people! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars: a masterpiece (I never throw this note).
