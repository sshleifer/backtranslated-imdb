To answer the question of a previous critic who asked for the name of the official of the United States mentioned in "Lumumba", the name of the character is "Mr. Carlucci". It is reported that Frank Carlucci had been at that time Second Secretary of the Embassy of the United States in the Congo. Subsequently, among other tasks, he was appointed Ambassador of the United States in Portugal, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Secretary of Defense, and is now the President of the Carlyle Group. It is not surprising that Carlucci's biographical sketch on his website www.carlylegroup.com does not credit his service in the Belgian Congo. If his name was deliberately censored by the HBO version of "Lumumba," it could have been to avoid the possibility of HBO being sued in US courts. UU However, Carlucci's name is clearly mentioned in the theatrical version of "Lumumba" that I saw recently. In the event, I hope he denies any involvement in Lumumba's murder. <br /> <br /> Others have commented on the impartiality with which the film "Lumumba" deals with the parties involved: supporters of Lumumba, other Congolese, including Belgians. I think a slightly more sinister vision of the BBC documentary emerges entitled "Who Killed Lumumba?", Based on the book "The Murder of Lumumba", by the Belgian historian Ludo de Witte. When examined closely, these films show that the fate of Lumumba and the history of the Congo is not just a matter of black and white. Only the murderers of Lumumba believe it.
