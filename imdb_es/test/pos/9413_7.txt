The director of Maverick, Seijun Suzuki, was finally able to film the project of his dream, "Princess Raccoon" and, in a way, it's a good thing he did not try it in the sixties. Special effects and computer graphics made this type of production easier to achieve than the matte technology of the previous film. <br /> <br /> A little familiarity with Japanese history and theatrical traditions will help you enjoy this movie. In the same way that familiarity with Shakespeare's "The Tempest" would help with the dense "Books of the Prospero" by Peter Greenaway. These two films really do have a bit in common, although "Princess Raccoon" is much more colorful and easier to see so that someone without the background appreciates it completely. <br /> <br /> While artistic design, acting and directing are fine for most of the film, this viewer feels that the energy runs out in the last third of the movie. Most of the interesting sets have already been presented and the camera seems to take a step back to enjoy a theatrical cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> This is certainly a unique cinematic experience and I recommend it to anyone who is interested. in alternative ways of film performance. It is not really for children, although nothing happens that disgusts them. If the last third were better, I would have given him nine stars.
