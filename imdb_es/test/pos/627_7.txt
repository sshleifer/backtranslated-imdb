I have waited 9 years to see this movie, simply because I never saw it on television. I finally caught it and it was worth the wait. It's much better than your exaggerated scream or the trash of last summer because everything is at a fairly fast pace, without lengthening, crawling around the house to corny music scenes. Only the bad dubbing disappoints you a bit, but do not let that discourage you in any way. What lies below - about promoted and junk. Silent witness: low budget, without exaggerations and very good.
