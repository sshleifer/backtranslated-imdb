This movie was filled with a great performance, great musical sounds that make your mind completely lost. Larenz Tate, (Darius Lovehall), "Waist Deep", 06 was a sharp cat with the girls and soon met her Waterloo with Nia Long, (Nina Mosley), "Big Momma's House", 2000. Nina put her heart and your soul in this role and when you meet Darius, the sparks fly at the beginning and then there is a kind of hateful relationship. The whole cast of actors made this a very entertaining film, with a lot of comedy, drama and lots of love and cheating. This is a very realistic film and at the same time shows how everyone eventually has their destiny in life and they are located in their little corner of this great world. Great movie, enjoy!
