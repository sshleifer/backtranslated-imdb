The first time I saw this was in a house of friends. He ended up in the hands of his parents by accident; Some bike repair shop / video library! It went bankrupt and it's about things like that. We saw it twice in a row and almost wet it's the pants how hard we laugh. <br /> <br /> I've seen historical documents like Ninja Mission and Plan 9 from Outer Space, and they're still good runners up compared to this one. <br /> <br /> Almost 15 years after the first contact, it is now considered the best cult movie of all time (in my circles); I showed it to all my friends ... Now we have the tradition of looking for movies in the same category: the unsustainable. <br /> <br /> It can not be explained or revised in any way. in a normal way because each scene, each shot, each movement, contains at least one error with respect to editing, dialouge, direction, etc. <br /> <br /> For any cult movie fan, this is the ultimate prize, the jewel of all gems. . <br /> <br /> Raiting: As for the crafts, you can not qualify, because it would even be an insult to the homemade videos of birthdays and weddings. <br /> <br /> As for pure fun, it's the funniest movie I've seen in my life; More funny than any comedy done or passed. Anything less than 10/10 should be considered as an insult to the good sense of the buzz.
