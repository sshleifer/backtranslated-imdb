Sweeping and still impressive early Western Talkie from the pioneer days; other contemporary films in the same sense include THE WAGON COVER (1923), THE IRON HORSE (1924) and CIMARRON (1931)? none of which I have seen, although I have the last on VHS. It was filmed simultaneously in the full-screen "Standard" relationship and in an experimental widescreen process called "Grandeur," but only the first one was released on the Fox DVD of the brazen; You can only guess how it would look in a larger proportion, but careful framing. Not to mention the splendid cinematography. it is evident enough even in the "Standard" version. <br /> <br /> Young John Wayne is surprisingly in control (a role that, however, did not lead to the expected stardom, as he languished in the 'B' westerns for most of the next decade, before John Ford came to his rescue with STAGECOACH [1939]! anyway, he and Marguerite Churchill (from DRACULA'S HIUGER [1936]) make a good couple? Despite their somewhat tedious character, the secondary characters include a variety of types of actions: western veteran, comic assistant (with a penchant for making noises with his mouth!), corpulent and rude villain (played by Tyrone Power Sr.!), his two slug cohorts (one Mexican and one Southern, the latter is also becoming the rival of Wayne by the hand of Churchill), etc. Also among the members of the wagon is a shy Swedish (full of optimism for the promised land, but who is continually reprimanded by his irascible mother in the law) and more t regular Wayne Bond burns. <br /> <br /> The episodic narrative is solved in a series of alternately cornball, lyrical and action-packed vignettes? As we see the possible settlers that fight the elements, the Indians and themselves; However, the film has a completely authentic feel that softens its static and essentially antiquated quality. In addition, the edition is somewhat choppy (especially during the second half). No wonder, since the DVD edition of the movie is only 108 minutes long compared to the "Grandeur" version of 158 minutes.
