Or maybe not. Whatever you think of "Broadcast News," good or bad, almost all the merit of that "thought" belongs to writer, producer and director James L. Brooks. As a screenwriter (of which for a long time he has been one of the best), it is not easy to attack an entire business, in this case, the "business" is the television news, but doing it with a smile, a wink, a wise gesture and a laugh practically every step of the way. To do everything that requires real talent, something that Mr. J. Brooks has in abundance. <br /> <br /> A user of this website, in his summary, asked the musical question: "Did Walter Cronkite act in this way?" Answers: No! Of course, no! And the reason for that is Walter's day, Mr. Cronkite, the only thing that mattered was taking the news to the people. The same goes for John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Sure, they had to pay attention to their qualifications, if only to please their bosses. But all that REALLY concerned them was THE NEWS IN ITSELF. <br /> <br /> Now, of course, all that has changed. During the last 25 to 30 years in the network news business, the only things that have really mattered are the qualifications, grades and qualifications. The bottom line. How many dollars will our news division deliver to the network? You do not believe it? <br /> <br /> Consider "The Big Three": Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (also known as "Stanley Stunning"). The three have been working at their respective anchor desks for the past 15 to 20 years (in fact, Peter had his first opportunity at the national anchor desk in the 1960s, but he was not prepared for the job). Of the three, Dan is the one with the best training in the field as a reporter. Personally, I think all three do fabulous jobs as news anchors and deserve their positions. All of which has nothing to do with why the three are really IN those jobs. The three are now in their 60s (Dan is pushing the big 7-0) and the three are still very attractive. And if you think they still look good, now imagine how good they looked in their 40s, when the three of them were hired to (let's say, "put") their current jobs. But do you honestly believe that any of these three would have been "placed" if it had looked like, say, Fred Gwynne ("Herman Munster")? Or like - the sky for your defense - ME !!! Not only that, if Dan retired tomorrow, a young man (who today) Walter Cronkite could not recover his old job. Why? Not pretty enough. And it would not matter a bit that he is, or was once, "the most reliable man in America." <br /> <br /> And this is what "Broadcast News" is about. Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), the near future of pretty-boy-national-news-anchor-to-to who has problems with some minor things, like thinking for himself, being able to write and know things. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the brilliant news producer with business standards of news and ethics, all of which is thrown into the wind when even she falls in love with Tom, a beautiful child. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, no relation to James L.), a top-notch news writer and reporter who has no hope of a national job because he "sweats" behind the anchor desk. And many other defective characters that you KNOW really exist in the news divisions of the different networks. <br /> <br /> "Red" opened the way. Eleven years later, "Broadcast News" took the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next movie to attack the network business "news you can use" ... maybe? Or maybe not.
