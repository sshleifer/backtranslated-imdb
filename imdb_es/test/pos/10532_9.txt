"Children of Wax", which is also shown as "Killing Ground", is an interesting mix of genres. Some might think that the purity of the genre may be only for the good, but for me the eclectic symbiosis is very entertaining. There is also the mixture of thriller and popular action, as well as the combination of the historical masterpiece and the ethnic appeal for tolerance. This film is built with the star presence of my favorite actor, the perfect Armand Assante, but it is also marked by the performance of a shooting star. Hal Ozan. We've seen it recently in the HBO television series called "Sex." "Sons of wax" is an entertainment for the public, but at the same time it has an eternal morality for ethnic tolerance. This is a wise way to seminar wellness. The discussion about the contemporary problems of our days can be done with attractive media in this very positive aspect of the movie "Children of the wax".
