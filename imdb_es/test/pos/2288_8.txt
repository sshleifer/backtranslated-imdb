This has always been one of my favorite movies. I had a copy of VHS, and a couple of months ago I found a DVD release that is also part of my video collection. It also turns out that I'm a big fan of baseball, and as part of my reading off-season, I got a copy of Robert Whiting's excellent book "You Gotta Have WA," which describes the ins and outs of Japanese baseball and the challenges. That foreign players have found themselves playing in Japan. When I started reading yesterday, it made me think about this movie, because it seems that the script was almost literally based on this book. The parallels are strange. The character of Jack Elliot is very similar to Bob Horner, an old MLB player whose best days were behind him. Horner's partner, Leon Lee, is also represented in the character Max "Hammer" Dubois, a veteran of the Japanese league who has made peace with the frustrations of the Japanese game, and helps keep his partner healthy. The character of Elliot goes through the same sequence of encounters as Horner, from the great fanfare brand, the early success that feeds sports media and voracious, and the resulting depression that generates frustration, estrangement from their peers, fans and media, and the resulting disillusion that causes A desire to return home to the United States. The only difference is that the film adds touches of Hollywood as a love interest and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Speaking of love interests, I'm sure many viewers have come to this site (as I did) to find the actress who played "Hiroko" (the beautiful Aya Takanashi), and what other jobs she has done. Just list this movie. It turns out, based on an article I read, that the brief love scene he has with Tom Selleck (a foreigner) in this movie (moderated by our standards, they basically kiss while he's in the bathroom and she's wearing a towel) caused such a an indignation on the part of the Japanese public (in particular men) that he has never been offered another role of any kind, in films or television, essentially denied by the Japanese film industry. It's a real shame, since she is (was) a very talented actress in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie because of the baseball elements as well as the cultural differences that I have, go find a copy of "You Gotta Have WA" by Robert Whiting. A good read and a great accompanying book for this movie.
