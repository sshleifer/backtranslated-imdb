This movie felt so real. In fact, I felt all the emotions represented here during my life on several occasions, both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene Muscular Dystrophy as Rory, so what you see here is exactly what I felt. Some do not believe that there are disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I am one of them. <br /> <br /> The story is great. For a drama, a movie directed by the character, the story moves fast. I never got bored, maybe partly because I was seeing things that are close to my heart. But I think that most people, with intelligence, will be glued to the screen and will care about the characters. The acting is phenomenal! James McAvoy is perfect as Rory O'Shea, who has Duchene muscular dystrophy. Steven Robertson deserves a prize for his performance as Michael Connolly, who suffers from cerebral palsy. <br /> <br /> Michael's love is not returned by a girl and Rory helps him come to an agreement. I have felt it many times and the question is "do not you love me because I'm not the one chosen or because my disability has turned it off?" No matter what the girl says, we will always be skeptical about the truth. It is natural and hurts in any way. <br /> <br /> Some parts made me cry a little because it's sad and I have to face the problems myself. People without a terminal disability simply can not begin to understand how it can feel. This is a movie that must be seen for everyone. People with disabilities are everywhere and very poorly understood. This film brings a little light on some of the facts of life, which are taken for granted by the healthy. We want to be like you: live on our own terms, go out, get drunk, be loved. Outside, we can not do much, but inside, we're dancing!
