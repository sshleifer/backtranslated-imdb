This was a great movie from 1981 that told a great story about three men and two girls who go together on a camping trip and go through thick forests and high mountains with a large waterfall. This group of people runs into property owned by George Kennedy, (Roy McLean) who plays the role of ranger and rides a white horse. Roy McLean warns these young people that where they are going there is no space to camp and they must return. Of course, these young people do not pay attention and go on to have a ball swimming naked near the water and playing excellent music, dancing by the fire and drinking lots of beer and wine. There is an old wooden house of a single school that attracts girls and boys inside and it is from that moment that the movie starts to be very scary. There is a time when a girl has to climb a tree to get away from a human beast that desires her body and begins to cut the tree to capture it. Do not miss this movie, there is a lot of everything.
