I recently saw this movie with the hope of seeing a precise picture of the bloodiest battle of the 20th century. I got what I expected and much more. Just to think that I came across this movie luckily, before I had ever heard of it. It's a German movie made in 1993, so I guess it does not surprise me that it's almost completely unknown to the modern American audience. It's a shame because it really is an extraordinary movie, I daresay it's as good or no better than Platoon, Full metal jacket, Apocalypse now, and All quiet on the western front; All of them are iconic war movies. <br /> <br /> 1942: World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany has surpassed continental Europe and parts of North Africa, then Adolf Hitler orders the large-scale invasion of the Soviet Union. A fateful movement that finally condemns Nazi Germany to defeat. In the early stages, the invasion goes well and the German armies conquer large sections of Soviet territory, but a critical battle takes place in Stalingrad, a city that has great symbolic and strategic value. The battle soon turns into a bloodbath of epic proportions, a nightmare for the German and Russian soldiers who fight. About to take the city, the Russians suddenly attack the Germans and end up cutting off the entire 6th German Army in Stalingrad. To make matters worse, the Russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the Germans. All this battle is seen through the eyes of some young German soldiers who struggle to survive not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions but also against their own sadistic officers who care only about the medals and the glory and generals who they have little regard for the average infantryman. <br /> <br /> This movie will chase me for a while. The German soldiers in whom the film is concentrated are so young and naive, that they are stripped of their humanity and sanity and really feel sorry for them because they are not the demons that the Nazis often portray in the film. Everything they were fighting for is no longer important, and everything they believed was broken, and after fighting a gruesome battle against the Russians inside Stalingrad, we see that they deteriorate further with the start of Winter and many of them Freeze to death The scenes of Battle & Winter were like a horrible nightmare, but they also felt so real. It's amazing, at first we see young men tied at the best moment of their lives, and in the end they are a shell of their old self stripped of everything. After witnessing so much carnage, these men simply lost their will to live, it was really sad. When there is finally a moment of hope, they are betrayed by Hitler, who finally abandons these men to a horrible death, which is just one more of Hitler's crimes that abandon the men who fought to be killed by the Russians. <br /> <br /> A good anti-war film describes the horrors of war and that's what this movie does. The battle for the tractor factory sequence is the closest thing to hell on earth, but that's really what the battle for Stalingrad was about. The German and Russian soldiers were represented with humanity, only rotten apples (specifically on the German side) condemned the men. The conclusion is that this movie is amazing because we see how men break down physically and emotionally during the war. We all have our limits and these men were pushed beyond their limits into the deadliest battle of our time. What the average infantryman endured in Stalingrad was beyond imagination. Even if they had survived everything they had seen and done, they would have marked them for life. <br /> <br /> Stalingrad shows us why War is Hell and what exactly hell is like.
