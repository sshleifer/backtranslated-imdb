When it opened, "Heaven's Gate" had become, to its detriment, more of a cultural phenomenon than a movie. At a time when concern over excessive budgets and directors' arrogance was growing, it was a convenient goal, since it was a much more budget-ridden job than the last "author" who hit Hollywood, who had not yet established the history that I would. They have given the benefit of the doubt among critics and industry alike. As someone pointed out at the time, no one was going to jump on the "reds", even more expensive and dark Warren Beatty because Beatty was "one of us", while Michael Cimino had not reached that status. <br /> <br /> But "Heaven's Gate" was also affected by a cultural change that took place at that time, the political movement to the right and to a more unquestionable patriotism and the consecration of the myth of the West (and of West). A few years earlier, the demystification of the border by Cimino could have seemed timely, fresh and a necessary correction. But in 1980, in the aftermath of the Reagan Revolution, it was thought to be almost anti-American. <br /> <br /> What is a shame, because the film, seen from the point of view of several decades, is a fascinating and stimulating look at that particular moment and place like a world where life was, in Hobbes' words, "unpleasant, brutal and brief". Kristofferson plays James Averill, a high-class oriental who, in search of adventure, becomes a sheriff in Wyoming, where he is forced to lead a resistance of settlers and squatters against an attack by a contracted mercenary death squad. by wealthy landowners. , including Averill's life-long best friend. In a more innocent moment, Averill and his "army" of poor peasants would triumph; but this is not a traditional western, and when the United States Cavalry joins the fight here, it is not on the side of the "good guys". <br /> <br /> Like "El cazador de ciervos", by Cimino. The previous film, "Heaven's Gate", spends a lot of time building the details of the lives of its directors, which gives the film a sometimes paused rhythm that, however, leads to an exciting conclusion. With an excellent performance, an excellent musical score and the visual texture that makes us believe that one is really seeing the "Old West" with new eyes, "Heaven's Gate" is a film that rewards repetitions. I just want MGM to publish a new DVD, with an improved transfer and a comment from Cimino. However, the current version is satisfactory enough for viewers to see what the critics in 1980, possibly blinded by the cultural subtexts of the film, managed to ignore ... that "Heaven's Gate" is a great movie.
