HBO created this program with the purpose of making us see the most realistic view of the prison and they did a great job. Oz was created by the creators of Homicide who wanted to show a rough version of the prison. This program is what launched the idea of ​​all the other original HBO programs, such as Sopranos, Sex and the City, The Wire, Arliss, Deadwood and Six Feet Under, among others. Oz is the nickname of Oswald State Penitentiary, a fictitious prison in some US state. UU It is never mentioned (although with accents, crime scenes and racial distribution it is assumed NY). The main prison unit analyzed in the program is Emerald City, a seemingly ideal prison unit with more privileges than others thought by a liberal unit manager named Tim McManus. In general, this program shows us what it really is like if you want to survive in prison. <br /> <br /> There are around 10 gangs in Oz. First we have the Muslims, a group of black people who want to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve the living conditions of black people everywhere. They are led by Kareem Said, a black militant minister who wants to destroy everything racist about the judicial system. As a group, they are not so much anti-targets but rather anti-injustices. Our second group of blacks are the Homeboys who are essentially blacks on the street who want to keep all the bad behavior in the ghetto and direct the drug trade. Their leadership varies mainly because they are always losing members due to violence. In this group, a character who acts in a terrible way is Simon Adebisi. Adebisi is an African prisoner who is essentially the most frighteningly evil character in the world. This gang in general receives side help from the Irish sometimes and is always in conflict with Latinos and Sicilians for drug distribution purposes. Since Oz is mostly black, Homeboys have the most soldiers of any gang in the interior. <br /> <br /> Latinos and Sicilians, like the Homeboys, have variable leadership due to the violent deaths that occur during the show. The Sicilians have the most important opinion of how any illegal activity in Oz is carried out. Latinos make their presence known so that at least they can walk well if they do not have control. However, unlike the Homeboys, these gangs do not have much internal battle for power and are generally more stable when it comes to drug use. The Irishmen mentioned above are a smaller gang led by a manipulator and snakelike Ryan O'Reily. O'Reily always manages to maintain good relations with all the powers of drugs and manages to manipulate things his way whenever he wants. They have no illegal control, but at least they are on good terms with everyone they are. <br /> <br /> Among the whiter inmates, we have the Bikers and the Aryans. Bikers are simply a group of tattooed drug users who help Aryans most of the time. The Aryans are the most hated and hateful band for most of Oz's viewers. They are directed by Vern Schillinger, one of the most racist, sickest and sadistic characters you will ever see. Both gangs do not control anything illegal, they simply let darker-skinned inmates see that they are a substantial threat to anyone who thinks that all white interns are soft. We also have the Others. The Others is a band of outside prisoners that are not necessarily a problem for any other prisoner. In this group we see Tobias Beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a young woman whose life is forever altered by prison. We also see Augustus Hill, a black man tied to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who narrates the show and presents the audience to all inmates. The crimes of the character are shown as they are presented and Augustus lets us know how long they will be in prison. Finally between gangs, there are Christians and gays. Christians simply stay religious to avoid mentality and gays are a group of transvestites who are often raped by other inmates. <br /> <br /> This program delves into many topics related to the Criminal Justice System and is more explicit than any prison film. As the language has not been edited, here we have more racial epithets and bad words than in any other television program. Augustus Hill's commentary gives us a good way to truly understand each and every one of the topics related to Oz. This show, as good as it is, is not at all for the light heart to medium. It explicitly shows the use and distribution of drugs by any possible means, rape in prison, murder, fatal stabbings and general blood than anything else I have seen. In my opinion, it is the most influential and biggest show that has been created, but at the same time I can see why other people are bothered by this show. If you are interested in the shows and movies about the prison, Oz is a must.
