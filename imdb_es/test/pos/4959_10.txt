Well, here's the deal. There is an American pilot who is flying, thinking of his own affairs, when he is suddenly outnumbered by evil fighter planes and non-American cowards (they are from the Middle East, but they are enough to say that they do not like apple pie or Elvis Presley). that come to knock him down. Now, this American pilot was not doing anything wrong, but those evil non-Americans did not care and before you know it, they beat him in a foreign jail and sentenced him to death! <br /> <br /> Now, what normally happens here is that the US Army. UU bombed a couple of nearby cities until the pilot was released, but not this time. Those types of love of evil were probably involved and managed to stop any kind of reprisal massacre. As you can imagine, this does not please the pilot's family and the evil foreign dictator has this satisfied and satisfied look on him. It will make those Americans pay, oh, yes! <br /> <br /> But he did not estimate Doug Masters, the 16-year-old capture driver, son. You will see that Doug has been able to fly a plane more than a car can drive (which can not be that long) and decides to fly to that evil, foreign country and get his dad back. Then, with the help of his friends, Doug and his wingman, retired pilot Chappy 'Sinclair, Doug launches a two-man airstrike on foreigners. <br /> <br /> Now you would think that this plan would be destined to fail, but I would be wrong. Of course, those guys from the Middle East could be all veteran pilots, but Doug has an ace up his sleeve, he listens to rock music when he flies! After knocking down a dozen enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery, Doug lands at an airport and puts his wounded father aboard the plane. Understandably, the villain, who is no longer so cocky, the dictator gets very angry with these pranks and throws himself into the heavens himself, in an attempt to knock Doug down. But the young man listens to some more rock music and takes the villain from heaven. HURRAY! <br /> <br /> After Doug and Chappy downed 90% of their air force, the aliens sent their last planes in a rather poor attempt to knock Doug down, but just in time, a flight of the F16 from USA UU it appears and scares them. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. It was the first video cassette film I brought, and until I was twenty, I expected my father to be shot down in a foreign country in order to rescue him. But he does not like to fly, so it did not happen.
