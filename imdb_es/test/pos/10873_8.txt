Debbie Vickers (Nell Schofield) and Sue Knight (Jad Capelja) want to become one of the best girls in their high school. Uncool and the ugly girls had two options, being a mole or a chubby! Debbie and Sue imitate them using their cheating practices in an exam. Two of the cool guys, Garry (Goeff Rhoe) and Danny (Tony Hughes) ask for their answers and all are arrested. After a shout from the director (Bud Tingwell), the cool girls met them outside on the playground and confronted them to see if they "doubled" in all of them. As Debbie and Sue did not have the cool girls they invited them to the "dolls" to smoke. Then they begin to hang out with them on the weekends on the beach, watching all the boys surf. Sue ends up dating Danny and Debbie with Garry. It takes place a lot of usual actions of teenagers, including sex, drugs and rock and roll. Garry has an overdose of heroin that makes Debbie face the inequalities of life and she decides to learn to surf instead of just looking at children. They are not happy, but they watch her, name her and, finally, Debbie dominates the meeting. A great Australian movie from the early 80's.
