I have read reviews of this film that I found "disappointing" and "confusing". I can not understand why this should be like this. From the beginning I thought it was an extraordinary experience and a complete joy to see. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The initial titles overlap a beautiful picture of the evolutionary process, and this presents the story with a serene and broad style. However, the film is not about the process itself, it refers to the struggle of Charles Darwin with his conscience, his love for his wife, his deceased daughter and his search for the truth. <br /> <br /> The appearances of your daughter are the most important. Manifestations of a tormented mind that knows that it has "killed God". The daughter is an adult, she makes comments from adults about her work and tortures Darwin with personal doubts. Was he in any way responsible for his death? The husband and wife in real life, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly give truly wonderful presentations as Charles and Emma Darwin, as does Martha West as Annie. The size and uncomfortable gait of Bettany give Darwin's character a genuine sense of reality, while Connelly seems very comfortable with her English accent and, on occasion, with a somewhat harsh personality. <br /> <br /> It's easy to misinterpret the times in which this movie resides. The control religion had over society and the internal struggles that a man like Darwin had to endure to seek the truth in what he witnessed. Science and religion have always been uncomfortable couples and, although it did not cost her life, as did so many previous men and women, science put a barrier between husband and wife, fact and faith. This film portrays that barrier in a supreme way. <br /> <br /> I give Creation ten stars, because I think it is beautiful, deep, superbly well acted and a genuine and uncomplicated look at one of the worlds. The true geniuses. <br /> <br /> What seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone ... see the wonderful "Religulous" by Bill Maher) was hidden for millennia. The truth, once it was discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines that pain and the understanding that we are all that we possess. <br /> <br /> A wonderful cinematic experience.
