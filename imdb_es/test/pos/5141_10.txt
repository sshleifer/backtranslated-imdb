I took my youngest niece to an early presentation and she LOVED it (I enjoyed it too). I do not need to explain the plot, since the film is still completely faithful to the best-selling bestselling book of the famous author Carl Hiaasen. The film takes the popular book and combines it with a beautiful cinematography (I want to go to Florida now!), Humor (thanks to Funny-Man, Luke Wilson and some newcomers) and excellent music! I have to get a Jimmy Buffet CD now! I know a movie is good when I get goosebumps at the end. In general, it was a great family movie that I felt comfortable taking to my youngest niece. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
