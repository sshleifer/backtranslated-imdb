I was recently given this movie on DVD as a gift, and at first I was not sure if it would be attractive (although one of my favorite actors has a leading role). In fact, he is on the way to becoming a favorite. <br /> <br /> In the first place: fortunately, it is not the same as the book, whose end I think is excessively melodramatic. Secondly: it is one of the best movies I've seen about the First World War. "What?" You can ask. "It's not a war movie!" True: we do not see battles or bombings, or trenches, or gas. But it shows the cost of the war, the damage done to the lives of the men who fought in it and the impact this had on those who are close to them. <br /> <br /> First we see Helen (Sarah Miles), The Widow of a Baronet, waiting for her to leave a psychiatric hospital. All the women in the film seem to be widows: some of the war, but Helen's much older husband, Sir Thomas (we see him later in a photograph) got sick and died while she was at a party, hence his fault . damaged fault. She is lost and alone. The cable that surrounds the hospital grounds evokes prisoner of war camps and trenches: like many men in the outside world, Helen suffers a kind of electric shock. <br /> <br /> Outside the hospital, you have to find your feet in the outside world again: a world that we experience through your eyes as desolate and desolate. His mother can not provide any real support. She herself, a widow, has put up her own emotional defenses, behind which she hides to avoid dealing with her daughter's anguish. (Like many people, especially at that time, it seems that mental illness is shameful). <br /> <br /> Ledbetter, the hired driver, becomes a supportive presence, and helps Helen adjust to life again, but she does not realize that she is becoming dangerously obsessed with her. This is an excellent performance by Robert Shaw. Ledbetter is a former regular soldier, a former sergeant major who runs a boxing club and has established his own car rental business. Superficially, it seems strong and strong, reliable, but there are cracks below the surface: it has not really adapted to civilian life. Invent (for reasons he explains later) a family and family life he does not have; He has brutal outbursts with colleagues, and sex without affection. Approaching Helen? A woman with whom, even with the greatest post-war social freedom, could not really have married? It exposes the psychological flaws that destroy it. These days, one could diagnose post-traumatic stress disorder. <br /> <br /> The same goes for the other man in Helen's life, the aspiring politician Captain Hugh Cantrip (Peter Egan). He is ambitious, handsome, but also very young. In a revealing way, his girlfriend, Connie (Caroline Mortimer), takes care of him, combs his hair and makes sure he has a clean handkerchief before leaving. Both Ledbetter and Helen know him: the first had served under his command during the war, and Helen had known him in political circles and had considered him a "popinjay." However, he and Helen now begin a relationship, with Helen intending to support his career politically, financially and emotionally. Peter Egan, newly arrived from his stage success as Stanhope in R C Sheriff's "Journey's End," makes Hugh more than a fad. There is a revealing and discreet scene in the back of the car between Helen and Hugh, in which they cite "The Old Vicarage at Grantchester" by Brooke. She asks, from her experience of war, "Was it very bad?" He can not answer. She says: "Well, you're back." But his response in a low voice? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder?" ?? It is the key to your character. When light and shadow cross his face, we know that there are some horrors that can not be expressed in words. The disproportionate casualties suffered by subordinate officers of his class? Directly out of school or college and expect to lead from the front? They are well known. In a nervous speech (during which Helen reassures him) to local political people at a dinner party, he reveals that he will remain an independent, no longer a liberal (the party that had led the country to war). His emotional life is as damaged as Ledbetter's. He can not easily separate from Connie, who depends on him emotionally and financially: reading between the lines, it is likely that he is a war widow (perhaps an old comrade?) With a child, whose drawings we see on the wall of his house. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> The crisis between the trio develops slowly, with a terrifying scene between Helen and Ledbetter in the car, and Ledbetter listening to Hugh. and Connie when she drives them, while Hugh tries to persuade Connie that, even when her relationship with Helen develops, they can continue with hers; that he, at least, will continue to support her. Jealousy, obsession and her belief that she must protect Helen from a gold duplicator led Ledbetter to confront her and Hugh violently at home. <br /> <br /> The ending is completely different from the one in the novel, and it is Better for it: it is dramatic, but less melodramatic, and maintains a non-sentimental tone. We begin with a character recovering from a mental crisis; We end with another sufferer. Helen, it is perceived, is now wiser and stronger than the two men, who have not been able to fully adapt to the so-called 'land suitable for heroes' to which they returned from the nightmare of total war. The new ending is open: one feels that she, at least, will face what is coming, without illusions. In this, it reflects well the reality of the time, in which women (Helen, Connie and many others) had to collect the pieces of a world in which too many men had died or returned home with varying degrees of mental discomfort. and physical damage. <br /> <br /> "Well, you're back." ?? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder?"
