This movie is a hidden gem. I can not understand why this movie does not get more air time. Errol and Eleanor Parker are an attractive and attractive couple. And its chemistry is impeccable. I really liked the touch of his daughters' reference to him as his Robin Hood. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Errol Flynn. It's good to see Errol playing a father too. According to all the testimonies of his own children, he was a very caring and loving father in real life. Also, the cast is wonderful too. You can not go wrong with players like Hattie McDaniel and Lucile Watson. Hattie McDaniel makes a much better movie from the beginning. This movie has now become a holiday tradition in my house. Enjoy!!!
