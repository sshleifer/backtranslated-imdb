Actually, I have more a question, than a comment. I loved the Z-Boys and The Lords of Dogtown. First I saw Lords, then the doc, and although I loved the story, I was curious to know why in the film, Sid was an important character, but in the documentary he was not part of the team, it was only mentioned as Just a child that they knew Does anyone know the story about that? The story of these guys was incredible. I never experienced the madness because of the skateboard I grew up on, but my children enjoyed it. What I've seen in the local skate parks is what these guys had invented. I never knew. When the film showed the competition, and the Z-Boys did their thing, they put others to shame in the competition.
