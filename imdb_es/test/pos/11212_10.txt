It has taken me about a year after watching this movie to write about it. God knows that I wanted to do it. After witnessing it, I knew I saw something I had not seen before, but I was not sure why. Now, after reflecting for quite some time, I know, these are the characters that even now I can not stop thinking about. <br /> <br /> Distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative (Yusuf) who comes from the The peasants live briefly with a wealthy to become a photographer (Mahmut) in the city with the hope of finding a job. However, it is clear that, after Yusuf believes that the idea of ​​being a sailor and his employment possibilities are scarce, that he is really looking for something else, some kind of purpose in his life. <br /> <br /> Through all this search for souls They are taken through seasonal environments that are filmed exquisitely. The context in which they occur makes the scenes more powerful in 2, in particular, when a girl that Yusuf has been following suddenly encounters her partner, and the expression on Yusuf's face when he looks at a basket of fish and the shot and the light that is reflected in his tortured face. That scene in itself has to be one of the most magnificently filmed pieces that I've witnessed. I do not know how much time. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mahmut also has his own demons, but ends up confronting his relative. that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave, in a scene that is very simple but that has the feeling of a real pain in the heart. <br /> <br /> What's left of the viewer is a lot Reflecting and reflecting on these 2 people in which everyone can see a part of themselves. You should not be intimidated by the pace of this movie. It's worth it for every impressive second. <br /> <br /> Qualification 10 out of 10
