In a nutshell, Goldeneye is the best N64 game to date. The learning curve is almost perfect, and you will continue to play with your friends months later, since the multiplayer mode is exceptional. <br /> <br /> The system for acquiring tricks for once requires a certain degree of skill, rather than simply knowing what buttons to press, and Aztec's challenge at agent level 00 is amazing. <br /> <br /> In general, it's the best game I've played on the N64
