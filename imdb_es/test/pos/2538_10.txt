"Pixote: A Lei do Mais Fraco" is about what is perhaps the greatest of all Brazilian themes: poverty. And along with poverty the other unnatural feelings and actions it brings; Prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder. <br /> <br /> Brazil is the country of paradoxes, and its social problems are present everywhere. The difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; The happiness and the deepest human decadence. <br /> <br /> "Pixote" is one of the films that dare to touch and open these painful wounds, and does so without the slightest hint of hope, in an honest portrait of A country that, like the Pixote himself, he is already lost.
