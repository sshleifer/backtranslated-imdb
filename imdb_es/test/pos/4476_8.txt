An excellent story well told by the filmmaker. The interactions between man and leopard brought many questions to the viewers' minds about who the humans were. Humans killed animals for no reason just to survive. At the end of the movie, you were left wondering who the real "hero" of the movie was. A story well told. The human actor did an excellent job, but the leopard stole all the scenes he was in.
