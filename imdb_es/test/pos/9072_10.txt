The group of big stars at the box office is phenomenal in this movie! William Baldwin, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts! This movie was made in one of my favorite years too, 1990! I am a resident of Chicago, and the stage in Chicago was very identifiable and artistic too! I liked this movie, and the agitation that motivated the climax in this image was a powerful element for the plot, which was absolutely sensational! /> <br /> The "flatliners" are centered around a group of dissatisfied pre-medicine students who want to be in a flat line to obtain some kind of social demand! When life has no meaning, it would seem very illogical to be curious about apocalyptic nightmares! At the same time, once your curiosity has taken hold of them, there is no going back! The king of the hill (so to speak) is the one who shouts with vehemence: I WILL DO TWO MINUTES !! WHO ELSE IS GOING TO DO THAT !! SOMEONE WANTS TO TRY BY TWO AND A HALF! Ultimately, all these newly arrived and very unpleasant recriminations now have an extremely ubiquitous disposition in the lives of these retesting! The consummation of his justified or unjustified pathos required a full 360 degree perspective on the subjects for which they were dying! Whatever purpose this imprudent and academic chicanery serves, it is definitely an original approach to affirming his personality! I liked this movie, 1990 was a good year for me too, things seemed to fit that year! When I saw this movie one night in November of the year 1990, I was very happy to have done it.
