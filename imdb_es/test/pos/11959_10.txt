What can I say about this movie, except it's very fun! <br /> <br /> John Cusack plays Hoops McCann, a recent high school graduate who has two options, learning to take on the family street-sweeping business or spending the summer on Nantucket with his friend George Calamari ( played by Joel Murray) and his crazy friends. <br /> <br /> When I say madness, believe me, you can not be more crazy than the Stork brothers, Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Clay (Tom Villard) and Ack Ack Raymond (Curtis Armstrong). Add a girl named Squid and her weird little bug and a great performance by Demi Moore and you'll have everything you need to divide your faces, movie. <br /> <br /> Laughter flows freely in this film and in the story. The line, although the typical good against the bad and the good conquest, is great with the touch of a regatta like the confrontation. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a lot of laughs and feels good. If you like * to enjoy * your movies completely, then you can not miss One Crazy Summer!
