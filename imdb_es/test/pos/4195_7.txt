You really should remember the Monkees and have a clear understanding of where and how they adapted to the second half of the 1960s to fully appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no plot as such. Basically, it's a crazy, mixed pastiche of several unrelated sequences. But, it's interesting and entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get to your wavelength. In short, it was a classic, ingeniously conceived and well-designed example of the experimental cinema of the late 1960s. It contains some good songs, some ultra-great cinematography and many other valuable ideas in terms of cinematographic technique. <br /> <br /> I give it 7 out of 10 for various reasons. First, it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox film in the commercial stream, where both its stars and its producers were firmly installed at that time. If a feature film fails at the box office, the consequences can be terrible for everyone involved. Second, it was, for the most part, a creative success. And finally, as already mentioned, it is undoubtedly a classic of the genre and, as such, is now of historical importance. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Head" came too late in the Monkees race. But, once again, they would not have been allowed to do it before because it was essentially a very punctual and cynical satire of their own image. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the members of the group knew, very well, that all the Monkees monster had almost run their race when they started working on this project. In a way, it was going to be his swan song and they were determined to let it all go well. They were tired of being treated as mere pawns in the high-powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited in recent years. In short, "they wanted to leave" and they were going to say some things before leaving. <br /> <br /> However, history has vindicated the band. Let the critics be condemned. The Monkees left some of the best and most polished pop albums of the decade. Yes, they had a lot of help. But at the end of the day, THEY stood in front of the micros of the studio, THEY led the film and the TV cameras and THEY did the concerts. They were fun and a little crazy. But, unlike some of his contemporaries, they were never threatening. You could safely introduce a monkey to your older aunt. <br /> <br /> "Head" probably takes a little too much from the Beatles' "Hard Day's Night," but it's still worth seeing those who were close at that moment. or for the youngest people who have the ability to appreciate its meaning. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
