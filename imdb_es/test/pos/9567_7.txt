Well, in 2002 I have something to do to catch up. And looking back on a dull year, Best In Show shined. There is no great story. Little action Only a cavalcade of magnificent characters. Particular reference to Fred Willard and Jim Piddock as a couple of television commentators. Well done. Well worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Ron (Seen March 24, 2001)
