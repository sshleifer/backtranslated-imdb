So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a movie that was silly? "The villain" and this could top the list. My husband says that "Jekyll and Hyde Together Again" is one of those movies that if "you've been there and you've done that" you'll think that this cocaine parody of the 80's Culture is a revolt. I think the whole movie is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes ... There are ongoing gags that must be watched to appreciate. To say that the movie does not follow the book would be true, but then many really good films also take liberties with the word published. I recommend this movie to all the old "drug addicts" among us. We can be smarter now, but we will still recognize and laugh at many people we met (ourselves?) In the old days.
