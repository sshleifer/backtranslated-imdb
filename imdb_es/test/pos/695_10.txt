This movie has to do with reality, the submarine war in World War II was not a clear and precise science. There were no computers that gave exact details about the enemy, there was no precise instrumentation to control the submarine 100%. Not all the team went to fight with a song in their heart, and a smile on their dial. <br /> <br /> People with expectations of seeing a "pretty war" in this film will be greatly disappointed, ... ........... WELL, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve to be put the reality in the face. <br /> <br /> War is not clean, accurate, fought by people who are about to break into song. It is supported by frightened, cold / burned, hungry and desperate people who are willing to do anything to survive. <br /> <br /> "We Dive at Dawn" is a good example that describes a desperate situation that needs desperate actions.
