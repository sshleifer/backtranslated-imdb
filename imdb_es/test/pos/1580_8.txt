This movie, I would like to say, was completely great. I can see how many people would think it's just a shocking movie. This is not completely false, but it is as outrageous a fiction as Chuck Palahniuk's books are. One of my favorite films of all time, Bijo no Harawata, is a certain type of raw manufacturing film to which you can have any reaction. It's scary, funny, silly, disgusting, full of material out of the top and for some people, waking up. The first time I saw him, it was with my friend, and his mother had brought him home for him to see. He said it was just a ruined Japanese movie, but I saw a lot more of that. It's badly done, yes, but it has a certain kind of intensity to be beautiful, too. As the Director himself says, this is a shocking movie made for a certain reason. It's like atrophy. If you leave the audience soft, then the entire human race will be soft. I think this is a good philosophy, and I agree with it one hundred percent. Bijo no Harawata is the kind of movie that gangs violate hell, yogurt and all these novelties.
