I saw this show on stage when it aired on PBS in 1983. At that time I was involved in the local theater and had seen incredible things at the Dell Arte Players, but Bill Irwin surprised me. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the way a man of his size (which is quite tall and sturdy) could fold into a small box without even a pause to adjust and move around the stage at full speed without even a whisper. of his feet, if he chose not to make any noise. <br /> <br /> The most surprising thing to me, however, in this performance, was the way he stood up during the jack-in-the-box / marionette hunk. Those who saw this show will remember that when he came out of the box and collapsed on the ground with his limp body and akimbo limbs, he "crawled" up the top of his head as if by a rope, and stood up not only for his feet, but to a full ballet point and he did it in a fluid motion, seemingly effortless. Just consider the strength, grace, balance and focus a series of movements must take to achieve them the way they did! Add to your physical prowess your strong and credible characterization skills, and there is an accomplished actor / actor. My jaw dropped in movement and my heart broke into the representation of a puppet that is determined to be something more than a lifeless thing in a box. <br /> <br /> As for the unfortunate (yes? "Tragic" would be a better word) unavailability of this piece in the form of domestic media, I have noticed that much of the works of PBS are not available on tape or DVD. Sometimes, PBS programs will be available for direct purchase for a limited time immediately after transmission, but rarely remain on the market for long. There are exceptions, of course, but these are mainly science and history documentaries; rarely does a piece of art remain printed for a long time, assuming it ever became VHS / DVD to begin with. I do not know why this should be so; Certainly, PBS could use the revenues of media marketing in its programs, but they do not take advantage of it. It's a shame. There are many things I've seen on PBS that I want to own, but I'm afraid that pieces like "The Regard of Flight" are, once in a lifetime, never repeated on PBS. Again and never be available for the purchase of media at home. That really sucks. I'm lucky I caught him when I did it. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, our local library obtained a copy of "The Regard of Flight." And if it was stolen.
