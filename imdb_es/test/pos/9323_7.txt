The musical biographies are all cut from the same fabric. The hopes fight, they triumph and finally they win the girl, but this one, a life of Irish tenor, Chauncey Olcott / Jack Chancellor, has more possibilities than the habitual traps. It has great charm and great sincerity and is played very well by all concerned. Dennis Morgan is well in the lead as is Arlene Dahl as his love interest. The supporting performance of Andrea King as Lillian Russell is much better than Alice Faye's leading bio performance in the movie dedicated to her career. William Frawley is playing while the old tenor champion, William Scanlon, and Sara Allgood is charming as Olcott's mother. George Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale lend a good support. There are more than 25 songs (a real treasure chest): Come Down My Evening Star; The blue eyes of my nellie; You tell me your dream Wait until the sun shines, Nellie; Will you love me in December? By the light of the silver moon; Minstrel Days; Polly Wolly Doodle; The Natchez and the Robert E. Lee; Miss Lindy Lou; If I'm dreaming Little pink of Killarney; Handshake; A little girl; A little piece of heaven; Mary; Sweet Innescarren; Tiddely Um; When the Irish eyes are smiling; Mother Machree; The Kerey Fair; Room in my heart; My wild Irish rose. <br /> <br /> Although the film only won an Oscar for Oscar nomination, and deservedly, it also deserved winks for the direction of art and costume design, sumptuous and charming in Technicolor. <br /> <The reasons why this is not in video can be due to the large amount of time that is spent in the atmosphere of Minstrel Show, at least in a quarter of the film, with a lot of material politically INCORRECT for the public today. However, it is historically accurate. <br /> <br /> This is a real gem and it's worth looking for. Leave one with a warm glow.
