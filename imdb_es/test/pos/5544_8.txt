It's a pleasure to see Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine in this comedy about nonsense. Alec Baldwin, who was a rising star when the movie was made, is a big shout. Dean Stockwell, in a summary of John Gotti, is hysterical. But Mercedes Ruehl, like the paranoid and above Connie, steals the movie. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme, formerly known for crazy comedies like "Something Wild" and "Melvin and Howard," once again proves he's a genius. I was not surprised when he won the Oscar for directing "Silence of The Lambs." The performances he evokes from his actors in "Married" are inspired, and the audience is taken for a wild and shaggy ride. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful and endearing films of the 80s, stands out. and shoulders above many of the satires of his time.
