After seeing this for the first time, I thought: "Wow, this is the most spectacular movie, visually speaking, I've seen". Since then, I've seen some that have surpassed him, but he still ranks as one of the best in that department. I just disliked that the long-awaited DVD was so poorly made, the quality of this transfer is not much better than the VHS tape. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the jungle are recorded in Cameroon, and "exuberant" is the best Adjective to describe what you see. Except for the sounds of the jungle, "seeing" is certainly almost everything at first, since there is almost no "audition", there is no dialogue until Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) befriends Ian Holm and vice versa ... so get ready for that, if you have not seen this movie. <br /> <br /> As for the story, all I'll say is that it's not the Tarzan that many of us met in the Johnny Weismuller movies ... but that's not a complaint. For those who want action, and I do not care about cinematography like I do, you just have to get through that period of silent introduction. <br /> <br /> In this version of Tarzan, our hero returns to Scotland (his roots) , he adapts to that environment (for the most part ... and a little too fast for credibility, frankly) and then returns to the jungle without Jane. This is supposedly more faithful to the Tarzan books, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> The special effects here were made by Rick Baker, one of the best in the business. Sharp DVD or not, this is an awesome movie to watch and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes.
