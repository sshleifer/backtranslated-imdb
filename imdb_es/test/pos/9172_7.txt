While the concept of "doctor's appointment" is the only thing that saves this movie from being an otherwise normal romantic comedy with a standard argument for the genre, I found it nice enough to raise my opinion about it, as well I ended up liking myself much more. that if I had had only a mediocre plot without many twists. Will Smith does a great job, as always, acting like Hitch, the man who spends his life advising men how and how not to win over women ... from his failed attempt to keep his girlfriend from college. There is much laughter as he tries to help his last patient, overweight and disgusting asthmatic Albert Brennman (Kevin James) to court the beautiful co-worker Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta). Also, when he decides to get rid of a woman with whom he finds himself in a turkey bar that does not seem to understand that she does not want him, he is attracted to Sara (Eva Mendes); It seems to be a great deal for him, so I guess since college he never practiced his own rules about himself. Unfortunately, Sara is a gossip columnist who is interested in "the appointment doctor" who has a seemingly dumb guy like Albert along with Allegra, especially after the player / imbecile Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) breaks the heart of her best friend (Julie Ann Emery) and hints at the date when the doctor saw him upset, when she does not realize that she refused to see him. Still, the problem continues and Hitch is stuck wondering what to do with their own relationship, while it is not very helpful to Albert when he tries to figure out what else to do in his. The acting is good, there is a lot of humor and some other fine points with meaning. The character of Hitch is witty and wise, sometimes manages to be both at the same time. True, the misunderstanding in which the woman feels offended by something that the man has not really done (why do they always show that?) As something common and irritating: I suppose it would not have been if it had been the first, not the fifth time, I've seen it, but the rest were completely new. I just wish this movie was longer. I remember I could see 3/5 while I was on a restaurant's TV once, but I still approve. It is definitely worth the money to pay for its brevity.
