The Ator series is a shining example of what serial films should be. They fail in all aspects, but in such a hilarious way that they are fun instead of sad. "Ator l'invincibile 2", also known as "The Blade Master", also known as "Cave Dwellers", shows us the favorite clone of Europe, Ator, where we left it in the first film, after showing us a long summary of all the events of the first movie. This time, the world must be saved from "The Nucleus", a kind of bomb, represented on the screen as a bright light (I guess they could not afford an accessory). This one has invisible attackers and samurai. As with the first movie, many archive images are used (including a fairly obvious part of "Star Wars"). Totally ridiculous and unforgettable, this is a B-movie exception.
