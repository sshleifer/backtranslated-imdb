I'm a big fan of big, noisy, trashy, completely stupid action movies like The Rock, Con Air, etc. All these are very fun to watch but, when you think about it, it is extremely silly. IN THE LINE OF FIRE tells a story and tells it well. With plausibility, emotion and suspense, he also addressed several important moral issues that really make you think. The last image of the film is Eastwood and Russo sitting together on the steps of the White House observing the pigeons with soft and peaceful music and I felt a deep sense of satisfaction. This was because I cared about the characters and I was glad that their story had reached a happy conclusion. It felt like a real story. Like the old secret service agent tormented by the fact that he could not protect JFK on that fateful day in Dallas, Clint Eastwood is fantastic. He brilliantly transmits his paranoia and his personal need to stop his adversary. On the other side of the spectrum is John Malkovich, as the spooky predator who tortures Eastwood about what happened in 1963 by openly telling him of his plan to assassinate the current president. This Oscar-nominated performance really gets under your skin. Throughout the film, Malkovich talks to Eastwood as if they were friends. He does not threaten him, he does not lie to him, he does not laugh at him, but he tortures him with his unbearable kindness until the last moment. In addition to this exciting main plot, there is a lovely love story that involves Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood. Despite the age difference, they have excellent chemistry on the screen and the director wisely does not let this dominate too much, but keeps it as part of the background that works well. In short, I love this movie because it has a mind.
