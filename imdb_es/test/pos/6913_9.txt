I thought Rachel York was fantastic as "Lucy". I have also seen her in "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Victor / Victoria", and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations. It is a chameleon that can touch (and sing) anything! <br /> <br /> I am very surprised at the amount of negative reviews that appear here regarding Rachel's performance in "Lucy". Even some bona fide critics of television and entertainment seem to have missed the point of their interpretation. Many people have focused on the fact that Rachel does not look like Lucy. My answer to that is, "So what?" I was not looking for a superficial impersonation of Lucy. I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. And Rachel certainly gave us that, in great depth. Nor did I want to see someone simply "doing" Lucy's classic routines. Therefore, I was very pleased with the decision of the producers and the director that Rachel interpreted Lucy in the essay of the most memorable of these parodies: Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory. (It seems that some of the reviewers did not realize that these two scenes were intended to be test sequences and not the actual scenes). This approach, I thought, gave an innovative twist to the sketches that many of us know by heart. I also thought that Rachel was terribly cool and funny in these scenes. And she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the Professor and the grape trodden, in particular. There was a moment in the grape scene where the corner of Rachel's mouth had the exact small rise I remember Lucy had. I could not believe that she was capable of capturing that, and very naturally. <br /> <br /> I wonder if many of the people who criticized the performance expected to see Lucille's dance of "I Love Lucy" throughout the entire movie. After all, those of us who came to know her only at through television we would have no idea of ​​what Lucy really was like in her early cinema years. I think Rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. She planted all the right seeds so we could see the clown who was waiting to emerge, given the right circumstances. Lucy did not fit the mold of the old study system. In her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she continued to repress what would prove to be her last gifts. <br /> <br /> I think Rachel skillfully captured comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger. Passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sensuality, self-absorption, puberty and stoicism, all in a complex American icon. And he did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. "Lucy" was a star turn for Rachel York. I hope it brings a lot of great roles in the future. I also hope it brings you an Emmy.
