I love almost everything that the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career, but "The Possession of Nurse Sherri" stands out above the fun, but there are certainly Z grade fairs like "Horror of the Blood Monsters" and " Dracula Vs. Frankenstein. " This movie is really scary! Am I saying you're going to jump out of your seat when you see "Nurse Sherri"? Of course not. But this pastiche of elements of "The Exorcist", "Ruby" and "Carrie" is one of those pretty and creepy horror movies common to the seventies. You can not point out what is so creepy, but the film drips with the atmosphere. (And what an end! Do not worry, I will not ruin it for you). Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really did it, and it does not matter if "Sherri's nurse" was a calculated success or a success. happy accident Jill Jacobson is sympathetic but not outstanding as the unfortunate nurse who is possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (Bill Roy, who shines in his brief role). Geoffrey Land is fine as his rude boyfriend doctor. There are some blaxploitative elements here (after all, the benefit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in movies) but they actually contribute to the plot instead of just being showcase. "Nurse Sherri" was a Poverty Row production, and is sometimes shown (series, special effects, etc.). Still, the movie has a heart, mostly decent acting and direction, and some genuine chills. Sam Sherman also considered it appropriate to use Harry Lubin's theme music for the television series "One Step Beyond" in the late 50's and early 60's in this film, which certainly adds to the spooky atmosphere. The DVD contains two significantly different cuts from the movie (the previous version features a lot of T & A that ended up on the floor of the cutting room to make way for more horrible things), as well as the theatrical trailer, the television spot and a great comment by Sherman. Does anyone know what happened to Bill Roy, by the way? Along with John Carradine, is the best actor I've seen in an Al Adamson movie, and interprets the cult leader as he means it.
