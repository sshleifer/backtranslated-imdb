It is not a joke. Yes, "Who's That Girl" has the distinction of being one of the Madonna movies that bombed, but I actually liked this movie better than "Desperately looking for Susan." In "Susan", the character of Madonna is relegated to being a violin of Rosanna Arquette and she is not given much to work with. Without disrespecting Rosanna, but in WTG, Madonna plays this crazy and scandalous character, which only takes place in an 80s style. While it may seem "corny" today, this is actually one of the best and more undervalued Madonna movies. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an ex-convict who is sent to jail for a crime she has not committed herself to. She is being released from prison after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very underestimated actor, plays Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station. Of course, when these two come together, that's when the madness happens. Sir John Mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of Manhattan with a rain forest (???) on his roof. <br /> <br /> This movie parodies everything. The rich people, the sordid characters who live in Harlem and totally destroy Rolls-Royce de Louden, the homosexual cops who follow Madonna and Dunne in town, and Dunne's fianc√©e dressed, Wendy Worthington, who has supposedly slept with all taxi drivers from New York (played by Haviland Morris, who was Jake's girlfriend (Caroline in Sixteen Candles), and very fun! In addition, Dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard that resembles "Bringing Up Baby". , Madonna had a great 80's platinum blonde in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack, throw all this into the mix and you'll have the madness of WTG. <br /> <br /> Madonna is the queen of life There are times in the movie where it says a totally straight line and, surprisingly, it turns out to be funny! This is how some of the best comedies should be played directly, Madonna should have done more comedy and it was a pity that she did not choose Later, it became much more controversial and got into more of the dark and sex-laden roles in the famous films "Body of Evidence" and "Dangerous Game". <br /> <br /> Some people say that Madonna can not act, and that's fine, people are entitled to their opinion, but I think the real problem is that people can not see the difference between Madonna playing a character in the movie, instead I still see only Madonna and that is the main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies. It's still a funny comedy from the 80s. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you will not like it, so I would recommend it mainly for Madonna fans, but you never know, it may surprise you and you like it. <br /> <br /> Interesting note: Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, one of Madonna's friends from her days in New York clubs in the 1980s, was a member of the bands Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band.
