If you want to see the true vile nature of communism, watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. (Tvamomodr√Ω Svet) Tells how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared having picked up dangerous Western ideas about freedom. Then, these heroic Czech pilots were thrown into a nightmare prison, where some of the guards were the same Nazis who risked their lives to defeat. <br /> <br /> If Hollywood wants to understand why so many films fall. flat, they should compare the dramatic parts of the character of "Pearl Harbor" with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really make a connection with all the characters. At Pearl Harbor, everyone is like a cartoon version of a real person. <br /> <br /> There are innumerable examples of brilliant writings in this movie. A funny scene that comes to my mind is when the character of Karel is being taught in English by a fairly formal Englishwoman. When he can not pronounce a word, he ridicules the lesson. In typical English stoic fashion, the teacher confronts Karel calmly but forcefully, and embarrasses him to behave. <br /> <br /> The aerial battle sequences in this movie are incredible and help keep the film animated. I read it was $ 11,000 an hour to rent the planes, but it was worth every penny. <br /> <br /> Ladies, you are expected to cry in sad movies, but boys ... be careful! This movie would make General Patton cry. And if you're a dog lover, you'll use half a box of Kleenex. Do not say I did not warn you.
