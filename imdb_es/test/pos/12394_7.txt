I blow hot and cold on card. He really can be a puzzle for me. I think maybe his inspiration left him a little earlier than he did for other directors of his generation. Certainly, a man who reached maturity in the 1930s with the Popular Front seems to feel uncomfortable in the France of the 1950s, with his unbridled commercialism and great American influence. He is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and it shows. The scenes of the party last much longer than they should, as if trying to buy time for the anemic scenario to work. The character of Roland Lesaffre, who plays Pascale Petit's older brother, seems to exist only to assure the director that his old-fashioned ideas are still solid. <br /> <br /> At two hours, this image is too long. Even so, let me praise Pascale Petit for his performance in the game; she was a natural person who should have challenged Brigitte Bardot for sexpot supremacy, but somehow she lost her way. Andrea Parisy is also excellent as the girl who gets pregnant and wants Charrier to marry her and make her baby legitimate (yes, they still thought that way in the fifties). Laurent Terzieff is the only French actor who can play an anarchist convincingly: he is excellent here when he rescues a cat from death and then says he can not stand cats. Jacques Charrier only reminds me how mediocre he was as an actor, with that constant little smile and those blank eyes.
