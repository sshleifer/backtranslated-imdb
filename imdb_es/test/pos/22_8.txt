What is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews I have read here, is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behavior of homosexuals in the era represented in the film. While Courtenay's character is obviously gay, he is not the only one: the one who is often talked about by Mr. Davenport-Scott is the other, and the reason why he is never seen, the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems be that he has done it. He has been arrested by the police for homosexual activity, a criminal offense in England at that time. <br /> <br /> We can read under the surface that this recent event has disturbed Norman, the character of Courtenay: and we can also see it in a passing observation of Oxenby, the character of Edward Fox, the quick resignation of any connection with that person when the law is involved: the fear of association affects many of the characters, and is part of the portrait that the film paints of an era and People who inhabit it. The abandonment of Courtenay at the end by Sir has been anticipated to the end, if this subtext is included: it also makes sense both the unexplained omission of his Dresser from the list of those to whom he gives thanks. The extravagance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of longing and fear that Courtenay has to "get on the lanterns," as he does when he announces the impending air attacks, a scene that would otherwise be free , but that is a symbolic and literal representation of the internal torment of man. <br /> <br /> Then, while the drama is of Mr. Finney's decline, much of the tragedy of the movie and the game comes from the "fatal flaw". 'of Courtenay's homosexuality, and makes this a film about him, as the title suggests. <br /> <br /> The artistic direction, the rhythm and the cinematographic style of this film seem to come from another era, more distant than the one of the eighties and, in some way, even that the second world war. The implicit portrait of a society that still clings to an older moral order, and the sympathy of the person tormented and ruined by the cruelties of that order, necessarily trapped in the closed world of the theater; and the knowledge we have of how much would be eliminated after the war makes this film even more poignant, despite all its shortcomings.
