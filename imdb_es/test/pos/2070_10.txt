1. I've seen Branaghs Hamlet: Branagh is too old, speaks often with a high-pitched voice (not wanting to be funny), is not a convincing Hamlet, and his qualities as directors, poor! (Also see many comments about Branagh, the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut, not talking about the mistakes of the directors in the dialog cuts!) 2. I've seen Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is a Interesting idea - but those terrible actors - all 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is fine - but this BBC Hamlet is the best! Derec Jacobi is convincing, he seems a little crazy, very suitable! and Patric Stewart - wonderful, and Claire Bloom is a very attractive queen. You believe those actors what they are saying, I think this is the best compliment.
