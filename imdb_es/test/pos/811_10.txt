The first time I saw this movie was in the early 90's, and I instantly fell in love with it. Richard Benjamin and his wife Paula made the 1981 film "Saturday 14" in 1981 before making this film in 1983. I think they work quite well together. This movie made me laugh several times. He also has a young Molly Ringwald, who later in the late 1980s would make films like Pretty in Pink and Sixteen Candles. It's fun to see her a little younger. Although not seen by many people ... I do not even think that the average movie fan has heard of this movie. But when I saw it for the first time, I was glad I did it. I gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars, I think. It is a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. Finally, I would like to say that it is not available on DVD, so I chose a copy on VHS on eBay, so if you are interested, you can probably find one in there. Range of $ 20 to $ 30 dollars, but I mattered for $ 12 dollars. I wish it was released on DVD.
