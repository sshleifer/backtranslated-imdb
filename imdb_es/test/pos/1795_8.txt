Apparently, Hans's isolation and desperation are caused by a stereotypically cold bourgeois mother, an annoying wife and the rejection of a lover. And despite the complex representation, Hans himself does not make precisely these claims, the foregoing must also be a substantial part of Fassbinder's thought (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer must not look beyond Hans's gender and sexism to locate the truest cause of his crushed spirit. <br /> <br /> First, it is very unlikely that his mother's lack of love would push him to sign with the Alien Legion. It was much more likely, and partly indicated, that it was an adventure, the male camaraderie (escape from the female world of the mother and sister) and the masculine identity itself, which both the Legion and the war offered. <Br /> <br /> Second, Hans loses his successful job as a policeman due to his own sexism. Falling into the trap of a prostitute at work, not only stamps stamps as an oppressive institution, but shows that he can not control his sexuality in the professional field, and that he is even willing to jeopardize a desirable career. <br /> <Third, he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his male friends as sheep, without making any distinction between his absence or, when she appears in search of him, his presence. In fact, it is more brutal in its presence. <br /> <br /> A few hours later, in a state of drunkenness and violence, he strikes his wife in front of his daughter, who intervenes on behalf of her mother. The terror it infuses in her and her daughter is palpable. But both he and the audience go ahead without a wail of conscience or protest. Why? Because his wife is cruelly characterized as annoying and sexually promiscuous (yes, this may be Fassbinder's opinion of what capitalism does to women: property, insecurity and merchandise), but this does not absolve Hans's brutality. nor the exploitation of Fassbinder. in the battery scene). <br /> <br /> And then there is the pressure of the male role, which Hans could choose to reject and protest, but instead he accepts. He is too short to be masculine and not heroic to achieve the worldly success recommended by the male role. But how can these causes of despair be when he not only wins his lost love as a lover but marries a tall woman who is considerably more attractive than himself? Finally, Hans allows Harry, his warmate, to stay, beyond the convincing of his wife. On the contrary, at home. With this decision, not only makes it clear that he is more linked to Harry than his wife, but that the male bond overcomes his love for women. And it replaces, in the end, his own life, because it is Harry's superior competence and spirit in the house that makes Hans's star fall. Hans, the merchant, may be a victim of capitalism to some extent, but more specifically, he is the victim of his own allegiance to his own masculine identity. His inability to let go is the ultimate cause of his isolation and despair. <br /> <br /> This is something that is lost, I think, not only in Fassbinder, but also in Han's sister, Anna, though, only to a degree lost. By the support of Anna (and Fassbinder) to her brother, about her mother, she only goes so far. She is quite insistent that only he can save himself, that his support and love can not end his own aversion. Unfortunately, she does not offer anything of this same support and love for his wife, who must be much more embittered than Hans, but who in the end can pick up the pieces, save herself and her daughter and present a stark contrast. to the fall of han.
