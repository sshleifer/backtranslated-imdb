After watching the Harry Potter films, I've been a fan of the actors of the trio Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; However, we have been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides playing the same characters per year or every two years of J.K. Rowling series. Mainly, instead of a trio, cameras and magazine articles are more focused on Daniel and Emma, ​​since they are the most prominent men and the most prominent women in the series, leaving Rupert in the dead end. It does not matter, every actor has a moment to shine and the light of Rupert hits him for once in this movie. <br /> <br /> "Driving Lessons" is called Harold and Maude of this generation with Rupert Grint playing the role of Ben Marshall, a young British man who lives with his dominant mother (Laura Linney) and a vicar's puppet ( priest) father for whom he wants a job in the summer but can not find work while at the same time taking his driving tests (and fails) and writing poetry for a young woman who has no interest in him. <br /> <br /> Ben looks for an advertisement in a church newspaper for which work requires caring for an elderly woman. He takes the job and realizes that he is going to have fun with surprises like Evie (Julie Walters, Rupert's mother in the Harry Potter series), an unemployed actress who is also a poet and gives Ben the opportunity to earn your money They join where and secrets are told, along with Evie acting like a child and doing pranks where he drags Ben for a trip through the countryside. Ben not only drives from Britain to Scotland, since Evie needs to recite in a local library, but at the same time an older woman falls in love with the young man in which Ben begins to become a man. <br /> <br /> There is a setback and at the same time rejoice with Ben and Evie and say that I was very happy with the movie when it came out in the cinemas and I was impressed by the performance of Rupert Grint, especially if he showed the rest of the world that although it brings a bit of Ron Weasley to Ben Marshall, there is nothing to stop the actor in his brilliant performance.
