Yes, great cult television series. The great atmosphere, the best script and good performances make him a class A candidate for the DVD release. <br /> <br /> This is a seminal strength tour of the history of Australian television and has an unforgettable soundtrack of the time with the voice of gravel and phlegm of Doug Parkinson and the Australian of the 70 in all the cathode ray box as an incredibly long camera zoom Reveals the religion of the open road in all its antipodean glory. This is a memory of another time not too far away, and it has the proud stamp of the powerful land of Down Under, from beginning to end, in all its natural freedom and gritty grandeur. <br /> <br /> Come on ABC! Participate in the program and free this cute cult baby of the 70 for everyone to enjoy it, or return to enjoy it if you are lucky to have lived the dream at that time.
