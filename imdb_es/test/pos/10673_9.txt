I have fond memories of having seen this visually dazzling movie as a child in the late 70's and early 80's in wor-tv (now upn-9) in New York. Although it is a product of the 60s, this film has hardly aged. The effects are as wonderful as those of 2001, and in some aspects superior (the work of the model is impeccable). With an attractive cast, a great color photograph and set design, and an evocative score, JTTFSOTS is a winner!
