I've been playing this movie incessantly this month, and I love it. I was around in the 60's (oh dear), so it's nostalgic in a sense. However, it is the fun premise, the agile dialogue and the great performances that keep me watching. <br /> <br /> Dr. Winston's reactions to Stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless. (It would be more specific, but I do not want to spoil it for anyone). Who, apart from Matthau, can play a man who is not quite on top and still loves us? As for Bergman's outfits, I think she looks as disheveled as she's supposed to be. I think "they stole" the only time she appears in an evening dress. It does not suit him at all, which is very bad. I never liked it when I saw it for the first time and still not. <br /> <br /> Goldie won an Oscar for her role. People thought that it was an innovative performance at that time and, nevertheless, it is the only one that I do not love as much as the others. However, she has the right amount of sweetness and sympathy, which is important for this role. <br /> <br /> And I agree: I thought that Rick Lenz was very good at that and it's a pity that his film career has not done it. Take off after this. <br /> <br /> I hope more people see this movie ... they will love it!
