This was the last silent film by Laurel and Hardy for Roach Studios. However, given that the public had a real thirst for "fanatics", the team did this same short film a few years later with only a few changes in the plot. GRAVY'S LAUGHTER was essentially the same plan, except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their bad-tempered owner, not a goat like ANGORA LOVE. All this angle of goat is the worst part of the movie. While you can understand children who want to have a cute puppy (after all, it is covered in snow outside), the reason they bring a goat home is simply contrived and meaningless. According to the plot, the goat followed them home and they tired of frightening her and kept her. Hey, this just does not make any sense, if it had been a giraffe or a cow, would they have done the same? In addition to being an unconvincing argument, the film itself is pure Laurel and Hardy, with a familiar plot and familiar roles for comedians. This movie has a lot of laughs, but unfortunately it is not one of his best films to close his silent careers. This aspect of their careers seems to have ended with a moan.
