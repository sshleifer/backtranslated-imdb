"Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable", the third of the series, is a magnificent piece of dull pulp. With a narrower tone and subject to a violent pink Nikkatsu than other Scorpion entries, it is photographed in a surprising way, it is directed with great enthusiasm and filled with a gallery of villains and degenerates of rogues. Shinya Ito, the director of the first installment, returns for this surrealist fable that begins with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting the arm of a policeman who is handcuffed and fleeing to the Tokyo subway with that arm still hanging from his wrist. She takes refuge in a district of red light where she befriends a prostitute, who is seen for the first time having incestuous sexual relations with her brother (who ends up impregnating her). Scorpion's desire to protect this unfortunate woman finally exposes her identity and all hell breaks loose. They beat her, sexually assault her and lock her in a bird cage in the villain's lair. I loved everything about this hypnotic, nihilistic and emotionally moving film. It is the superior of the first three Scorpion films and presents one great scene after another. I can not recommend it highly enough.
