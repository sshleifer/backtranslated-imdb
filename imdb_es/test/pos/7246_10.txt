I give this one 10 out of 10, not because the plot was difficult to discover because it was not ... but because it leaves one taking care of the characters. The performance, for the entire cast, is excellent, especially Joan Hickson, and it is a wonderful episode for her heart. <br /> <br /> Miss Marple is asked to kill Jason Rafiel to investigate and solve a murder that happened seven or eight years ago, and he has to find out who, why and when he goes along. Mr. Rafiel is the same Rafiel as in A Caribbean Mystery, so there is a sense of connection here. <br /> <br /> Nemesis is definitely one of the amateur psychologists among us, and if you are one of those who are only happy with lots of blood, guts and action sequences, you will not like it. . But if you are like me, someone who loves to know about PEOPLE and find out what motivates them, then Nemesis is for you.
