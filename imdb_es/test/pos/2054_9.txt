I had never heard of this movie until it appeared on cable TV and I can not understand why. Geena beats Arnold as an action hero in this movie! Geena is a former CIA assassin who was brainwashed and given an identity as a school teacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and a daughter. The clues begin to reach her saying that it may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that his former employers have discovered that he never died and want to make sure that he is. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, who is a former police officer. Together they make a pair as entertaining as Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. When Geena finally regains her memory, she undergoes a transformation in the killing machine that once was with the song "She's Not There" playing bottom. What follows is that Geena and Samuel have to chase the bad guys and, hopefully, stay alive. Throughout the rest of the film, Geena has to decide who she really is. The senseless killer machine? The mother / school teacher with quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially since the bad guys grab Geena's daughter. Great action scenes that line up with any of the Die Hard movies!
