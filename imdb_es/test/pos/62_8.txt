Fun and entertaining film about the German spy of the Second World War (Julie Andrews!) Falling in love with the American pilot (Rock Hudson), while trying to hide secrets. For some reason, this was attacked by criticism and rejected by the public in 1970; I do not see why. It is very well filmed, has wonderful costumes and interiors, and exciting aerial combats. He also has Andrews doing a striptease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song: "Whistling in the Dark". The movie has problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the filming of this, and it shows. Their love scenes lack spark and have zero sexual chemistry. Even so, they become good performances. The film is a bit long (even in the 105-minute director's cut that I saw) and it gets very dark and serious at the end. Still, it's worth catching. Try to see the directors cut ... the other one runs half an hour more!
