Pretty good for a French movie. I have not seen any of Catherine Breillat's previous films, so I have no opinions about this compared to her previous work. French cinema usually adheres to the art films ultimately, and leaves the films and star vehicles to Hollywood. That's probably a good business strategy, since no other film industry in the nation will have the resources to compete in such projects. Movies about making movies are often boring, as it has little resonance for people who are not in business. But this one sustained my interest much more than I thought. Despite the title, (curiously in English) it is not a comedy, despite some funny moments. I've only seen some of Anne Parillaud's films, but she shows a generous amount of talent and range, from the psychological and action drama of "La Femme Nikita" to the ironic comedy of "Innocent Blood". This film also expands its range when it plays a more or less common woman, but it is still convincing on the screen. Congratulations also to Roxane Mesquida, with whom I was not familiar. She plays a very inexpressive actress for most of the film, whose talent is exposed at the end. If you DO NOT HAVE to have entertainments of car chases and explosions, take a look at this.
