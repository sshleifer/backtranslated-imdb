One of the most famous movie series! It's still interesting today, although it looks like an "old movie." The second series looks better but it just is not equal to this one. The actors have a good time, especially Middleton and Lipson. Great edition by the team of experts from Universal. The musical score was traced in Universal's "Unknown Destiny", "The Invisible Man", "The Black Cat" and "Werewolf of London". And what great action music it was! If there was an option for the best series of all time, this (possibly) should be # 1.
