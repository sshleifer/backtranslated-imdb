This is not the kind of movie that really deserves critical attention. He's not going to win an Oscar, it's not really a good movie. What the heck, it's not even really a movie, just a series of short and disgusting side comedies united in an effort to make entertainment. And as much as all the critical bones in my body scream to give this movie a poor score, fuck, I'm going to give it a much better score. The kind of people who are going to enjoy this movie is not the kind of person who really cares about what the critics have to say, so I'm not going to make a careful critique of the quality of Jackass's surreal existentialism that permeates and Comment on how society ... oh forget it. <br /> <br /> What to say? There is no development of the plot, there is no development of the character, there is no real beginning, there is a semi-pleasant ending that is not as fun as the sketch that precedes it, and all that there is between bad smell and bath humor. that high school kids make fun of. Actually it's pretty fun. <br /> <br /> Leave all your preconceptions of a good movie at the door. Jackass: Number two is bullshit. That is really all that is. However, I give this to the filmmakers: they come with some pretty imaginative things. You will probably shrug several times, you will want to vomit a couple of times, shake and move uncomfortably while the people on the screen do the killing and the stunts that defy the vomit. Vomit, garbage, urine, semen ... Virtually all bodily fluids can be seen in Jackass: Number Two. There is nudity, sexual humor abounds, and so on. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining. If you're the kind of person who finds this material pleasing, then you'll probably like Jackass: Number Two. I laughed several times. As I said, it's quite imaginative. I never wanted to vomit, although I have a strong enough stomach. Just accept the premise of the movie: a group of idiot guys do a weird shit for fun. Once you have passed that, accepting it and going with it, you will enjoy it. The only flaw in the movie is the excess of all weird and disgusting things. There are several very imaginative and very disturbing parodies, but it creeps in many places as they do in others that are less interesting. Towards the end, things recover, but in the middle of the film, the resistance affects the overall quality of the film. In a half-hour TV show, this is not a problem, but with film length celluloid, it is inevitable that boredom will occur at some point. After a while, the trash becomes insensitive. <br /> <br /> In general, Number Two is an entertaining, imaginative and, above all, disgusting comedy that will leave you with a feeling of pain, nausea and hilarity. Go see it if you must do it, but hey, if you know you do not like this kind of thing, do not bother. It will simply disappoint you.
