OMG, it's seriously the best show in the world. It's harder than Jackass and CKY and it's very fun and entertaining. I love the show All 5 seasons are amazing, but for a brief summary: Season 1: - Excellent if you want to plan a treasure hunt, watch how the house separates and enjoy watching Phil Bing hungry. <br /> <br /> Season 2: - Great if you want to see them buy Castle Bam, see a concert of killers, see the wonder that is Mardi Gras and the fun of reaching it, see a demonstration derby and see the creation and opening of a Tree Top Casino. <br /> <br /> Season 3: - Great if you want to see probably the first Skatepark Driveway, a civil war, Johnny Knoxville, a pirate ship and Don Vito who actually won one of Bam's reindeer games. <br /> <br /> Season 4: - Great if you want to see them in Europe, getting jobs, building a state and a swamp and Season 5 of Dudesons: - Excellent if you want to see them in Brazil, Ape's birthday, Mike Vallely, The Metal Mulisha The disappearance of Bams Lambo, the destruction of Bams Hummer, a playboy party in the pool of Bams and the last Viva La Bam :(
