"Big Fat Liar" comes as welcome - shallow, but welcome - a breath of fresh air after too many films with restrooms, body fluids, pets with acid, gas jokes and crotch gags. After all, "See Spot Run", "Big Move by Max Keeble" and "Snow Dogs" had pointed to The Degenerative Spiral of Kiddie Movie-making. The worst thing is to realize that the young audience would be satisfied later with the softer offers of "Not Another Teen Movie" and "Slackers". Written by the producers of Nickelodeon, Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who coincidentally co-starred in the 80s comedy "Head of the Class"), the film stars Frankie Muniz as Jason, who is always ready with a good lie to get rid of scratches. (Where is the newspaper in English? Dad choked on a Swedish meatball). Your teacher (Sandra Oh) issues an ultimatum: hand out the newspaper at the end of the day or take summer classes. Jason flogs a story called "Big Fat Liar" and is beaten on the way to school by a limousine carrying the insensitive Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Wolf takes it, but Jason leaves his paper. Nobody will hear the truth this time, and dad tells him that he has lost his trust. <br /> <br /> Months later, Jason and his best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) see a preview of the movie for "Big Fat Liar", and head to Los Angeles to wreak havoc on Wolf's life, all to get a confession that he stole Jason's paper to make the movie. They even win the sympathy of some of Wolf's abused employees, including his assistant (Amanda Detmer), the former driver (Donald Faison), the movie star (Jaleel "Urkel" White, who plays himself) and the doubles coordinator (a very elderly Lee Majors). . <br /> <br /> Because "Big Fat Liar" does not have the edge by which his situation comedy "Malcolm in the Middle" is known, Muniz is easy to encourage but does not have much to work with. Similarly, for Bynes, who heads his own sketching show for Tracey Ullman on Nickelodeon. Giamatti gives him all the affection, whose eyes bulge and his cheeks shake with every mocking insult. <br /> <br /> The film breaks with just trying the high road, and it must be enjoyed by its target audience (especially since most of the high jinks occur in the Universal Studios lot). But here is a scratching: the message is that it is worth telling the truth. But did not we just see Jason get his reward by telling white lies throughout the movie? Well, at least there is no poop.
