I am a big fan of the legendary director Elia Kazan. His films often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses. Either the obsessive love in 'Splendor In the Grass, the poverty in "A tree grows in Brooklyn" or the racism in "Gentlemen's Agreement". While looking for other films made by Kazan, I came across a movie based on a novel by Arthur Miller. The movie called "Focus" is starring William H.Macy (who happens to be one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern. Treat anti-Semitism in a very realistic way. <br /> <br /> Macy's character seems to agree with fans in his neighborhood and at work, until it affects him personally. That's the key here ... the reason he acted was not because he knew he was wrong and wanted to take a position, he acted because he was now considered a stranger, and he began to experience the same looks, the same observations. , and the same brutally experienced by Mr. Finklestein (David Pamyers). <br /> <br /> The film is very well written and well acted. Meat Loaf does an amazing job of playing a ground bag! Both performances by Macy and Dern are exceptional! It is easier to go in life, instead of going against it. Sometimes, for people to take a position, things have to impact their lives, or the lives of their loved ones ... Only then will some find their moral compass.
