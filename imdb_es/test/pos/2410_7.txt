After a very disappointing Part 3, I kind of wondered if I should bother with The Next Karate Kid, while I could see why this saga would not continue, I still enjoyed The Next Karate Kid more than the second and third Karate Kid. films. While there are very unrealistic moments and situations, it was very nice and the story is catchy and warm. <br /> <br /> Hilary Swank, has this girl arrived or what? She plays a rebellious girl who has lost her parents in a car accident and when Miaugi "takes care of the children" for her opinion, she realizes that she has karate skills. He offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life. Now, of course, there's the guy who likes her and the bad guys who are pretty similar to the first Karate Kid, but I would recommend this one. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> 7/10
