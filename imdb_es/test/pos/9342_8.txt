Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983) has to be the best video ever made. Friend, you have Zombies, Gore and a catchy melody, what else can you ask for? John Landis mixed elements of The Night of the Living Dead and the American Werewolf in London and this video came out. What begins as a good evening for a young couple becomes literally a date from hell. You have zombies dancing, a werewolf with a funky jacket and Vincent Price "rapping". A great video for a song that everyone in the neighborhood scored. <br /> <br /> I have to give a high recommendation to this because it has to be the best music video ever made. There has not been another like it. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the "making of Thriller". The documentary has some "interesting" things in it.
