Functioning as a kind of midpoint between "Waiting for Guffman" and "A Mighty Wind", "Best in Show" portrays a dog show and the various people who take their canine friends to participate. Some are weird, others crazy, and others, but they all make the film good. Director Christopher Guest is particularly fun as gay Harlan Pepper, who tries to promote his dog. Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara and Bob Balaban also do great works (I can not imagine that they do not do great works, at least not in a Christopher Guest movie). As someone who has never attended a dog show, this movie is my main exhibition for them. Sure they look good.
