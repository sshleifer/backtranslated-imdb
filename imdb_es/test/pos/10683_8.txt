Fans of Gerry Anderson's productions will recognize various actors and vehicles of UFO (which was made after Doppelg채nger), as well as the sound effects of several Anderson series. The excellent music of Barry Gray (mostly exclusive to this film) adds to the feeling of familiarity. Just for these reasons, I think any Gerry Anderson fan would consider it worthwhile to get Doppelg채nger. <br /> <br /> Judged simply as a movie, it must be said that Doppelg채nger has flaws. It is known that there were major problems during the production, and I suspect that is why there is a thread of the plot that consumes a lot of time and ends abruptly and seems to have no relevance for the rest of the story. Presumably, time / budget constraints prevented relevance from emerging! <br /> <br /> In a distracted way, special effects range from extraordinarily good, better than any film from the 1960s I know, to disappointingly bad. <br /> <br /> However, even with these flaws, the main story of Doppelg채nger is well told and keeps the viewer (or, at least, this viewer) involved in everything. Maybe the end is not what one might expect from Anderson, but at the same time it's typical of Anderson, and it's certainly appropriate. To know what I mean, you'll have to take care of yourself. :)
