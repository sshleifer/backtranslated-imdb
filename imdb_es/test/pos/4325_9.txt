Marine, who gives Sayid the way to become Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, Desmond's partner in Hatch. Fate, uh? Yeah Right! <br /> <br /> I guess we'll all have to wait, to see what's going on in the lives of the people in awe on that strange island, in the middle of nowhere.
