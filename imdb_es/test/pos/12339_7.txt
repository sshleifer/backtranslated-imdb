A group of girls from the sisterhood of women make a new promise to spend the night in a spooky mausoleum. Of course, the recently deceased do not remain dead for long and all hell breaks loose. "One Dark Night" is a pleasant horror of the 80s with some gruesome corpses that are being controlled by the spirit of a dead Raymar psychic. no gore or nudity, but the atmosphere of a mausoleum is very strange. The acting is solid, but the script takes too much time to develop the characters until the final 20 minutes that Raymar finally comes out of his grave. The cinematography is impressive and The mausoleum is a great place for climatic events. The film takes so long to get going and this is its main defect.7 out of 10.
