Saltmen is a long film for its genre and, often, the rhythm is much slower than expected by the Western public. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed it both in terms of interesting topics and in the magnificent images that this film contains. Some of the landscapes are really impressive, and there is enough interest so that most can survive Grasshoppers with minimal use of fast forward. <br /> <br />
