One of the best of all time. Direction, photography, an exciting and dramatic story, a wonderful soundtrack and, above all, the incredible credibility of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, the best and most underestimated actor "of less than 40 generations". After watching this movie, I suppose if there is someone who can not hesitate to kill another man, despite the ugly things he could have done.
