There are two ways to consider 'Head'. Either it's a dazzling and mind-blowing collage of music, old movie clips, psychedelia and comedy-style television comedy, or a less pretentious and messy plot. The truth is probably somewhere in between. It is also one of the best movies of all time. <br /> <br /> 'The Monkees' - Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Mike Nesmith - had just finished their successful series and wanted to make a movie. In collaboration with writer Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson, they created 'Head'. <br /> <br /> It begins at the opening ceremony of a bridge in San Francisco, where the Monkees gate breaks the proceedings. Mickey jumps over the safety railing, sinking hundreds of feet into the water. The sirens rescue him with the accompaniment of a superb composition by Jerry Goffin and Carole King called "The Porpoise Song" and visuals that make the end of Stargate's "2001" look monotonous in comparison. By now you will have disconnected with bewildered displeasure or you will be completely enthralled. <br /> <br /> Stranger events happen; Mickey uses a tank to destroy a Coca-Cola machine in the middle of the desert; The whole Italian army surrenders to him; the group is hired to play to play the dandruff in Victor Mature's hair for a television commercial; an overweight waitress insults the group, describing them as 'the gift of God for eight-year-olds'; A surprise birthday party for Mike is going badly; The group is absorbed by a vacuum cleaner and, to top it off, it is expelled inside a giant glass tank. <br /> <br /> You will hate this or you will love it. I found a refreshing change from the senseless pop musical of the variety 'Let's make the show here'. The songs are good too; 'Daddy's Song' is beautifully choreographed by Toni Basil (who will then appear on Rafelson's 'Easy Rider' show) and presents a wonderful edition, with Davy's clothes changing color at lightning speed. 'The We Go Along' is a charming number from Goffin & King whose accompanying images carry a strong environmental message. <br /> <br /> Frank Zappa, Annette Funicello are just two of the guest stars that appear. Did Victor Mature read the script before agreeing to do this, one wonders? However, it is very funny. <br /> <br /> So crazy, there has to be a real genius behind that, 'Head' is a little gem of the 60s and it's worth going back to visit it again and again. Too bad he did not find an audience at that time. If only 'Spiceworld' would have been like that!
