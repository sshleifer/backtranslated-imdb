The Merchant of Venice 8/10 <br /> <br /> (This review assumes a basic knowledge of the story and, therefore, may be thought to contain spoilers for anyone unfamiliar with the plot). <br /> <br /> Like a film version of Shakespeare's famous play, Merchant of Venice does what few adaptations have done since Macbeth, a bit rough of Polanski: takes the spirit of the work and makes it manifest not only, but better than the work alone. achieve. <br /> <br /> The director of Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson, has argued that when adapting a book or a work there are three options: try to replicate the original in the most perfect way possible, use the original idea as a inspiration but take full license for the film change, or (the one he prefers) adheres to the original as much as a viable film ally, but makes the necessary changes to the film and remains true to the intention or spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> In Macbeth, Polanski used the rain-soaked beaches and the realistic rapes and murders to convey the bloody and horrible period in which the work was developed, which reminds us of the horrible context in which the characters commit such evils. Recommended decisions. It differs from (say) the Branagh Village, which reached new heights of faithful delivery, but otherwise offered few novelties. Macbeth, on the other hand, perhaps allowed the new audiences of Shakespeare to appreciate something of the fullness of the drama without an exhaustive study; similarly, more familiar audiences may find a depth greater than what one-stage performance could achieve without help. This interpretation plays a vital role if audiences are fully involved, not only intellectually but also emotionally, with the points that Shakespeare wanted to make. <br /> <br /> Radford's Merford adaptation of Venice does just that. Critical moral dilemmas related to religious fanaticism or the fulfillment of promises are required and, with a minimum disorder of the holy tome of Bard, faithfully transmit them within the spirit of the original story. <br /> <br /> The first of these, religious fanaticism, gives meaning to Shylock's extravagant behavior. We see the Jews of the time relegated to a walled ghetto, they are only allowed to leave if they wear a red identification cap. If you are not allowed to own property, one of the few ways in which you can make a living is through the loan of money. This makes them useful for their Christian oppressors and at the same time the object of their defamation. The idea behind (both the old and the new testament) of the biblical prohibitions against usury probably derives from not making a profit by helping friends. Christian fanatics extend this to curse those who spit (we see Shylock not only spit, but also other Jews thrown into the waterways for sport, in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening). <br /> <br /> The actuality of the film is curious, since the fanaticism of right-wing Christianity (as embodied by the Americans following Bush) has taken a complete turn, as they are now the main supporters of Zionism , and Jewish political leaders sting their Palestinians. neighbors as much as Shylock tries to bite Antonio (once he thinks the law gives him the power to do it). Psychology is self-evident: kicking a dog repeatedly and it will become cruel. The circle continues easily as the victims of oppression themselves easily lose their sense of moral values ​​and become oppressors. <br /> <br /> The strict play of hands that the disguised Portia uses to save Antonio has some merit, both as an intelligent interpretation of the unsophisticated law that the Venetians of the work lament and also as a moral indicator. Shylock can "have his pound of meat" according to his contract, but he may not have blood. An easy analogy could be made with regard to war and terrorism: it is much easier to justify fighting between combatants or attacking evildoers if soldiers or criminals are the only victims, when there is massive collateral damage, such as when innocent citizens, including women and children, die to hundreds, the arguments of the warmongers (whether the warmongers are Israeli, Palestinian or American) have much less popular support. <br /> <br /> For a long time there has been a lot of discussion about whether Shakespeare was being anti-Semitic in this story. One wonders if he had to adapt the ending for a mostly Christian audience that had little dealings with the Jews. Far from teaching him a greater good, the end imposes Christianity and humiliation on Shylock, a course that probably perpetuates repressed resentment. Both fields look just as bad, one simply has more power than the other. The slight improvement of the sentence simply gives the Christian judges a better public image, or like Bassanio so sharply (he observes when he chooses the coffins and solves the riddles to win Portia's hand): <br /> <br / > In religion, Damn it! error, but a sober eyebrow He will bless it and approve it with a text, Hide the rudeness with a just ornament? There is no such simple vice, but it assumes some mark of virtue in its external parts. <br /> <br /> Of course, intolerance applies to organized religion (rather than to spirituality), especially when it is organized for political purposes, but one that easily encourages ordinary people and God fearing that They do not have the habit of dividing hairs. The kindness, the mercy ('Chesed' in Judaism) that is so fundamental to true Christianity, is something that is also practiced to a wonderful degree in Judaism as in most creeds. The Jewish faith distinguishes between goodness and charity, the ways of practicing both effectively and the ways of making it part of our being rather than just an outside show. Both Shylock and Antonio are intolerant and use their respective beliefs to abuse those of another faith. While Shakespeare perhaps pointed out the gulf between the goodness prescribed by different religions and their absence in practice, the film version greatly reduces the window for interpretations of anti-Semitism and brings a greater degree of realism to psychological causes. <br /> <br /> The fulfillment of promises (men to their wives) is treated less, as are the comic elements inherent in the transvestism subplots. Bassanio, no matter how strong his love for Antonio is (are there homosexual elements there?) He can not make solid moral judgments by showing his gratitude to the 'judge', and that is why he breaks his promise (for which Portia forgives him, showing a triumphant character for women, not only as supremely intelligent and witty but also as more truly merciful and considerate of others than their intolerant male counterparts, including her husband.) <br /> <br /> Some of the performances are a bit forced, and there are too many regional Accents (in English), but in general, the Merchant of Venice offers a renewed and rewarding rework of Shakespeare. I enjoyed the performance, and also the beautiful soundtrack by Hayley Westenra and others, singing ballads written by both Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe. In general, Merchant of Venice is a not insignificant achievement of British cinematography (insofar as it can be said that any film has a particular nationality these days).
