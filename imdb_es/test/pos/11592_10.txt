This story about a man's 28 years of struggle for a death that would free him from his already dead body becomes a masterpiece to remember, thanks to a team of artists in a state of grace. Directed, written, edited and rated by Alejandro Amenabar, it touches you from the first images, and does not let your eyes and your heart rest until the last credits, thanks to Alejandro and a group of wonderful actors and actresses at their best. Bardem is an animal that acts: one of those few comedians who can make a masterpiece of almost any character, the supporting actresses are excellent in their roles and the story is told with such sensitivity that one laughs and cries in the same minute, like us. I used to do with the great old masterpieces. The best movie of the year in every way. 10/10
