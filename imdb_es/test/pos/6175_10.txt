My flight instructor "caught" this movie and now I wonder how the hell he was there for almost five years before he finally discovered it. If you have any love for flying, especially an attachment to World War II aircraft, this is something you can not miss, far superior to the pathetic "Pearl Harbor" and in rivalry with the famous "Battle of Britain" filmed More thirty years ago. There are times when you feel like you are flying, flying, literally, dodging your leader's carcasses as you move on Me 109 or He 111. <br /> <br /> As a historian, this film touched me deeply. Well, it is about the difficult situation endured by tens of thousands of Polish, Hungarian, Slovakian and Czech gallants who in 1939-1940 fled their countries of origin, arrived in England, fought with the greatest courage for the survival of Western civilization , and then they were. Openly abandoned by "us" after the war when they were arrested by the communists when they returned to their native lands. I stopped at the top of Monte Cassino in Italy and the cemetery moved me to tears for the Polish troops who assaulted that mountain that the British and the Americans could not take. I have also traveled to Prague (the most beautiful of the cities) and I have studied its history. His history of abandonment, I believe, should be a lesson for us, even today, about the obligations to the gallant allies. <br /> <br /> But let's go back to the movie. If you like to fly, look at this. If you are interested in the plane of World War II you will definitely see it. Undoubtedly, the most brutal, direct and appallingly quick aerial combat scenes ever played for the film. And yes, if you are even looking for a touching romance, there is also that with heartbreaking details. <br /> <br /> History Professor Bill Forstchen Co-owner of a replica of World War II "warbird" P-51 Mustang "Gloria Ana"
