Julie (Meg Tilly) is a high school girl of the type "goody two shoes" who, determined to prove something to herself, is allowed to submit to the rituals of "The Sisters", a small-scale gang presided over by boasting and returning to home. Queen Carol type (Robin Evans). The sisters propose that for the final test of Julie, spend the night in a mausoleum, preparing to take Julie to the wall, but not knowing that the psychic Raymar recently deceased and malicious is buried there and has plans to wreak havoc from beyond from the grave. . <br /> <br /> While this debut picture by Tom McLoughlin ("Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason lives" and "Sometimes they come back") is limited by his obviously low budget, it's what McLoughlin and his team they are able to do with that what counts. It is genuinely chilling, disturbing; I may have been very scared if I was less than 10 years old, and even at my current age, it has still reached me to a certain point. <br /> <br /> Some of the effects seem corny. , but decent-looking bodies and gore are created by Tom Burman, an experienced make-up artist who, although he tends to be overshadowed by more famous names like Winston, Baker and Bottin, has a good resume with other movies like "Cat People "(1982) and" The Beast Within "in his opinion. <br /> <br /> What I liked most was a real sense of foreboding and atmosphere, an aspect that is missing in some of the current horror films that are shown. in our multiplexers. <br /> <br /> Tilly is cute and attractive in her role, as she recently completed her first film job on "Tex" before joining this production. "One Dark Night" was completed some time before its release to theaters in 1983, where it really did decent business during its first weeks. The other actors do what they have to do well enough; familiar faces in the cast include veteran singer / actress / vocalist Elizabeth (also known as EG) Daily, Kevin Peter Hall, for once * not * playing some kind of creature character, but unfortunately it ends with very little time screen, and nothing less than Adam "Batman" West. Nancy, the director's wife, who would play Lizbeth in "Jason Lives," appears here as the space girl in front of the arcade. <br /> <br /> It's a decent level B horror entertainment, maybe too cheap for your ambitions. and maybe he's not that cunning (well, McLoughlin * was * just beginning), but it's definitely good for some chills. <br /> <br /> 7/10
