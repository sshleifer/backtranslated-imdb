It is always difficult to take a 450-page book to a three-hour movie. I read the book before and found that the BBC production deals with this difficulty in the best way possible. The qualities of the book have not been lost: the dense and animated representation of a family of smithy patches in London in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is raised, the characterization of different social groups by different forms to talk , the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film makes viewers look different in the same scenes when told first from Sue's point of view and then from Maud's point of view. The main actors do very well, and especially the growing love between the two women develops convincingly, with a first culmination in a scene of very tender love between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were willing to do and made to each other, because they still love each other. <br /> <br /> For each of her books, the author, Sarah Waters, has thoroughly researched what life was like in the 19th century. While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the terrible reality of women prisoners and the fashion of evocation of spirits, in Fingersmith represents the public ceremony of people hanging in London and the inhuman. Treatment of alleged or declared disturbed people in nursing homes based on reading sources and scientific research. This is transferred very well to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high degree of historical truth. I recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions and suspense.
