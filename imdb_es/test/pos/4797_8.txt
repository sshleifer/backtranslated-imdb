When you look at the best movies in Mexico, it is very likely that you will find that Photography was made by Gabriel Figueroa. It is recognized in the world as one of the best that has existed. His master control of the cameras gave an added value to the films he was part of. If you add to your participation, we add the address of Luis Bunuel, you will never find a pair of aces of this type anywhere else in the world. This story, Nazar√≠n, was written by the best writer in Spain, in addition to Miguel de Cervantes (Don Quixote de la Mancha). The story itself is magnificent: Nazarin, a priest who lives according to his beliefs, tries to live a very Christian life, but as always there are people who do not accept this. He wanders in many places preaching his Christianity, but finds, most of the time, people who do not accept him. But in addition to the splendid story, it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that Bunuel sends us throughout the image in scenes that make him tremble.
