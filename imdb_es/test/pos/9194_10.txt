As in "Les amants du Pont-Neuf", two strangers live a love story without concessions. The film consists of a great interesting conversation and many sweet moments. The best comes in a listening booth. They listen to a record together and from time to time they look at each other. They talk, they like each other. She suggests a change in their lives but he is out of hope. Realistic style about realistic (but) emotive dialogues. The work of a really mathematical scriptwriter for this movie. The director of Spanish novels, Jes√∫s Ponce, creates one of the most perfect galleries of the last year of Spanish cinema.
