I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the story and the development of the character. Fulci was a master at creating a horrible atmosphere with an ingenious camera work, a vivid cinematography and, yes, gore wonderfully explicit. <br /> <br /> This movie is no exception, compared to its later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House for the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis moves away from the supernatural and is based more on the suspense created by a classic that is amused among the lush hills of Italy. In some moments, the landscape recalls the precious folklore and then contrasts with the mud and blood-soaked terror enveloped by ruins in ruins. The gore in this movie is not as frequent and seems to be moderate compared to the most recent films by Fulci. However, splash and giallo fans will probably be satiated by some close-up shots of wounds and the last 5 minutes of the movie. <Br /> <br /> In general, a fantastic and mature film by one of our great Italian horror directors.
