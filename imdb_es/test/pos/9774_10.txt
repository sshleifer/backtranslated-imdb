This would have to be, by far, the best series I've ever seen. I observed vividly every Sunday night and bought the box set as soon as it was available. This is a timeless work written by a fantastic Australian that could relate to people of all ages, whether Australian or not, however, for those of us who are Australian, we really present the typical Australian icon. A must see 10/10
