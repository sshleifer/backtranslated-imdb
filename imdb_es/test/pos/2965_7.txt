To summarize this story in a few sentences: a teenager (Amy) uses her sexy body and the "supposed" virginity to attract a young man with problems (Matt) with a possible soccer scholarship to offer him a "Full Ride" outside of the city ​​. Come to discover that he has a good reputation and that he has slept with many soccer players in the past with the hope that they will offer him the same treatment. Both of these children have come from troubled and dysfunctional homes. The mothers of Matt, an alcoholic who shames him repeatedly in front of his friends, and Amy's mother had a bad reputation and got pregnant with Amy at a young age. Matt falls in love with Amy and tries to straighten his life for her. Final very predictable. The actress who plays "Amy" is actually 33 years trying to play a teenager!
