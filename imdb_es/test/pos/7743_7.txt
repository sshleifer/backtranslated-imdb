For many years I thought that I was the only person on the planet who had seen TEMPEST, and I am very happy to know that I am not the only person who discovered this person who sleeps somewhere in their tribulations in the movie. Depending on the work of Shakesperean, TEMPEST follows an architect (the late John Cassavettes, in one of his best performances), bored with his job and his marriage in ruins (with his real-life spouse, Row Rows), who decides get rid of everything, for example. To hell with the rat race and go to live on an island with his daughter (Molly Ringwald, in his film debut), and the new girlfriend Aretha (a luminous Susan Sarandon). Even though Paul Mazursky is credited as a director, Cassavettes' hand is throughout the film ... the long scenes filmed without cutting, the sense of improvisation in dialogue ..., the self-indulgent narrative style, this is definitely his show from the beginning. To finish, and if you're not a fan of your work, the movie will seem laboriously long and boring, but if you're a fan, there are rewards. Cassavettes is surrounded by a first class cast ... his scenes with Rowlands creak with intensity and his surprising chemistry with Sarandon is a stark contrast to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in his film debut and there is a stealing performance of scenes of Raul Julia as Kalibanos, the servant of Cassavettes on the island. Julia stops the show in a scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by Liza Minnelli singing "New York, New York". This movie is sad and tragic and fun and intense. Yes, it's a bit long and disconnected and it works too hard to be different (there's even a curtain at the end of the movie), but it never fails to draw the attention of those who like something a little different in their filmgoing
