<br /> <br /> `<br /> <br /> 5 years ago, if I were to see an Australian movie, I would expect to see crocodile hunters, war stories, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in In general, they are represented as imbeciles who live off the earth, say words like "cobber" and, in general, are the weakest classics. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the Australian film has evolved over the past two years and is currently being produced. Classics such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People. <br /> <br /> In this evolution of the film we also find Two Hands. <br /> <br /> Located at the Kings Cross in Sydney, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival at the edge of the city. Pando, played by Bryan Brown, is a Sydney Mob boss. He is the king of organized crime wearing thongs, carrying a chubby and helping his son with his origami. It is vicious, but real. As is your 'mob', hold the gun to someone's head in one scene and then play board games in the next. They are very respected and if they ask you for a favor, you do not say no. <br /> <br /> Enter Jimmy, played by Heath Ledger. Jimmy is your average Australian guy in his twenties. He is a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on the wrong side of anyone, so when Pando asks Jimmy to give him $ 10,000, Jimmy accepts. <br /> <br /> Things start to get exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal Money while Jimmy is on the beach. So now Jimmy has $ 10,000 in concept of a big mafia boss. From here we started to see all the stories interconnected with Jimmy and his attempt to rob a bank to recover the money, Jimmy and Alex (the love interest, played by Rose Byrne), Pando trying to find Jimmy and, of course, the Two Teens and their new found prosperity. The concept is deepened by the narrator, Jimmy's dead brother, Michael, who was killed by Pando and his gang years before. <br /> <br /> In the end, all the stories connected really well with a surprise twist to surprise and stun. the audience. I enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br />
