It's so refreshing to see a movie like this with a real mood and personality instead of just a bunch of CGI cartoons tricks. This is a great parody of terror that has genuine chills along with some really cool sets and performances. Their laughter is subtle, but abundant. Because there is very little or no CGI, there is no need to violently shake the camera to hide the effects of crap. This makes the film immensely visible compared to the other films of this genre that have appeared in the last decade. <br /> <br /> Much nicer than the big-budget remodeled garbage that Hollywood is launching today. <br /> <br /> See it.
