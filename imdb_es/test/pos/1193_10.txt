This is a cult movie for many reasons. First for the phenomenal success as a musical both on Broadway and in London, then as a musical film. The film is close to the work and part of the provocation of the work is no longer provocative twelve years later. The discourse against the war in Vietnam is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song that demonstrates how young people in these last years of the sixties managed to overthrow the political establishment. Milos Forman plays with some situations in the late 70s as narrow-minded justice, the egocentric umbilical justice of the rich or the little ones who have a single rank of power rather than the impotent. He also plays strongly with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity that he builds all the time. The movie is still nice and reflective. And, of course, it is a tremendous emotion to remember these years when we had the privilege, and that was not an opportunity to live them. On November 11, 1969, Nixon ordered a massive celebration for the armistice of 1918, which became the order for teachers at all levels to take their students to the celebration and the march, thus supporting the invasion of Cambodia that It was in full swing. And some dare to give lessons of democracy to foreign countries. I also remember the long campaign for the dismissal of Nixon in 1973-1974 that will eventually lead to his resignation and the oath of Gerald Ford, the first vice president and eventually president of the USA. UU He had not been elected, since he was appointed vice president by the Senate after Spiro Agnew had to resign to face trial, conviction and sentence for embezzlement. Of course, that makes us think today when in the year 2000, a president of the United States was elected not by the people, but by the Supreme Court, or by a war that was rejected by millions around the world from the beginning, and even before the start. and it was initiated against the best judgment of the United Nations and of three permanent members of the Security Council. And some speak of a new world order based on the respect of others. Modern Western man seems to have some problems to understand that the world is changing and that it has already changed widely and wisely. Modern Western man seems to be out of sync and needs special night classes to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority, and that the West is far from that majority, and that if the Soviet bloc could have understood that The market economy is not capitalism, but the market economy can be socialist or capitalist. The Berlin Wall would have fallen, but the other way around, and that China has learned that lesson wonderfully well and is at the foot of the wall they have. Climb to learn that your socialist market economy has to lead to political democracy, but they will, just as Vietnam was able to rebuild after thirty years of aggressive war and damage. In other words, hair is a perfect food for thought. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris 1 Sorbonne University and Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines
