I have a completely partial point of view, mainly because I live and enjoy the cultural lifestyle of the club. Being a DJ and a fan of clubs, I see honesty in this movie and I love it. If you do not know the culture of the club / rave, it will be a great foray into that culture for anyone who does not know it first-hand. The honest portrait of the emotions and the human problems in the part of Jip that I loved. The characters were well built and I really enjoyed this movie. I really do not enjoy the fact that you have to write ten lines on this website. I will write at least 6 or 7, but I think I can represent my point with less than ten. Here are some additional lines to make the gods of IMDb happy.
