I saw this movie on Buffalo's nightly television some 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it once again before ... well ... you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) "captures" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a failed attempt at kidnapping is absolutely hilarious. The interpretation of Charles Nelson Reilly of a dean of the neurotic university (?) Or the head of department is priceless. How many films can you name that are capable of illuminating the struggle of humanity for meaning and realization by making you laugh from beginning to end? This film reminds us that we are all in the same struggle regardless of class, race, sex or religion. And who can forget the scene of the owner of a suburban house on his hands and knees attacking those few small weeds that have dared to appear overnight in his perfectly manicured lawn!
