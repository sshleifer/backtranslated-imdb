"Pitch Black" was a total shock to me when I first saw it in 2000. In previous years, I was repeatedly disappointed in all science fiction movies (eg: STARSHIP TROOPERS) and I thought this movie would not. be different But to put it bluntly: this movie scared me ... in a good way. I did not realize that I was still afraid of the dark until I saw this movie; I must have buried my fear in the back of my subconscious when I was a child and rightly deserves to stay there. <br /> <br /> The alien creatures sent shivers down my spine; The individuals who designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to create something so impressive and grotesque. <br /> <br /> I loved how the writers gave each main character a story and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion. <br /> <br /> The gift of Riddick (Vin Diesel) to escape from any impossible situation. and to hold a big fight was to drop the jaw. At first, you consider him a coldly intelligent villain but in a few moments, you can see something human behind his animal side. But as soon as you discover it, he does something maliciously tortuous. It certainly keeps you guessing until the end. I did not know whether to despise him or admire him ... he's definitely a kind of love / hate character. <br /> <br /> Johns (Cole Hauser) was a perfect example of a character that shows a good front. but through the need for greed, it shows his true intentions and what he is willing to do to survive. John's ability to know which buttons to press and the right words to say do it as cunning as Riddick. <br /> <br /> Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, as Johns expressed so well, looked at her own Ass first before considering the consequences. But what she likes most about her is that she quickly realizes the errors of her ways and desperately tries to pay the penance, even when she endangers her life when others discard all human values ​​and head to the dark hills that they run. <br /> <br /> Jack (Rhiana Griffith) just wanted to have a hero and was the first of the whole group to find that hero in Riddick; Through the eye of a child, good can be seen through the dense clouds of evil. I thought I had no price when Jack shaved his head in the ode to Riddick; you know what they say: imitation is the best form of adulation. <br /> <br /> The magnet (Keith David), like Jack, has the ability to see good in any evil. He uses philosophy to take him through the difficulties he faces and when time permits, he regrets his losses rationally and then the soldiers. In a way, it served as a moral reinforcement for the survivors, although most of the characters acted as if they were not listening. <br /> <br /> The casting of this movie was positively perfect. Each actor shone brilliantly in his role and his talents combined wonderfully on the screen. <br /> <br /> This movie may have had a small budget, but the director's leadership and the actor's performances made the film work and allowed the audience to use his imagination instead of letting some scandalously expensive special effects do all work for them. This movie is a definitive science fiction classic. Look at it and judge (with an open mind) for yourself. It will be well worth it.
