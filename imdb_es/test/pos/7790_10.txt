Well, to begin with, Rajkumar Santoshi is not a comedy filmmaker, and this is really unfortunate because the only comedy film he has ever made is a masterpiece. This movie is really funny. Out loud, exaggerated in some scenes but still the dialogues really laugh at the riots and the characters really full of fun. The story in a simple daughter of a billionaire came to India to get married and two young people behind her, the story also has a twist with the connection of a Gangster. Amir playing an intelligent boy from the street Amar has played his role brilliantly and Salman played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection. Raveena has done well, but Karshima really becomes irritating in some sequences. But the real thief of show r Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor, enter the picture and automatically start laughing. In general, a movie so nice that you can not see it. Of times without getting bored.
