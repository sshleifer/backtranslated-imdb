The first time I saw this movie was in the eighth grade and I remember that it affected me deeply at that time. I saw again about a year ago (now I am 29) and I was still moved in a similar way. This is a great film that embodies the struggle of the "principle against pragmism". The character of Voight is the idealistic teacher who will not give in to any psychedelic inclination of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also epitomizes the struggle of how older people often resist change and, more specifically, cultural change. Often at the expense of children. When these battles finally come to a boil, Pat Conroy loses and pragmatism reigns triumphantly. Or does it? Children who have to leave are better off knowing, more exposed to the "real" world and to classical music. The other teacher at the school earned respect for him and learned a lot about himself. A great movie with a heartbreaking ending. I recommend that anyone who has enjoyed the movie read the book "Water is Wide" by Pat Conroy. It will stay with you!
