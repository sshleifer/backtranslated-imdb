"Five Fingers of Death" began the madness of the American kung fu movie, but I remember seeing it for the first time as "King Boxer" in Chinatown, New York, without the bad dubbing and few Americans. I also had the good fortune to see the premiere in the United States of "Five Fingers Of Death" in Times Square, New York. What a contrast it turned out to be ... the same movie but different audiences. <br /> <br /> In Chinatown, this movie took a more serious tone for the viewers. It was because of listening to the real voices of the actors (in Chinese) that made this film more credible. The theaters of Chinatown showed violent films of kung fu during years (the "Boxer From Shantung" of 1972 defeated them all), reason why the choreography of action and the history were the main attraction. The plots of rival schools were not yet used too much, so the story seemed fresh. All the great kung fu movies had wonderful and cowardly villains that you wanted to see and that FFoD also had them. The star, Lieh Lo, was a well-known actor in Chinese theaters. The majority Chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely. The buzz of the audience when leaving this movie gives me the final satisfaction. <br /> <br /> In Times Square, this movie was an action comedy ... probably unintentionally. I enjoyed it here too, but for different reasons. The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. From the beginning, the movie made you laugh. As soon as the audience heard those strange British accents from Chinese actors, the film became a violent and bloody caricature. Most American audiences saw this blood type in a horror movie, not in an action movie. The action sequences impacted the public. Unfortunately, film studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu film formula. <br /> <br /> I had a lot of fun watching this movie with an American audience but I enjoyed it much more Chinatown. Some movies can pass the test of time, but the dubbed version of FFoD can not. The original "King Boxer" is still nice ... a CLASSIC!
