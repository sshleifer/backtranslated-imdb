It is always good to see a film that teaches us about the history of Africa, since they are definitely very few. However, the film shows Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be equal to the old colonialist ... I felt it was difficult to sympathize with this type of leadership, but the film is like a tribute to man. There was very little content, explaining how the man grew up in the first place, and the whole context of Belgium "letting them go". Therefore, it is worth seeing, since the performance and photography are excellent, especially Mobutu himself. I just would have liked a better political analysis.
