"Thriller" is brilliant. It's a long video, but just brilliant. The song itself is ... excellent ... add Michael Jackson dancing and you have a golden Phenomenon. Of all the videos I've seen, this is the best. If you have not seen the video yet, I urge you ... <br /> <br /> The special effects are amazing for your moment ... everything from the transformation of the werewolf to the idea that these creepy zombies are rising slowly. their tombs are great ... amazingly grandiose, that's it. Vicent Price has its segment of trembling lines ... known simply as "rap" that Ola Ray does well as Michael's girl, and Michael JAckson himself ... dancing and singing (although not during the video itself) it has no equal ... <br /> <br /> 10/10.
