So well done Photography, sound, music and performances were the best. It's also a funny story that makes you smile with every scene: I loved it and I'm a 60-year-old heterosexual man. Each character seemed to fit his part into a shirt. It's the best performance I've seen of Ms. Capshaw: she's been in more movies than I thought, but it was a wonderful accomplishment. I guess it's an advantage to have Spielberg's money behind you, which allows you a big budget and all the best that money can buy technically. Two of the cast members have successful television television shows of their own now, it's easy to see why. Tom Selleck does his usual good job.
