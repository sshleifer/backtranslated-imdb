This film made by the NFBC was made in honor of the years of the Montreal Canadians' dynasty in the 50s, 60s and 70s. My fifth grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I've been a fan of Canadians for 29 of my 30 years of life. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this movie a 117. All hockey fans should see this, as I hope it will be placed in the Toronto Hockey Hall of Fame and shown at the Bell Center in Montreal or here in Edmonton in Rexall Place. Watch this movie with your family, it's a great movie. I also recommend the book in both French and English. Go Habs Go.
