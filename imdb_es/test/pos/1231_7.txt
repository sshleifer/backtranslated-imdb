Travis (James Franco) is a young man who travels on a train for business reasons (we assume) that leaves his beloved phone. He is picked up by a prostitute, Terri (Rachel Miner), and when he goes to his city to pick her up, a series of events happens that will surely remain with him forever. <br /> <br /> Both characters have barriers that have been placed to defend themselves against communication. But despite their facades, it is obvious that both are eager to bring them down. In total there are about 30 spoken lines, but since James Franco and Rachel Miner use their faces, it is better to turn off the volume, the words are not necessary. A scene to keep in mind is Terri looking at herself in the mirror. You can just feel his desperation permeating the room. <br /> <br /> But, the movie is not perfect. It is recorded mainly with handheld cameras, which distracts a bit. Mainly due to the performance of Mr. Franco and Miner and photography, the flaws of the script do not stand out as much. However, sometimes it seems that the story does not really know where it wants to go. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the kind of movie that really stays with you long after you saw it. An hour after having seen it, you are still a "what if" in the name of certain characters. It is not impeccable, but still leaves you wanting more, wishing that they were at least 4 times longer.
