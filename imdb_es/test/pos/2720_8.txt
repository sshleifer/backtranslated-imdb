Exquisite!! in simple words ... both Aparna Sen and Konkona Sen seem to understand each other quite well or perhaps both are too good. This could be her best acting actress and the best of Aparna as a director. Yes, maybe better than Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, the older sister of Mithi (Konkona Sen). Shabana Azmi did her best with the Anjali character, as she had to play a strong, responsible and arrogant role for an older sister who had full responsibility for her family. Aparna Sen has the beautiful character of Anjali, a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life, her love for her family. <br /> <br /> Mithi's behavior was not at all juvenile, because you can expect this from most Indian Directors for this role. It seems that much research has been done to understand the role of Mithi, a schizophrenic. When sometimes Mithi is a normal, sweet girl who goes to college, she also scares you when she shows up sick ... both sides have been beautifully judged and played ... believe me, she sometimes reminds you of the girl in the Exorcist ... not though that's scary ... Overall ... Wonderful work by Aparna Sen, Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi ...
