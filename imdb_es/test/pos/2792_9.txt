My wife and I watched this wonderful movie tonight because we will see Russian Dolls tomorrow and the first one is important to watch before the second one. <br /> <br /> We both loved the Spaniah apartment and we will enjoy following some of the characters. through the first years of their lives, now in St. Pertersburg, Russia. We both identified slightly with the approximate frame of the story because we were students, Florence Italy for us, so the script was not completely foreign to our early life. Our life was considerably different, but as with this film, whenever you bring together young people who go through the same hoops of life as any other person in the developed world, they will experience the same situations in life. <br /> <br /> The collection of people and the personal difficulties they faced were universal and that is where the beauty of this film lies and probably the sequence that I will see tomorrow. As I wrote, both the characters and these situations are familiar to all of us and, therefore, we can enjoy living their lives for a while. This must be one of the great strengths of the film: allowing the viewer to indirectly experience the emotional disturbances of the people involved and, however, remain aloof. The viewer can, through that distance, laugh, thinking: "I would not have done something so foolish" or "I would have avoided that trap". Maybe that's why we go to the movies.
