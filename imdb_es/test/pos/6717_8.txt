LIFEFORCE was one of the biggest failures of Cannon Films. He received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help the career of director Tobe Hooper in the wake of the Spielberg / POLTERGEIST controversy. All this is unfortunate, because LIFEFORCE is really a great movie. It is extremely entertaining, moving at an accelerated pace and presents some of the most incredibly exaggerated modes of direction, production, performances and special effects that have exploded on the screen. It must have seemed strange on paper: the producers of THE DELTA FORCE, the screenwriter of ALIEN, the director of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, the composer of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, the magicians of the special effects of STAR WARS ... The audiences were not ready for this demented exercise in rarity. <br /> <br /> What more do you want? We have an alien spaceship full of giant bats! We have a sexy and naked space vampire sucking the souls of people! We have bodies that explode! We have zombies! We have possession! We have an interrogation of S & M! We have the whole city of London on fire! It's Dracula meets THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD meets with QUARTERMASS and THE PIT meets with EARTHQUAKE. It is very possible that it is the most outrageous epic horror / science fiction / comedy / action / disaster / erotic / apocalyptic song that has been unleashed, that is, if there is any other. <br /> <br /> Try watching this movie while chemically altering. Maybe then you will understand. An authentic experience, and one of the most underestimated films by director Tobe Hooper. Maybe one day, find your audience.
