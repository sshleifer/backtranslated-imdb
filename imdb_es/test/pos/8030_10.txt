I am a big fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best movies. The Assignment is based on a true story, which has been graced a bit for the big screen, and really takes you on a fun ride. The film has a great cast, starring Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. <br /> <br /> Naval officer Quinn is reluctantly recruited by Sutherland after a chance encounter with Kingsley, who believes Quinn is the famous terrorist Carlos Carlos. Jackal. Because Quinn looks a lot like Carlos, Sutherland does not stop at anything to recruit him because Sutherland is obsessed with the capture or death of the terrorist. <br /> <br /> The training sequences are impressive. Kingsley and Sutherland really put Quinn to the test, as they have to withstand attacks from remote-controlled snowmobiles, from eating the same food every day to being drugged with a hallucinogen. He even has to learn to make love to a woman like Carlos would. <br /> <br /> The movie has some great action scenes with Quinn eluding the allies because they believe he is Carlos and in his final mission when he is. to kill the jackal. Throughout the film, Quinn must struggle with the new personality she has achieved in front of her. Will he still be as ruthless and free as Carlos or will he return once again to his life as a good husband and father? <br /> <br /> If you like the spy genre, this is a must. The action is used only to boost the story of this thriller; There are no free explosions or fight scenes. Rating 10 out of 10 stars.
