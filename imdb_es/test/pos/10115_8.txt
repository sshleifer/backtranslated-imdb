The radio will make you laugh, cry, feel. This story based on a true story is the perfect movie for a couple to see. There is enough for both. Cuba Gooding Jr.portra the character of the title to perfection. His performance is worthy of a nomination to the academy prize. The compassion of the film is obvious. The film evokes many emotions. I sincerely enjoyed this movie.
