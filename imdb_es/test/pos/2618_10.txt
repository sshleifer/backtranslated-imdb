Right in the hospital scene with Holly and Shannon was done brilliantly, starts with Piper On A stretcher that looks very hurt, the doctors take her to a resuscitation room and move her from the stretcher to a bed and Prue holds her hand From that point on it is obvious that Piper has a lot of trouble breathing and her lungs are failing, as she turns to beg Prue not to stay by her side. She does not leave, I love you and then her pulse drops and she enters. cardiac arrest and the monitor shows a clear flat line and the nurses go into trauma mode and bring a defibrillator Prue Steps from the bed in horror when the doctors desperately try to surprise the heart of their dying sisters but there is no response and she does not respond pronounce tragically dead good big scene well done girls
