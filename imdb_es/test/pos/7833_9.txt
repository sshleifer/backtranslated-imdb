The motto in the box says: "100 PASSENGERS TREATED ... 3,000 VENOMOUS VENOMS!" You almost have to admire that degree of "no chance in hell that we will ever fulfill this promise." I could admire the hucksterism of The Asylum if they made movies that, well, you know, they were good or, at least, they were worth it. Haha, and that's what I like about these movies. They are garbage. You put them in a toilet and then you throw them away. It's worth the price if you're a fan of the cheesy movies. It can become a cult classic among many fans. The bloody scenes are effective, there's not much I can say, it's a Z movie that parodies the new movie with Samuel L. Jackson, hell, it might be better, who knows!
