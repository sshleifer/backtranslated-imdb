If you do not like Mel Brooks, you will not like this movie. That's a fact. I do not know why someone would not like their movies, but for those who can not see the light, just avoid them. <br /> <br /> Everyone else: this is a classic. The whole cast is perfect: Carey Elwes is a brilliant, intelligent, British Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck acts appropriately as Marion, Richard Lewis is his usual, distracted and annoying, Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of nervousness and violence as "Mervyn "The Sheriff of Rottingham, and Dave Chapelle, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield and the sadly underutilized Matthew Poretta are the perfect Merry Men. <br /> <br /> There are similarities with Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles ... and all the other Mel Brooks movie. But why would you want to change your style when it works so well? The references of pop culture in this film are old enough to be fun again ... at least from the sight of a 16 year old. It is a complete and complete parody, every second is a work to laugh. Some of them do not work, but most do, and well. I discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time I saw the movie! <br /> <br /> Of course, if you do not like this style, you will not like to be bothered by constant visual and verbal gags. This is not an Academy Award winner, it's Mel Brooks. You know what it is when you get into that. If you want a non-stop laugh, surprisingly well-developed characters and phrases that last a lifetime, look at this.
