Certainly, it's not a great show, but it's better than most other situation comedies right now. Remember to programs like Married With Children and Roseanne when they go to places that are not traditionally treated in comedies. Sometimes it's funny, even if you ignore the hints of laughter, but it's not very funny. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters are quite funny (the gay friend) and some of the others. This is also one of the few programs where the soliloquy of the characters (sorry for the chewed spelling) is actually effective and fun. <br /> <br /> Is this an All-in-the-Family or Seinfeld-type program? Absolutely not. However, it is certainly better than a program like 'Til Deat (probably the worst TV show of any kind at this time). <br /> <br /> Oh, and the mom is not too bad to see and the character of Hilary is a little hottie
