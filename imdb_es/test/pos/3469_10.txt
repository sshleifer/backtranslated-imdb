Until I saw this movie, "life is beautiful" was my favorite movie of all time. This movie is everything a great movie should be. Great script, unparalleled performance and direction that does not approach the sentimentality that the subject tempts or leaves without the emotional impact it demands. This film contains the flavor that could not come from Hollywood and lacks the pretension that would come from France. A wonderful movie even above the caliber that I have come to expect when I see the logo of handmade movies appear. I do not need to go into details, since the previous publications cover everything why this film should be seen by everyone on this planet.
