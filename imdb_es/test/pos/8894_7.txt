Owen loves his mom ... only he would love her better six feet deep in this dark and cheerful comedy that both stars and is directed by Danny DeVito, with admirable assists from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the lead role. <br /> <br /> "Throw Momma From The Train" is a great comedy, even if it's not a great movie. It is too shallow in parts, and the end feels less organic than stuck. But most of the time it's a journey of great skill, since Crystal and DeVito use great chemistry on the screen as they work on their own separate comics and take on the essence of being a troubled writer (DeVito is avid but not talented; Crystal is blocked and is bitter). <br /> <br /> Professor Donner of Crystal believes that his ex-wife stole his book (the unfortunately titled "Hot Fire") and can not write more than the opening line of his next book, which is not easy. She teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrities, including a middle-aged woman who writes Tom Clancy fiction but does not know what the submarine captain is about; and a tapestry salesman who wants to write the story of his life. Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughs per minute on the screen, a weirdo who uses ascot's skill and who sees literature as an excuse to write his work: "100 girls I'd like for the pig " <br /> <br /> Then there is Owen Lift, from DeVito, who calls himself the "star pupil" of Professor Donner even though the teacher will not read his work in class. Owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie, a man-boy of about 30 who lives with his dominant mother, Anne Ramsey, who calls him "lardass" and other endearing feelings. In any other film, we were asked to feel sorry for Owen, but "Lance Momma From The Train" accumulates the cruelties of life in this sad bag for laughter and hopes that we will move on. That is one of the main reasons why this movie probably loses a lot of people. <br /> <br /> For those of us who enjoy the humor of this character, even identifying with him, and take the rest of what we see here as a lark, it is not such a great stretch to go along with the tactics more Big guy who takes this comedy, and asks us to watch it with fun as Owen gets ready to help Professor Donner in a plan to kill his mother. Actually, he first goes to Hawaii to kill Donner's hated ex, then tells the professor that it is his turn to kill Mrs. Lift, "trading murders" as seen in Hitchcock's "Strangers On A Train". <br /> <br /> As DeVito, who is a director, not only complements the performances of his actors with the setting that puts the accent on the dialogue, but makes some bold visual statements, throwing fragments of fun unreality to keep to the alert public (and far from taking things too seriously). .) <br /> <br /> Writer Stu Silver is also helping things, he keeps laughing with his employer. "You have rats the size of Oldsmobiles here." "She is not a woman ... She is the Terminator." "A little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper." Those are all of Crystal's words, but some of the funniest lines, which work only in context but absolutely kill, are those of DeVito and Ramsey. Apparently, Silver never wrote another script after this, according to the IMDb, and that's a shame, because he had a real talent for it. <br /> <br /> The best scene in this film, when Crystal meets Ramsey, was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical presentation of 'attraction in motion', the only time I've seen a film promoted from that way. Owen introduces the teacher to his mother as "Primo Patty", and when Mom says he does not have a Primo Patty, Owen's panic loses him. "You lied to me," he yells, hitting the teacher's forehead with a frying pan. <br /> <br /> Of course, actually the teacher would not let something witty from the floor, but 'Launch Momma From The Train' works effectively at those times, when it plays its Looney Tunes environment for all its value . DeVito has not disappeared from the movies, of course, but it's a mystery why he has not followed the direction promise of this movie. Maybe it's because, as demonstrated by 'Throw Momma From The Train's' main lack of success, your type of vision is not for everyone. That is very bad for those of us who can see this again and again, and that we like.
