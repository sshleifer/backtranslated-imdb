After all these years, I am amazed at why Julie Brown (West Coast) is not a household name or a very famous comic star. She is one of the funniest females on the planet. In this parody, she confronts Madonna, which is one of her favorite goals. She is Medusa, a very successful singer, like Madonna, who also had the documentary "Truth or Dare". Julie Brown parodies Madonna as Medusa, who came from Wisconsin, the land of dairy products and beer. I remember the segment where he went to Wisconsin to visit his family and a grave. I do not remember if it was a father or his pet. I remember someone saying that Medusa did not do anything original. She was copying others. I must say that I hope this fake documentary is available on DVD somewhere. Julie Brown was at her best, mocking and deceiving others.
