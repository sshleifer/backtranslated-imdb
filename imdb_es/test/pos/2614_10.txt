This was! I would never have expected the ending if I had not known what was going on behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hated was that Shannon had kicked himself out and not Alyssa. I hate her, I would prefer her character to die, than Shannon's. what was funny is that in the scene where Piper is dying in the hospital bed and Prue was crying at her side, I started crying too hahaha. At the time it was aired, I was about 10 years old and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning, so I told myself that if she dies, I will not see the show anymore! lol <br /> <br /> then all the flashback in time was a shock and really good. I also blame Pheobe for Prue's death because, instead of being with her sisters, she had to be a bitch and be with her demon boyfriend. <br /> <br /> but I think this episode will be now and forever one of my favorites and a CHRMED classic. <br /> <br /> ALWAYS ENCHANTED! Be blessed!
