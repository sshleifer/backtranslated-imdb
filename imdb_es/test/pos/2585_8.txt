My roommate and I got free tickets for a Pre Screening. I suppose you would call it in Atlanta, GA, at Atlantic Station. Upon entering I expected something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily exaggerated, etc. But the movie is much more than that. It is a story of two people helping each other. It is not exaggerated, and the film is done in a careful balance so as not to make you tremble or to say that it is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> He's armed really well and does not take himself too seriously. That is the beauty of that. If he tried to take himself seriously, he would have failed miserably, but instead it will be transmitted through humor (something unintentional) and some amazing performance by Ricci. Although Timberlake fails miserably in his role, the film is good enough for you to put that aside. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie, if it were not for another reason other than the fact that it is something different. to experience.
