Alright guys, this is the deal with this movie. It is not the best, but for all of you, the children of the 80s, will bring good memories of your childhood. Personally, I love this movie. I still love the rainbow brite and the care bears. So, in my opinion, if you are not a child now or you were a child who loved and / or loves the rainbow brite, you will not like this movie.
