For me, "Anatomie" is undoubtedly one of the best movies I've seen. I do not think that "Anatomie" was mainly a horror movie, but a film that questioned the ethics of science. If you see it with that in mind, it becomes a really good movie. The only annoying thing was the horrible voice dubbing for the English version. How can you expect a non-German person to listen to these unbearable German accents for two hours? Let native English speakers speak or use subtitles instead!
