A brief history of time. The cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating, the thoughts provoke and the man ... brilliant. However, it cost me a lot to enjoy this documentary. <br /> <br /> The way in which family members and teachers are interviewed feels so unnatural. These members were interviewed in specifically built ensembles and were directed uncomfortably. For the most part, their accounts were highly acted and strongly directed. The non-inclusion (deliberate) of the questions asked manipulates the information given in a very hard and impersonal format. <br /> <br /> I do not know who are responsible for the interview, but they did an awful job and that took away the visual experience. <br /> <br /> In general, it is still a fascinating documentary that is worth seeing. , even if only for the interesting concepts presented.
