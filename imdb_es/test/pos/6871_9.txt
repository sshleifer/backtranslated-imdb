One night, on Tom Snyder's "Tomorrow" show, I watched Tom ask his guest Henry Morgan what he considered "perfect." Morgan replied: "Anything with Glenda Jackson." And although I do not consider this film to be perfect, it confirms that idea very well. I was about to use the clich√© that Hollywood no longer made images like this, but then I saw "Up in the Air", another smart movie about 2 people over 35 who fall in love. However, that is where the similarities end. "Calls to the house" is simply fun to see 2 professionals like Matthau and Jackson, who are affected and seem completely natural while they are at it. I saw this movie in the theater in 1978 (at the age of 18) and it took another 20 years to get all the jokes. Any movie that could make tennis player Bill Tilden a line punch, and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain would not play too well in the megaplex these days. Another thought: the original theatrical release presented a montage of "walking on the beach / falling in love", with the melody of the Beatles / George Harrison, "Something". It seemed a bit forced at that time, but since then that song was changed to a generic musical signal by Henry Mancini for its later release of video and cable. Pity, because that scene is just there now, another victim of the Hell music license.
