Having seen the movie years ago and disappointed by its potential waste, when I heard it was turning into a television series, I absolutely refused to see it. My best friend became a rabid fan immediately, and knowing my love for horror movies, I could not believe I would not see a single episode. I told him that the movie had marked me for life as far as BUFFY was concerned, and he told me to forget that the movie even existed. He insisted that I try two episodes: "Once More With Feeling" and this one. <br /> <br /> Both are the reason why today I am a BUFFY fanatic. He was right: I was hooked immediately. I have never seen a program with the guts to dare to try an episode that has almost no dialogue, and nothing else could have been achieved with the touch and pure creativity of BUFFY. I think X FILES could have gotten away with it if they had thought about it first, but I'm glad BUFFY did it. <br /> <br /> It is a credit to all involved that you are fascinated during the entire hour, sometimes hanging on the edge of your seat. And when it was over, I longed to know more about each character. So I went out and bought the Season One box set. And the rest is history ... <br /> <br /> I guarantee that if you've never seen it, you'll want to see more if you make this episode your first episode. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I do not give it 10 out of 10 is because I book that score for "Once More ..."
