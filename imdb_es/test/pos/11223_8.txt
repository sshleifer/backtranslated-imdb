At first glance, a film like Northfork, a city that will be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters that are sent to evacuate the other inhabitants of the city, could be just a normal movie. As we will soon find a remaining priest caring for a sick child, a greedy owner of a land, we could prepare ourselves for a simple story that we could all easily digest. However, when you first enter this movie, you notice the incredible picture on a large open screen and a scene in which you see a church room where you lose a wall that opens onto the pastures and a panoramic view of the mountains with cattle grazing. It soon becomes clear that after this scene and some of the cities of the villages, it is not an ordinary film or an ordinary story, it is something very special and unique. <br /> <br /> At first glance, things are not. so clear, but the cinematography and the landscape that the viewer witnesses are impressive, and the characters that inhabit this small area that will soon become extinct are simply amazing. It's what can bring you closer to this qwerky movie, or you get bored sitting there waiting for something to happen. <br /> <br /> Films of spiritual and dreamlike qualities, give you a slow and methodical approach that I'm sure bores some viewers, but if you're patient with that and see the big picture, the movie is great witness. <br /> <br /> Rating 8 out of 10
