I am a Maharashtrian, a teenager who lives in the 21st century, and it is obvious that I do not even like Bollywood, much less the Marathi movies. However, when I saw Shwaas, it left me with a unique feeling, which only an extremely effective film is capable of generating. <br /> <br /> It is a fact that, like most Indian films, the film has its true and complete effect only if it is seen in its original language. Much of the emotion and meaning of the film are embedded in their Marathi dialogues, which, however hard they try, can not be effectively translated into English. <br /> <br /> Shwaas explores, with a complex detail, the relationship between a grandfather and a child. And it does complete justice to this strong bond. Dialogues like "mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe" (My parsha is also one in a million) enhance the emotion. Anyone who has closely observed the grandparent-child relationship can relate to the situation depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> In general, it is definitely worth seeing. It is a film that has left a profound effect on me. I will surely recommend it to anyone!
