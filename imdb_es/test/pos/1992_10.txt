David Cronenberg's 'eXistenZ' is a well-designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture that is connected to technology that can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The film shocks the public with its replacement of mechanical technology by an organic and metabolic. In this context, technology is capable of being part of the human body. After playing the virtual reality game of 'eXistenZ', the real world feels like a game and, as a result, human behavior changes to apply violent impulses even when the game ends. In eXistenZ, technology has evolved from machinery to biological organisms that connect directly to the human nervous system; an idea that reflects the belief of Marshall McLuhan, who is a well-known media theorist, that computers are extensions of human consciousness. Since the telephone is an extension of the ear, television is an extension of the eye, the telegram is an extension of the central nervous system. High-tech virtual reality is an extension of human consciousness. In eXistenZ, technology is biological and, therefore, more human than in our world. But as technology becomes organic, humans become more mechanical and, therefore, less free, unable to resist their play impulses. eXistenZ is a simulation of virtual reality of the existence of man. Jean Baudrillard describes a society mediated in his book Simulacra and Simulation, in which all the power to act has been transformed to appear. The world has passed to a pure simulation of itself. In eXistenZ it is obvious to see the society mediated by Baudrillard with the themes of the invasion of the body, the loss of control and the transformation of the I in another. <br /> <br /> While you are in the eXistenZ, consciousness slowly. It replaces with another identity, its role in the game, which is a reflection of the subconscious of each individual's real life. As you gain control of your hyperreal life step by step, the aura of your real life disappears. For Baudrillard, "simulations or simulations have become hyperrealistic, more than real". Our hyperreality, like Cronenberg's computer simulation world, "now feels and, for all intents and purposes, is more real than what we call the real world." (Baudrillard) The purpose of the game that can basically be called "experience" is quite metaphorical. Because you can not even know what the experience is unless you experience it. As the existentialists say, life without an exact explanation is absurd, the game of eXistenZ is also absurd. Cronenberg, ironically, reflects the absurdity of our lives. For example, in the game, the other roles stop unless you ask them a preprogrammed question. And when you put your fun-looking state without purpose in representing our lives, the exposed absurdity really surprises. <br /> <br /> Is the theme of the game to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphorical question creates anguish about the people who play eXistenZ. They have no doubts about their existence, however, they do not know the underlying reason for their existence. The essence. <br /> <br /> Existentialists have argued that human beings do not have a fixed nature, or essence, as other animals and plants do; Every human being makes decisions that create their own nature. In the formulation of the twentieth-century French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence. The choice is, therefore, fundamental to human existence, and is inescapable; Even the refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice implies commitment and responsibility. "Because individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and the responsibility to follow their commitment wherever they take it." Maybe I should mention, 'eXistenZ' also deals with the concept of freedom of choice. You achieve your final role in the game by making the right decisions. If not, the game becomes irreverent and boring. Then, you begin to question the game, your existence instead of your essence. Suddenly you become schiappially alianated from the game and realize your position out of the game. Well, as a last word, eXistenZ is a well-designed inverse simulation of life, therefore existentialism. <br /> <br />
