The Kid is a very good family movie about an image consultant, Russ Duritz, who has a lot of money, a good job, a good house, etc. The only problem is that he does not have a great social life as no one seems. Like him, he is not always very nice. One day, although things are about to change when a version of himself eight years old appears magically. This gives Russ a second chance to do things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and gives a very good performance. The Kid is a pleasant and moving movie for everyone.
