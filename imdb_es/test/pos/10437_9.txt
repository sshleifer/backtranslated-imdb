I saw this movie for the first time recently. If you ask me, you do not get the credit you deserve. It's a bit like American Pie meets Fast Times at Ridgemont High but with more depth. Handles the same problems as the two movies, but in a way that holds something true. The end is sad, but that's the way life is. I think everyone should see it. I have it in the form of a DVD, and it took me a long time to find it too. That should say something, heh, and another thing that I will add is that it is quite difficult to find the soundtrack. I think they stopped him, but the soundtrack of this movie is incredible. It has songs by artists like The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and Sunshine Band, and many more.
