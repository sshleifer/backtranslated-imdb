This production was pretty good. The usual fabulous scenery, interesting characters, peculiar. It was so strange not to have Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon, and the office / residence of Poirot, so prominently featured in the original mysteries of PBS / BBC. <br /> <br /> In the original series, both took place in the office. Hastings reads the newspaper, while Poirot "exercises his little gray cells". Miss Lemon participates when necessary. <br /> <br /> Poirot without the captain. Hastings would be like Holmes without Watson ... he can certainly solve the crime, but it's not that interesting. <br /> <br /> And what would be a mystery of Poirot without Hastings, with his impeccable manners, falling in love with a beautiful and unattainable woman?
