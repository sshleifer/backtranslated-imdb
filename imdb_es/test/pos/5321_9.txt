I noticed that the official review of IMDb refers to Leland as a sociopath. I believe that this diagnosis is manifest and deeply incorrect. <br /> <br /> This is a film about sadness and the ability of a particular teenager to see sadness in everyday life, as it is around the corner on every corner. , before the deployment of the lives that impact. A sociopath is a person who can not empathize with others and who, although he understands the difference between good and evil, does not care about this difference. A sociopath is a subject who places himself at the center of the universe of that subject, with total contempt for the impact that the subject's actions have for those around him. One of the defining characteristics of a sociopath is that a true sociopath lacks the ability to feel empathy, lacks the ability to feel what others feel and does not correlate changes in the mood of others as a result of the actions of that sociopath with those behaviors. A sociopath CAN NOT feel the pain of others, or understand that the pain of others is the result of the sociopath's own actions. A sociopath is a person who is not fully formed. A vital part of the psychological and emotional composition of a true sociopath is lacking, which makes the sociopath immune to "speech therapy" and other treatment modalities that involve human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings. Sociopathy is devastating, even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment designed to contain the damage that the sociopath can do to others. Many sociopaths function more or less normally and never cause a signal on the radar of the criminal justice system, although they tend to leave a trail of emotional debris in their wake. <br /> <br /> Leland Fitzgerald is not a sociopath. He is a blessed (or cursed) person with the ability to anticipate what he considers the consequences and inevitable outcomes of human interactions. Leland literally sees the sadness written in the eyes and faces of the people around him, as he slowly assimilates and internalizes the philosophy that life is about loss, and that people slowly succumb to the inevitable and inexorable fact that, lack of a better metaphor, things fall apart. People who fall in love and kiss and hug each other today become "pathetic" elderly couples. The electricity in the eyes of Leland's "mother" (a wealthy socialite from New York who loves Leland and invites him to the house she shares with her family when she arrives in New York City, alone and determined to stay in At the age of 12, she fades when she explains, during the last of her visits to New York City, that she knew that her husband had been cheating on her all the time, that she had divorced, It breaks the heart, everyone, and that such a loss is an inevitable part of growth, his eyes still reflect the light, but the electricity that once illuminated them disappeared.This scene, this explanation, it is too late, it is crucial to understand why Leland commits a seemingly savage and senseless crime (which kills his ex-girlfriend's retarded younger brother) .Leland knows what awaits this little boy: a life of unattainable goals, of being taught only words that mean danger, of never knowing the master r of another human being, of never feeling that love and never connecting with another person. More than any other character in this film, this child embodies everything Leland considers inevitable and horrifying about the world. The act of Leland (killing this little boy) is, for Leland, an act of mercy, committed because this was the only thing he COULD do in a world where actions can not change the results. While a true sociopath knows that actions can change results, but does not care about the damage inflicted on others by those actions, Leland does care. What most people consider a barbarous and horrific act is, in Leland's eyes, the only decent thing he can do to alleviate the suffering of just one person. <br /> <br /> It would be comforting to be able to present this as an explanation of Leland's actions: comforting, but incomplete. Because in the end, the "fault" of Leland's actions is elsewhere. As is usually the case, there are no easy explanations or balms to apply to the indignant soul. Why did not Leland learn something that even the most pessimistic people usually recognize, that sometimes, only sometimes, do people remain in love and that relationships do succeed, and that even the saddest lives ARE transformed? For Leland, there is no middle ground, no inner core to which he can withdraw and regroup. There is only pain and sadness. One is tempted to blame his arrogant and unpleasant father, the brilliant writer (played by Kevin Spacey), for not being present at critical moments during the development of Leland, but given the evil of this man, that may have been a blessing. br /> <br /> In the end, this viewer was moved by a tremendous sense of sadness. Why was Leland condemned to see the world through a veil of pessimism and depression? There is a maturity in the character of Leland, present, for example, when he insists repeatedly that no one is to blame for his girlfriend breaking up with him, that is stoic and heartbreaking. Stoic, in the sense that it is absolutely genuine, despite the heated denunciations of Leland's teacher. But heartbreaking, because it is born not so much from understanding as from despair. Leland's indifference to his fate is merely a reflection of the absolute certainty of his belief that nothing really matters. Nothing you do can change your destiny. <br /> <br /> This is not a sociopathy on display. This is, in any case, its polar opposite ...
