Shes man is great. It's fun, original and it made me laugh so much that I almost wet the seat. The day I went to see her at the movies, I was not in a very good mood (human problems), but when I left the movie I had a smile on my face. The story is a little out there and nobody realizes that it looks too much like a girl, but, who am I to say what is credible, the jokes are great and some of the themes of this 2006 success could fall ? in History. Amanda B. did a great job as the lead role and Channing Tatum seems too good to be true as her opposite as the beautiful Duke. So the girls are going to see this because it's a great laugh and there's an attractive guy in it and the guys are going to see it because maybe they learn something about the girls! <br /> <br /> In general, a brilliant, fantastic and funny movie that I will buy on DVD when it comes out.
