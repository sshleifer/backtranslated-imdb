Do not be fooled by the nostalgic aura that surrounds "Mon oncle Antoine", because like the best Canadian film, darkness is hidden just below the surface. <br /> <br /> Presumably located in rural Quebec in the 1940s, the story explores the development of young Benoit's consciousness as he learns to deal with sexuality and death. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the film is amazing, especially due to the fact that a large proportion of criticism of Canadian cinema by the general public surrounds aesthetics. Beyond this, the modest Benoit is a seductive protagonist for the audience, looking at his corrupt community with new and innocent eyes. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading Jim Leach's critical essay on the film in Canada's Best Features for anyone looking to place the film in a historical context while also analyzing the film's form. Definitely take a look at this.
