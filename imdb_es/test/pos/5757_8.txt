Bottom has been my favorite comedy since I saw it on TV and the movie is even better if you're a fan of the bottom, I say it's a must-buy! The plot is that Eddie and Ritchie run a hotel called Guest House Paradise, but not everything is going well for them, as customers leave until a famous actress comes to stay. They try to impress her, but not all go well. This is a breeding for the British. Cinema so buy this and you will pee with laughter. Also starring Simon Peggi (shaun of the dead) and Bill Bill (really love) may not have done well at the box office or for his appearance on this website, but do not listen to them, buy this and I swear I love it
