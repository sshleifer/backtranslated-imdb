This is one of the best sequels and a very good movie, even though there were some mistakes, but I still enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not only fighting against one or two robbers but an army of them. Death Wish 3 has many great action scenes and I enjoyed it every second. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page provides the music, with producers Golan and Globus doing the same and Charles Bronson continues to perform well for Paul Kersey. This movie also made it look like Michael tried to finish the Death Wish series and I can not blame him and I love the gun that Charles uses. Death Wish 3 is one of the great movies of 1985 and it can not be better than this. <br /> <br /> I give this 9/10
