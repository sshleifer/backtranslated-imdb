Does anyone know why this movie is called the couch trip? I was just watching it and I'm still not sure why this title was chosen. The movie was very funny and it is probably my favorite performance by Dan Aykroyd. He even exceeds his performance in the Ghostbusters. I had never heard of the movie until I saw it in a Sears store. I read the reverse and thought it sounded good, so I bought it and when I finally had the chance to see it, I thought it was better than I had originally expected. This movie is as good as the house of the animals and the vacations of the national lampoons in my mind. I wish that the comedies that have come out lately have been written, as this is not sad, and the bad things that happen are also fun parts if someone else feels this way and I would like to read a comedy script for a movie Do not have a sad situation, send me an email to killer2511@hotmail.com
