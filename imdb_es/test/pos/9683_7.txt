Despite the apparent structural similarity to The Simpsons: fat and noisy father, housewife, 3 children, a pet, typical suburban home, Family Guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposed to The Simpsons. His avid (and sometimes too much) use of cut jaws has been his main stay since the first season. While some hit the nail in the head (The Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito bit into season 5 is very funny), others are less successful, apparently so naive. And they can be annoying, especially when they do not advance the story line. (The fragments of Jesus are totally funny and insulting) <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin lends itself to pure comedy gold, so much so that Chris and Meg only manage to fulfill the role of compulsory teenagers in However, the feature film Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, is MINDNUMBINGMENTE horrible. Thank God, he went straight to the DVD. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the heavy comparisons with the perennial Simpsons, Seth Macfarlane's approach to Family Guy is actually very different, far more incorrect from the political point of view and, surprisingly, much more cheeky . <br /> <br /> The creator of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi, criticized Family Guy for having "extremely low" graphic standards from a cartoonist's point of view. I do not think it looks so bad, however, the details and the accuracy of some of the parodies are quite successful. <br /> <br /> In short, a great series to accompany a large bowl of French fries. Ranchera sauce and ass pranks.
