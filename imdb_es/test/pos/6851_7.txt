More of a near foul than a flop, MR. IMPERIUM plays Ezio Pinza as Alex, heir and then king of a small European nation, who falls in love with a willing American actress and artist, Fredda Barlo (Lana Turner), but due to the machinations of Alex's astute prime minister as King, very well played by Cedric Hardwicke, the lovers split up for 12 years before meeting in Palm Springs, where their love is revived. Director Don Hartman, who also writes scripts, can not fully utilize his talent for an agile dialogue due to the tentative use of English by Pinza, and the necessary rewrite, along with a less than total relationship between the two stars, gives as result a somewhat irregular tone. to the script, exacerbated by the cruel cut of many studio scenes, which leads to a confusing ending. The overwhelming Pinza dominates his scenes with Turner, but both artists get good results, while Marjorie Main is impressive with his pattern effects as written, with Debbie Reynolds placed on the track by Louis B. Mayer for SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN as result of his brilliant performance here; only Barry Sullivan is strongly a victim of blatant cuts. Pretilely filmed largely in Pebble Beach, California, and other surroundings of Monterey County, the film is endowed with Pinza's strong solo operatic base in Once Only, as well as original songs by Harold Arlen and Dorothy Fields, with Douglas Shearer handling the sound in a splendid way the recording and the announcement must be done with the fine decorations of Edwin Willis and the effective costume designs of Walter Plunkett.
