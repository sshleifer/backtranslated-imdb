You can not watch a movie like "Privilege" by Peter Watkins, a story of the exploitation of a pop music performer by large companies, the state and even organized religion, without thinking of creatively degenerate products like Michael Jackson or Britney Spears that hawk corporate giants like Pepsi or some other poison for money. Or any number of artists, in music or movies, that become tools of political parties or commercial religious interests such as Scientology and Kabbalah. A film like Privilege must have seemed almost like science fiction when it premiered in 1967, so fantastic was its premise. Today we tend to take the support of celebrities for granted, paying little attention to its most alarming implications. Watkins' vision has not only become reality, but we tacitly accept this reality as "normal". <br /> <br /> Now let's consider the Punishment Park. As Privilege challenges the viewer to examine what is being sold to us, and why, Punishment Park demands that we consider what is taken from us and why. <br /> <br /> Heaven helps the United States and, indeed, the world, if contemporary politicians put their hands on this film. It is already so close to reality, that upon seeing it recently, I experienced a genuine and nauseating feeling of anxiety. <br /> <br /> Watkins again skillfully employs a documentary-style narrative. While in Privilege some approximate aspects of this technique were evident, in Punishment Park it has been perfected to achieve impeccable perfection. The sense of realism is enhanced by disproportionately modest, economic and credible representations of the entire cast. This is the kind of action that Hollywood has completely turned its back on, in detriment, in favor of aesthetically perfect image projections. The cast has first-class material to work on the Watkins script. <br /> <br /> Many film visionaries have tried to get the viewer out of their complacent and false sense of security. Nobody has achieved this result with such absolute and chilling precision as Peter Watkins does here. <br /> <br /> "What seems clear enough now, is that instead of trying to attract excluded and excluded Americans, like these Again in the national community, the Administration has chosen to accept and exploit the division current within the country and next to what he considers to be the majority, instead of the policy of reconciliation, he has chosen the policy of polarization. " <br /> <br /> To paraphrase one of the characters, we do not have to call them pigs because they know what they are. Better than us.
