I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival in the Palace cinemas, and I changed it completely in the first five minutes. Thank God for a film that ignores all the garbage that we see often in Australian films that seem to revolve around a) race b) gender and c) class, in favor of er ... I dare to say ... very good movie theater. The producer, a shy and slightly eccentric guy named Alex Frayne, presented his film, made with a group of his classmates near the city where he spent much of his childhood. Apparently, he has spent much of last year traveling the world with the film, mainly in Europe. The world that creates the film is brilliant and artistic, not only because of the strange and disconcerting style of editing, the Gothic characters and the surreal sense of time and place that attracts viewers to their nightmarish realm. <br /> <br /> The producer returned to the Q + A tracking rooms. Someone asked him what his inspiration was; he replied "South Australia". Listen Listen! Another asked what a "day in Alex's life" meant. He replied that he drives an old Ute, who has breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant where he has eaten very well for the past 8 years. And he plays the piano what helps him think. Do not drink alcohol and play cricket once a week. Then, the question and answer session ended abruptly due to the upcoming screening of the film, so my thoughts are that for the next festival, they should extend the subsequent sessions to the film.
