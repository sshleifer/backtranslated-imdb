After a slightly slow start, I thought that this film about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II resumed and became a pretty nice watch for a couple of hours, mainly from two points of view. <br /> <br /> The love triangle is interesting and it seems credible to me, because I know it happened in several places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl committed to marry Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of his love from the beginning, but his future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece and Mandras went to fight. After the German intervention, Greece is conquered and the island where Pelagia lives is under Italian occupation, during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage). This, of course, was a dilemma that came to many young women. in occupied lands. As they got to know their occupants, they began to see them not as enemies but as real people, and sometimes they fell in love, often at the disapproval of their neighbors. I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of the Channel Islands of Great Britain in which this was an important issue. Once Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. <br /> <br /> The second fundamental problem is the Italian occupation itself, which I thought was portrayed quite realistically. First was the contempt with which the island treated its Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the city to surrender to the Italians and, on the other hand, insisting on surrendering to a German officer seemed to me something that could well have happened (and in fact it was quite funny, I loved the line ", we would prefer to surrender to this German" dog that for you, the Italians. "The portrait of the Italian troops also seemed credible to me.The Italian army never fell in love with its German ally, and was never enthusiastic about fighting with them.Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, His soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt, where Italians are more interested in singing than in fighting (what German troops on the island simply can not understand) and are excited when Italy makes peace and retires from war , until they discover that this can make them prisoners, the Germans, everything went pretty well, I thought. <br /> <br /> It wobbles a bit at the end with too predictable an ending, but it still deserves praise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
