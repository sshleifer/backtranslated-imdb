This film started being confusing and became one of the best movies I've seen ... The performance was absolutely excellent and when I was not drying my tears I enjoyed Meryl Streep, whose performance was extraordinary. The film is about the difficulties of a distant family that faces a mother who develops terminal cancer. The movie was very hard to see and heartbreaking. The soundtrack fits this movie perfectly. Brava Bette Midler !! Of 5 stars, I give this to 4 1/2.
