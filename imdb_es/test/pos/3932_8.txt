I saw a preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a great time! After seeing the furtive picks of BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (more or less 6/10) I enjoyed it much more! As it was seen in the trailer, a blow I had was that I believed that an entire city could be "forgotten", but this is a horror movie of popcorn, so I accept it as it is. <br /> <br /> My only major complaint is that I assumed that Paris Hilton would touch wax or be submerged, etc. and I would moan "that's hot", but they did not (how could they resist?). <br /> <br /> There is NO nudity on the part of the 2 girls although Paris looks great in her underwear! I am surprised that they have not placed a third "victim of a hot chip" in the movie because of unnecessary nudity, which is the norm for this type of movie! I will not list any death or spoilers of the plot, BUT I will say that both Paris and Eliza are roughing it! <br /> <br /> The characters develop decently and are somewhat enjoyable (not like Cabin Fever where you wanted them to die) and the movie has a decent pace, although in the first 30 minutes nothing happens like most movies Horror. <br /> <br /> I give it an 8/10, as it delivered good fears and gore and had low expectations about it. If you go with some friends who like cheesy horror movies, you'll have a good time. <br /> <br /> Noah
