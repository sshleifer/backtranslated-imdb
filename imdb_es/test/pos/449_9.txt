There have been many excellent comments about this movie and I want to add my voice to the praise. Yul Brynner has never been more powerfully attractive. His eldest Surov was fascinating. Your eyes simply can not leave the screen when you are in it. This is your movie. This is not to disparage the rest of the cast that was also exemplary, especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson. As they were mostly theater actors, they brought many nuances to their performances. For example, I've seen this movie at least 4 times, but this is the first time I've noticed the German girl's reaction when she came face to face with a Russian soldier. Although it was not threatening, his absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that I should have been in Germany after the Second World War and that it was very likely to be raped by the Red Army. The possibility of discovering deeper layers of history that may be just below the surface makes you want to see this fascinating film over and over again. Please put it on DVD.
