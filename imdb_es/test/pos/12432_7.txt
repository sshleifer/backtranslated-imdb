Well, it must be said that Monster Man is a big mess of a movie, but somehow, several different genres and a cliché plot come together to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror movies I've seen in a long time. The two biggest styles that are mixed in the film are a "Road Trip" style teen comedy and a Texas Chainsaw Massacre horror vibe, and while one gets in the way of the other quite often ; Director Michael Davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant change of tone means that we are never quite sure where the movie will take us next. Things start worryingly when they introduce us to two characters, both irritants in different ways. Adam is a virgin wussy, while Harley is a fat "A-hole" with a big mouth. They both drive through the desert to attend the wedding of a girl they liked in high school. After a couple of strange events, they pick up a hitchhiker and then find themselves being chased by some maniac in a monster truck for unknown reasons ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​someone being chased by someone else in A larger vehicle is hardly original, but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the biggest assets of the movie. The truck itself looks creepy because it is very haggard and rusty, and the fact that it bounces around the screen makes the action unfolding exciting and disconcerting. After a while, you start getting used to the characters and once Aimee Brooks enters the contest, things start to get better. The teen comedy of the movie actually works quite well, since Justin Ulrich is always at his disposal to offer some entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes between the dorky virgin and the sexy hiker are quite interesting. Just when you think the movie can not be more complicated, things change for the weird in the last third. Without spoiling things, it must be said that Monster Man presents the type of end that could not possibly be seen and, along with the turn, it is a great surprise. Some people may feel cheated by the sudden turn at the end, but actually I thought it worked pretty well since it fits the movie because nothing here fits ... Overall, this is not a "great" movie in any way - but If you're looking for some silly entertainment, Monster Man should hit the spot!
