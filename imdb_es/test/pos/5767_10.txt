This is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life: from start to finish, it was perfect in time, atmosphere, punctures, background music, fight sequences and every other possible aspect you can imagine. To be absolutely honest, I find this movie as fun as his comedy "Bottom" (by Rik & Ade), maybe even more fun. I laughed constantly throughout the film and I can only recommend watching this movie ... However, if you see it without knowing (or do you like it?) The kind of comedy that Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson have done before, it is possible that think it's funny all, but I REALLY can not understand those who do not like it, THIS IS HUMOR FOLKS! (People who are hit with frying pans, men who wear red rubber underwear, green vomits that fill the corridors, those who are kicked on the beach and candelabra in their eyes, how can this NOT be funny? 10/10
