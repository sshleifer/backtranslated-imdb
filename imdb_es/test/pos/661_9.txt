Cheezy? Yes. Wrong filmed? You can bet. Zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters. Bright anyway (or so)? Safely. <br /> <br /> This film celebrates (and mocks) everything that was classic about the horror genre of the 80s: characters with absolutely no depth, who fit into a stereotyped roll from which they never escape for a moment; the teenagers who tried to survive a murder by some mysterious force that bothered them by doing something sordidly adolescent; completely free nudity; Impossible amounts of blood coming from the victims; slow-moving zombies; Super single line ... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket! <br /> <br /> This is not a total spoof like Scary Movie, but rather a movie in homage to the lost innocence of the horror movies of the 80s ... when being scared and making money could also be fun and silly. , sexy, and goofy good time!
