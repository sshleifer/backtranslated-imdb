I like the good things in life as much as I do anyone, I suppose, but until about five years ago, opera did not feature in my entertainment options. Oh, I made some attempts to learn what all this fuss was about; He had seen several television productions, especially parts of Wagner's cycle on public television, hoping to understand the fascination of others for the art form. And I knew that I could like parts of several operas (I remember when I was a child I was surprised that I really LOVED the fragments of "Madame Butterfly" in "My Geisha, and I enjoyed the opera scenes in" Moonstruck "and" Pretty Woman " ), but unlike the characters in those movies, I just did not "get it". <br /> <br /> Then in 1995 I saw a live performance of "Rigoletto" presented by the New York City Opera Company York, and that The night that "I understood." What a wonderful, glorious parade of color, music and pure emotion! And I mean emotion with a capital E. The key, I think, is that operatic music allows artists act excessively freely and credibly in a way that would seem silly if only their words were uttered.It all depends on the music, of course, and when the music is magical, as in "Rigoletto", an opera can be a magnificent entertainment . /> <br /> A sympathetic member of The family gave me a laserdisc copy of the 1982 television production of the opera, and I discovered that I can not see the concert live. The gestures of "Rigoletto" live on a regular basis, this video version is a good substitute. Luciano Pavarotti is perfect in the Duke's part; Ingvar Wixell is excellent as his evil court jester Rigoletto; and Rigoletto's beloved daughter, Gilda, is played by Edita Gruberova. The sets and the costumes are splendid, and the location shots on the river at the end of the film bring a dramatic sense to the story that could never be combined on stage. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen "Rigoletto" or if you think you do not like or do not understand opera, I urge you to find it on a videotape and buy it or rent it. If you do not like this, if this production of "Rigoletto" does not make you appreciate the power of the opera's artistic form, well, just abandon it and move on to something else. But I suspect that, if you're new to opera like I was, you'll be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Bill Anderson
