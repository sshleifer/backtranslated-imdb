Alien Warrior (or King of The Streets) is one of those gems of the 80 that you come across by mistake, then watch amazed, marveling at how wonderfully silly and exaggerated it is. <br /> <br /> A fairly stout alien arrives on earth (LA to be exact) and stumbles into a world of corrupt drug dealers, gangs and police. He falls in love with the beautiful blond hair teacher who only wants to help the children in the city center to read more. He also manages to annoy a drug kingpin who inhales Coca-Cola who swears to destroy him. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this movie when I saw it for the first time ... sure it's silly, silly and low budget. But you can say that the filmmakers had their hearts in the right place, and damn if the thing does not work! I just pray that it's on DVD soon. <br /> <br /> It has a soundtrack, a break dance, violence, nudes ... all with a positive and healthy message! Look at it.
