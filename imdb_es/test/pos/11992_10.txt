Like Richard Pryor, Mason never got the material he deserved. What you know about him is probably wrong. Pass the accent and go see your stand-up. You'll be surprised: it's one of the best I've seen and I've seen many comedies (from Lenny Bruce to Eddie Murphy, Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock, Jackie Mason is definitely up there). It is known for being the comic of a comic. Even Howard Stern said he is one of the 3 funniest comedians in the world. <br /> <br /> The accusation that Mason is not a Dangerfield is ridiculous. Dangerfield is known to have been a big fan of Mason. Dangerfield's career was not going anywhere for long until he started following Mason's shows. It was then that Mason gave Dangerfield the inspiration for his "do not get respect" routine. While I think Dangerfield is great, see them both standing up and you'll see that Mason is the best comedian.
