I thought that this film was educational, entertaining and very moving. I was impressed when I found out how much Justice Arbor had contributed during his stay in Kosovo. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is highly undervalued and it's good to see her again in a Canadian production. Other easily recognizable stars are Leslie Hope (24) and John Corbett (Sex in the City). <br /> <br /> Although the story of this film may not be completely objective, it left me wanting to learn more about Arbor's word. A great movie for inspiring young women. <br /> <br /> I say that the movie is a "must see".
