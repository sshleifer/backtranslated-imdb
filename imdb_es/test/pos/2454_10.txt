I had never heard of this movie and I only got it because I'm a fan of Martin Sheen. Now I am surprised why he did not receive the accolades and recognition he really deserves. All four characters make you feel for them, the father who tries to assert his authority, the mother still clings to traditional family values ​​and both try to keep up appearances despite the total fragmentation of her family, the daughter who wants her own life and the son Persecuted by his experiences in Vietnam. One felt that this was a scenario that should have been played in thousands of "ordinary" families after Vietnam. Emilio Estévez, like Jeremy, was magnificent, totally upset by his experience of war with which none of his family could relate. The chemistry of the screen between him and his father in real life, Martin Sheen, was incredible. And there were moments when Emilio's anguished face was like Martin's in "Apocalypse Now." I am sure that, just as Martin has considered Apocalype one of his best films, Emilio will consider this one of his best films as well. The scene with the gun was totally amazing, since all the emotions were in the faces of the family. Brilliant performance by Estevez, Sheen and Kathy Bates. Last night I saw the movie for the first time, and today the main news was about a veteran of the Gulf War who had killed several members of his family. How many more young people are going to have their lives destroyed by the war?
