This is an adventure movie that can be seen perfectly, with a great cast and a good story, based on real events. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the story of the film is based on real events. It is mostly for the most part an adventure story, with all the usual ingredients that can be expected from an adventure movie set in an Arab world. So, many fights with swords, good old fashioned honors, religion and a rich and proud country. But the film is also full of humor, to make the film light and pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> The constant cut between the Moroccan plot that involves Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American plot. In my opinion, involving Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) was not the best possible approach. Both things have totally different rhythms, totally different characters, they are totally different worlds! Of course, both lines of the story are connected and focus on the same thing, but the contrast between the two worlds is too big to let it work. It does not make the movie feel connected and a little disconnected at all times. The American plot line is most of the time more political, while the Moroccan story line is purely adventurous and action-packed. In the end, maybe you could even ask yourself what was the point or Roosevelt in this movie. It seems that John Milius is just a great admirer of him. Often, the line of the American plot removed most of the rhythm of the line of the plot of Morocco, much more interesting and more full of action. After all, John Milius has always been at his best as an action director. <br /> <br /> It is not until the half that the film is fully exposed. The largest and largest scale action of the movie starts. Especially the large-scale final battle does not disappoint. I wish the whole movie was like that. That way, this movie would also have been better known, no doubt. <br /> <br /> The film has a great musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, which may be much better known than the film itself. The film is also attractive, with a great production design and an action and attractive battle sequences. Apparently, the movie only costs $ 4,000,000 to make, but that's really hard to believe, considering the configuration and size of the movie. I mean that John Milius, his best-known film "Conan the Barbarian", cost around $ 20,000,000 to make, but it was much more attractive and less impressive on its scale. <br /> <br /> Pretty funny to see an Arab speak a big Scottish accent but hey, it's Sean Connery, so you just tend to accept this. It adapts well to your paper. This is what Candice Bergen does. It is always difficult for a female character to appear credible and work in a movie like this, but she does manage. Also John Huston plays a great role in this movie! <br /> <br /> A perfectly visible movie! <br /> <br /> 7/10
