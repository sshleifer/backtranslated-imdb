I was lucky to see this at this year's Tribeca Film Festival. I was surprised at how well done and how entertaining this wonderful little movie was. Griffin Dunne director has done a great job putting together this film has several characters and several story lines that blend smoothly and without problems. The main story involves the family and it is a very stimulating and entertaining story that involved the viewer in each scene. The film as a whole has credibility and integrity, but it still has that commercial advantage, an "indie" movie for the masses, if you wish. The performances of the cast are excellent, but it is Diane Lane that shines the most. Diane Lane is simply sensational in this wonderful movie and must be nominated for an Oscar. The first days I know, but Lane acts his socks out of here.
