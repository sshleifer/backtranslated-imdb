Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema, and it's much better than I expected. Those people who say it's not scary or funny are right, it's not that great. But it must be kept in mind that everyone involved in the film is rather amateur, so it's basically an inaugural trip. And comparing this one with other Sinan Çetin films as the "Propaganda" of first class garbage, this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> One thing that MUST be said: it's about the life of high school students in Turkey very realistic! That is exactly what happens! The scenes that are destined to scare are something cheap and hollywoodenses. Most of them even if not all. But that scene from the religion lesson made me laugh in tears, and Emre Kýnay performs the best performance of this film as a religion teacher. <br /> <br /> It is NOT a waste of time, go and see it! You will find it quite fun, especially if you know Turkey enough to relate to the school life of young Turks.
