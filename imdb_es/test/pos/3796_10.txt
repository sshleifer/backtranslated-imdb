I rarely write reviews, but this movie simply demands more attention than it receives, since it contains the most hysterical kidnapping, comically wrong sequence ever filmed. <br /> <br /> I've only seen it once and I think it's the funniest movie. I had the privilege of looking once. I laughed from beginning to end. It is a pity that it is not on DVD or video. <br /> <br /> You can only compare his cinematography with that of It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad or Promise her Anything. Only this story is not as complex as Mad World. <br /> <br /> I hope that this movie will be released in the near future, as it would be a shame to lose a comedy gem among the scum we have today.
