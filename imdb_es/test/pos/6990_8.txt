This was a great movie and the sequel should know what our socks are! The action will have no end and I just bought the special edition DVD with the animated story similar to the Animatrix. This will put Vin Diesel back in the limelight and, hopefully, give him the coveted role in Spider Man 3 as Venom. It would be the most logical choice for the role. Back to PB this movie, although it is an independent thriller, has a great story and characters with screaming backgrounds so you want to learn more. If they were to make books or comics it would be a great read. There was one thing that I felt was a bit to do. The ending needed a little work, but not all films will have the best ending.
