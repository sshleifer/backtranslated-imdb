'A tale of two sisters', or 'Janghwa, Hongryeon', is a true masterpiece. A brilliant psychological thriller, a heartrending drama and a passionate terror, all in a beautifully orchestrated package. From the intricate plot, to the beautiful cinematography, to the absolutely perfect casting, every aspect of this film is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> For fear of revealing too much about the plot, I'll just say it's very satisfying. . While it may seem a bit difficult to understand at first, it does a good job of explaining things in the end. And if you prefer the psychological thriller, drama or horror, I promise you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, it is almost impeccable. The set, the cinematography, the lighting, and especially the soundtrack, are captivating. The waltz seemed an odd choice at first, but it proved to be an ingenious choice. <br /> <br /> As for the casting, we are talking about absolute perfection. I'm Su-jeong is totally convincing as the defiant, but concerned Su-mi. Mun Keun-yeong is as convincing as his sister Su-yeon emotionally traumatized. These two girls were magical on the screen. I will certainly be investigating his other films. Yeom Jeong-ah is deceptively cheerful and terribly evil like the stepmother. Finally, Kap-su Kim offers an excellent performance as the tired and broken father. <br /> <br /> I really love this movie. If you have not yet seen 'A tale of two sisters', I recommend you locate a copy. It is a true jewel, worthy of anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> (10/10)
