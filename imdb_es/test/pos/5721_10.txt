John Leguizamo's one-man shows are unpredictable: Mambo Mouth showed his intense characterizations and his great rhythm, but the material was average, Spic-o-Rama also achieved the first, but this time the material was fun, Freak is a classic followed by His disappointing Sex-o-holic. But his things in Freak show his genius and, when he is in the spotlight, he has no equal. <br /> <br /> Freak's semi-autobiographical look at a young man's journey has power and resonance. I do not think he is not even its creator. he knew about By allowing us to see his soul, Mr. Leguizamo gives us the opportunity to project our own life into his and there can be no more important gift that an artist can give. The willingness to leave the 'Wall', expose and share is too terrifying for most actors (they use characters to hide behind), but JL does everything possible and cheerfully breaks any pretension. Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor were our best cultural observers / comedians / actors because they spoke from the depths of what they noticed in society and the truth that provided sharp humor. Combine that with the gift of a great actor to imitate and be in the moment (without mentioning the sense of humanity) and you will see that John Leguizamo has the power to do the same. At least in Freak he does. <br /> <br /> From its birth to its first big break and every moment of life alteration in the middle, a spectator sees our host and other characters in their most private moments while experiencing the pain, Hope, and the humor that comes with. Apparently drained and lean, JL Muscled is sounding with sweat at the end of the night, having offered his crazy life for an audience; The fluid work of the Spike Lee camera captures the nuances of the actor until the last lip curl and the slow blink. The scenarios range from drinking with his father fed with machismo (when he was 9 years old) to see A Chorus Line with his gay and deaf uncle; The vicious humiliation of his first girlfriend when she undresses, anxious to have sex. A first nightmarish sexual encounter with a large German woman in the back of a Kentucky Fried Chicken follows an unsuccessful attempt to pick up a "Catholic drunk" at a bar on St. Patrick's Day. Climaxing in a serious confrontation with his mother and father, is here where he shows his true genius: he plays a scene between these two characters and he and his brother with a dramatic / funny intensity so strong, he forgets that he is only seeing one. person. There are no costume changes, bad wigs, lighting tricks or makeup. Only an actor who gives everything. It is simply amazing. <br /> <br /> Other actors / comedians who stand out at the moment are Eddie Izzard and Chris Rock, but they do not dive into them as deeply as John Leguizamo does; That is not a criticism, far from it. I love his work but Freak is different. It is moving in a non-b ******* way. It is the best one-man show and no one will be able to touch it for a long time.
