Luckily for Bill Murray, this is such a light project, since it practically has to carry it out. Meatballs is the story of Northstar Low Income Camp and how its advisors deal with campers, as well as each other. Then there's a lot of its rich rivals across the lake called Camp Mohawk that culminates in a two-day Olympic competition. Above all is Bill Murray doing antics and making a memorable debut in the film. <br /> <br /> The film is peppered with medium laughter, laughter and more than a few laughs on the way. The biggest laughs come from the jokes played in the director of the nerd camp. Three of them involve counselors who move their beds outside in various places while they sleep. Morty, or "Micky", as everyone calls him, wakes up along a path, hanging from trees several feet above the ground, and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some fun moments that involve the counselors who hit each other, but this is a movie rated by PG with little fighting ability. <br /> <br /> The film takes a serious note that involves a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course, it's Murray's decision to teach him how to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the Olympiad. The sentimentality of Rudy's situation seems to be attached to a large extent. Note that when Murray first sees the child sitting alone on the grass after getting off the bus, he says, "You must be the little depressed child we ordered." It makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or Murray was just improvising while the cameras were rolling. In other words, Murray could also have told Makepeace: "You must be the actor we hire to play the solitary, stereotyped child you see in most summer camp movies that do not fit." But before it's all over, Murray's performance makes this layout device more than bearable. He really seems to have good chemistry with Makepeace. <br /> <br /> The film culminates with games between the two rival camps. Very little of the events they show us are even a little believable, but "it just does not matter". This is a pretty good movie on many levels. Do not let the absurd rating of 5.6 of this movie scare you. Murray will keep you laughing all the time. Just be careful ... avoid the sequels! Especially that of Corey Feldman !! 8 out of 10 stars <br /> <br /> The Dog.
