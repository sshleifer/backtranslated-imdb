* SPOILERS FORWARD * <br /> <br /> The great WrestleManias were still a few years old. But this was certainly good, with many good matches and a great match. <br /> <br /> The demolition was always the best at WrestleMania. I'm glad that his last WM hoorah (I refuse to include the other version) was a victory over the Colossal Connection. I liked Andre's joke that he has never put on. <br /> <br /> Few fans know that this was the first time someone beat Mr. Perfect. For some reason, the feat of Brutus Beefcake was never recognized. Or the fact that he did it quite easily. <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation's victory over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in WM history, including the second match 24/9 between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Jake and DiBiase had to fight at WrestleMania. This compensated for the fact that the dispute had to be held in suspense for so long. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the Big Bossman-Akeem fight would heat up, but the Bossman just hit him. As good as Bossman was like a heel, it was just as good as a face. He was always intense and, obviously, he loved his work. <br /> <br /> If the Warrior had a better work ethic and perhaps tried to learn to fight, he would have been a great WWF champion. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching, especially because boring matches are too short to complain about. And the tag team matches are very exciting.
