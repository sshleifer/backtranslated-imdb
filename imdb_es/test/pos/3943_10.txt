This may be the subject of wine, but this could be the best movie I've seen in a long time. Okay, I spent a lot of the first half hour wondering what the hell was going on, but once I accepted that I would never understand it through the subtitles, I was able to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Can you really? Do you hate a movie in which a cane becomes a flock of birds defecating on the enemy? What matters the development of the character when you face a lesbian extraterrestrial princess whose people built the pyramids? Why Buddha uses diamond earrings that shine seriously? Does any of this matter when faced with the sumptuousness of the images and the cunning humor of the characters? Any battle for my heart was won once I saw the main character dressed as a spiderman, incredible! Many people will complain about the lack of cohesion in the story, but a fun movie to laugh with a group of classmates that you can not do better, especially if you do an alcohol injection every time someone says "I'll love you for 10,000 years".
