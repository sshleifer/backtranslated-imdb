Anyone looking to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find the right research material for Dogtown and Z-Boys. This should not be confused with Lords of Dogtown, that unfortunate Hollywood attempt to capitalize on the success of the original revival of Dogtown. <br /> <br /> Directed by Stacey Peralta, a former Z-Boys, as well as a professional skater and intellectual author of the Bones Brigade of the 80s, and co-written with skateboarding photojournalist Craig Stecyk, this documentary describes how a group of surfers the children of the mediocre streets of southern California (known as Dogtown) that formed the skateboarding team Z-Boys (actually there was a girl, Peggy Oki) revolutionized skating. The film contains interviews of almost all the Z-Boys (the whereabouts of Chris Cahill is unknown), with the most notorious being the bad ass Tony Alva and the youngest, Jay Adams, whose talents (along with Perlata) seemed to transcend the rest of the teams. . There are interviews with the founders of the team (and the Dogtown store), the surfboard designer Jeff Ho, Skip Engbloom and Craig Stecyk. There are also interviews with people like Tony Hawk (obviously), Ian McKaye (Fugazi) and Henry Rollins, who were small children in the 70s when Dogtown exerted its influence on skateboarding (skateboarding was a completely different context in previous years as a documentary Explain). <br /> <br /> It really shows you not only who the Dogtown team was and how they formed, but why their style changed not only the skating tricks (group skating became immensely popular and therefore , gave way to the vert skating). it also facilitated sport (though not in the extreme commercialism that it is today) as something more than the fleeting fashion that it had been before, since these surf children who had run out early in the morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually they got on skateboards. The days of Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand were over long ago when Dogtown, at least through the publicity of their skating team, paved the way for the new generation of skaters. Because Dogtown received all the attention, they were able to push the skating to the next step. <br /> <br /> It's a great documentary in the way it's organized, although Stacey Peralta always knew how to do it, even when producing Bones Brigade mini-films / skate demonstrations like "Ban This" and "Search for Chin Animal ". Narrated by Sean Penn, the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, contains a lot of excellent footage and many interviews to give you a genuine idea of ​​who the Z-Boys were and how they left their mark on skateboarding.
