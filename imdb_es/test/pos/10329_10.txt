The juice of bugs changed my life. I know it sounds strange, weird, weird. But he did. I'm from England, Bug Juice was never broadcast there, but five years ago I went on vacation with my family and I saw it on the Disney channel. Once I saw this television series, I was hooked, I wanted to go. My parents had a hard time convincing us to allow my brother and me to go to Waziyatah. I've been going since I was 12 and it was my fourth year this summer. If you are a teenager reading this, come to this camp change your life. You make lifelong friends in Wazi. It does not matter who you are or if someone at home does not like you, everyone likes you in the camp. You have a lot of fun If you want to take a look, visit www.wazi.com and see for yourself. It is fun. I love. It is my home away from home.
