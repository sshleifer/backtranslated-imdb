The man with the golden arm was one of the first films to have as main theme (and, in some aspects, the message) the tragedy of heroin addiction. It is not even close to a great movie, but its importance lies in the dedication of Otto Preminger to make it feel real and on the verge of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked is that it is not so much an exhibition of drug addicts (if you want the best exposure of that reading, Naked Lunch, if you can overcome it, apart from the point), but the nature of the urban environment that Frankie Machine lives. He hopes that after leaving prison for a direct and close deal, he will become a drummer of a band and make him legitimate as a musician. But he has his wife "crippled" Zosch, who can not work and needs money and often complains, and then there's the old neighborhood: he can not escape seeing Louie (Darren McGavin), who is still making card games in the back room. And, yes, pushing the drug. Like Mean Streets, it's hard to escape the details unless you leave. <br /> <br /> But, again, it's hard for Frankie Machine not to try to operate naturally in this urban neighborhood. It's just that he can not escape the temptation of junk (when he reserves a false accusation of theft with his friend, he sees a crazed drug addict, and he returns the fear of returning to his pure state). And impersonating Frankie is Sinatra, and I can not see anyone else who could have played it, even Brando, the original choice. It fits in the neighborhood and seems to be the kind of person who should be one step ahead of the game. But there is also a vulnerability for Sinatra that he pulls out wonderfully, and by the time we see him going to "Cold Turkey" in Molly's apartment, it's believable, even if it's not the kind of thing that those of "my generation" would think of as heroin (That is, Trainspotting and without a doubt Requiem for a dream). If it were not for something else, he wants to see the movie to see what happens to Sinatra like this character. <br /> <br /> However, the flaws appear in some of the other presentations, although it is a bit difficult. Eleanor Parker seems to be overreacting a good part of the movie, fooling Frankie that she is really crippled when she can actually walk and is cheating for one reason or another. But then it becomes clearer as she goes along: she is supposed to be crazy and crazy about jealousy, and at that level she begins to improve. Meanwhile, Kim Novak is good, although not worthy of Vertigo, as the possible girl on the side, but rather as the voice of reason in the story. Then there's a Detective Bendar, who could be one of the most famous characters / performances in history. And also Sparrow, Frankie's nerdy friend, and the characters of Louie and Schiefka, and they all play as you might expect (McGavin is better than OK). As for looking for other talents around Sinatra, Preminger does not do all that wonderfully. And, frankly, some scenes fade away. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot of fascination in Man with the Golden Arm, and not just an antiquated piece of sociological interest. It works as a convincing drama, and as a piece of message transmitted without being a preacher or countryside. It is a genuine article, but not exceptional.
