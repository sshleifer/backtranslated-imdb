This miniseries is a reasonable continuation of the original Gone With The Wind. If one sees this on its own merit (and does not immediately follow the original), it goes pretty well. I'm sure that most viewers will question the performances of Scarlett and Rhett, but it seems unlikely that anyone else has done better. Many of the characters here are new to this story, so the comparison in those cases (Rhett's mother, Uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen) is not a problem. No one will be Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable. <br /> <br /> The best part of all the production is the beautiful spring landscape of Charleston and Ireland. Look at it just for that. Obviously, this was a high budget TV miniseries. Follow the book for a while, then have a totally new story when Scarlett goes to Ireland. <br /> <br /> The performance is credible if it's nothing special, the way I feel Roger Moore is following Sean Connery for James Bond.
