Many of the first British sound movies I've seen on video suffer from poor print transfer quality or poor sound quality or both. Fortunately, I was able to obtain a copy of this movie in a video of excellent quality, which allowed me to concentrate on the story itself. <br /> <br /> And, it was an excellent story. At first glance, the passengers on the ill-fated bus looked like a pretty boring lot (except for the always lovely Jessie Matthews). But, as the film once again showed the story of each passenger the day before the accident, I discovered that the cast, unlike the initial appearance, was a group of talented artists, skillfully directed to provide a true individuality to their characterizations distinctive . <br /> <br /> Spectators may have different preferences as to which two passengers will have a tragic end and which ones will survive. But, the movie keeps your interest, because it keeps you guessing. This film deserves a much wider audience, a true jewel of ancient British cinema.
