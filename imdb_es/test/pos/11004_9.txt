This is a beautifully filmed film that questions the future of all indigenous peoples, especially the nomadic tribes. Focusing on the Saltman of Tibet, the film moves at a pace that can make some Western viewers feel uncomfortable. For some people, life continues to advance at the same pace it has for thousands of years. This film follows a group of tribal members in their annual search for two months to get salt. Your tribe lives its life in a traditional way (slowly according to modern standards) and always keeping in mind its many gods. This is a remarkable film, which will preserve a part of what, unfortunately, can become history. Well worth the time. Do not hurry when you see it.
