Score: 7 of 10. Directed by Barbet Schroeder. If you like 'Rope' by Hitchcock, then you will like this movie. Sandra Bullock plays `Murder by Numbers' as police detective Cassie Mayweather, psychologically concerned but brilliant. His partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> The teenage killers are high school students Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These young psychotics are willing to demonstrate their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it, but the proximity of the capture is exciting and exciting for at least one of the killers. <br /> <br /> Secondary characters include a police chief, an assistant district attorney and the high school caretaker to whom the assassins attribute the murder. The film reminds me of several 'Hitchcock' movies crossed with the TV show 'Law and Order'. We see a bit of police work and it's really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones do not. <br /> <br /> The other plot of the film is related to the past of Cassie Mayweather and his former incarcerated. -husband. Most viewers felt that this aspect of the film was unnecessary and moved slowly, but I found this in the most intriguing part of the story. <br /> <br /> `Murder by Numbers' is a very well designed movie if you are looking for security, or should I say dangerous, mystery murder. To get more emotions and suspense, try `Se7en 'or' Dial M for Murder 'by Hitchcock.
