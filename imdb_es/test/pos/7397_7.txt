The problem with so many people who see this movie is the mentality in which they see it. People come in search of a B-grade horror movie, or a movie "So bad is good." Jack Frost 2 is none of these. <br /> <br /> It is, to put it simply, a very good film intelligently hidden inside a very bad one. To see it as anything other than a meaningless comedy (easily more fun than the three "Scary Movies" combined) is to misinterpret the film at a basic level. It would be like watching Shawshank Redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple; The characters in the first film, tormented by the memories of Jack Frost, take vacations on a tropical island. A new and improved Jack comes after them, now with essentially the powers of Spider-Man's Hydro-Man; Basically, he can move from water to snow easily and quickly, divide, multiply and, what is worse, has managed to develop an immunity against his only previous weakness ... Antifreeze. <br /> <br /> What the sad thing about this movie is that the fans of the death of Jack Frost (a movie simply HORRIBLE) can not appreciate the change of tone for the sequel. Like Alien was a horror movie and Aliens was concerned about the action, Jack Frost was a weak attempt at horror trick and Jack Frost 2 is an artfully written parody of the trick horror genre. <br /> <br /> Most of the entertainment Live acting actors come, who serve admirably. Particularly amusing among them are Ray Tooney (playing a caricature of a British colonel retired since the early 1900s), Christopher Allport (offering an insane and hilarious twist on his woodcarving of the first film) and David Allen Brooks (taking the once serious The role of manners to totally strange new heights). <br /> <br /> The lack of "memorable appointments" bothers me. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of The Mutant Killer Snowman, qualifies a zero. But you have to understand, IT'S NOT A HORROR MOVIE.
