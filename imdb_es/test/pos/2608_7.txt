This is a beautiful movie starring Spanky, Alfalfa and Buckwheat of the comedies "Our Gang". Located in the South during the Civil War, it may seem a bit strange to see Buckwheat as Spanky's slave, but this movie is as charming as the best of the shorts with the same cast. This was the only feature film by Our Gang, and I highly recommend it in the 1994 remake of The Little Rascals.
