I picked up this little gem completely by accident in 1980 or '81. I was in a revival theater to watch two old science fiction movies. The theater was full and (without warning) showed a lot of science fiction parodies (to put us in mind). Most were fun, but this went on and in seconds, the audience was hysterical! The biggest laugh came when they showed "Princess Laia" with huge cinnamon buns instead of hair on her head. She looks at the camera, smiles grimly and nods. That made it even more fun! You have to see "Chewabacca" played by what looks like a Muppet! He was extremely stupid and stupid ... but he could not stop laughing. Most of the dialogue was drowned out due to all the laughter. Also, if you know Star Wars quite well, it's even more fun: they deliberately make fun of some dialogues. This REALLY works with an audience! A definitive 10!
