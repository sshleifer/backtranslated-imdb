Having been familiar with Hartley's "The Go-Between" for a long time, both in its original book form and in its disappointing Pinter-Losey film adaptation, this was interesting. "The Hireling" proves almost a mirror image at times; established in a slightly less distant period for the main part, which presents the exhibition of the British Class System and which contains a set piece sports game (boxing replaces cricket) that reveals a lot about. <br /> <br /> This is updated in its small scale, the focus of the character. You do not know exactly Lady Franklin and Leadbitter in the novelistic sense, but this distance is played properly by saying the body language and the inflection of the actors. His distance of sympathizing with any true character reflects the latent "difference" that condemns the central relationship. Miles and Shaw are wonderfully subtle, and we see more in their "less"; Never once are these performances of actors, showy. They are appropriately interpretations of Stanislavskian that create the impression that these characters have life outside the limits of the film. All the other parts are handled very satisfactorily, although they are much smaller in this film than I presume in the novel and are in fact compared to "The Go-Between", an impressive work on disillusionment. <br /> <br /> The disappointment in the center of this film is conveyed so sadly and poignantly in the last scenes where Shaw kisses Miles and is rejected, and then where a drunken Leadbitter confronts Cantrip and Lady Franklin . It is a shameful shame that what would have been an incredibly moving ending to desolate lives in disrepair on both sides of the screen, is "embellished" with a decidedly strange coda. One is completely taken aback by the leap in tone, when Shaw's Leadbitter goes crazy and ironically sings "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" as he crashes his car into things. The political point is greatly exceeded by this grandiloquent, rather somewhat operatic ending. The whole sense of subtlety, transmitted so effectively so far, is lost, since the implicit point becomes loud and loud. Agit-prop surely has no place in this kind of delicate period drama. <br /> <br /> In general, however, one can not be too harsh. While this absurd final piece is a major flaw, the rest of the film should be praised as a sensitive and evocative film of sadness and detailed observation about the way in which British society was in the past. The languid but clear touch of Hartley is very evident in everything. It's just a pity that we do not end up with the overwhelming conclusion of Shaw's drunken scene. The tragic and illusioned figure of Mrs. Franklin by Sarah Miles suddenly refuses to place itself at the epicenter of the film, while the excellent human drama slips strangely into the realms of political punctuation. Shaw also, the drier and deeper feeling of the actors, is betrayed by the excess of character that closes the film. A) Yes; a fine triumph, on a small scale, is sabotaged; but we must remember the many positive points. <br /> <br /> Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
