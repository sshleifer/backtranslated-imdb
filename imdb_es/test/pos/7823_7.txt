This is a television movie made by Hallmark. Hallmark has always made quality films that are family oriented. Just Desserts is a boy and a girl who fall in love while working together on a movie. Two bakers compete for a prize of $ 250,000 against a sector of professional bakers. It is fun and cheerful. The desserts look very good. The film has a catchy and optimistic little song that plays during the competition. I guess it's made for the song of the movie by Roger Bellon. Too bad there is no soundtrack available. I would really like to get a copy of the song. I do not even know the name of the song, because the credits are crushed at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of promotions. Anyway, the cast is great. It's always good to see Brenda Vaccaro. She is very bubbly and optimistic. Lauren Holly is always an advantage and Costas Mandylor completes the good ones with a wonderful performance. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck has a special appearance. It's worth watching the movie.
