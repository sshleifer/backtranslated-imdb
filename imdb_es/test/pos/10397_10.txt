The first time I saw the movie was a couple of years ago and it totally and absolutely impressed me, but its sensuality. It's one of the most moving movies I've seen, although it may seem a bit pretentious and artificial, too beautiful, so to speak. Anyway, one thing is for sure: the cameraman has done a great job: each image deserves to be cut from the film and shown as a separate artistic peace, comparable to the paintings of Chirico or Bernard Buffet. <br /> <br /> The music forms a perfect background for the story, especially that of U2 that is played between the first and the second novel in the beach scene. As for the casting, I can not be objective since I like Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue a lot and I can not add more to the praise of others. <br /> <br /> However, the very fact that many people (critics and those sophisticated in film) criticized the film made me see it with a more critical eye for the second time. Without a doubt, the stage is splendid and the casting is magnificent. But this is not enough to make a complete and cohesive film. The second novel (when Sophie Marceau tells her story to Malcovic is superficial and does not say much about the motivations of the people involved, was it just about filming a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked Marceau or what?) . Apparently, it adds nothing to the idea of ​​the film and even Malcovic's husky voice can not link it to the main plot. <br /> <br /> Other stories are more justified and very well recorded, which please many of the logical fallacies within them. The scene in which Jean Reneau dominates the city through the huge window of his apartment at the top of the tall building is absolutely incredible. The sensation of damp air and fine mist, which is spreading through the first scene "Ferrera", can be felt literally through the screen. Without a doubt, Antonioni is a great teacher of shadows and semi-shades. My favorite novel is the last one, the most romantic, profound and significant, I think it's the closest one to Antonioni's in the whole movie, almost a parable. Probably, the overall positive impression of the film is mainly due to the last shot somewhere in a small Italian Gothic town, with its narrow winding streets and twisted sidewalks, fountains with the drinking and monumental cathedrals of the leau ... It was laconic but really moving. <br /> <br /> I hope that my impressions and comments about the film, however chaotic, would motivate someone to spend the afternoon watching it (it works better in the home theater, having someone by your side by your side , that in the cinema). Enjoyment. <br /> <br /> I apologize for imperfect English and any possible misspellings
