Spoiler Alert I worked as an extra in this Lifetime TV movie (filmed in Seattle). It is really interesting when you participate in the production of a film, because, in general, they are still in the process of writing parts (as was the case here) or making editing cuts and important changes in the final parts. <Br /> <br /> My husband and I worked as extras in this movie, and I remember them discussing on the set how it had not yet been determined whether the girl died or not at the end. Frankly, I never thought that the character of Margaret Colin really received an adequate punishment for the crime of running over and running away, lying to the police, covering up, etc. Could you imagine how he would have had to change the ending if she had ended up killing the hit? Victim instead of ending up coming out of his coma, okay? Only something to think about. <br /> <br /> By the way, I play a police detective that you can see for a split second and my husband plays another detective that you can see very often (we've counted four times). It was great to work with Margaret Colin and it was very realistic, although Lisa Vidal (now regular for life) was distant. <br /> <br /> In general, the film turned out to be a 7/10, but like other The poster commented, it is still a true jumper of tears and makes an excellent cable movie on Saturday afternoon.
