This is one of the great modern movies of kung fu. Many of the criticisms seem to overlook the fact that the comedy is based on a rather subtle contrast (sometimes, directly on your face) between old and new China. Kara Hui, for example, gets the name of peasant and gets into trouble every time she tries to adapt to the new, but in the end to save their families, dresses the honor dresses as an old-fashioned heroine in contrast to the style modern military of Hsiao Ho. Gordon Liu seems to have played his part for the laughs by playing his seriousness, monk character with silly wigs and a guitar. The final fight is simply fantastic and ends in a defeat for Johnny Wang instead of death. Kwan Yung Moon should be mentioned for his great portrayal of a bully with "invincible armor", just great. And Kara Hui does a magnificent performance and fight. A great movie.
