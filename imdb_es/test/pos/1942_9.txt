Crispin Glovers' way of acting (and not just his) is tremendous. You really want to believe him because his body language and performance fit the perfect person. It gives Layne this extraordinary personality that makes this movie a cult. Besides Feck, what role Dennis Hopper does very well. It is about choosing the right or wrong side, without a logical thought about the scene. Friendship is more important, and that is exactly what I think is what makes elections so difficult. Rivers Edge allows you to experience this with serious tones and familiar mathematics. I really enjoyed watching it. I saw him a month ago for the first time, but if you like a nice feeling from the 80s, this is what you have to see. It's the same thing I did not know before.
