This was a wonderful little movie that was really creative and fun, something that is rarely seen in movies. The film begins in Russia just after the fall of the communist government. As a result, society seems to be in chaos and life has yet to improve now that the old regime is gone. Dirty cities, crime and homelessness still plague poor residents of St. Petersburg. <br /> <br /> In this scene of desolation and uncertainty comes an idealistic music teacher. He is among those who are homeless and FINALLY receives a letter from the government telling him he has a small room in a nearby apartment. When he arrives, the place is a mess, but the people seem kind enough that everyone has a lovely party. In the middle of the night, an old woman wakes them out of the giant wardrobe of the room (I was expecting Lucy and the other children from THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, to leave, but they did not.) They are too shocked to do something at first, but decide to investigate soon. Instead of being just a clothes closet, the closet opens to Paris. How the residents of the apartment respond to this magical door is really intriguing. Some, like the music teacher, are delighted and amazed. Most of the others are more pragmatic and are more concerned with looting everything from Paris before the door closes once and for all! These Russian thieves are horrible people, greedy, rude and rude, but very deep, VERY DEEP, they are hearts of gold. I like how this is a metaphor for the nation that is now on the verge of capitalism. At first, they go crazy and take everything they can, and only later reveal some depth, but mostly they act as guests at THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW! The movie has many twists and turns and is fun and fascinating. The only negative thing is that, due to a harsh language and a naked scene (although very funny), this is not a movie for children. This is a real shame, because with a very small edition, it could have been a great family movie.
