This is the standard fare of a director who has always been among my favorites. <br /> <br /> Although it is very flat compared to many of your other works, but it is Argento and this may be partial, but I am going to give you a good review anyway. <br /> <br /> It contains many good ideas. The subtle voyeuristic element. The needles under the eyes. The bloody and disturbing deaths. And the flashing of the clich√© of Argento. <br /> <br /> The disadvantages include the heavy metal soundtrack, the acting and the ending. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is worth it for the birds in the theater sequence near the End. <br /> <br /> A pretty good film by Argento, but he did it better. Better!
