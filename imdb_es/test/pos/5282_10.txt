It is rare for a movie to drag you into your world and leave you wanting more once the credits come out. Ponyo by Hayao Miyazaki is a movie of this kind. <br /> <br /> The film is the story of a young goldfish named Ponyo who wants to become human. She swims to the shore and is found by a young man named Sasuke who promises to take care of her. Of course, Ponyo's father, an environmentally obsessed sorcerer named Fujimoto, tries to prevent Ponyo from becoming human to maintain the balance of nature, which eventually becomes when Ponyo finally transforms into a girl, causing a massive typhoon. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is a very rich movie. It is full of wonderful fantasies, adorable characters and a genuine heart. What director Hayao Miyazaki has done here is tell a little story, and at the same time create an authentic movie magic. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is a lovely experience. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true. In addition, the environmentalist within Miyazaki remains as evident within this film as in all his previous works. Miyazaki shows the filth and filth that fall into the ocean in an almost surprising way, not to mention that Ponyo's father is on an obsessive mission to clean the world's oceans. While the story is simple, Miyazaki manages to add this additional layer to provoke thought with expert skill. <br /> <br /> The film is a beautiful work of art, each cell drawn by hand looks like a wonderful painting in pastel colors. The film looks very different from many other Studio Ghibli productions, but the art is still as spectacular as ever. The scenes under the water are simply beautiful to see, Fujimoto's fortress under the sea is very ingenious, and the sequence in which Ponyo runs through the jumping fish into the typhoon to get to Sosuke is iconic. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is thanks to His beautifully executed characters that make this film such a memorable experience. Sosuke is a young boy who acts older than he really is, and the energetic Ponyo is a laugh per minute. Each character is so nice and memorable. <br /> <br /> In general, Ponyo is a wonderful experience, charming in every way. While the film can be sold as a fairy tale for children, I believe that many adults will be dragged into their fantasy world along with their children. While the film may lack the density of some of Miyazaki's previous works, here he keeps it pure and simple, being true to himself, presenting a fun, comforting and entertaining film, all in one. This is a magnificent movie. <br /> <br /> I give Ponyo a perfect 10 out of 10!
