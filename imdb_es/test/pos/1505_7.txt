Lucio Fulci was one of the most prolific Italian directors at the time of his death in 1996, however, his career had long since descended into a downward spiral of increasingly useless genre entries that could barely be in the shadow of his previous work. For much of the 1970s through the mid-1980s, he created stylistically distinctive horrors such as "The City of the Living Dead," "The Beyond," and the brutal giallo "The New York Ripper," fondly remembered by fans as myself. And while "Cat in the Brain" falls into the era of Fulci's decline as a filmmaker, it's a shocking and very fun journey that, while a work clearly inferior (the framing, effects and acting are below average) , demonstrates interesting and open Meditation on pop psychology and cinema's ability to desensitize. Make no mistake: "Cat in the Brain" is a total gorefest, and as disconnected as the previous films by Fulci, but it deserves credit for trying to be something else. In a delightfully ironic twist, Fulci plays himself: a director in the middle of filming another violent horror film that suffers perverse / murderous hallucinations; After visiting a psychiatrist who puts him under hypnosis, his dreams and reality begin to interbreed, to the point where the viewer can not discern the two. The recent DVD of Grindhouse Releasing mentions "Cat" as an apparent heir to the likes of "Eraserhead," and has an equally disturbing, awkward, and fun quality associated with the best surrealist art.
