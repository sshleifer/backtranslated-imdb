The actor who became director Bill Paxton continues his promising debut, the "Fragility" of Gothic horror, with this sports and family drama about the US Open in 1913, where a young American hip rises from his humble background to play against his brutish idol in what was called "The best game ever played." I'm not a golf fan, and these not so popular sports movies are a dime a dozen (the most recent was made with great effect with "Miracle" and "Cinderella Man"), but somehow this movie captivated anyway. <Br /> <br /> The film begins with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disney version of the animated opening credits of "Carnivale" and "Rome" from HBO), but it moves slowly during its first hour of numbers . Once the action moves to the United States, things recover very well. Paxton does a good job and shows a special ability for management success (I loved the rain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the opening) that drives the plot even further or adds some unexpected psychological depth to the procedures. There is a development of convincing character when the British Harry Vardon is obsessed by the images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed their family home as a child to make way for a golf course. It also does a good job of visually representing what happens in the heads of players under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, gets alive here. The scenography designers and the costume department must also be given credit for creating an attractive atmosphere in London and Boston at the beginning of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> You know how this will end not only because it is based on a true story, but also because movies of this genre follow the same template over and over again, but Paxton presents a better show than the average and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than the one before him. In spite of the nature formulated, this is a pleasant and easy to encourage movie, since it deserves to find an audience.
