I do not think this caricature was as bad as some may think. Of course, he was only five years old at the time he left. But, I found it very entertaining at that time and even today I would take a look if I had the opportunity. Batman and Robin voiced by Adam West and Burt Ward were a nice touch, and they gave me a sense of familiarity to me, as I was also watching the replays of the 1960s live action "Batman" championship at that age. This caricature also introduced some new twists that I had forgotten, such as "Bat-Mite", for example. Looking back, I'm sure it was as annoying as many people think, but it did not bother me that much at the time. The best I can remember, his voice sounded like a cross between Dumb Donald and Orko. Gee, I wonder why? :) Anyway, take a look if you can and make up your mind. You would be surprised.
