Every guy that Liv Tyler meets loses her head for her, not, of course, without a little encouragement from Liv. Liv is at her best, with Matt Dillon's tapas among the lovers. An interesting initial premise, to tell the story from the perspective of each victim, degenerates into a comedy-style ending (not unlike Blame It On Rio, with which it has more than a few similarities). It's worth seeing, though.
