This movie was just amazing. The writing was incredible, as was the direction and the acting. The story instantly interests you. This movie is one of those movies in which your heart beats all the time. As always, Damian Chapa is brilliant. the acting on the screen is as powerful as that of any Hollywood actor. The cast in this movie is perfect. Each character made the story more complete. The cinematography was captivating and elevated the film. It was totally stuck to the screen and I could not stop seeing it. He did not get up to buy popcorn or anything. This movie is one of the best of the year, maybe even the best. Rent this film definitely, I recommend this movie if you want to see a good movie filming or just for pure entertainment.
