I loved this movie, the audience that I was part of loved this movie, and the 7 year old girl who was with me loved this movie. We all laugh at the word games, the visual humor and the good feeling that you left the cinema when it was over. I could easily see why it was a huge blockbuster in France. I'm planning to buy the DVD, so I can watch it again and laugh at all the fragments I missed when I was laughing so hard the first time.
