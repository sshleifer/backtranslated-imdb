Being raised at the time this movie was released has probably influenced my superficial mind, but even so, this is not a bad movie in any way. It is a film about a hostage situation that involves a high school populated to a certain extent by young teenagers who seem unable to get out of trouble. What is wrong with that? It does not have great special effects, but so what? Who needs special effects? The decline of cinema began almost at the same time as special effects became popular. A coincidence? I do not think so. He turned the movies into a plot and potentially good feelings and turned them into a great light show without substances for innocent children and self-medicating. Well, you know, not all movies need special effects. Nearly three quarters of the films in the top 250 of IMDb have no special effects, but almost all Top Grossing movies of all time have some special effects. Think about it: Star Wars, E.T., Ghostbusters, etc. All the good movies, but the rest of the blockbuster movies are, in general, crazy with a non-sensual plot and a lot of candy. Well, some movies do not need that garbage. <br /> <br /> Excuse me for getting off a tangent, which I normally do, but I'm so sick of that special effects garbage. Back to the point: Toy Soldiers is simply a great movie. I admit that part of the content is a little cheesy and scammed, but what? Each film tears another to a certain extent. Think of Resovoir dogs. Innumerable sites of "appreciation" dictate the fact that the beloved Quentin Tarentino, who I admit I like, has copied many, many, many films in the making of his first important film, Reservoir Dogs. Many say that the whole plot is torn up almost scene by scene from the Japanese and Chinese gangster films that Mr. Tarentino loved so much, and probably still does. I'm sorry once more for the tangent. <br /> <br /> Toy Soldiers is fun. It has all the insubordination of adolescents to the unwanted members of the authority, that is, the kidnappers. It's fun to watch children take over when they're being held back for something they do not want to do. Demons, teenage rebellion inspired by anguish was the key issue for a large majority of comedies of the 80s. In addition, there is tension and emotion that the characters use firearms and eliminate bad guys, etc. Also, there are some emotional points in the movie. When one of the characters dies, the others have to face and adjust. It is not the perfect performance, but it surpasses most of the other guts that exist. <br /> <br /> In summary, Toy Soldiers is exciting, interesting and fun. How dare you bored swaggers rate this movie wrong? What a shame! <br /> <br /> Personal evaluation: 8/10
