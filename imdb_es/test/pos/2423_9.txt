*** SPOILERS *** Feeling lonely and needing company, as well as loving Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, keeps all of these emotions inside her as she traverses life as a popular single young woman who has many high class friends. But because of their deep insecurity, it keeps them at a distance. As for Frances, the male friends are not close to her age so she has no reason to have a romantic relationship with them. <br /> <br /> One early afternoon, when Frances was entertaining some of her friends, she sees outside the window of her apartment a young man, Michael Burns, sitting alone in the cold rain. Feeling helpless and only after her friends leave, Frances goes to the park and offers shelter to the young man in his place until the rain stops and even to stay overnight in a guest bedroom that he has. Immediately you can see that Frances is more interested in the young man taking shelter from the cold and rain, then he wants him to be a lover of friends or even to play everything for her and, as the film progresses, you will see that They were right. <br /> <br /> A really amazing performance by Sandy Dennis that, in a way, looks a lot like the performance of Kathy Bates Academy Award in the movie "Misery" that took place in 1990, some twenty-one years after. Frances thought that the young man was alone and homeless and, later, when he finds him, Mute sees the perfect person so that she has a true friend. He is in no way equal or better than her, like the friends he has, doctors, Indian chiefs, and therefore he is totally dependent on her. Later, it turns out that the young man is not the lonely and homeless person Frances thought he was. It is when she slowly discovers that he does not really need her as well as he does, by manipulating her, on the contrary, it causes Frances to become a compulsion of murderous proportions. <br /> <br /> A really strange film by director Robert Altman that delves into the depths of loneliness and depression of the human mind. The actress Sandy Dennis is perfect as the personality of Dr. Jekyll and Miss Hyde in their performance as lonely but at the same time dangerous Frances Austen and it is a pity that not only has not received an Academy Award for his role in the movie. but he was not even nominated for it. <br /> <br /> Like most of Robert Altman's films, there seems to be a lot of improvisation between the actors in the film and the ad lib dialogue, especially between young Nina's sister, Susanne Benton and her boyfriend Nick, David Garfield. The only thing in the film that I found confusing is when we see Frances go to a clinic in the city to have a complete gynecological exam and she tells the doctor that she hopes to get married very soon. Would your husband be the young man who stayed in his apartment? But besides that, the film adheres pretty well to the story and the ending is a real shock for the audience and for the young man. When finally, in the end, she realizes that Frances is not only a little extravagant, but she is also terribly crazy.
