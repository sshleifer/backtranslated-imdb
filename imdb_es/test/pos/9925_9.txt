I consider myself a casual fan of Dario Argento. For every good film made by him (like "Deep Red" and "Tenebre"), there seems to be one that is not inspired either (his output from "Opera" has tended to disappoint). However, it can not be denied that, when it is at its best, there are few horror directors who can overcome it. I consider that "Opera" is the best work of Argento. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the movie in which all your trademarks are present. There are no well-developed characters and the plot does not make much sense once you start to examine it. Still, think of Argento as a European equivalent of Brian DePalma: style is all that matters here, so much so that it becomes the substance. Typical of Argento, there are some sequences of beautifully filmed murders. Those who are not familiar with the work of man may perceive that as a sadistic commentary (and may be, considering the misogyny of time often), but it is really true. Argento organizes the murder with a complexity to the striking visual details. He truly makes graphic violence an art form. In addition, his direction and the appearance of his films are impeccable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, "Opera" is one of its most terrifying products. Argento is the only director in whom I feel that the rise of rock music works well in horror sequences (when others try to achieve it, it appears as corny). The performance varies, with Cristina Marsillach playing a young opera interpreter beautiful and reasonably friendly, but never particularly animated. The rest of the actors are professionals and do the work, but again, with Argento, acting is never the point. They are the beautiful colors, the terrifying violence and the general atmosphere of dream / nightmare of fever. (9/10)
