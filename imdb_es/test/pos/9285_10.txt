This program is, without a doubt, my favorite television comedy without comedies. Australia produces very few good shows, most of the television that I watch (and live in Australia) is from the United States and England. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this program is how controversial it is. Like when they passed the numerous security barriers at the APEC summit, posing as Canadian diplomats. <br /> <br /> The show is made up of pre-filmed stunts, a general satirical discussion of current world events and, sometimes, on stage. parodies All these come together to make a fabulous TV show extremely fun. Segments such as "Ad Road-test" and "Message from Osama bin Ladin" are fun. For anyone interested in watching a hilarious satirical comedy, then this is definitely the show you should watch. <br /> <br /> All the guys are great and do an excellent job entertaining you for half an hour. <br /> <br /> I would rate it 10/10.
