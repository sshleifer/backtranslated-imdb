Richard Condie is a Canadian wonder that must be shared with the world. Whether it's for beginning work like "Getting Started" and the Oscar-nominated "Snit" through "The Apprentice" and the digital fact of "La Salla," Condie is a precious local hero. But no single job puts a stamp on his career as "The Big Snit." And did I mention that he was nominated for an Academy Award? Darn tootin '. <br /> <br /> "The Big Snit", though clearly an old-fashioned message bearer from the 1980s (the short revolves around nuclear annihilation during the Cold War, but do not worry, it's so hilarious as hell), carries a broader meaning, as is most of Condie's work in a discreet way. While the planet escapes from Armageddon to protect itself, a couple discuss the annoying habits of others (Condie-style, he saw the furniture while she shakes her eyes literally). And do not forget to see it again and again, because there is always something to see. Condie loads this guy with innumerable visual gags and memorable phrases. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this incredible piece of animation to be tracked. In Canada, it is usually seen in a National Film Board video that includes other stellar short films (including the also fun "The Cat Came Back" by Winnipegger Cordell Barker). Americans will only have to dig a little deeper, but keep going? The reward is worth it.
