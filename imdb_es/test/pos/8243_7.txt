We went to the cinema waiting for an economic premiere and we obtained an artistic film. The film was digitally projected at approximately two thirds of the actual screen space with slanted edges, the classic digital projection, and had a limited stereo soundtrack that wasted on the cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was the same historical content that we have all seen before, but very disinfected to prevent the audience from getting sick. The live action scenes, what little there was, were constantly reused in a classic documentary style, which became annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised that only 4 people showed up to see it, I guess the rest knew something that we did not. <br /> <br /> I suspect that the producers made the film to recognize the ninetieth anniversary of Gallipoli. I have to wonder if they should have bothered. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten for trying, and out of respect for the ANZAC.
