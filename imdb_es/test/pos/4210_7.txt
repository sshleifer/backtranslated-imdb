This is a breezy entertaining drama with an excellent cast. Garfield is fine as a boxer who hides from the police with that motley crew the Dead End Kids. The most notable of these is the beautiful Billy Halop, which has some very moving moments. Gloria Dickson, who in real life died very young in the burning of a house, is strong and very attractive as Halop's sister, and in the first scenes, Ann Sheridan, on the verge of stardom, is a novelty. May Robson is very funny like a crusty old grandmother, but Claude Rains proves here that even a great actor can fail in the wrong punishment (who thought he would be a NYPD?). <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley proves he was a good director with or without musical numbers. The film moves at a tremendous pace and the sequence of the water tower is very exciting and well photographed. The end is artificial, and the plot is not surprising or original, but still I found this experience very pleasant.
