I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone, but, this imitates the reality of life in many ways and, if you are really honest with yourself, you will resonate with it in at least some of the scenes. br /> <br /> The performance is not only credible, but also convincing in a way that attracts the characters. Also, it's fun, without trying too hard. <br /> <br /> And, yes, I really believe that a sequel is justified, here. Watch the movie, you will understand why. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, especially if you like movies that have a real message.
