I saw the Anatomy when it came out and I bought it recently, and the sequel to 2003, and while I watch many foreign films in various genres, you have to watch the movies in their original language. Not only is it annoying to know that the voices do not belong to the actors, but that they always seem to be happy, as if the whole movie were a long or large toothpaste commercial. It makes an awesome movie look horrible and I have had to convert many of my friends who used to think that foreign films are not as good as American movies, that they are not "Hollywood enough". Also, the translation is never correct, it is too literal and ruins the vibe of the movie, even if it basically says the same thing. I saw the Anatomy only the other week in German and then with subtitles with my roommate because it was on his laptop and he did not want to lose parts when he could not see the subtitles because he was writing. 30 minutes and he begged me to let him finish his work and then start the movie with subtitles. He loved it! Both movies are awesome like the intellectual horror movies! Kelly
