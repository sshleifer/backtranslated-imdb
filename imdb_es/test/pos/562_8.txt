Anyone who is looking for an episode of "Law and Order" or "CSI" would have to look elsewhere, since the most basic elements of police or forensic work were totally ignored in this case. <br /> <br /> A murder was committed. Instead, all the police did was take a 15-year-old boy out of the street and take him to the only witness, a 65-year-old man, and say: is this the guy who did it? Of course, the old man thought that the child in the back of the police car had to be guilty. It did not matter that he did not look like the real murderer and was dressed in a completely different way. He should have shrunk, reverted his age for 5-10 years and change clothes. <br /> <br /> The police made no effort, and they admitted it! They did not do forensic analysis on any of the evidence, they did not question any other witness and they made a confession to a 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this compelling vision of the criminal justice system is that it happened right at the end of the road in Jacksonville, Florida. Let everyone begin to speak of "justice of the south."
