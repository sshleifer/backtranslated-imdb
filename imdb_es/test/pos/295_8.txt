You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is trite Or you can find a neutral value commentary on the madness of war (stripped of "judgment"); that layer is completely uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Or you can see this for the excellent entertainment value of Duvall's phrases, but that's just a coating for commercial chewing. <br /> <br /> You may try to see this as a 'realistic' film of the Vietnam War, but ask any veteran and he will reject that idea: most vets will say it sucks. <br /> <br /> Or you will see how one or not morality will play, there is nothing rich there either. <br /> <br /> Where I found that the value was in the excellent self-reference. Coppola needed a container with large enough dimensions (war) to adapt to the greatness of the multidimensional expert actor who plays "a great man". <br /> <br /> Brando the man was as nonconformist as the character Kurtz. The studios felt uncomfortable with their "method" of acting, however, he always excelled and won praise; The 'generals' feel uncomfortable with the 'wrong methods' of Kurtz, despite his strategic genius. <br /> <br /> So Coppola makes a movie about Brando's greatness. To insist, he is placed in the movie (like Hopper, a manic photojournalist loaded with multiple cameras) to shout his praises. Brando himself is only seen in the shadows and silhouettes, a brilliant cinematography of Storaro that only increases the power of the actor. And it comes out as the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes: "the horror ..." <br /> <br /> Other pieces of interest: the great use of camera perspectives from the point of view, including "being in the shooting" long before " Private Ryan "; the innovative use of sound, in particular the sinister sweeps of flanging and the sound representation of an acid trip. <br /> <br /> Do not get caught in the outer layers; The rich part that you must divest of this is the bright core of sound, vision and self-reference.
