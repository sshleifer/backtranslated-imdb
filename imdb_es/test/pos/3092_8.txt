Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the strangest and most disconcerting art films I've seen in my life. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, although it has elements of documentation of its images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder if it was really worth telling this story just so these images can exists. Basically, the film is the history of the earth and the creation of the earth filmed from the perspective of a stranger, whether strange or something otherwise indescribable, all in the Sahara desert. The title of the image refers to the illusion or reflection of images, both real and hallucinated, that people in the desert often witness. These are also known as mirages. <br /> <br /> The film opens with an airplane landing followed by the plane landing again and again and again and again and again and again and again. With each landing shot of the plane, the actual architecture of the location where it is landing and the plane itself begin to slowly dissolve with each other and become less and less real and increasingly reflective. The images in this movie only become more intense and unusual as the image continues. The film's narrative speaks of the creation of the universe as the alarming sexual images of sand and landscape pass through the camera. The shots go farther and farther in the desert and Herzog films what he sees and finds. The strangest reflections in the world are shown in the distance, while Herzog encounters some of the purest and photogenic collections of strangers you are likely to see. When the Leonard Cohen soundtrack begins, you can be sure that you are in the world of a madman who is in love with the universe. <br /> <br /> I can not say much more about this movie without ruining anything. , but I'll say it's a sobering experience and there's really nothing like this. I love watching movies that are only in their own classes. This film is certainly a good example of how Herzog loves to mix narrative and documentary narratives in an interchangeable way. Unfortunately, Fata Morgana stays longer, is welcome only a little, but when it nears its end, it is very likely that the images will be recorded in your mind forever. Definitely a must see for those who are obsessed with nature and the origin of the universe.
