I am surprised that this comedy, well above the average of the 80s, gets only 5.2 of all the IMDB voters. Dan Ackroyd makes his usual satirical turn as a con man who takes advantage of a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prison doctor. He retires to California to begin his work giving advice on a radio program that claims to be the infamous Dr. Lawrence Baird. The only person who knows he is an imposter is the drunken priest (Walter Matthau) who comes to be pampered by the new wealth of Ackroyd that has thrown him out. Charles Grodin also offers a good supporting performance. For its genre I think that this film deserves the same credibility as "Ferris Bueller" or "Trading Places". 7.5 / 10
