The first time I saw this movie in the form of a video. Even on a television screen, the views were impressive. Seen on the big screen in all its glory, it must have impacted people. <br /> <br /> As one or two other comments have pointed out, the history of the first pioneers and how they solved the problems of the terrain. The road to Oregon is as authentic as any movie. Therefore, it shows that it is totally unnecessary to take liberties with the truth, something that today's filmmakers should pay attention to, reality is enough. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on the struggle of the man against the elements and the hostility. natives The subplots are few and simple. But the basic plot is enough. Elsewhere I've reviewed Paramount's rival for the great trail, Fighting Caravans. Despite having a more sophisticated plot and better actors, Fighting Caravans lacks impressive scenes. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail must be mandatory.
