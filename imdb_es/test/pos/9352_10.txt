That's a good movie! Unfortunately, in 1947, the script of the film could not have followed the book from which it was adapted, but the murder of a homosexual would have been too hot to handle in that era. <br /> <br /> I thought everything The performances were outstanding, as were the screenplay, the direction, the brilliant black and white cinematography, the music and the black cinema atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I understand that in 1947 the film could not represent racism against blacks or prejudice. against homosexuals. (The explanation of Robert Young's prejudice against his grandfather who was Irish and who suffered this racism 100 years ago was rather boring, but the times dictated that the film avoid a re-examination of racism). <br /> <br /> I have an observation and a question to ask the viewer: 1. Did you notice that Robert Young did not point his gun when he shot and killed Robert Ryan who ran fast in the dark and Young fired from the window superior of history towards darkness without aim? 2. If Robert Young's grandfather was murdered 100 years ago in 1847 (the film was made in 1947) and Young was 40 years old, the timeline would not be logical. If the grandfather had been killed 50 years ago, the deadline would be realistic.
