This is a real cheesy sci-fi jewel! Peter Cushing adds a great personality to this midnite movie classic. <br /> <br /> I particularly like the sound design. The strange choppy voices of creatures and rhino creatures provide a strange background (Of course, the baby with little clothes does not hurt either!) <br /> <br />
