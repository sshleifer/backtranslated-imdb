Deep Water (2006) **** <br /> <br /> "It's indifferent ... it's there waiting for you to make a slip". Those words (paraphrased) are perhaps the best summary of the nature of the ocean that I have heard murmuring. His furies have no limits, including their loneliness. Those words come from the fascinating and heartbreaking documentary Deep Water. It is the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor who participated in the Sunday Times Race of 1969 around the world. If you do not know your story, it may be better to stop reading now. Do not read this or any other information about Crowhurst or the race. Find the movie and just look at it. <br /> <br /> After the first solo circumnavigation of the ocean in 1967, adventurous adventurers and observers began looking for the next adventure. This time the trip would have to be made without touching the ground or stopping on the road. Having fallen on hard times, Crowhurst saw the race as a great opportunity for his family to stand up again. He had experienced economic difficulties as a child, and wanted to participate in returning to that life. So he set out to find sponsors, and soon he did it at Stanley Best and Rodney Hallworth. The two men spelled out the potential source of income, and they gave Crowhurst a boat, on the condition that if he left the race he would be forced to pay the expenses. However, his ship needed to be repaired, and he feared that it was not ready in time for the last day of departure. However, his sponsor informed him that he should simply go. after all, they put the dough and waited for it many times. <br /> <br /> The details of the story are infamous: the Crowhurst boat started drinking water, and its progress was reduced to a crawl. Faced with the decision to try to surround the Horn of Africa (some death in a boat) or to retreat (financial devastation and misery), he sought a third option. He chose to hide, alone on his yacht, waiting for other competitors to round out Cape Horn in South America. From there he would rejoin the race. Reported false positions, and record record speeds. Then he stopped all communication for fear that his position would be revealed. He also had to carefully build fake registration books for each day of a trip he did not make. Finally, the loneliness, the guilt, and the understanding that they would probably catch him weighed too much on Crowhurst. Your final log entries make a Kurtz's reflections seem completely healthy. Only a few weeks after his home, he went around his boat and is said to have jumped overboard shortly after. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst's odyssey is fascinating, and its end is heartbreaking, but it is inevitable. Our dreams often become fears, and the consequences of our actions often leave us with few options for a happy ending. It is the story of a descent into madness, in which the infinite abyss of the cruel seas is inflated. The filmmakers do a wonderful job telling this story. It is composed of chilling audio and video recordings made by Crowhurst, and narrations of his increasingly maddening record notes. The story begins slowly, and may distract some viewers, but the rewards of the story are totally worthwhile as it progresses. <br /> <br /> There are also questions about some of the other competitors, like Frenchman Bernard Moitessier, who was on par to win the speed competition, only to retire and start a second trip around the world. Also in the film is Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the winner of the competition. He donated his cash prize to the Crowhurst family. <br /> <br /> To read briefly about the Crowhurst saga simply does not do justice. Of course, it's interesting, but a quick search avoids the raw emotions and quirks that are presented here. The final moments of Deep Water are truly heartbreaking, listening to the thoughts of your widowed family and the adoration and understanding of your friends. This is a fascinating story, and it is the one that takes the documentary to such great channels.
