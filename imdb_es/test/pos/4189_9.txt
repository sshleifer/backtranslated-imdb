I can not believe that this is not a great cult success. Maybe people in 1968, thinking of the Monkees as foolish of the Beatles pop band, refused to see it. That cynicism probably covered him from sight since then. Do not make this mistake. _Head_ is an amazing movie that most open-minded people will appreciate. It's very funny and very smart (and very trippy).
