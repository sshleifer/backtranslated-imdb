I love this movie! Has it all! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job co-writing, directing and co-starring in this movie. David Duchovny is simply hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. Combine all that talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson and Jim Belushi. You have a film worthy of an Oscar! I'm surprised they did not receive one. If you have not seen it, go rent the DVD, watch it once and then put the comments of the directors in ... Bonnie Hunt is fabulous!
