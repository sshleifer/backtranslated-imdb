Being a retired medical / health field "in the vineyard", I never tire of seeing this movie. Paddy Chayefsky was a friend of my professor of higher education and visited him during several classes in 1958. His writing ability has stood the test of time and the "Hospital" is as new as it was in 1971. I can see it all week and I still find something new. Many of the supporting cast members went to bigger and better roles both on TV and in movies. George Scott made only a few comedies, but his time and skipper are as good as Jackie Gleason and Steve Msrtin. Mental humor instead of physical / slapstick wins in my book every time. And it's still a family movie with only 1 word of four letters throughout the film.
