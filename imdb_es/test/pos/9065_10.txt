I really loved this original script and the different places that took me, emotionally, spiritually and simply ridiculous things. I did not get caught up in the "credibility" in the script or the actors and I did not even think about it until I read the reviews that appear here in IMDb for the film. Listen to Michael Parness talk in the question and answer session about his idea of ​​the movie, want to see how crazy people or the "f'ed", as he said, fall in love is really interesting. I identified with not having a storybook and I liked seeing the dysfunction at its best. I like to see David Krumholtz in everything he does and I have followed his career for some years. I think this is one of his best works and I tell anyone, just watch this movie to see an amazing young actor. I agree that Guillermo Díaz really was a scene stealer, and what he did with his character is really a great lesson in engagement performance. I laughed and cried so much in this movie and was disappointed that I did not win any prize at the festival. I wonder why that did not happen. I gave Max and Grace a ten because these interesting Indie independent films deserve an audience. Technically watching this movie, is it very well done? The colors are incredible and, finally, it is one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a movie in a long time.
