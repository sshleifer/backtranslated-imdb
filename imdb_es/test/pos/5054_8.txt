I was glad when I saw that my husband rented "Labyrinth of passion". I love the almodovar movies. We both loved the movie. We both could not stop laughing. We especially enjoyed the scene in which the transvestite is filming a photo novel, and while he is allegedly being threatened by a killer with an electric drill, he is told to answer the phone and say: "I can not talk to you at this time, I do not know". I'm being attacked by a sadistic serial killer. If I survive, I'll return the call. "(That would make a great answering machine message think it.) We also loved that the lady told her new beloved beloved:" I went to an orgy after the concert, but I could not stop thinking about you "(I'm waiting to use that line on Twitter)." Labyrinth of Passion "is a fascinating farce with a lot of jokes, a hilarious dialogue and goodies for everyone.The film has aged well: the costumes and Hairstyles from the 80s add to the madness, I would give it a rating of 10 out of 10, but I give it an 8 for two reasons: the first is the scene involving laxatives, which includes a photo of a lady who gets dirty herself Same: totally unnecessary, and reduces for a moment the tone of the film to the Hollywood comedy.The second is the suggestion that Queti is sleeping with his father: shocking, yes, but again, ruins the tone of the film. Still, I would recommend the movie to any I wanted a sophisticated, spicy and fun moment.
