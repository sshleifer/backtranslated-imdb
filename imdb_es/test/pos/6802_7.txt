This was one of the first color films I saw in the movies when I was a child. It is good to remember it. The girl, Liz Taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, starred along with the small and excellent actor Mickey Rooney. The content of the plot of the film is good for all ages, good will and behavior. The good ethics of Velvet's parents, particularly her mother, is something to keep in mind. Our generations must be well educated and this movie can help this purpose. Velvet loves horses and racing, and My Taylor (Rooney) took her to an international horse racing competition in England, where in the end the young Velvet won, but was disqualified for being a woman.
