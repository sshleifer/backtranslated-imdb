I remember my dad hiring these episodes on video. My whole family loved them, and now that I've moved from home and have my own life, I'm trying to share these fabulous creations of Jim Henson with my husband and stepson, but I'm already starting to discover that not everyone is a fan of Henson. Which is a shame, since it means that you'll just have to put up with me looking for this series. But even if they do not seem interesting, I would strongly recommend to anyone who took over the Narrator. You will get lost in a world of stories from a time when people could only talk about unexplained situations through stories and how people should worry if they ever faced these situations.
