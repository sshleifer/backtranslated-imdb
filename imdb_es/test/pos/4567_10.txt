Claudine is a film that represents the worst of the American system. The social assistance system was initially established as a springboard for those families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet. The film showed an accurate description of how the welfare system breaks down the family unit. In other words, if the father or any male figure is in the lives of women and children, their financial support of the system would be jeopardized if it is not canceled. The struggles of the poor can be seen all over the world. I would like to see a reproduction of this movie in stores so that everyone can rent it or buy it for their library collection.
