Art imitates life, imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated in the D.A. in this tragic and moving moving documentary that looks more like who did it and how it happened. The authenticity and, at times, the reluctant honesty of individuals make this a compelling story in many layers. While racism is one of the issues, there are other elements such as work ethic, integrity and pain management that have led me to see and review this film over and over again. The music is driving but it does not bother; The rhythm and the images are such that there is no doubt that these are real people who go through an authentic experience.
