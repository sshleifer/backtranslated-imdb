Many of us find art enjoyable only when the masterpiece touches something deep within us. That is, the complete creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow relate to it personally. It was winter, here in Australia, 1992, when I saw Batman Returns in theaters and I was surprised. Both "I's". It was supposed to belong to an ideal, a standard, but at the same time I was living another life. Tim Burton was the first filmmaker to say that it's okay for a comic movie to be dark and confess that darkness can happen to all of us. After the performances of Tim Burton in Batman, many other heroes of dark comics and antiheroes flooded the cinemas. The folklore of comics for decades had told about friendly and friendly heroes with handsome smiles and magical superpowers that fly in the sky, and they wove powerful fabrics from the wrists, wore red boots and had the strength of a locomotive. But what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents executed coldly in front of your eyes? You clasp Somewhere in your psyche, your young and delicate psychological makeup separates. The only way to control this pain and this pain is to create an alternative person. You make a promise. Your other self will be stronger, use all the wrath of anger to use any means available to avenge the innocence of your parents on that criminal, those criminals, any criminal. This is the life seen through the eyes of Bruce Wayne. Both pairs. The world you see is dark, dark and cold. Although he patrols the streets and people hear him pass by, they do not rush to get his autograph. He is your Savior, not the winner of a personality contest. Batman Returns is about losers. Batman, for yet another Christmas, is still "the only beast of the lonely man in the city." Bruce Wayne never arrives to legally arrest the vile Max Shreck. The Penguin never gets to unleash his pain of being thrown out by his parents to the citizens of Gotham, and Selina Kyle is lost forever because she is mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero does not get the girl or the cat. This film deepens the desire of all of us to desperately want to belong, to have a home, as expressed by Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot. The film raises a need for all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by Selina Kyle, Oswald and of course Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are all repressed in one way or another, we are told to be an ideal, to behave according to a certain standard. That is until it finally breaks. There is only hope left at the end of the film when we see Catwoman rising towards the night sky. But whatever happens, we must all desire goodwill towards all men and women. As for me, I can not say that I will reach a point where I will believe that my problem with duality will be reconciled. But that's okay. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not only the best of Batman movies, it is an exceptionally outstanding masterpiece of storytelling.
