Rififi deservedly deserves a big mention for the famous robbery scene and, in fact, that scene deserves all the credit it receives. It is a masterpiece of suspense, character interaction and photography. But Rififi is not just this scene: all the scenes in the film are so well-armed, and as a whole, the film is not only taught with suspense, plot and character, but it is a cleverly narrated moral story that prepares the scene. Noire cinematic in the coming years. <br /> <br /> Kinematically and technically, the robbery sequence may be the most impressive scene in the film, but for me, it is the final scene that has the most power: the hallucinogen of Tony le St√©phanois Driving towards redemption .
