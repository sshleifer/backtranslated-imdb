Two people living in the same apartment complex discover that their partners have a mutual adventure. While they try to reconstruct how it happened, they also embark on an emotional journey that seeks resolution. <br /> <br /> From his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar Wai gives us this A pretty old-fashioned and wonderful story of revived passions, longing and unrequited love. <br /> <br /> Possibly, In the mood for love is not to everyone's liking. He wanders rather lazily at 98 minutes: it's not particularly long for a movie, but it seems longer because it does not really happen much. But this lazy feeling hides a fairly well-constructed movie. Most of the story is cleverly interwoven around a series of role-playing games, where the characters represent supposed scenarios between their respective spouses, trying to figure out how the affair began. I say cunning because, of course, this makes it difficult for the audience (and the characters) to say what is "in the role" and what is genuine. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds rather artistic and shy, it is because it is. Shamelessly like that. And it is played to perfection by two of the best of Hong Kong, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan. <br /> <br /> It is also a virtuoso performance of Wong Kar Wai , which treats the audience to sensory and sensual overload. Bringing together Christopher Doyle (who later implemented his exuberant and over-mature style on Hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose beautifully understated style can be seen in Springtime in a Small Town) was a cinematic genius. It has all the bold beauty of Doyle, without, frankly, the Athena-poster cheese of his work in Hero. Music, as always with Wong, is prominent. From Nat King Cole singing in Spanish to the disturbing strings of the main theme, it perfectly combines the eclectic beauty of the images. <br /> <br /> In general, a first level film, whether judged by plot, performance, cinematography or soundtrack. Similar to, but more accessible than, Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, this is a beautiful and ancient story about lost and recovered love. <br /> <br /> And beware of Tony Leung's hotel room 2046, which presages the recent Wong movie of the same name.
