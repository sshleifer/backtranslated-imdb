The fact that there is so much fuss is ironic, since the main objective of the program was to highlight the way in which the media treat these "taboo" issues, such as pedophilia. The set of the news table, the costumes, the presumed presenters, the men in the scene screaming about things that can be seen behind them, the graphs and statistics without sense, everything was a satire, a very funny satire. the way c-list celebrities will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them that it will be good for their career ("there is no evidence of that, but it is a scientific fact"). It can be hard to see (with Milly Dowler and the girls from Cambridgeshire, as well as 9/11), but satire is supposed to be a challenge, and we should not be afraid to face the blatant protagonist and the headlines. just because it is a delicate matter. The way in which this program won no television awards for its intelligence, observation, courage, acting and provocation of thoughts is shameful, but, seeing it, it will show you, not in the least, surprising.
