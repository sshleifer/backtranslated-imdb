Sheba Baby is always underestimated, probably because she has a pg rating instead of the usual r rating she gets from a Grier movie. all that pg means is that Pam does not remove the cap, but removes it in all the other films she has been in. It's more exciting than Coffy, more action. It takes off slowly, but by the time it is on the screen, the excitement has begun. Like Dolemite d'urville, Martin is the heavy one who tries to get Sheba's father, but she does not. She waged a war against a woman against Martin and his gang of friends. the best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car that I'm still laughing at. I thought it would be stupid due to the classification of pg, but I was wrong, it replaced sex with violence and in a blaxplotation movie that can only be good.
