I was quite impressed by Martha's narrative and how it affected the emotional feelings of the audience, as well as how it should have impacted the family. The forward and backward movement of the story was well done, and I usually do not enjoy movies with the flashback / flashback effects. I felt throughout the evolution of the film that "surely Tommy did it". It leaves you with an idea of ​​how these people lived their lives almost totally devoid of each other and the consequences of not having any desire to answer the question: "It's 10 o'clock. Do you know where your children are?" And besides, "What the hell are you doing?" Or "Do I care?" Rich and spoiled brats literally escape murder. Or so they thought .......
