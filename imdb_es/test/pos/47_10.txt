Lackawanna Blues is an excellent movie. The casting was perfect. Each actor and actress was perfectly suited to the role they played. Their chemistry together was incredible. The performance was excellent. I felt as if I knew the characters. I could almost "feel them". They reminded me of the people I met as a child and grew up in the 50s and 60s. Oh, the memories !! My personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for everyone to see. I've seen this movie so many times, I can almost recite the lines when the characters say them. I can not even list my favorite part, because I have MANY favorite parts. Thank you for recovering a part of my youth that I have never seen in this era ... and that is that blacks love each other, take care of themselves, respect each other, take care of each other and do everything we do. They can help each other. I have to go now. I have to go see him again.
