In my review that I just sent, I referred to the young actress who had addressed herself as Katerina when Veronika should have been. I was so involved with the character and the action, I guess I was not so concerned about the names. Anyway, she and the movie are brilliant. As I said, the cinematography and the use of the director's montage are worthy of Eisenstein and his cameraman, Tisse. The production design is first class. The location of the actors in the foreground, the intermediate terrain and the background within any given staging is worthy of study. Impressive, memorable camera movement, and an ending that has an emotional blow that leaves Hollywood movies far behind. Caramba! Heroic self-sacrifice instead of walking towards the rainbow. Thanks again, John Hart
