My father took me to see this movie when it was released in 1976. He was just a child and it scared me so much. So much that I had to leave the theater during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene since it was too intense for me! I went home to the safety of my family. I watched the movie to the end as I grew up and enjoyed it very much. However, pity about the men in monster costumes. If you ignore the cheapness of the production and go deep, you will find an excellent performance by Cushing, an incredible opening score, a good photograph and the always reliable Mr. Douglas McClure, my childhood hero. British police guard the White House in the end! Titty bang bang cave woman! Monster with beaks! Actors in monstrous suits sliding on cables! This has it all! Magnificent.
