The first time I saw this movie was in 1994 or '95 during my first year in high school when I was on Lifetime. After I saw it for the first time, I thought it was wonderful. Of course, it may not have run longer, but it is as accurate as it may be in my opinion (regardless of what someone else might think). Cynthia Gibb was excellent at playing Karen, and Mitchell Anderson was fine as Richard. Louise Fletcher (Yes, who played Nurse Ratched in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" in 1975) was also fine, but I discovered that her version of Agnes (Karen and Richard's mother) was a bit crazy about control . I am an EXTREMELY BIG LOVE from the Carpenters, and I think Karen's voice was and still is so wonderful. I am really saddened by the fact that she has left and left this land too soon, but thanks to the endless popularity of her music and her angelic voice, the music will continue. Anyway, going back on the road to this movie, it's really a mystery to me and possibly to other people (fanatics and not fanatics of the Carpenters) as to what caused Karen to end up having this problem with her health. Were the media responsible or was it just Karen's decision? I would not believe it was his decision. It could have been the media of an article that was printed on her somewhere in '70, when her hit "Close to You" came out (from what was shown in the movie). There are also other moments in the movie. Richard's fight with drugs and Karen's brief marriage. I did not hear about his loss in February 1983, since he was not yet watching the news; I had found out years later. I do not know if there will be another movie about the Carpenters or Karen in the future, but until then, this movie will be fine. However, I will say this: if Karen had ignored the false details of that article or any future article that might have been published with similar content calling her "chubby" (which must have been a real insult), she would still be here in this. the earth today I know that she is in heaven and probably entertains everyone with her beautiful voice. God bless you, Karen!
