The sad thing about Frontline is that once you see three or four episodes, you begin to understand that it is not very far from what happens in real life. What is really sad is that it is also extremely fun. <br /> <br /> The Frontline team in Series One consists of Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence), a man who really lives and dies simply because of the ratings his program receives. Every once in a while, his tricks to achieve these ratings see him run with his line producer Emma Thompson (Alison Whyte); a woman who has not lost all her journalistic integrity and is prepared to defend moral scruples at times. The same can not be said of Reporter Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy), a reporter who has taken all the substance, so much that interviewing Ben Elton should be instructed to laugh. Her reports usually consist of interviewing celebrities (with whom she has or has not met before) or scandalous and unethical reports that are generally counterproductive. Martin De Stasio (Tiriel Mora) is the reporter with whom the team trusts in gravity and dignity, since he has the intelligence of 21 years of journalism behind him. His is not as principled as a nous of what makes a good journalistic story, although it does draw the occasional line. Parading about this chaos (by name) is Mike Moore (Rob Sitch), a selfish and naive reporter who can not see that he is just a pretty face for dirty journalism. He often finds that his morality is compromised simply because Brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest. <br /> <br /> Frontline is the kind of show that needs to be more, because it shows that while in modern times happiness, security and deep political vision are interesting things; It's much easier to qualify with scandal, fear and tabloid celebrities.
