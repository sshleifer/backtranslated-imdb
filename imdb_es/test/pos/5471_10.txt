I'm from Texas and my family took a vacation a couple of years ago to Sante Fe with my brother. He suggested we go see the church with the staircase. I was absolutely impressed by the miracles that took place there. The film is great: Barbara Hershey and William Petersen were perfect for the parts they played. It's incredible, absolutely incredible. If you have not seen the staircase in person, it's worth the trip to go see it. The wood is beautiful and the architecture is amazing. Just being in the chapel gives me goose bumps! Read about the history of the chapel and then see its beauty is impressive. See the movie - it's great! Then see the ladder in person!
