The film is partly a thriller and partly a public service announcement when viewing events through the perspectives of politicians, terrorists and, of course, victims. In this intelligent drama, lessons are given about pollution and surviving chaos, while, meanwhile, the way in which the crisis is handled makes the spectators distrust the guardians and get scared with the assailants. The film, originally aired on the BBC, raises questions about the official preparation. The performances are adequate, discreet, but never spectacular. The film is just the beginning, a provocative start that leads to a broader discussion but, in my opinion, it works, gives the right emotion and makes the audience reason and ask questions.
