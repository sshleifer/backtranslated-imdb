This is one of the best TV movies I've seen! The title makes it so obvious and predictable, but come on, all TV movies are like that! <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic. It may seem ridiculous, but it is based on an incredibly true story. Gary Cole plays a military man named Dave who feels trapped in his marriage. Abandons his wife and children and then fakes his death! Everything so that he can be with Alyson (Karen Chairs). How far will Dave go to keep his secret? <br /> <br /> The acting is first class for TV movies. Gary Cole, especially, keeps the film as a charming and soft-spoken sociopath that has an answer for everything when his wife suspects. Karen Sillas does the best she can as a wife who discovers that her husband is LIAR and does not know what to do about it. Teddi Siddall, who I believe is the wife of Gary Cole in real life, fulfills her role well, especially when she cries for the "death" of her husband. Wendy Makkena adds a nice touch like Alyson's sister. Linda Goranson is excellent in her small role as Dave's mother. <br /> <br /> Predictable, but acting and history take this film to several levels.
