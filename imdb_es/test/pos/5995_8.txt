<br /> <br /> This movie has some really impressive action scenes. Humor and action combine well, although the intensity of the film does not hold until the end. The last scene is a light anti-climax in terms of action quality and surprising explosiveness of the scenes that precede it. The humor does not seem to be as ridiculously clumsy as in many other Hong Kong movies, and this movie is of another kind than most American action comedies of recent years. Lau Ching-Wan acts as an intuitive and typical police hero who mocks the invalid orders of incompetent police superiors. The dialectic of the film is based on the superhuman coldness and cruelty of the drug gang, humiliating the police force and providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with a variety of machine guns. Leaving many corpses in its path. Yu Rong-Guang is especially impressive as a relentless and ultra cool gangster in this Woo-type action piece where hard guys are really tough.
