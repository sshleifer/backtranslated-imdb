Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film does not reach the quality of the television program, it is still very funny and has some really bad moments! I liked Ali G from the first time I saw the material of the program. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time ... up there, for example, Peter Dragon ("Action") and The Blues Brothers. The biggest surprise with this movie was that they actually have some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon). After this I will respect you absolutely even more, for having the good sense to take advantage of this opportunity. I have nothing really bad to say about this movie, it's very funny. Very young, but hey, so what? <br /> <br /> One more thing for mr. G: SEQUEL, PLEASE! <br /> <br /> **** / *****
