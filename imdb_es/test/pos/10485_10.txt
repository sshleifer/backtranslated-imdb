Directed, written, performed and filmed without fail, this calm and unpretentious Danish film is an example of cinema at its best, and if there is a person who can see BABETTE'S FEAST without being touched on a very fundamental level, it is a person who I do. It does not matter to know. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple. In the nineteenth century, two elderly single ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in the remote Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities and personal happiness to continue the religious ministry of their father for a long time until the small flock at what served . One of the young admirers of the woman sends them to a French woman, Babette (St√©phane Audran), whose husband and son have been murdered in France and who have fled their homeland so they do not have the same fate. Although they do not really need their services, the sisters hire her as a servant and cook, and as the years go by, her astuteness and tireless efforts on her behalf allow the aging congregation to remain united and for the sisters to live more comfortably in the community. They had. imagined in fact, the whole village admires it and depends on it. <br /> <br /> One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and now, by the standards of the village, she is a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters grant her the wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for themselves and for the members of her small congregation. The food and the night it is served is, in fact, a night to remember, but not for the reasons that can be expected, since Babette's party proves to be a nourishment for body and soul and, ultimately, It is a gift of love for the women who took her and the villagers who have been so kind to her. <br /> <br /> The film is extraordinary in every way, meticulous in detail but without dominating it in its presentation. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters both for their simple devotion to God and for their human weaknesses, and the scenes in which Babette prepares her banquet and in which the food is consumed are incredible, beautiful and incredibly amazing memorable. There have been several movies that have used food as a metaphor for love, but none is close to the simple art and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity that are nourishment for body and soul. Highly recommended <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
