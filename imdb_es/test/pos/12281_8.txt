The whole city of Blackstone is afraid, because they lynched Bret Dixon's brother, and he will return for revenge! At least, that's what they think. <br /> <br /> A great Johnny Hallyday and a very interesting protagonist of Mario Adorf in this Italo-Western, obviously filmed in the Alps. <br /> <br /> Bret Dixon returns to Blackstone to investigate why his brother was lynched. He is a loner and a gunslinger par excellence, everyone is afraid of him: the Mexican bandits (fighting the gringos who took their land!), As well as the "decent" citizens who lynched Bret's brother. They lynched him, because they thought he stole the money instead of taking him to Dallas to the bank's security there. But this is only half the truth, as we discovered in the course of this psychologically interesting western. <br /> <br /> But beware, it's a depressing movie, since everyone turns out to be guilty in some way and definitely everyone is bad for the bone ... <br /> <br /> Even so I enjoyed it a lot and I gave it an 8/10. Strange, that only less than 5 people voted for this film as of January 12, 2002 ...
