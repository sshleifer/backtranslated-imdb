Dan Dailey gives a sincere and colorful performance as the great Dizzy Dean. His character handling is very true to life and captures the flavor of Dean's background and limited education. The movie, of course, centers around Dizzy Deans and his sudden trip to the sidelines with an injury he decided to ignore, much to his dismay. His wife is splendidly portrayed by Joanna Dru, who gives a very earthy quality to the woman who loved and supported the ball player who rose to a "vertiginous height" so quickly. The description of Dizzy's subsequent career as a sports commentator is honest and unwavering, reflecting his problems stemming from his bad manners and colorful language, both on and off the air. Dizzy was quite a character and Daily has given life to his story with admirable skill. If you liked this movie, I recommend the comedy "Kid from Left Field" (1953) in which Daily plays a ball player idolized by his son (Billy Chapin). Every day he throws a ball player again in a completely satisfactory way. I wholeheartedly recommend the Pride of San Luis to baseball fans.
