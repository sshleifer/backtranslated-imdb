Possibly the best role of John Travolta ever. Saturday Night Fever was a great movie and a great role, but a long time ago. I can not think of many of his films or papers that I have even liked, and it is easy to think of other rotten ones. You can do bad intentions like in Pulp Fiction, but it's the perfect funky angel, and it's hard to imagine someone doing a better job (just as slobby) with that. The summaries of the plot are available everywhere, but the plot is not the point. Just go for the ride and enjoy the intelligence of the fun little ones on the way. There's nothing I do not like about this movie, unless you're looking for something deep. I wish there were more movies like this one. We need a break from the deep or amazing or creepy or complex or hysterical.
