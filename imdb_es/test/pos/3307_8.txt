You can not take this movie seriously ... the plot is predictable and hackneyed, the acting often on top, the dialogue is ridiculous; But everything adds up to great fun! Three "career girls" in the late 1950s find their way to the BIG city and all the evils and temptations that their mothers probably warned them about: married men, alcohol, premarital sex, abortion, etc. <br /> <br /> Then there is Amanda Farrell (Joan Crawford) who succeeded professionally, but whose personal life has been sacrificed by an office with her name on the door. <br /> <br /> This movie may have been credible 50 years ago, but now it's just great campy fun! Rent / buy and enjoy.
