I've heard many different opinions about this film and then discovering that Paris Hilton was in it did not give me the best impression of the movie ... to then be dragged to the movies by a group of my friends and sit there waiting for a lot of pants, I was surprised to find out that I was scared all the time the movie lasted ... it was predictable, but the accumulation of deaths and the whole atmosphere of the movie made it REALLY scary for me ... I was observing through my fingers all the path. So I say: go see it and decide for yourself and if the fact that it is a scary movie does not convince you to look at it, then you also have Chad Michael Murray in it, which can not be so hard to see during a couple of hours.
