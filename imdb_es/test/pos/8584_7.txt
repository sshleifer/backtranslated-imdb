I suspect that there is some revisionist history here, but definitely one moves away with the feeling that Patrice Lumumba was a cause of problems that incited his people to violence from the moment the Congo declared itself independent. His inability to control his people and his decision to bring Soviet aid to re-align his army was obviously what made the United States involved and led to his assassination. However, by replacing it with Mobutu, the United States did not resolve anything. They made the situation so bad. Well acted, with an excellent picture and a touching score. It's definitely worth seeing.
