Everyone wants Duvall and Jones to come back, come on! The spectators say things like: Zahn and Urban are not so deep ... Puhlease! Were you so deep when you were young? That is the point: they have a lot to learn. Zahn and Urban draw the superficial innocence with which they were directed to act, and with an excellent commitment to preserve the nuances of the contributions of Duvall and Jones to the characters. Zahn is flagrantly perfect like the first Gus, and Urban is subtly perfect like the first Woodrow. What a bold decision it must have been for them to assume such a position in the entertainment industry. They must have known that they would make everyone attack them because they are not really the original loved ones, but they clearly make the most effort. I gave it a 7 because the edition was choppy in some places, and the timelines were incomplete, but the performance was a joy to watch. Val Kilmer was absolutely great. One more thing: I hope that the audiences would have accepted more the mysticism that the appearances of a jaguar and blue and gold macaw imply if they had put more effort in the way they appear and are simply accepted by the characters.
