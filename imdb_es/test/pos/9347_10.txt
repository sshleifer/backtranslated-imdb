The first music video I saw, Thriller, my mother told me she took me home from the hospital and when we arrived, my sister had MTV on TV and Thriller was playing, my mother said I smiled. What nonsense, I know, but I have loved Michael Jackson since that day, the music video Thriller inspired me to dance, I still have the dance memorized until today. I even made it for an audience 3 times! The words can not describe the power of this song that makes you want to sing and dance, but Michael, of course, had to raise the MTV level at that time by signing with the American Werewolf director in London, John Landis, and directing the only, the only, Thriller. <br /> <br /> Michael and his partner, Ola Ray, run out of gas in a dark and wooded area. They go to the forest and Michael asks if he would like to go calmly. She accepts and he gives her a ring. However, he warns him that he is not like the others, not really, not like the others. A full moon appears, and Michael begins to convulse in agony. Transforming into a horrible werewolf! Her date screams and escapes, but the werewolf catches her, knocks her down and begins to attack her with her claws. The scene goes to a movie theater where Michael and his date are actually watching this scene unfold in a movie called Thriller. Michael smiles but his date is scared and tells him he's leaving. Michael reaches out and says it's just a movie, but she does not like his jokes and starts to walk away. Michael and his date then walk down a misty street, and he teases her with the opening verses of Thriller. They pass through a cemetery, where corpses suddenly begin to rise from their graves when Vincent Price performs his rap. Michael and his date are surrounded by zombies and, suddenly, Michael becomes a zombie. Michael and the undead perform together an elaborate song and a dance number, followed by the Thriller choir. <br /> <br /> Thriller is possibly the best music video of all time, the funny thing is that people who want to discuss that is with others. Videos of Michael Jackson, but what makes Thriller so special is the dance, the history, the effects, this was the most expensive music video of his time. Michael, of course, returned to the bar with his famous music video Scream and then again with Ghosts. But say what you want, Michael was the star of the 1980s, there was no celebrity like him, he loved life, he lived it, he breathed it and embraced it. Thriller is the proof that he was willing to work to do the best and that is what we got with the legend that is Thriller. <br /> <br /> 10/10
