I must admit that I liked this movie, and I did not find it all misogynistic. It could be subtitled, three ways to see LiV Tyler. Three different men become obsessed with the same woman and tell their stories to very different characters; a man (John Goodman) tells his story to a priest (the very funny Richard Jenkins). For the character of Goodmans, the character of Liv Tyler is an idealized character. Holy, the second coming of his sanctified wife, Theresa. For the character of Paul Riesers (who tells the story of a shrug (a subtle and subtle interpretation of the great Reba Mcintire), the character of Liv Tyler is simply an object of sexual fantasy (perverse) .Finally, Matt Dillons, a character Pretty foolish, tells his side of the story to a seedy hit man, played by Micheal Douglas All these three obsession stories are told simultaneously, and all are entertaining Finally, the film ends in a strangely funny climax. give away.
