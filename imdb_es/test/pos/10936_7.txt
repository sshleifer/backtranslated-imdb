There must have been some interesting conversations on the set of Eagle's Wing, with Martin Sheen immediately Apocalypse Now co-starring the actor he replaced in the Coppola film, Harvey Keitel. A true unwanted son of a film, which dates back to the last large number of westerns in 1979-80, was much criticized at the time for having been made by a British studio and director (conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic American westerns were directed by European émigrés), which seems to be an overreaction. <br /> <br /> The plot is simplicity itself, since Martin Sheen's inexperienced hunter finds himself fighting with Sam Waterston's non-syllabic Kiowa warrior for possession of the beautiful white horse, the Eagle Wing, through a rough and primitive landscape in a moment "before the legends began". Apart from the captivity of Caroline Langrishe's Irish governess, the supporting cast has little to do (Stephane Audran does not even open her mouth) and is a little slow, but Anthony Harvey's film features an excellent photograph of Billy's Scope Williams and a good score by Marc Wilkinson.
