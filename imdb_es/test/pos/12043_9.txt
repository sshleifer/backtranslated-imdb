Darr (1993) was an incredible movie. In my opinion, it is one of the best in Bollywood. The film itself provokes feelings of sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness and sadness. The role of Shahrukh was incredible, in fact he gave the obsession a new face. The innocent and feminine character of Juhi Chawla contrasted greatly with the passionate and passionate character of Shahrukh. The role of Sunny Deol made the role of "good guy" look like "bad boy". The fact that Shahrukh, not Sunny, captivated the attention of the public shows that everyone has that helpless internal impulse to pursue something that really is not in their hands. Even though the film is several years old, it surpasses any recent one. The song "Tu Mere Samne" was full of passion and meaning. His personality fits perfectly with the paper. I should seriously consider re-starring in a similar movie.
