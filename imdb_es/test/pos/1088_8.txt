Without music. Do not masala stupid. A reasonably realistic representation of the police system in India and based on a true specialist in "meetings" in India, Daya Nayak. That's Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolizes how many criminals the leader has killed "Sadhu Agashe" - well, you know) Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role of a relaxed and calculating Indian policeman. The phrases are very funny. The plot, although slightly predictable for review, is intriguing anyway. Another one of the films of Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory. Films that are decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan means almost very good. However, it remains one of the 70 best films released from India, including commercial and artistic. <br /> <br /> What's great is that the story relaxes and finally shows (in an Indian film) how the police network works. The cast is really very good but, seriously, the phrases are fun (although I do not know if the subtitled version will appear as fun). The producers are trying a release at Cannes, which is interesting. Made by the director of debut Shamit Aman (I think that's his name). <br /> <br /> Again 55 years Nana Patekar i Brillante far from their roles of silly screams from the past, it only shows what a good director can do with a good actor. Very good things If you're interested in Indian films and you dislike the nonsense that some of our guys give out, this is definitely a relief. <br /> <br /> Again, Patekar is the guy who happily takes the film on his shoulders and embodies the style of the movie: relaxed, fun, intelligent and calculating. Good dialogues, good acting, good direction, all in great things. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Ram Gopal Verma's Company (both Indian films)
