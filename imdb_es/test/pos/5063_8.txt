Tense, current political thriller, which points directly to the political controversy of delivery of the United States, another Orwellian phrase (collateral damage, someone?) For illegal interrogation, including the torture of terrorist suspects who avoid due process of law. The inhuman interrogation is supervised by the Egyptian police chief, he himself was the target of a fundamentalist suicide: a bomb plot, which linked the two main lines of the film. Both work very well, the bombing set is graphic and chilling in its realism, with its outcome revealed in an elegant Tarantino flashback and the scenes of torture in an innocent man also portrayed in all its bloody details. The film has revealing points about the use of torture as a credible means of intelligence, which meets in the war against terrorists and against the anonymous bureaucracy not politically (here personified by an appropriate Meryl Streep, cold steel, like the CIA boss who gives the order for surrender) that can ruin innocent lives. No matter what Kafka's fiction, think more about the recent murder of the innocent Brazilian in London in 2005, with the Metropolitan Police chief still in his job and no one was tried for the murder of the poor man. The acting is excellent at all times: the two key roles of the innocent man and the terrorist terrorist are interpreted realistically and revealed by the unknown actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas. Similarly, Yigal Naor, as the intimidating police chief, and Zineb Ouhach, as his idealistic daughter in love, seem true with their performances and their lack of familiarity (at least for me), which increases the credibility of their characters. Of the biggest Hollywood names present, Gyllenhaal's stature grows with successive films, here portraying the embarrassed and anguished government man, initially puzzled but later, who does the right thing in the end. Witherspoon plays the role of his anguished wife mainly in a key, but is credible anyway, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin are convincingly selfish senators and their lackeys, who will only go there to help him until his career prospects are in danger. There are some weaknesses regarding the plot; There is little dramatic need to create the "suspense" that surrounds El-Ibrahimi's escape and the Streep character is perhaps a too obvious bogey man / woman. Worst of all is the meaningless inclusion of Gyllenhaal's girlfriend in the place, merely for decoration and a brief scene of gratuitous love. In general, however, a fascinating cinematic experience that provokes thoughts.
