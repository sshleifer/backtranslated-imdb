Based on the real event, this epic is set in 221 BC and tells the true story of the unification of China. Filled with action and full of intrigue, passion, betrayals and unforgettable battle sequences, it caught my attention despite its duration of 160 minutes. <br /> <br /> The king, Ying Zeng, played by Li Xuejian, is obsessed with unification. The seven kingdoms of China and becoming its first emperor. His lover, Lady Zhao, played by the beautiful actress Gong Li, designs a plot that will travel to the neighboring kingdom of Yan to launch a false assassination plot that will give the king an excuse to invade Yan. However, she falls in love with the killer as the king becomes more and more ruthless. <br /> <br /> There are subplots, tragedy and constant drama. There are scenes of great beauty and abject cruelty. There is a great photography and a brilliant use of physical space. <br /> <br /> The deep characterization made me think of Shakespeare. And tragic events that recall the Greek drama. And, nevertheless, it is totally Chinese, since these are old questions about whether the ends justify the means. And it raises issues related to life and death and good and evil and all intermediate blurred edges. <br /> <br /> It is the history of individuals in the context of history, a history that has shaped China for the past. Two thousand years I was dragged through history, as well as moral issues raised. There are no easy answers and this was one of the film's strengths. <br /> <br /> Recommended. But be prepared for violence and blood. <br /> <br />
