When I first heard that this film was going to be made, I was very excited to see it. The ideas for making a film of this caliber, as good as it was, must have been very difficult. I was not really sure that anyone could cover all the many amazing qualities of the Pope in a movie, but the film did justice to his memory. In my opinion, the most important task was to reveal the people who started the Pope. From his days in Poland, to his last days in the Vatican, this film followed all aspects of his life. Thomas Kretschmann, the man who played the pope in his adult life, did an excellent job of conveying emotion. In general, this film was educational, but also very entertaining.
