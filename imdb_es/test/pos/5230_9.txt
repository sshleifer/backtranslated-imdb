The best cinematography I've seen. Taking into account the year in which the film was made, I was absolutely amazed and completely impressed with the amount of attention devoted to the scenes and with what seems to be authenticity. Although I am not particularly fond of Western cinema, each scene is given the greatest detail and is disturbing. There is a sincere connection with nature. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the amount of action that goes through the scenes, but I never get bored. I feel like I'm really looking at a time machine and looking at the old west. I recommend this movie to anyone who is studying set design, location planning and, in general, photography. It can be a humiliating film to experiment with regarding visuals considering this era of digital retouching that we now experience.
