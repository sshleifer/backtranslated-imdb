... but you probably have seen it or else you would not be here. It's so dark that you probably tripped over it like I did because this little-known gem does not get word of mouth. <br /> <br /> From the beginning you know how the story will shake, but seeing how our innocent redhead nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment. Most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture, but Do not Look in the Basement makes it subtle, which makes the suspense superior. Note for horror filmmakers: some of us like subtlety. The charming, home-loving nurse Charlotte takes a job in a sanitarium, but is shocked when she learns that the chief doctor who hired her had a terrible accident and is now subordinated to a mysterious doctor, and we all know she is not a doctor. . The suspense is built through the outcome of Charlotte events with the assistance of many of the patients, but in which of the patients can Charlotte trust? This is a jewel and it is my favorite movie of TRUE HORROR. I love Re-Animator and Evil Dead, but they play more for the HORROR-COMEDY audience. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (Enough for horror standards, but there's a decent bit of blood throughout the movie). The opening scene is classic; No other horror movie starts better, and the ending also has its fair share of blood too. <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$ (Wanting to fall in love with Allyson (Betty Chandler spends a lot of time naked, trying to seduce half the men in the sanatorium.) Betty Chandler is a knockout and I'm surprised that this is his only film. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ $$ (The story is handled well despite the premise of getting a great mileage in Hollywood.) The script has a special ability to create suspense and never leaves poor Charlotte in a precarious situation.) <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$$$ (Betty Chandler does the best job here as Allyson, naively capturing insanity in an ethereal way. It was splendid, weighing the facts before reaching a verdict while Rosie H Olotik as Charlotte offered a genuine performance as you will feel for her character.
