What is the point of this message if it is not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season? Here is my prognosis: 1. The hatch was really destroyed, but somehow everyone inside survived. Buts let's see about that. 2. The episode at the end of the tent is an observation team that monitors the tracking device installed on the Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield has been raised around the island, the observation station took the signal and will send a rescue mission. 3. After the destruction of the hatch, the island is no longer isolated, and other ships / planes will arrive 4. The others will finally share their secret with us, the poor observers. <br /> <br /> Was In fact, it was confirmed that there will be 4 seasons of LOST? <br /> <br /> Greetings Mike
