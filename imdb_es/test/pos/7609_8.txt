I saw this movie for the first time years ago, when it was still new and I was satisfied. It's a great Hollywood story for teenagers. However, it is not realistic. As much as you want to believe it, these stories never happen. That's why it's irritating to watch movies like that. They play with the minds of teenagers, just imagine how many girls who still attended high school believed in that magic and were disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin. The director should have spent more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about the actors. Yes, they (the actors) were good, but the idea is not worth a 10. There are many movies about teenagers. So, why do not we make a better one?
