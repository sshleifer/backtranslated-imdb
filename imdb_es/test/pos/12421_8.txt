This is a surprisingly excellent horror / comedy game, low budget, fun and very well done, with good performances and a really great ending. All the characters are quite great, and the story, although unoriginal, is very good, in addition to Eric Jungmann (Adam) and Justin Urich (Harley) had a fantastic chemistry together. One of the funniest moments of the movie for me is when Adam is stuck in the bathroom, and Harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there, and decides to take pictures in the truck, and Aimee Brooks is just sexy! Also, this is one of the best low budget horror movies I've seen in a long time. It's very bloody, but in a comical way, and I thought it was also very well written, plus, Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic as the Monster Man and had an evil makeup! It is similar to movies like Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers, etc, etc, and has some suspense moments here and there, in addition to the effects of Gore are very well done for the most part. This is a surprisingly excellent Horror / Comedy, low budget, fun and very well done, with good performances and a really great ending. I recommend it a lot! The address is very good! Michael Davis does a very good one! I work here, with a great camera work, good angles, good use of colors and use of an excellent stage, in addition to keeping the film fun and at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of blood! . We have extremely bloody nosebleeds, bloody impassions, bloody stabbings, a monster cuts a man by a monster truck, human remains in a stew cooked, guts everywhere, the guts of the guys fall, a pencil in the eyes, a bloody cut in the throat. A lot of people walking without limbs, bloody dead squirrel, crushed heads, severed limbs, bloody and shattered corpses, a decent amount of bloodshed, a very bloody scene at the end and more. <br /> <br /> Acting is very good for a low budget movie. Eric Jungmann is fantastic here as Adam, he was a nerd but very nice, he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, he had some great lines, and I loved his character, he also seemed to be enjoying himself, and he was especially Good at the end! Justin Urich is excellent as the ass of a Best Friend, however, I could not help but love him because it was so much fun and he often stole many of the scenes, I really dug it! Aimee Brooks is beautiful, and she did very well with what she had to do, she had good chemistry with Jungmann and just like Jungmann was especially good at the end, as she loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man, he had a spooky look, he had an incredible makeup and now he is one of my favorites. The rest of the cast does it well. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this one! *** 1/2 out of 5
