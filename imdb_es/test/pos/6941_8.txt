As a Canadian, I did not know much about Whitlam's dismissal. I had read the Wikipedia page about those events, but that was all. Earlier this year, when Canada went through a potential constitutional crisis (which disappeared, fortunately) that could have led to the intervention of our Governor General, the dismissal of Whitlam was mentioned in the press. In an effort to obtain more information, I ordered the DVD of this miniseries through EBay. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with how interesting the account was. As dramatic as the events were, this could have been a very boring political drama. However, it was a very suspenseful miniseries. I was also impressed by how understandable it was, despite my lack of familiarity with Australian politics. It did not take long to discover who they all were and what their roles were. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it is not a completely unbiased account. Malcolm Fraser is certainly represented as a rather Machiavellian figure, who does not allow any person or thing to interpose in his quest to become Prime Minister. Gough Whitlam is represented in a more noble, almost holy light. However, the actor who plays Whitlam channels the nobility in such a way that it is presented more as pomposity. I thought that Sir John Kerr was represented in a fairly comprehensive manner. <br /> <br /> I must warn people that the DVD is of very poor quality. I understand that it was made for television in the early 80's, but it seems that no effort was made to restore the image quality or sound quality. It was very disappointing that no extras were added either. A documentary, or even some interviews with historical figures, would have improved the experience, but there is nothing. <br /> <br /> I recommend this miniseries for anyone interested in real life events.
