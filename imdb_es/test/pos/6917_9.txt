The original story and the fun and compelling characters were very good for a teenage girls party movie (2 times). I loved it, it was fun and it moved quickly, without boring scenes. It is violent and has a bit of language (although most of it is covered). It's a great movie. David Strickland was an excellent actor. Ron Eldard gave a wonderful performance. I see him with the girls every time.
