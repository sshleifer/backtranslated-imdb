Saint Schnikey! This movie is cool! The duo of Chris Farley and David Spade are very good together. My favorite parts are "Gordo with a little coat, my God, Room Service and more scenes that will be remembered for years." This movie has a great cult of followers, I wonder why, which shows that even eleven years after Chris Farley's tragic death and he's still popular, he plays Tommy, he'll make you laugh every time you look at him, he's a great comedian and he misses it, Mr. Spade reminds me of Dan Akyroid while Chris Farley reminds me remember John Belushi, they made more than 2 movies together, this film is a must buy and must be in the collection of all Snl fans.
