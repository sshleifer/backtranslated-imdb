As an admirer of the 2001 film "Moulin Rouge" and the most recent admirer of Jean Renoir's filmmaking, I knew that, inevitably, he would see his "French Cancan" sooner or later. The film tells a fictional story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. The businessman Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to turn the washerwoman of Montmartre, Nini (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) into a Cancan star, without arousing the wrath of her tempestuous lover, the Lola (Maria Felix), who dances. This is just one of the many love triangles in "French Cancan": true to the stereotype, these people from the French entertainment world are always falling in love. <br /> <br /> Renoir addresses his typical friendly humor and his attention to supporting characters. and he also wrote the lyrics of a beautiful waltz song featured in the movie. Gabin perfectly embodies the old French playboy hero. Arnoul is a pretty redhead who stays in the dance numbers, except for some tricks in which a double is obviously used. <br /> <br /> "French Cancan" is announced as a musical comedy and although there are many musical numbers that take place on the stage of a nightclub, etc., only one character, Casimir, breaks the song in middle of the conversation. The actor who plays it, Philippe Clay, is fun to watch: a very tall and thin young man who sings, dances and makes contortions. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a long cancan sequence, like all characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together. The dance is much more illuminated and edited in a more coherent way than in "Moulin Rouge"; In fact, if I have a complaint about "French Cancan", everything is too Technicolor. Even when Nini experiences anguish or someone sings a melancholic song, the lighting is bright and flat, with no intrusive shadows. Yes, the result is a cheerful and affectionate musical comedy; It's just that I can not stop thinking that things were never so colorful and innocent in real life.
