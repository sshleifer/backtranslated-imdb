The movie is really good, it does not use violence or sex, etc. to sell itself like other movies, but uses a really decent plot (based on Michael Caine's original) and some excellent actors to make a fun and action-packed movie. enjoy so much. One thing that made me enjoy this movie even more was that I had some actors that I really like, like Edward Norton (whom I last saw at the 26th hour, which I also enjoyed), Jason Statham (transporter, I also enjoyed it) and Seth Green, which I think is great, his role as a roommate of Shawn Fanning nicknamed "The Napster" is hilarious and his piracy skills play an important role in the main theft that focuses on a huge traffic jam in Los Angeles. Angels The car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive. I have not seen the original, so I can not really compare, but I liked it a lot and I would recommend this movie to everyone, it's not a movie in which you like that specific genre, it will adapt to everyone I felt good after this movie, it had a very good ending and, in general, it was very fun to watch. I give it 8/10. Go see it!
