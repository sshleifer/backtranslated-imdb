Movies are not always supposed to be about deep, provocative thoughts. Sometimes they are simply meant to be escapes from reality. Out To Sea fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> A cheerful romantic comedy of the "golden years", Out To Sea may not be a big budget, you may be able to easily say when they performed in front of a green screen, but it's still a lot which is worth seeing. A sweet movie that needs a rest. <br /> <br /> This is just fun, cheerful. It is not meant to be a deep film. It is something worth seeing. If he does not do anything else, he should see it for Brent Spiner's humorously stiff and tense rendition of Oye Como Va. Gil is a character who loves to hate and Mr. Spiner takes out the perfect evil comic role to two beloved comedy gods.
