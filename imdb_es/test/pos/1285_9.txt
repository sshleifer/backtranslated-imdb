I only saw it on DVD three times. Once in the "normal" way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this gossip of a black movie, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the director's comment. . Pretty surprising. A short story, told with more style, energy and substance than most of the exaggerated big budget features that are launched today. <br /> <br /> I think this is a film even more successful than the subsequent Memento, which made me Nolan in the first place. I can not wait to see what he does with a bigger budget (and bigger box office stars) in his next movie, Insomnia.
