Millions of gold travel by train to the treasury of the United States. Traveling along is Lois Lane to report on it. On the way the train is attacked by masked thieves. They take off the car with the armed guards and attack the rest. This leads to a vicious struggle between the remaining guards and the thieves. The thieves beat them, but then Lois Lane jumps. She defeats the train thieves (at one point with a gun) but the train starts to get out of control. Lois can not stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold. The good thing is that Superman is on the way! <br /> <br /> Fast, exciting and non-stop action. Probably one of the best of all cartoons. Just great
