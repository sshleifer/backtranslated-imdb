Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No matter how many times you see the same thing, the program never becomes monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the best comedians in the world who does not even need to talk to make people laugh. His gestures, his facial expressions and his face itself is very fun to watch. The situations he faces in the program are simply fun and the way he handles them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this program should not receive a 10 because it is fabulous. It is something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh. Some of my favorite episodes of the program are: 1) When Mr. Bean is staying in a hotel 2) He who sees the scary movie 3) Beware of the baby (especially the diaper scene). In fact, all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the program. Mr.Bean can go to any height to show that it's fun, even undressing completely in one of the episodes. the way he handled that situation was simply mind-boggling. 10 out of 10
