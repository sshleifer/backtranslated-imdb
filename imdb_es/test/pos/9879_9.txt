To understand the "Accelerated Course" in the right context, you must understand the 80s on television. Most television programs did not have any point. The comedy overcame the drama by at least 3 to 1. They were still finding out where the lines were to be able to cross them. (TV shows like "Hail to the Chief" were a bold step!) This movie made for television "Crash Course" included a cast of stars, which brought together members of all the classics of the 80s: "227", "Family Ties", "Who is the boss?", Et al. The directors must have had a certain predilection for those stellar films at that time. Even so, this film offered very light meals and a simplistic vision of heroism and maturity. And that is not bad sometimes. Viva Soleil Luna Frye.
