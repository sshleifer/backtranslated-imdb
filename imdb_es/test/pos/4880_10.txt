Supernanny Jo Frost, in each episode, gives a family the benefit of their hard-won experience. But when she is gone, they will succeed in following their strict disciplinary rules or will face a life dominated by ungovernable children. <br /> <br /> Following the line of British documentaries "Wife Swap" and "How clean is your house" Supernanny offers a deep insight into the private family life of average people, but with the added benefit of practical advice on how to raise your children. <br /> <br /> Jo advocates a tough love style for child care and the now infamous 'mischievous step' has reached the popular vernacular in many British homes. <br /> <br /> In just three weeks, the families presented became a disorganized house; sibling rivalry, screaming, kicking, teething children and struggling parents, to a quiet oasis of family love. <br /> <br /> The series, which aired, garnered huge ratings and critical acclaim and is currently in talks to be revoked for America.
