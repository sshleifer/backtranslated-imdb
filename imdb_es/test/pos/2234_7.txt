This is a pretty clever and well-acted version of the romantic fairytale of the "modern" woman of the 30s. In this case, she helps the man she loves become the head of the company while serving as secretary and, finally, you win the love of an intriguing social butterfly. Interestingly, his business sense is shown as subtly parallel to his domestic prowess, and the ladies of the office are depicted as the "powers behind the throne." Raised well above average by the intelligent performance of Ms. Astor.
