These critics need to find a new job !!! This movie is based on a TRUE HISTORY, which has made history. Beautifully illustrates how even in the fog of war and tragedy love can conquer everything. Greece's impressive Chefalonia has captured my heart and my soul as if I were there too. The blue-eyed cage and the lovely cross were incredible. Together, they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only approach in times of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did with mine, you must go see it!
