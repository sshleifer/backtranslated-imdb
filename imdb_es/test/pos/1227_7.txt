Well, boring or bad? It's good. Is it worth your money? If you can reserve it for a ticket, insurance. Better than the trailer makes it look like? Yes, curiously. <br /> <br /> There is not much in the script: the guards who work in an armored truck company move large amounts of money. The guards see the opportunity to retire as millionaires, one of them is too honest to agree with all this, and a well-established plan goes to hell. <br /> <br /> This could have been a poorly executed Reservoir Dogs scam, but the cast's ability and the director's ability to make almost anything tighten pulled him out of that realm and put him on a solid foundation .
