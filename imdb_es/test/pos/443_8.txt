I saw this movie three times in different ages of my life and I always enjoyed it a lot. This Can-Can is a real explosion of joie de vivre, like Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's musical, but in French. And a nice tribute to Jean Renoir in his time, his friends, lovers, music and dances. It is at the same time a business chronicle of that time, full of affection and French humor. It is also a clear tribute to impressionism (people who like impressionist painters will like this photo). It is particularly a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and, of course, to Jean Renoir's father, Pierre-Auguste. You will find a reliable and splendid recreation in color of some Renoir masterpiece. Excellent casting, scenery, sound effects and music. He even tells us about the creation of the Parisian Moulin Rouge, obviously it is a fiction story (and, by the way, it is not very original, since it falls into the very well-known moral that the show must continue). But Jean Renoir's production is excellent. <br /> <br />
