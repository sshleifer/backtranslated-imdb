Pixote is directed with just a bit of sentimentality. And even then, more than I imagine, Héctor Babenco owes some of his cinematographic abilities with this film in the neorealist style of Vittorio De Sica, in particular to Shoeshine (that film, like Pixote, takes place mainly inside a children's prison ). And yet, although he might prefer De Sica's film, if it is a question of deciding between the two, it is so close because it is, there is no pun, how to choose between two children. Both are wonderful works of raw drama, and with Pixote Babenco it has an extra advantage and a heartbreaking quality that is not filmed in the conditions created after a world war. So it was in Brazil, one would see it with a little more style and admiration in City of God, maybe in some of the same places, and these children were on the streets before and after the movie. Some are not alive more than 20 years later, so everyone knows. <br /> <br /> The "protagonist", the preadolescent child of Fernando Ramos da Silva Street, plays the main character, a young man without a father or, in reality, any family that takes care of him, and he stands among dozens of others street children and delinquents in a reformatory for children. The conditions could not be much worse, and they become even more unbearable since two children are killed one after the other for some cause of duty. There is a riot and a fugue, and in the middle of the film we find Pixote with some other young people, including Lilica, a transvestite who is not even 18 years old, and they become pickpockets, drug dealers, whatever survive None of this, I repeat, is shown with a kind of fervent seriousness; Certainly, in a million years you would never see Ron Howard or Paul Haggis directing this type of images, and yet, there is an emotional honesty in everything exactly because nothing. It is trivialized. <br /> <br /> Almost all the scenes are significant to show how fragile life is for Pixote, and how he could kill himself or die somehow at any moment, and so, without even reaching puberty, he has to be . at the level of those around him, who are a little older (but not much) and become things that will persecute this person forever. Despite the use of Babenco for a tender and sad music and one or two scenes with people who cry a lot, nothing feels forced. As with De Sica, perhaps more or less given the consistent conditions of the children of the streets of San Paolo and Rio, he is a natural director of children, and co-axial with Ramos da Silva and Jorge Julião and others, a work really excellent that provides the appropriate touches of the "cinematic" drama (which is not so real that it becomes a documentary, which is not a bad thing to say) and even the subtlety in some scenes. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Pixote is not as well known as it is later Brazilian films of the 21st century that look back on the horrors of Rio, or even neo-realist films, but they should be. Anyone who wants to get a good and hard view of what it was, should look it up in one library or another and soak up the best foreign film of 1981.
