This little film brings many memories, affectionate and disgusting, of what can happen when one is a musician who works. The accommodation not so nice for the band, the management of the place jumping up and down telling you what to play, the absolute ecstasy of applause .............. Far from being ridiculous is In fact, very accurate in the way he represents musicians, professionals and others, who have traveled a great distance to perform a concert season in one place. There are times when everything goes perfectly, there are other times when he immediately begins to miss his partner and wonders what the hell he is doing so far from home. In the end, you have to make the best of it because there is no other way out.
