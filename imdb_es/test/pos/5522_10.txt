Abe Zwick perfected the unique, beautifully. He never made another film, but he created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self-hate in this film that is both caustic and emotional. He directs the screen, presenting the rubble of a man who collapses under the pressure of a life increasingly meaningless. <br /> <br /> Paul (Zwick) is an aging queen who somehow is convinced that Stanley (Wayne Crawford), an idiot with no sense of the future, follows his star. He is a petty thief whose seething hatred has recently increased. He has been forced to skip the city and move to a suburb in Miami. As a disguise, she dresses like an old dry blue sock with as much sexual boiling torment as the Lady of the Church. He tells Stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "Aunt Martha." Paul himself has no friends, spends too much time alone in the house and has to deal with Stanley's dissolute lifestyle. It would be enough to make any man cross the line into a transgender homicidal mania. <br /> <br /> Once again, Zwick presents Paul as a tragic figure who has completely lost the understanding of how to relate to other people. However, there is some poetry in his anguish, which burns slowly throughout the film. It is tragic, but also elegant. This is, ultimately, a very sad movie. It certainly has many fun moments, but there is such a hidden stream of despair and despair that the humor is bittersweet. It's worth watching this movie for the performance of Abe Zwick. He really could have built his career on Martha. She is quite gaseous, once you know her. Just make sure you cut your hair and stop the detour. She really hates that!
