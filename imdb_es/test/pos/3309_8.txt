Pleasant movie that gives romance, psychodrama of women on the edge, sexual harassment in the workplace, adultery and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in American corporations. Joan Crawford is the usual executive of the bitches used for a long time and feels the need to be because she is with the big boys. Hope Lange is an ambitious entry-level employee whose determination to reach the top using her mind and not her body. Your personal life is the secondary plot. <br /> <br /> The costumes for the film are great, but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's stylist that "a little rubbing will do you a lot!" The amount of Brylcream in Stephen Boyd's hair distracts sometimes. The relationship of his character with the character of Lange never fully developed, which I found disappointing. In general, the movie is nice. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
