For those of you who made comments about this film before and who expected to see it again, I hope you did. It was aired today (November 28, 2004) on the Lifetime movie network. I subscribe to Dish. <br /> <br /> Karen Arthur directed William Petersen and Barbara Hershey in this southwest Gothic tale expertly. Lighting, editing and dialogue contributed greatly to the film, and Hershey and Peterson were chosen perfectly for the roles, both playing sensitive, audacious and intuitive characters. The screen was excellent, as was the support cast. <br /> <br /> Not knowing in advance, I correctly guessed that the story was based on the truth, and now that I know I must make the stay, as Santa Fe is a jump, a jump and a jump from Tucson. <br /> <br /> As an engineer, I was fascinated by the unique construction of the staircase and the man who designed and built it (who was he? an angel?). But what captivates you the most is the plot, and various plots, of how it came to be. You certainly have a strong feeling that God in his heaven was in every detail of all this drama in history. For you who have seen the movie, you know what I am talking about. For those of you who have not done so, I will not spoil for a minute ... <br /> <br /> Bon holiday, <br /> <br /> Bob Shank Jr., Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson , Arizona
