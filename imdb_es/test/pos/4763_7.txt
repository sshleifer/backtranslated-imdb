I think the film lineage can run like this. Pay attention, please, because I had to look for this. In 1967, Peter Yates, a former car driver, directed the English film "Robo", the most exciting part of which is a car chase through the streets of London, through alleys where there are many children playing and all that. It is a success. <br /> <br /> A year later, Yates directed "Bullet," starring Steve McCool. I mean McQueen, who presents another, even more spectacular, car chase in the hills of San Francisco, with incredibly authentic engine sounds. They seem to include double clutch, full race cameras, no silencers, twelve-cylinder engines under forty-foot hoods, supercharged, super-supercharged and all five thousand horsepower running at full speed. Many shots of McQueen's chewing gum face frowns with concentration as he tries to hit another motorway car, although one passenger in the other vehicle carries a shotgun. The persecution is staged by Philip D'Antoni. Bill Hopkins drives the criminal vehicle. <br /> <br /> A year or two later, feeling something good, Bill Friedkin heads "The French Connection," which presents a chase between a commanded police car (Gene Hackman) and a train in the new city york Many shots of Hackman's damn face as he struggles with the battered car through the streets. The persecution is staged by Philip D'Antoni. Follow the Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> Feeling good, a year or two more brings us "The Seven Ups", which presents a chase between a car driven by Roy Scheider, with many photos of Scheider's damn face as he tries to hit the other car, which is driven by Bill Hopkins, off the road, although the criminal car, by the way, carries a passenger with a shotgun. There are no hills in New York City, only potholes, but they're still sharp enough to raise cars to a few feet. The chased car screeches around a corner and runs down a street where a dozen children play. The shots of the children who scream when they disperse on the sidewalk and allow the car to approach. But once is not enough. The children immediately return to the street and must repeat the withdrawal for the police car that leads to Scheider. <br /> <br /> I once witnessed a high-speed chase on the streets of Philadelphia. Both the criminal and the police drove through the streets at approximately 25 miles per hour, arriving at stops at each stop sign and red lights, something very boring compared to this movie. <br /> <br /> Speaking of this movie, it's pretty good. "Robo" and "Bullet" were great. Everyone dressed well. But the New York movies are dirty. There is garbage everywhere and the subway cars are covered in graffiti. The shootings and beatings are carried out in empty lots surrounded by collapsed brick buildings, or in landfills for industrial-sized freezers. <br /> <br /> The acting is also pretty good. Roy Scheider looks like an elegant whippet. The other actors have faces made for the camera, especially Richard Welsh. And the story is interesting, if not entirely unknown. The best thing about the film is the way it captures the city of New York in its almost total indifference to human depravity and nobility. At a funeral, the limo drivers stand with their necks up, their butts hanging from their mouths, kicking their cold feet together, completely bored by the rituals. The film wants us to believe that The Seven Ups is an elite group of untouchable policemen who stop at nothing to get the job done, and here it's a little exhausted. He always seems to be threatening to do something unethical and illegal: beat a suspect to hell or physically harm a hospitalized and helpless boss, but they always manage to avoid doing so. (If they really did, their characters would become realistic and ambiguous and we would prefer to have our heroes and villains of a more biblical nature). Very pleasant, even if you have seen it before, and it is very possible that you have it. One or the other of his previous incarnations.
