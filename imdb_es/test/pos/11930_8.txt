Imagine this. Someone makes a movie about the Columbine or Virginia technological massacre, only the movie is directed by the guy who did it alone at home (I know this is nothing more than me) and stars Sean Astin out of Goonies. Imagine the terrorists being overcome by buckets of water above the doors and marbles ajar and that is why you need to see the movie. unfortunately, it does not reach the end of having the skateboard lying on the floor for the evil Mexicans to stumble, but halfway there you have to give it more than 7 for that but not a 9 because it did not go crazy enough. Pity, it seemed that it would be a comical corny, well worth a cult status.
