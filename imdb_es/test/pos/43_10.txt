One of the best, Lackawanna Blues <br /> <br /> excellent film, great cast, excellent music, this is one of those movies that is so good that when you finish you'll want to continue for another 90 minutes, I'll see this many times. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that catch you from the beginning and they twist you and hit you emotionally in the whole show. The cast is extraordinary without the slightest indication that someone does not feel uncomfortable in their role. You have the feeling that you are really there, taking all this. Much attention was paid to the sets, costumes and music of the time. The relationship between the characters we know is simple and complicated as the film progresses, but Mrs. Merkerson's constant performance is so powerful that the movie ends before we're filled with the wonderful misfits. Choosing someone other than "Nanny" is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors, among them: <br /> <br /> Jeffery Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But it's Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Mrs. Merkerson who make this a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> The film moves quickly and is short by today's standards, but it is undoubtedly one of the best movies you have seen. I'm going to see this year. If you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally, pull your heart, lift it with joy and put your feet at the same time, then this is the movie for you. I have shown it to several friends and everyone wants my copy, that says it all, the movie is very good. See for yourself. <br /> <br /> danceability-1, Amsterdam Holland
