I love everything related to the type of family. <br /> <br /> My favorite family characters are Brian and Stewie, and I like the episodes when they are mainly presented, such as "Road to Rhode Island" (Season 2), as they interact. very well. The comments they make only have me in stitches. Peter's behavior is also very funny, since some of the things he does "are so bright that they are delayed". The voice acting is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane, as it provides the voices for half the Griffin family, as well as for their perverted neighbor Glenn Quagmire and how he handles this range (especially with singing), I just do not know. He deserves his two Emmys for providing the voice of the evil genius of the baby, Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with his regular, funny and completely insane character, the mayor of Quahog. What I like about Chris (voiced by Seth Green) are the things he says that show that he persecutes his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I found annoying is that in UK Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflect the program itself, but marketing. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Family Guy, I would thoroughly recommend the other American project by Seth MacFarlane. Dad who uses a different style of humor, but is still extremely funny.
