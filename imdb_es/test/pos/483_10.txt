I saw it for the first time on Thames television and I loved it. Later I saw a terrible review written by someone who certainly had not seen or heard. Then, I bought a copy and then I bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on DVD PAL VHS or Region 2. The Australian version is great, but this one is better! I could buy another .............
