This was the first completed project of Eisenstein in more than ten years. The film takes place in the thirteenth century during an invasion of Russians by Germans (Teutonic Knights, I think). Launched in 1938, it is a very loose parallel to Russia's participation in World War II and Germany's advance in Eastern Europe. There are some incredible scenes, the most notable is the battle near the end of the movie, and there is a surprise when children are thrown into a fire pit, but it is not an easy watch. The film crawls and is not as bright as "Potemkin" or "Ivan the Terrible". Sometimes Eisenstein is better at clips. His brilliance is present, however, and is a "must-see" for the fans and historians of Eisenstein's cinema. Russian propaganda at its best.
