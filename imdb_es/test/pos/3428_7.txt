An interesting comedy, which takes place on a train from Stockholm to Berlin, in December 1945. One can not help feeling sorry for the poor writer / critic who leaves his job and gets on the train to Berlin. Their ambition is to make a difference and participate in the construction of the new unified Europe after the end of the war. <br /> <br /> I like the black and white format of the film, as well as the closed stage of a Train in movement. <br /> <br /> Robert Gustafsson makes a classic "Gustafsson role" in this film. If you are a fan of him, this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> The philosopher Wittgenstein, through his saying "One can never assume that anything is what it seems to be", is mentioned several times in the film.
