Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett. <br /> <br /> According to the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie. This seems pretty ironic to me because it's actually one of the first movies I remember. My mother and my little brother took us to see this movie at The Garland Theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid-1970s and I still remember it. <br /> <br /> I leave here by heart but I think this movement is about a trapper who was accused of a crime he did not commit and the law is after him. I think it will be established in the 1800's of Alaska. A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki. Actually, this is a very good movie with a great stage. It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson. The two films have a very similar story. The main difference between the two is that Death Hunt is a movie for adults, while Challenge is a family movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were quite old when this movie was made, which I find quite impressive when you consider that this movie was filmed in a place in the Alaskan jungle. This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died, only a few years later. Both had existed since the silent era.
