I just wanted to write a quick response to all those people who make a bad criticism of this movie because they think it's not funny or boring. <br /> <br /> Here's the trick: the movie does not pretend to be just a comedy. It has some depth. Like many other Demme films, these are people who live in some of the strange corners of our society who are trying to find a way to build a satisfying life for themselves. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the home movie and video industries do not handle the subtlety well and drop it in the "COMEDIA" container. It's funny, but a lot of the humor is out of rhythm. However, the heart of the film is not humor, but the people that contain it. <br /> <br /> It may not be one of the best movies in the world, but it is solid and entertaining. <br /> <br /> And the cast is one of the ones that shows why casting is an art in itself. Michelle Pfieffer is great and this may be the movie that showed that she had some actor skills to add to her beauty. Mercedes Ruehl is a great shout and she manages to chew the landscape in the way that only she can, in a role that requires it. With Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack in smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you have a great cast in which here, as always, makes a big difference. <br /> <br /> Matthew Modine is fun, but the most important thing is that he is a great attraction in this movie. Hot, cute and sexy. <br /> <br /> Sit back, wait for the unexpected and let the movie take you where you want to go and you should have a good time.
