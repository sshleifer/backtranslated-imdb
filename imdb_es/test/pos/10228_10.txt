I would love to see some link between NightBreed, The Fury and the X-Men series, in the same way that the second series of the outer limit would link stories and particular arguments after the fact, to create a story. Arch although one was never thought of. I would also like to know if there is more information, either anecdotal or otherwise, about the relationship and / or collaboration between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg. I just can not understand the fact that David Cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a Clive Barker movie. Is there really additional information on the subject? Finally, it has been 17 years since the movie premiered, and I hoped that there had already been a sequel. Does anyone out there know if there were plans in the making that never came to fruition, or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel?
