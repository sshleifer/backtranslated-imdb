This transmission of the musical classic "Sweeney Todd" does not do justice to the production, but it is still quite fascinating. <br /> <br /> First of all, the nicest aspect of this version is the production design, from the multi-millionaire set to the alarming trapdoor. Then, the staging is excellent, even the cut. <br /> <br /> The main flaw here is in the performances that people give. Oh, they're believable, that's fine, but it's pretty frustrating when no one seems to be playing their tracks on time in a song as fast as, say, "Kiss Me." In fact, the actress who plays Johanna is not only out of rhythm in a grim degree, but also a bit out of tune. And the slightly exaggerated cockney accent of Angela Lansbury is a bit irritating. One more thing, too: what exactly does Judge Turpin's interpretation of "Johanna" say is prohibited in American theater, but not the cannibal anthem "A Little Priest"? <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is an excellent production. It's exciting to see people doing what they love, and I'm not even talking peripherally about "meat pies with a twist".
