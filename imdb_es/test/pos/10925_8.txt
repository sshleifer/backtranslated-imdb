I just watched this movie, and it made me cry. It's a beautiful drama that two brothers fall in love, and I think it's a good idea, especially for the closed-minded, to look at this. I have come to love the short film genre after having only seen a couple, because they have to impress you so fast, and I must say that this definitely stood firm. He described some things, which he had never thought of in that way, incest for one. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I did not care too much about the ending. Only once I would like to see a gay-themed film without wanting to commit suicide after the theaters. It seems they almost always end in tragedy. However, it was "cute", how they had to be together, even if he was in death. <br /> <br /> I gave it eight stars, and I also recommend it to everyone, because I think it gives an 'Inside-look' in the world, that this movie makes you enter. <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening, enjoy.
