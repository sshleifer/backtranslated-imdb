The first time I saw this movie was in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when I was fifteen. I loved it then and I still do it. The ensemble cast is excellent: in those days the actors acted "naturally" and you "felt" for them in the respective roles. A "brilliant" film of the period: the relationships in it remain relevant to today's world, but now the sexes are on the same level, women should not or should not allow the kind of treatment shown in the past. The music on the soundtrack is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January 2005. The scenes of compassion were cut before the release, even at the two hours you want most! I registered with Amazon for the DVD (now they have a special page). Watching this movie in CinemaScope after forty-six years of panoramic and scanning will be great. Twentieth Century Fox, please look more in its catalogers of the CinemaScope productions for DVD in the fifties: there is a big market out there. I await the arrival of EE UU March 2004, a special article by Vanity Fair about the film, which is said to have fifteen pages with many photos on the set. Cheers.
