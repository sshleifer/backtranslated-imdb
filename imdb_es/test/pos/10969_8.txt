Are John Cassavetes' remarkable, sometimes exasperating, often brilliant films occupying a unique position in American cinema? Low budget, partially improvised, inspired by the documentary cinéma verité and related to underground cinema, however, they have often managed to reach a wide and deeply grateful audience. <br /> <br /> After drama studies, the young Cassavetes quickly made a name for himself as an unusually refined and intense actor, who often appears in films about rebellious and disgruntled youths like "Crime in the Streets" and "Edge of the City." <br /> <br /> Preparing an actors workshop, he worked to transform an improvisation experiment into his film debut. The result, "Shadows," which was completed in three years and was funded in part by his performances on Johnny Staccato's television, was a breakthrough in American cinema. On the effect of racism in an already tense relationship between two black men and their sister, two of whom pass for white, the film is impressive for its irregular, seemingly shapeless style and naturalistic performances. The plot was minimal, the mood and the apparent emotional truth were everything?
