I turned 13 when Elvis hit the big time in 1956 with his first RCA hit. A year later, Buddy Holly stepped in to give the King some competition. One of Buddy's top talents, in addition to his unique singing style and ability to compose songs, is often minimized. Buddy was also a skilled guitarist leader, developing a unique style of rockabilly in his Fender Strat. Gary Busey tries to capture this aspect of Buddy's person. There were other contemporary guitar masters of the same caliber, such as Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran, but Buddy's talent is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, Busey is the driving force behind the success of "The Buddy Holly Story". The script not only plays with the facts of Buddy's life, but even intervenes several anachronisms during the two years of Buddy's popularity, basically 1957-1959. One that comes to mind is the scene in which Buddy and Maria are watching a movie in 3-D. Buddy is disenchanted with everything and tells Maria that it will never last. It's just a fad. Actually there were no 3D movies in circulation at that time. The heyday of 3-D was in the early 1950s. By 1955 fashion had already vanished. Another example in which only a small investigation would have sufficed to make the story more credible. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to separate what really happened from the urban legends surrounding Buddy's career. The story about how the Crickets got their name may or may not be apocryphal, but it certainly did not happen the way it is presented in the film. Another problem with the film is how Buddy's parents are represented. Certainly Buddy's parents supported his musical career. "Maybe Baby" is attributed to Buddy's mother and she participated in the writing of the song. <br /> <br /> It's good that Buddy's greatest successes have been used in the movie, but I miss listening to one of my favorites, "I'm looking for someone to love." I am proud that, as a result of this film, Buddy's music has been republished for a new generation to listen to. His legacy is one of the best since the early days of rock 'n' roll. Rave, Buddy, rave.
