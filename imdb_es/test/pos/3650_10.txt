Before I forget, let me say that the work of art here is exceptional. From the garbage cans to the huge cruise, the drawings are very well made. If this were not encouraged, the critics would be praising the "address" here, because it is really good. <br /> <br /> To the story: Sylvester is picking up garbage in the shipyards, but the pickins are scarce. . While meditating on the dock next to a large ship, in a porthole he sees Tweety in his cage. Tweety also sees it, and you know his first comment, the same one he always does when he sees the cat. Anyway, Sylvester runs, opens the porthole and says: "Hello, breakfast!" Tweety hits the porthole window in his face and says: "You, old cat who looks furtively!" The cat falls into the water. <br /> <br /> Sylvester, who has not been discouraged quickly sneaks aboard the ship, tiptoes Tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to go when ... oops! - There is "Granny" at the door with her umbrella. Sylvester receives a beating while the old woman protects her pet bird once again. But, "gibbet flippety" says Grandma, "I've fallen glasses. I can not see anything without them. Heavens to Betsey, where these cheats are". <br /> <br /> Now Sylvester has the advantage ... and the normal scams that try to catch the cats get back on, like Grandma's glasses. The most intelligent act was taking his glasses Sylvester and Tweety paint a picture of them, so when he woke up and put them, you would see the bird and think it was fine. <br /> <br /> In general, a very entertaining animated short that was very fun to watch. As you can see from the quotes, I love the dialogue in some of these old cartoons.
