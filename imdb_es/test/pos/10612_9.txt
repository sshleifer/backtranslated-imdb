Marigold is, by far, the best "weird" version of Bollywood I've seen in my life. (I did not grow up with Bollywood, but I've seen a few hundred of them now). I would say that he leaves Gurinder Chadha, Mira Nair and even Merchant and Ivory (from Bombay Talkie) almost in the dust. Willard Carroll, the director, really loves Bollywood, and has the self-confidence to let us know: there is humor, but no arc, ironic distancing, not "of course I do not want to say this". As Jerry Lee Lewis would say, he "understands" it, and so he can afford to have it too: the joy of a Bollywood film experience, along with the touches provided by a Westerner entering the role of the narrator. <Br /> <br /> It's a story about a caustic American film actress, BAD and beautiful (she's only been in movies with numbers in her titles, like Fatal Attraction 3) that is in a different Bollywood movie who went to India to be (Kama Sutra 3 has doubled her stores while she was on her way, apparently because her producers are now in jail). Salman Khan, in real life, is a mega-mega star of Bollywood, is the dance master of the charming film written on the fly in which she has been involved ("this is before or after I went blind? "), And the sweetness of her character endowed with psychic talent, she learns more than how to find her inner ecstatic dancing ability. <br /> <br /> The strong start gives you Bollywood, a super-energetic group of dancers facing the Taj Mahal (which is fun and familiar to the Western viewer, as well as providing the high-speed musical emotion that we love in a film in Hindi), and Salman on the screen from the beginning: do not expect 20 minutes of Bollywood for the hero. It has an Indian disguise adorned with a strip of Western film Kit Carson style (all in white). <br /> <br /> The character of Ali Larter's actress is pleasing to the Western viewer: she is blonde, which is "traditional" for a "white" person in a Bollywood movie, and a visually understandable casting, but she is a robust girl, not the ethereal blondie type that usually appears to us, and she is a more or less three-dimensional total bitch, who continues to be profane and abusive. Cell phone conversations with a boyfriend and agent in the United States. <br /> <br /> We also have scenes of women who have problems among them going to a bar to deal with them: the ability for people not to have them. The fact of relating and having emotional conversations is traditional in Hindi movies, but we rarely see something similar happen among women (apart from the discussion between the mother and the daughter about the choice of the daughter's boyfriend), and much less "strange". People - let alone go to the bar. So the spirit is the same, the details are new, and I loved this completely. <br /> <br /> I only saw him once, in a preview, with the presence of the director, an excellent speaker and a responding question: he and Salman became "good friends" during his creation, he loves the India, has plans to make a movie of The Wizard of Oz in India. I can not detail the songs too much when I've seen them only once, except to say that I liked them all. They range from a happy parody of the Bollywood number in the movie inside the movie: the women's costumes, with Leghorn hats and shell snail bodices (it's a beach scene) in flowing dresses, are worth the cost of a single ticket - to a beautiful reflective romantic song with many scenes in a sadder and more serious part of the film. <br /> <br /> Mix of Hindi and English in music, and it works. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan receives a lot of credit from me for opening to unusual projects, this and Jaan-e-Mann, and good judgment on what to participate. Carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas along the way, and totally fine (that is, not narcissistic at all) if Carroll accepted or rejected them; clearly, he is only a professional who loves to participate and collaborate.
