2005 will go down in the history of 'Dr.Who' as its most incredible year. Everything seemed to click; a new Doctor and first class companion, large audiences (10 million for the first episode and the Christmas special), important prizes, critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years laughing at the Daleks' apparent inability to negotiate the stairs were really silenced. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bomb, leaving after just one series. It seemed that the honeymoon was over. Fortunately, the public seems to have embraced his successor, the excellent David Tennant. In addition to all this, the program has an excellent SFX, such as the spacecraft that crashed into 'Big Ben' in 'Aliens Of London' and a magnificent story like 'Tooth & Claw', 'Army Of Ghosts / Doomsday' . The new 'Dr.Who' is basically the same as the previous one, updated only for the 21st century. Some fans have accused Russell T. Davies of "ruining" the show. They need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until it arrived.
