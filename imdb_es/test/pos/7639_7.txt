I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. I think the general disgust of this movie is because people do not really understand the plot. If you think about the story line, this movie really makes a lot of sense, it just does not give you a silly explanation. It is true that the special effects are below normal and it seems that the budget is semi-low, but I think the originality of the plot keeps you amazed. People say that the vampire genre is exaggerated and clich√©, but with Bled, what you get is not your conventional vampire movie. It's a dream / alternate reality story with a vampire / eternal life twist. I loved. The only thing that prevented me from giving it a higher rating was the lack of special effects and that I personally do not like movies where most people have an accent. But as I said before, if you really understand the plot, this is not a bad movie.
