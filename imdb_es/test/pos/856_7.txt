Stephanie Meyer is going to be so nervous! Now, his book "Amanecer" will not be the first with that title. Sorry, Twilight fans. <br /> <br /> Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is a medical student, Eve, who is assigned to interview the psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected the turn, and when she discovered that they both grew up in the same city, I was sure of it. <br /> <br /> She kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that I felt there was a shared illusion going on. Sometimes, I even acted like I had PTSD. I really thought I was losing it. <br /> <br /> Well, she was not losing it, and when the end came, I was speechless. All my suspicion turned out to be wrong. The turn was even more surprising than I thought. <br /> <br /> Overton was fantastic and the story is much better than Stephanie Meyer would come up with. You must see it.
