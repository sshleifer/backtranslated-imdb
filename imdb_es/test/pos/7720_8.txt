This film is about a young Indian who comes home one day and is committed to a woman. The problem is that he is gay. To stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay, one lie leads to the other until it gets out of control. <br /> <br /> This movie is hilarious and made me laugh many times. The performance of Sally Bankes is excellent and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants in a convincing way. The plot is exceptional too. I find the plot very realistic, and I can fully identify with Jimi's feeling of being terrified, worried and upset. On the other hand, Jimi's boyfriend, Jack, gets much less attention in the movie. I would have liked to have been given more lines in the film and had more character development. However, as I suppose the director wants to make this a more conventional film, the love between Jimi and Jack did not develop in the film. <br /> <br /> It's great to see a gay affirmative movie. In addition, this film preaches to accept the differences of other people, whether sexuality, culture and way of life. This movie makes the viewers think a lot. <br /> <br /> We need movies like this to give us a boost. Thanks for making this movie!
