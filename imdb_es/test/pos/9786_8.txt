Milo is a horror film that has been overlooked and underestimated since the late 1990s, but the sensation and atmosphere are more than a horror movie from the 80s. It seems that a group of little girls are "seen to see things" in the Milo's father's office, a gynecologist, and as a reward for seeing what's in the jars (yes, a gynecologist and something else ...) a girl plays "Doctor" with Milo. Hmm, his first patient and he lost her. Now Milo is a scary little boy who always wears a yellow rain raincoat, rain or shine, and he talks funny ... but that is not all that is strange in him. Let's move on to the present where these girls are adults and there is a wedding planned for one of them, but the tragedy hits and leaves a girl who came from out of town with the option to replace or not replace her friend as a school teacher, which she does. And then strange things happen again. Which of course involves this little boy in a rain raincoat. This is not too violent or graphic, but it has a different creepy clarity that is not found in many modern horror movies, and it's worth seeing. One wonders why it is so difficult to find good horror movies in this day and age, but here is one that is criminally overlooked and definitely worth your time if you review it. 8 out of 10.
