This film is one of the classics of the history of cinema. It was not made to please modern audiences, so some people today may think it is squeaky or forced. I have found that it absorbs everything. Cherkassov has exactly the right presence to play Alexander Nevskyi, just as he did when he played with Ivan Groznyi (Ivan the Terrible) several years later. The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was the poor soundtrack that was quite confusing. Although I only know a little Russian, it would have been nice to be able to choose more words instead of having to rely almost 100% on the subtitles. However, I was watching this on an old video tape from the library. Maybe there already exists a DVD version in which the sound has been improved. I would like to know if the actors used the Russian archaic or even the old ecclesiastical Slavic when they spoke. The subtitles were oddly worded, and I find it hard to say if this was to reflect an older way of speaking, or if the subtitles were a bit wrong.
