I just saw "Checking Out" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. What a fantastic combination of a moving story and a great cast. Director Jeff Hare has done an excellent job of inviting the audience to the disconnected, though hilarious, world of Morris Applebaum and his family. Family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy crazy pranks and feel the pain and worry that they have for each other. <br /> <br /> Usually, I am not a fan of Peter Falk, but he IS Morris Applebaum and plays the role with great humor and humanity. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone can watch this wonderful movie and enjoy it as I did. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the Director, Cast, and Crew for a job well done!
