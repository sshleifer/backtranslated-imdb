This had just started on television when I opened it, and since I was too lazy to change the channel, I ended up watching it. Man, he was so lucky. <br /> <br /> This film is more of a fairytale than a demanding and, at times, openly sentimental drama. It is definitely what one might call a movie to feel good, and it usually seems boring or irritating to me. However, this movie is so well done that I could not help but love it. The script will not twist your brain; It is conventional, but impeccable. The actors are brilliant, each of them is perfect for the role. There is not much of a score, but the music fragments improve the movie beautifully. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate other things that are not expensive pyrotechnics, vicious murders or save the world in a movie, look at this if you ever have the chance 5/5
