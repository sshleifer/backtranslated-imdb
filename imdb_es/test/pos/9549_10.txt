There are movies that make careers. For George Romero, it was the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD; for Kevin Smith, CLERKS; for Robert Rodriguez, EL MARIACHI. Add to that list the absolutely incredible DING-A-LING-LESS by Onur Tukel. Impeccable movie creation, and as safe and as professional as any of the aforementioned films. I have not laughed so much since I saw THE FULL MONTY. (And, even so, I do not think I've laughed so hard ... So to speak.) Tukel's talent is considerable: DING-A-LING-LESS is so full of double meanings that one would have to sit down with a copy of this script and perform a line by line exam to fully appreciate the amplitude and width of it. All the shots are beautifully composed (a clear sign of a safe director), and the performances are solid (you can not expect a movie like this). DING-A-LING-LESS is a movie whose time has come.
