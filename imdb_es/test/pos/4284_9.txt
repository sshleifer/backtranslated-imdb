There are many more complexities in the plot of this wonderful movie that provokes thoughts that only infidelity and concealment of responsibility for the accident. I was surprised by the initial apparent goodness of her husband, Wilkinson, who wanted the driver, when he thought it was Everett, he revealed it to the police and the change of heart (and moral) when he learned that it was his wife. Besides, was he really good and / or was he trying to redeem himself by allowing him to go with Rupert? Then, things changed and SHE decided that the correct thing was to admit that she had hit him. The most important thing is that the theme of redemption (by accident, by infidelity, in its strange and defective way) is the strongest in the care of Everett by the sick of Watson. I think that's why she undertook that effort. <br /> <br /> This seems to be a common theme in modern British novels: Brideshead Revisited, The End of the Affair comes to mind. Love it.
