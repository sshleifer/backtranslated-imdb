Nynke is a film filmed with class in the same style as the Oscar-winning film, Character (1997). But this comparison immediately urges me to add that the latter was much more exciting ... <br /> <br /> Sure, Nynke is a beautiful historical drama and costumes (with a fantastic performance by Monic Hendrickx!) In the that you are witness to Personal Growth of 'Nynke van Hichtum' in his marriage to Pieter Jelles Troelstra. The subtitle of this film is "a love story". So it begins, and it ends with your marriage. <br /> <br /> But THAT is where the director makes a crucial mistake! The exciting and independent life of Nynke began when the marriage ended. He wrote several books for children and traveled all over the world. What a great life she has lived. But Pieter Verhoeff puts Nynke back on the road to the convention that depressed and fought her: the idea that her life extended only to her marriage to Troelstra, being nobody but the mother of her children. <br /> <br /> Let's all wait for Nynke II!
