I think this is one of the best Tamil movies I've seen in a long time. I love the fact that it does not revolve around a boy and a girl falling in love and who made the movie so brilliantly. The cast did a great job and I especially congratulate the girl. It was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child looking for his real mother. Best of all are the songs, beautiful music and lyrics in movement. There are some great songs in this movement ya'll! especially 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' and 'Velai Pookal'. Great songs, both I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and a great performance (and excellent songs!). Greetings Simran.
