One of the best memories of my childhood. It should be on DVD. It captured everything we grew up in the seventies: peace, softness, floral power and great acoustic music. The two hostesses, Carol and Paula, were the definitive pacifist style hippies, with long hair, peasant blouses and bell-bottoms (they looked like a Katherine Ross (wing "The Graduate") and Ali McGraw (wing "Love Story"), respectively .) <br /> <br /> We were happy with the jokes of the margarita "chucklepatch", they gave us lessons on how to be friendly through conversations with the garden squirrel and entertained us with music from their guitar. They were the best, and Carol was also the original Sandy in the original production of "Grease" (cool). <br /> <br /> This program should be in a time capsule of the era that would also include, "The Yellow Submarine", "Arrow to the Sun", and Marlo Thomas', "Free to Be ... You & Me. ", Also," Sunshine "and" The Point ". <br /> <br /> And Last, but not least, the main theme: "See you, see you, I hope we've had a good time, well, ah, I'm glad to say good morning", I hope that we can see them again, see now, see you, I'm glad you can stay for a while, ah, I hope we see each other again, see each other, see each other.
