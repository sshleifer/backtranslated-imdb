I have never seen "American Werewolf in London" but this movie was very entertaining. When renting it, I thought it was a horror movie, but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some aspects of horror. I thought that the sequences of transformation were well done, but as for the effects, the best scenes were those in which the effects and the lighting were built together, well. The transformations reminded me of many transformations of werewolf in other movies, but werewolves are very bestial and not very similar to dogs. Gore: I think there's too much in this movie, it really takes away the horror, when every painting has blood, it's very difficult to take violence seriously. <br /> <br /> J.Hurst (8th grade)
