Created by Dennis Spooner, the "Department S" was a brilliant thriller about a subsidiary of Interpol, based in Geneva, created to solve puzzling mysteries that the police could not handle. If a plane landed at Heathrow with no one on board, if a man was wandering around London in a spacesuit, if the passenger of a Rolls Royce was suddenly transformed into a skeleton, if a train entering a subway station appeared contain the dead travelers, called the 'Department S' to fix things. <br /> <br /> Peter Wyngarde played 'Jason King', a crime novelist dressed in extravagance whose fertile imagination helped solve many of the strange cases. King captured the public's fantasy and later received a derivative show. He was skillfully assisted by the American 'Stuart Sullivan' (Joel Fabiani) and the delicious 'Annabelle Hurst' (Rosemary Nicols). Unusually for a '60 program, the department was run by a black man: 'Sir Curtis Seretse' (Dennis Alaba Peters) If the show looked and looked a lot like 'The Avengers', it was not surprising. I shared many of the same writers and directors! The colorful titles were designed by Chambers & Partners, and it's worth tuning in alone. As was the case with so many I.T.C. Series, the music was composed by Edwin Astley. His theme for the 'Department S' has to be classified as one of the best television themes of all time. <br /> <br /> Predictably, the show looks a bit sexist and is dated now, but do not let that deter you. Imagine a hybrid of the 'Jonathan Creek' and 'Austin Powers' movies and you have the' Department S '! <br /> <br /> Note of trivia: the characteristics of the episode 'A little war of nerves' A young Sir Anthony Hopkins in an important role!
