I watched this movie at the NFT in London, where it was shown as part of BFI's John Huston season. I was not sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the movie were very little. In fact, the rest of the movie continued to give little away! No real plot, no action, no suspense, very little drama and, except for a short section at the end, no stage. <br /> <br /> The result of the lack of all these features was, however, a wonderful movie. I do not completely understand why, but I think that its discreet nature made the film almost completely perfect. The acting, the script and, most important of all, the casting were successful and I can not remember getting away from a movie theater feeling so good, but I still can not understand why. I only know that I will get the DVD (this is one of those movies that, I'm sure, will be as good on the small screen as the movie experience, as long as I can find a quiet place to watch it!) And I'll see it again soon. I will also be interested to know what my family and friends think of him. I am sure that it will not be everyone's choice, but I am convinced that a large number will agree with my opinion. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
