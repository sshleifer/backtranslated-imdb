Both the critics and the public had a lot to do with this movie, but I did not really think it was so bad! Even the critics I normally agree with thought it was crap, and I usually despise the "horror movies" of PG-13. So, this means one of two things: (1) I am too easily pleased, and my liking for movies has diminished over the years, or (2) "When a stranger calls" is not as horrible as it seems. be. Now, to be fair, some of the criticisms of the film are true: there is not much development of the character and not much happens in the story. But, live friends, what did you expect from a movie about the harassment of a nanny? Cut them a little loose! As a former nanny who was watching this movie late at night with the lights off, I can safely say that the stalker was a spooky mofo. Who knows? I guess this kind of thing just makes me want to go back. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit that I had fun seeing this, and I do not care how big the minority it puts me.
