People who compare this movie with blockbusters like The Lord of the Rings or The Matrix will inevitably be disappointed by the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks the great special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgam of two old folk tales here. The talent of the performance, although not from the A list, is still excellent and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with a cast of the A list. My favorite in particular of this film is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Reina de las Nieves was quite moving, greatly assisted by a great wardrobe and makeup. She injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fall season corrupted by the evil magic of the devil. A part of Fonda, the performance was not what we expected from Hollywood, which I think is a good thing, since Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train their talent to play roles, so they have become obsolete and reliable . CGI and other special effects to get away from the actors who use all the same tricks with us. Instead, it shows new ideas, some real thoughts from the actors about how they can find new variations on the old themes of love and danger.
