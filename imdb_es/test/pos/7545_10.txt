This bright and funny English comedy about schoolgirl antics is a forgotten jewel. The important question is where is the audience? The movie has a rating of 10 by most voters, but how many voters is that? They do not do comedies like this anymore because the films are not distributed or seen. I would never miss the opportunity to see this classic of the old art house again. But where are the art houses?
