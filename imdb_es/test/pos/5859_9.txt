I can get very tired of murder mysteries with the exception of a few really excellent television series. Otherwise, there are too many of these issues in the murder plot. I do not like the issue of the two selfish, cunning young people who kill as an intellectual exercise, I'm not at all interested in Hitchcock who seems to have been associated with this in some way I do not intend to find out. . But do not get me wrong, the theme is excellent in itself, the whole movie is very well done and, of course, Sandra Bullock is superlative as always. <br /> <br /> Sandra's character (as in Miss Congeniality) is not classified by the male team she works with despite her obvious abilities, and the boss mostly ignores her ideas, eventually forcing her to one side and he gives the case to his male partner. Of course, Sandra discovers what is happening and almost dies in a very dramatic outcome. It is intriguing how the boy who worked out the murder plan can not allow his colleague to kill her. She has some kind of consciousness and maybe she could be "saved", while the other is a true psychopath. <br /> <Sandra's hard shell is caused by the misery in her past that is so movingly linked to the murder case. Her colleague, realizing that Sandra is solving this case despite the fact that the dense superior stopped her, finally discovers what happened to Sandra in her. teenagers, who now must face and exorcise and the last scene shows its beginning, we hope that anyway, to do that. <br /> <br /> I can see in the other few reviews that I've had time to read that this movie would appeal to a broad group: those interested in the two spoiled children who spend time with their frightening philosophical determination to deceive to the police and escape with the perfect murder, the relationship between them that is described so cleverly, the horrific links to the past of the heroine, a policewoman. theme, and some fumes and mirrors, as well as for Hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> For those who have asked why Bullock's character has to have a troubled past, I really think this would be a much less interesting movie if she had been just a detective trying to understand what was happening. , with a partner willing to help and a chauvinist-chauvinist boss. The link between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show that the detective is too involved or, otherwise, how would he lose the confidence of his arrogant boss and, therefore, almost lose his life? That's not an original topic, in fact, it's usually an extremely irritating topic, since this sexist macho boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired agent to leave the case and leave it to someone who clearly does not have the skills to solve. although the partner is. I was worrying a lot about the ending, what could happen to Sandra's character as her emotional involvement in the case and a special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime that drove her with this case alone. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the relationship between Bullock's character and his partner. That is interesting and, at times, very moving. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two guys is definitely intriguing, if that's what you were interested in seeing. I felt that he remained discreet in some way, either because the filmmakers did not want to have too many friendships between boys and girls, or because we were not supposed to think that emotion governed their relationship. The movie makes you wonder intelligently which guy is in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity in several stages. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that I wish would have been clarified and that is what happens "after the movie ends" when the character of Sandra arrives at the Court ... you need to see the movie to know why it is there. <br /> <br /> Very well acted by all. I certainly can not agree with those who complained about Bullock's performance, she was excellent. The part suited him very well indeed. The story is exciting even if the mysteries of murder are not your thing and often are not mine.
