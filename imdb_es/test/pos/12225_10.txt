I love this program. It is really unique. I had the impression that I was going to have more seasons. Anticipating the series 2, I recently bought the series 1 to see it again and update it when part 2 started. Now, after seeing it, I was excited and craved more, so I came to the site to see the calendar of the continuation. I am really disappointed to see that there are no longer plans for a second series, as I was eager to see more of this story. I think they really dropped the ball in this case. There were a lot of story lines to build and many unanswered questions. Now I am a very unhappy vision and I hope that you reconsider your decision and take back the story where you left it.
