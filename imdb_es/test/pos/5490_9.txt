I was watching Perfect Storm, and I thought of another Wolfgang Peterson movie that is much better, this one. Although it is certainly not based on a true story, In the line of fire is how a movie should be made. It has a great story with a great cast. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance as the spooky assassin with a grudge against the government he served too well. Eastwood is good as the Secret Service tortured and Russo is nice to look at. If you have not seen it, definitely pick it up or buy it like I did. Definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the last decade. 9/10
