When I was engaged, my fianc√© and I frequented adult bookstores. I would search for your favorite magazines and, occasionally, a video that caught your attention. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had only seen another movie when there was a satellite channel called XXX (which was about a private eye that unraveled a case) that actually had a suitable plot and was nice. Everyone else was grunting, snorting, blowing and all that. There are only so many times that you can see a blonde bimbo simulating 'it'. <br /> <br /> This movie caught my attention, and I migrated to it, allowing it to roam around the store. He realized (how hard was it?) They smile, I was really interested in something, laughs (!) In the video section!) And I went to buy the slightly used copy. We took it home and I loved it. Here was a "Porno" with a plot. I was not even sure it was classified as porn, but I use the word simply. <br /> <br /> The librarian was a character I could identify with. Alice rejected her boyfriend's advances. She was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prudent in her comments. Bill left, and she continued to check books. The White Rabbit ran through the library (a book, if you look closely, I think (it's been ten years since I saw the movie) it was Lewis C.) and Alice, for the same reason that it drives teenagers to Running into the forest when a maniac with chain saw is behind them instead of towards populated areas, follow. It is the best way to advance the plot. Alice is in Wonderland. <br /> <br /> I hardly remember all the details, but I do remember clearly the bath in the lake and how it "dried up". I liked the way they put Humpty Dumpty Up back, the Mad Hatter member was in his hat to wear it with pride, and the brother team of Dum and Dee (which did bother me a bit, again, they could have I have been husband wife, but I could never say, no matter how many times I saw him). The woman of the gentleman who told Alice to leave and find your own Knight (What makes a nice girl like you in a Knight like this?). <br /> <br /> The part that really caught my attention when I saw her about a year or so was one of the letters (3 of hearts, I think) that looked exactly like my ex's current wife. We could not help but bother her for being in the movie! The king of hearts was interesting, and the queen was even more so. Due to the opening of the forum, I can not go into details, I just say that it was based on "orgy" and we will leave it that way. <br /> <br /> When we separated, I was allowed to take the video, I knew I liked it, but in the time since I got lost in the loans. Someday I will find another copy. <br /> <br /> By the way, if someone could tell me what kind of scene was cut from the Amazon version, I would really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. I recommend this movie for people over 18 years old. It was soft, sweet and really from the 70s, but I liked it enormously. <br /> <br /> ***** of 5. D.
