Normally, I do not check online, but it's Saturday and I'm stuck in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch science fiction movies and Xena: the warrior princess (I can not get the damn 'Joxer the Mighty' song out of my head, it has been there for the last ten years or so, it just shows up randomly when someone (I) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this movie and you actually post it on the Internet, do you have ANY idea of ​​how stupid it is? If you expect more from Bruce Campbell than he does (in the most literal sense) than why in the holy name of Gd, do you see his films? Nobody sees a Bruce Campbell movie when he wants to see something genius and intelligible, we see them so that we feel better with ourselves (like those people who see Jerry Springer and eat Chunky Monkey), and we easily entertain ourselves with meaningless psychopaths. I, personally, love the films of Bruce Campbell. I'm not a complete idiot, in fact, I look like an intellectual and a scholar (haha, shut up, Ally). His films reflect crazy, random, peculiar and ridiculous ideals that anyone with a brain, screaming or not, can enjoy. That, and it was a bit sexy in Xena: the warrior princess, even with facial hair. I rate this movie with an excellent 10, just because I can. If you can not take simplistic plot schemes (if there are any), hot girls with a sci-fi splendor (leather, spandex), and relatives, if they have not run out, the sights of madness, after crying out loud, do not watch the movie (or anyone who mentions the name of Bruce Campbell). Oh yes, Ted Raimi was amazing in this movie! That's how Ted is made! You did the best with what you had. ;
