Where do I start? Let me say that, after having seen the whole movie and the special features of the DVD, my wife and I went back to watch the whole movie with the director's comments. I do not remember having endured more than 7 minutes of said comment for a movie. It's worth listening. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Southern boy, but I spent some time in Memphis a long time ago, and I have an idea of ​​the area. This movie almost smells like the south, it's so real. Samuel Jackson, one of my favorite actors of all time, is magnificent as the emotionally inclined Lázaro, and Christina Ricci offers the performance of a lifetime as Rae, a woman who has been seriously injured during her brief life. I have always liked the work of Mrs. Ricci, but in this performance 137% of herself is given every second that is on the screen. The prizes and the small statues are not enough to reward her for what she puts before the audience in this film. <br /> <br /> There are other places where you can read the essence of the story, so I'm just commenting on the work. I heard Justin Timberlake's name before I saw "BSM", but I had no idea what it was like or why he's famous. By hitting my head with 60 years, I am out of their demographic goal, to say the least. After watching this movie I will recognize it. He can act! It gives a substantial and credible performance as the loving soulmate of the county whore. <br /> <br /> The director is from Memphis and shows reverence for his region of origin. He is also a good storyteller. <br /> <br /> ..... and I MUST mention the music. I love blues, and the soundtrack of Black Snake Moan is a real party for blues fans. <br /> <br /> I am writing with less coherence than usual because my enthusiasm for this film is to overcome the structure of my sentences. Watch this movie, and I mean now.
