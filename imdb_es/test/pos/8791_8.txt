Great movie! Oh yeah! Full of energy, full of fun, presenting our generation, our alienation: a hymn to positive thinking despite the world we live in, the story of a great party, the story of a group of friends who desperately must do something in a Weekend. And the only thing that needs to be done is The Club. But fun and ecstasy keep boredom away! Very funny, very grotesque in some points, very well filmed ... and a great soundtrack!
