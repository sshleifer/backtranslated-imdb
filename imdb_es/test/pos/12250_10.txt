Not only do I think this was the best movie of 1987, but it's probably on my own amorphous list as one of the 10 to 20 best movies I've ever seen. For whatever reason, I really connected with this movie, and it is one of the most personal movies I had seen at that time in my life (I was 26 years old). For better or for worse, I strongly identified with the character of Holly Hunter (and I am a boy!). She plays an extremely bright, loyal and intense woman who could not understand romantic relationships. There were so many things he said in this movie that they were things that I would say or say to others in similar circumstances. And the end of the movie seems very, very sad to me. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this role was the great opportunity for Holly Hunter. Clearly, I was not the only one who thought it so well.
