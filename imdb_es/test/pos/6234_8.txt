Slasher movies started may be 30 to 35 years before this movie, but believe me this is among those pearls that will remain longer after the television has been turned off. Especially if you are a person who is easily scared, this is the movie for which you would not have the stomach to fill up. Even after so many years, the film has not lost its charm and emotion. <br /> <br /> There is no blood or gore, but the emotion will surely drive you crazy. The film begins with the explosion and stays with the same rhythm until its end. BGM is a nervous fissure and I remember that this was the copy in many Indian films in those days. Kings favorite? No wonder that ... that's the only reason I wanted to see this and it did not disappoint me. "Do not turn off the lights" ... because you will not find Enrique, but it can be a smiling doll sitting right behind you! beware. not for those with a light heart ... <br /> <br /> Two hits and I go with 8 out of 10, which is quite low, but I still have my qualifications for Dramas ...
