I went to the premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York and I loved the movie. I'm Diane's # 1 fan and, of course, as always, she gave a great performance! I have seen each of his films and I must say that this is one of my new favorites. Diane was funny and touching and it took my breath away. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly humorous but also a good deal of seriousness. Anton Yelchin is simply a wonderful young actor and gave an incredible performance. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate an excellent movie. 10 thumbs up !!! I would definitely go to see it again and again and again. This is the best movie of the year so far !!!
