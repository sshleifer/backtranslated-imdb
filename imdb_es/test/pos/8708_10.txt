This is a perfect example of a classic movie of images of the full moon. Any Horror / Vampire Flicks fan should definitely verify this. Original and good plot, easy to follow story. In addition, this film has some scenes that accelerate the heart and combine horror with action. From now on, the only sequel I've seen in this movie is Part IV, which I must say is almost better than this original. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this should see Puppet Master, Slumber Party Massacre, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp and other Full movies Moon Pictures.
