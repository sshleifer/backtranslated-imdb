Based loosely on real events, "River's Edge" is a film, David Lynch-like, about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but nobody does anything about it for a long time. hour. With the first class performance of Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we can forgive the average performance of everyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a child, Tim (Joshua John Miller), dropping a doll off a bridge (murder # 1). Tim then hears someone scream, when he looks up he sees Samson (Daniel Roebuck) standing on the riverbank with the naked body of his girlfriend behind him (murder # 2). Samson finally shows the body to his friends. All of whom are horrified, not only for the murder, but also because the victim, Jamie (Danyi Deats), was a friend of his. Despite all this, nobody goes to the police. You may think that this is not realistic, but this is what happened in the real story. If you are familiar with the story of "Alpha Dog" (2006) you will know that the same thing happened there as well. Through all of this, Layne (Crispin Glover) is working to keep Samson safe, though no one (including Samson) seems to mind keeping him safe. As time goes by, we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper), a middle-aged adult who sells drugs to local teens, has also killed a woman before (murder # 3). From here, Samson and his friends begin to approach and, finally, everything is revealed, but not in the way you could be waiting. <br /> <br /> In the film, we discovered three murders, each with a different perspective. reason, a different reaction and a different effect on those involved. When Tim drops his little sister's wrist off the bridge, we never realize his motive. However, we do see the reaction of the younger sister. She cries and screams while her mother comforts her. Later, her older brother, Matt (Keanu Reeves), helps her put a cross in the yard in memory of her doll. The murder of Jamie horrifies everyone (except Samson, who is apathetic to the whole situation, and when Layne asks why he did it, Samson responds with: "She was talking sh * t"), but they do not sob or scream. They flee and continue with their lives trying to forget what happened. In Feck's situation, he did not kill his girlfriend out of hatred. We never really know why he killed her, but we see that Feck is not proud of what he had done. He even mentions that he feels it and that she loved it. From this we see the different ways in which we can be affected by death. In the film, it is easy for us to identify with teenagers, because they do not know what they feel or how they should feel about their friend's death. In the same way, we, the public, do not know how to feel, because we do not know Jamie. Obviously we are sad about death and we realize that Samson should be arrested, but we do not feel much about Jamie as an individual. <br /> <br /> There are several similarities between "River's Edge" and "Twin Peaks" (1990-1991), especially in the overall feel of the film. I wonder if Mark Frost and David Lynch were thinking about "River's Edge" when they were creating their series. After all, Tim Hunter continued directing three episodes of "Twin Peaks." <br /> <br /> The performance of Crispin Glover as the hyperactive and frantic Layne is a performance worthy of an Oscar. Always in a hurry and always worried about avoiding Samson, Layne is an intense character who seems to be accelerated. If you've seen Crispin Glover in a movie, you know he can offer a line like nobody else. It is always a pleasure to see him act. The other great performance in "River's Edge" is by Dennis Hopper. Her portrayal of Feck, the drug dealer who has a leg and an inflatable sex doll with whom she speaks of name Elly, reminded me of a more toned and humorous version of Frank Booth, the character of Hopper in the David Lynch movie, " Blue Velvet "(1986). <br /> <br /> River's Edge is a great movie and I think it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic, when in reality we need to step forward and speak out against the evils of the world.
