The questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully prepared historical documentary. The cutting beauty and horror of a man walking through life, are revealed in the totality. Dieter and Herzog combine and connect through a mental labyrinth that has been transformed into a single straight corridor in which the walls have been plastered with images created by the characterization of a man by the vibrations of his own vocal cords. This film, for about 80 minutes, has discovered a new dimension of the narrative. How do I call this seemingly new sense? Only God knows, after all, is not MIRACLE something that God does for us, but chooses to remain ANONYMOUS? <br /> <br /> This is a requirement to see. If you like to experience the enchanting horror of war, this documentary will cleanse your soul to the core.
