A brilliant adventure by Sherlock Holmes starring the brilliant Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Although many other actors brilliantly interpret Holmes and Watson and do a great job, Rathbone and Bruce will always be the best two. <br /> <br /> Holmes takes a Tobell teacher from Switzerland to London. Tobell is wanted by the Nazis. It has a bomb image that could win the Second World War. Your pump site has been divided into four parts, each hidden in books. Tobell is committed to giving its bomb site to the British government. The night of his arrival, Tobell goes to his girlfriend's house. He has drawn some figures of men, if Tobell disappeared, the lady would hand the drawings to Holmes. On his way home he is attacked, but a policeman stops this and the attacker flees. Tobell is glad that the British government uses its bomb site, but refuses to give it to him, Tobell wants to take care of him. The site of the bomb is divided into four parts, each part completely useless without the other. Give a part of each site of this bomb to one of your scientific friends. Then Holmes's greatest fear passes, Tobell disappears. Holmes visits the girl that Tobell was with the night he was attacked. She tells him about the drawings. The drawings have been stolen. She says that only one man came in during the time that Tobell left, to fix the light bulb. The man she describes is Professor Moriarty. He is working for the Nazis. Since he has the drawings, Holmes is finished. But he finds the notepad he used and using Science, he can see what Tobell drew by looking at the next page of the notebook. He sees his code. He sees that it is the name of four scientists. The first three for which the code works, but can not solve the fourth. The three scientists who have worked have been killed and the site of the bomb has been taken. Holmes can not work with the fourth scientist, but neither can Moriarty. Disguised as a sailor, Holmes manages to get to Moriarty's office. Moriarty sees immediately that it is Holmes, puts it in a box and throws it into the sea. But Watson and Lestrade insist that they check the box and find Holmes in it. Now it is obvious that Moriarty is at liberty. Holmes manages to elaborate the fourth code, a Frederick Hoffner. Holmes arrives at his house immediately and gets Hoffner and the decisive fourth part to get safe. Holmes now needs Moriarty to be accused of working with the Nazis. He pretends to be Hoffner. Moriarty elaborates the fourth code and gets two men to look for Hoffner. They take him back and he finds himself face to face with Moriarty. Meanwhile, Tobell is not well, he has been tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. Moriarty has had it with Holmes now, he has it and his death must be long for Holmes. The idea is to put him in his hospital, put a needle in his vein and watch him die because of blood loss, drop by drop. Watson runs and saves the day however. Moriarty escapes, but Holmes was only careless enough to leave Moriarty's trap open. Moriarty sinks sixty feet. <br /> <br /> Then, Moriarty died. No. She makes her last exit in the movie "The woman in green", but in "Green" she is definitely dead, a suicide, she jumps from her roof. It was the second of the three appearances by Moriarty in the Rathbone series, a different actor performing on each occasion. His first appearance in 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' was performed by George Zucco, his second in this film was played by Lionell Atwill and Henry Daniels played in his final output in 'The Woman in Green'. The first three films of Holmes. The universals were established in the war when Holmes triumphs over the Nazis. 'The Voice of Terror' was the first, then this movie and then 'Sherlock Holmes In Washington'. Then he returned to Victorian times, with definite relationships with Edwardian and Georgian (George, fifth and sixth) times. This film had a close link with the Sherlock Holmes story 'The Dancing Men' that can be found in 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes'. A great movie, although of obvious propaganda, was a brilliant presentation by Holmes.
