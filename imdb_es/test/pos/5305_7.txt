As a fan of Studio Ghibli and especially of Hayao Miyazaki's films, I went to the movie on opening day. When I left the theater I had the strange feeling that something was missing, this "magical" feeling that I was experiencing in all the Miyazaki movies before, but I could not say why it failed this time. After thinking about the other Ghibli movies, I can know the reason: this movie had most of the elements of a great Miyazaki anime: cute characters, wonderful key animation, a great soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi and the warm narration of stories that gives you the opportunity. Sensation of watching a high quality Japanese animation movie. However, two elements were missing: a profound history and dramaturgy. The purpose of this film was obviously to entertain young children with a simple story as in the case of "Totoro", so a complicated story like the one told in "Spirited Away" or "Princess Mononoke" is not really necessary , but on the other hand, by the hand, this story was simply too superficial. I could not connect with the main characters, because there was no character development, the dramatic scenes were limited and did not last long. I really hate giving only 7 stars to a Miyazaki movie, because I would give 10 stars to all the previous movies immediately, but this time it just was not this wonderful "ghibli experience".
