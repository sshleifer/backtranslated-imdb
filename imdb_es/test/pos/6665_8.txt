I really enjoyed it the two times I saw it. And on both occasions, I walked away thinking about it and the "morality of history" to a large extent. I agree with another critic that the film does not focus on the science fiction aspects that might be expected from an alien movie on Earth, but rather deals with the human condition. The characters in the psychiatric hospital provide a great perspective of this and how they move from despair to hope. This film has touches of sadness to humor and sympathy to the final "is he or is not he." The last question was well handled and although some might argue that you do not know what happens in the end and the question remains unanswered, I think it is done in much more detail than something like the movie Ronin (with Robert De Niro) where you never discover what's in the box and you feel very frustrated about it. I highly recommend K-PAX. 8/10
