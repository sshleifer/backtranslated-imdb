Do not Change Your Husband is, on the one hand, the beginning of a series of light marital comedies by Cecil B. DeMille. On the other hand, it is his first film starring Gloria Swanson, probably the best actress of the silent era, and it is the movie that made her a star. <br /> <br /> Although DeMille's old formula was beginning to change, and his films became more verbal and less purely visual, with an artist as expressive as Swanson we recovered much of that silent narrative style. His character does very little, but transmits volumes through subtle gestures and facial expressions. With a particular talent for looks of disdain. In real life, Swanson was nearing the end of his disastrous marriage to Wallace Beery, and it is possible that this fact has fueled his convincing performance. <br /> <br /> As to better complement the talents of your main woman, DeMille's use of The Framing and close-ups are particularly strong here. Do you use the cinematic technique to show off the performance? Often holding Swanson in long close-ups at key moments? And also to visually clarify the story. For example, when they introduce us to the character of Toodles, she is seen reflected three times in the mirror of a dresser. His character disappears from the story, only to become important towards the end. That first take of her attention helps us remember who she was. Later, at the anniversary dinner, Swanson and future husband number two, Lew Cody, are framed in one shot, while Elliot Dexter is isolated in his own plot. As well ?? And is this a sign of the growing sophistication of cinema in general? Is there much use of reaction shots? for example, the look of disapproval of the bishop when Cody represents his intentions with the dolls of the wedding figure. <br /> <br /> In contrast to DeMille's visual narrative method, it was the increasingly verbose screen writing of his collaborator Jeanie Macpherson. As I pointed out in several other comments, Macpherson was able to put together a strong and dramatic story, but like DeMille, he tended to express his themes in a somewhat pretentious and extravagant style. And so we get these very long quasi-philosophical title letters about the pitfalls of married life that, if they improve the story, it's only because they are involuntarily fun. For example, only Jeanie Macpherson could find a line like "Fate sometimes hides in Christmas shopping". Fortunately, although in this picture these titles mostly introduce scenes instead of dividing them. <br /> <br /> Although the images he made at this time tended to be small scale, it is at this point that DeMille seems to develop his taste. For the spectacular. You can watch him begin to sneak out excuses for a little razzmatazz as Swanson's little fantasy scenes are bathed with "Pleasure, Wealth and Love". It would not be until twenty years after the unofficial embargo of historical images was lifted, that he would have the opportunity to do everything possible with the great spectacle. <br /> <br /> In general, do not change your opinion. The husband is a pretty decent image of DeMille, although to be honest, it is only the presence of Gloria Swanson that elevates him above the average. It's curious, though, that this is supposed to be a comedy, and Swanson was chosen at least in part because of her experience at Mack Sennett's slapstick factory. She hated comedy, and here she gives a dramatic performance instead of a comedy. It makes sense then that the only direct drama he did with DeMille, Man and Woman, was by far the strongest of his collaborations.
