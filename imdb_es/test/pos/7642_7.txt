Like a winding rural road, "Tough Luck" takes the viewer for a spin. There is nothing wrong with the curves of the plot, as long as the credibility does not fly out the window. Unfortunately, in the end, the film challenges the belief tolerance of an audience. However, it is easy to forgive this flaw due to superior performance, character development and the wonderful carnival atmosphere. Do not expect that you like any of the characters. Armand Asante, Norman Redus and Dagmara Dominczyk, play shadowy swindlers, not exactly the kind of person who is easily admired. The double crosses come fast and furious, and the final cross is a bit exaggerated. Recommended. - MERK
