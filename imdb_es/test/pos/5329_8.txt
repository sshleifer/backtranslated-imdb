Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) has committed an indescribable crime, the stabbing of the retarded younger brother of his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone). No one, much less Leland himself, can explain why he did what he did, whether premeditated or spontaneous, done out of hatred or love. <br /> <br /> At the detention center, Leland meets Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle), a former novel writer who sees in Leland's case a second chance. But Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivation and take him under his wing as a confidant in prison. <br /> <br /> The film jumps from the past to the present several times, often allowing the past to act as context. to the present, and vice versa. Writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge shows how Leland's crime, and the events that led to it, affect the people in his life, from Becky to his family to Leland's mother (Lena Olin) and the separated father ( Kevin Spacey) to Allen (Chris Klein), a young man who is staying with Becky's family after the death of his own mother. <br /> <br /> The main asset of the film is Gosling, who is considered the 15-year-old pseudo-psychopath. Like Bartleby the Scrivener, Gosling's Leland simply exists; He shows little emotion during the film, but instead his expressions belie an ocean of guilt, sadness, love and anger. <br /> <br /> Each of the main actors offered perhaps their best work to date, except Spacey (who is not exactly a rookie). Special praise is due to Malone and Klein, two young artists who are more known for the cheerful comedy than for the heavy drama of this film. <br /> <br /> Another great benefit in terms of the story is that none of the characters is impeccable. No one is a hero to save the day. This is simply not a black and white movie.
