While I agree that this film lacks real substance and should not be taken seriously, it is primarily aimed at fans of the series who are looking for a quick solution. Bronson (Paul Kersey) once again takes the street (since he does not have a license to kill by the main police) and moves into his friends' apartment (who guessed it) was killed by a street gang that took control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of dying. Bronson systematically kills them one by one as people in the neighborhood are used against him. There are some dynamics between Bronson and Fraker that heads the street gang, it can be said that both enjoy their work. At one point in the movie, after they fought in the city jail, Fraker says: "I'm going to kill an old lady just for you, catching her on the 6:00 news." The "Giggler," a purse snatcher who laughs while committing his crimes, is also pleasing to watch. The film was made in 1985 and most people could probably identify with the stereotypical urban gangs that are part of the film. It's nice to see Bronson (Paul Kersey) get rid of the streets of these thugs. Watch for the appearance of Wildey Magnum, a serious piece of hardware that Bronson manages. I also really liked the soundtrack of this movie.
