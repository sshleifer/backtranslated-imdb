I loved this program, but then I do not remember ever loving anything he did, starting with the "Americanization of Emily." A sheriff of the city who keeps trying to rob the blind of the city and travel to Mexico, has to love him. Like everything he does, he has an ironic flavor that qualifies him as a Garner product. James plays the same character in many of his shows and movies, but somehow he never becomes obsolete. <br /> <br /> P.S. Re: Kill the main character <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, the "good" brother was killed and replaced by the "evil" twin in an effort to increase the ratings, that is; Do it like any other western on television at that time. I think this show was well ahead of its time and I still miss it. A TV without a Jimmy G show is missing something.
