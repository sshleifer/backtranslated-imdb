The few comments I could find online from Barnens รถ really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I asked for it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already passed, so I could not cancel it. I'm very happy now that I could not. It is an extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> I will not give a synopsis of the plot, because other critics have already done so. But I will say that I do not understand the comments that are somber, shocking, strange, clinical, depressing or pornographic. It's certainly very unusual, which I suppose could make it strange for some people, but the other reviews should reflect the reviewers' own problems, because I did not see any of that in the movie I just saw. I'm not attracted to the guys, so the nudity did not seem pornographic at all; he is just a child who tries to discover who he is without help from the irresponsible adults of his life. And it's Sweden, not Utah, so topless women are not a big problem. <br /> <br /> But what surprised me the most is how positive the film is in its representation of this brave and lost child who has a kind of Odyssey. all kinds of strange experiences, seeking, and finally finding, himself. It is fascinating, completely original and deeply satisfying. <br /> <br /> I am not at all surprised that Barnens รถ has won three major Guldbagge prizes, such as best film, director and actor, but I am absolutely surprised that The actor who won was not Tomas Fryk, the boy whose daring acting as Reine must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed, but Ingvar Hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of Stig, the boyfriend of Reine's mother. I do not understand it at all, but it does not alter the fact that this is a great movie.
