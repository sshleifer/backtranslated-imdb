... this noire piece of the film suffers from a cloudy sound (at least, as shown by the inadequate equipment of the Seattle and Maine film festivals) and from the darker paths, while Rickman suffers from an American accent, old tennis shoes and baggy sweats. However, it has chewing moments of stellar landscapes, and the film offers a sinister ambiguity by Norman Reedus, the beautiful Polly Walker, and a surprising ending (broadcast to frequent viewers), while offering a beautiful look at the physiography of Maine and Rickman. It will be released on video (after a cable broadcast) in March. You can not miss any Rickman fan. Ignore the hooey amanita.
