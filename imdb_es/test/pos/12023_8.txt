Note: I have tried not to reveal any important plot turn (or end), but if you are worried about that, please think about watching the movie before continuing reading. Thank you! <br /> <br /> This Obviously, it was a fairly high budget production, launched by Paramount. The story follows the exploits (supposedly true) of Jack Shepard in the London of 1700. He was a locksmith who was blackmailed into a life of crime by the infamous "Thief-Taker" to save his brother's life. After being double crossed by the Thief-Taker, we became a kind of Robin Hood-like figure and won the support of ordinary people. He proceeds to escape from several prisons (including the infamous Newgate), in addition to having time to "entertain" numerous noble ladies. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie, although the plot was a bit predictable. The film was shot in Glencree and Wicklow Ireland and the sets were very well made and seemed realistic. I think Clavell captured quite well the bustling atmosphere of London in the eighteenth century and I enjoyed his creative use of camera angles. And, unlike many films that represent this period, Clavell makes no effort to show us the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived (in one scene several people fight for a meatloaf that has gone through filth in the street) . <br /> <br /> In general, I really liked this movie. I admit that it lacks the wonderful scenery and the underlying political commentary that Clavell's next film, The Last Valley (a parable of the Vietnam War) has, but it still deserves a visit or two. It is unfortunate that it has never been released (in my opinion) on video or DVD.
