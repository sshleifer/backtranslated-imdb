I just saw this at the Philadelphia Film Festival. It was the most wonderful movie, the best I've seen in a long time. The attractive character of Isa is an open person, explorer and (as pointed out in the film) full of love, portrayed without errors by the beautiful Camille Natta. The music that accompanies it is soothing and transporting, a balm for the soul. <br /> <br /> Each character seems to be in conflict in some way, and their interactions (w / conflicts) make up a great story. The story told by A.K. Hangal as the Old Man was magically done, I wanted him to go on and on. <br /> <br /> The fact that Hari seemed to remember his "place" throughout added power to the story: a refreshing change in the bubble. Plot of many modern writers. <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone, an excellent movie. Go see.
