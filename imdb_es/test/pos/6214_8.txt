This is a wonderful look. You should forgive the play on words to 22 women who talk about their breasts: theirs, their mothers' and other women's, and how they affect many aspects of their lives. Young girls, old women and everyone else (with all shapes, sizes, configurations, etc.) talk about developing, reacting, celebrating, hiding, improving or reducing their breasts. <br /> <br /> It's charming, charming, sad, fun, and everything in between. The interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women and their breasts in what the other half has to say when they talk about documentary images and videos of those famous "young women's movies" that the girls took to the cafeteria to watch. I do not know what you're hearing
