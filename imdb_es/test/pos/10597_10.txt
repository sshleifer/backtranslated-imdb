Haggard does not even need to be qualified, since he was never designed to be qualified as Oscar-winning films are and never intended to have won an Oscar (obviously). If you just look at some of the things that Bam and Bran tried, like the fast moving shots, it is presented as a movie that is more than just cky or jackass (although they are also great). For fun, I definitely give this movie a 10; almost all the scenes made me laugh until my sides ached, like Falcone's movie. If you have not seen this, look at it and then buy it. Personally, my favorite character is the brandon (falcone), it's so soft, natural and random that it's fun, it's very good (with the action figures) and makes things more fun: a mountain bike with diamonds? haggard is definitely a movie in which, in general, humor is only rivaled by anchorman and napoleon dynamite.
