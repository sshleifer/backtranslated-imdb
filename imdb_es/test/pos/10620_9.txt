I've seen this movie, just once, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again and again. Dear David (from Beligium), why did you bother writing a comment about this movie? I just think we can think of you (after reading your comment), is that you're probably a non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie), and you're not ready for the new cinema that's coming. I guess you're a little old, and sexual expression is not part of your "face." The Cannes Film Festival is, by far, the best film festival, and I am pleased to say that this film was awarded with: Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prize. Isabelle Huppert is magnificent, as always, who would make this movie like her? One of his best performances. The music is fantastic, and once again Michael Haneke puts reality on the big screen. It's like a Dogma95 movie, because of the theme. Try to see it <br /> <br />
