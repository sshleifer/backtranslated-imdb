"Batman Returns" from 1992 was Tim Burton's second round as director and once again he achieved success by making this film dark and dark again like 1989. Again, Gotham City is a place of darkness and gloom , with the crime and corruption that come from every corner. It was also smart to see how Burton used politics as a secondary plot that related well to the business corruption of businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the plan to make the "Penguin" (Danny DeVito) mayor of Gotham. Anyway, Keaton returns again as "Batman" / Bruce Wayne and gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who simply can not find love in a normal world; however, he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in Selina Kyle, only Mrs. Kyle has a dark secret of her own that is very furious and she is simply a vampire like the sexy and mysterious but dangerous "Catwoman" (Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan is formed between the two villains to destroy Gotham and, above all, both want to get rid of the bat. This film, although violent and somewhat disgusting with many scenes of penguins, is clearly an exciting adventure from beginning to end, as you never find a dull moment and congratulations to Tim again for his exploration of the characters so dark and conflicting. Even more interesting movie. The performance of Michelle Pfeiffer was the best of all, since no one could have played "The Catwoman" better and Devito was perfect, since the "body of the penguin" of his body fit the character, he simply perfected his performance, although it was fun to see the macabre. "Batman Returns" is an exciting trip that you can not lose sight of, since, as a spectator, you will enjoy it many times, it is that exciting and explosive.
