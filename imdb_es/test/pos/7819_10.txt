I loved this movie, it was cute and fun! Lauren Holly was wonderful, she is funny and very credible in her role. Costas Mandylan was also very good, very good to see too! Brenda Vaccaro, as always was a pleasure to see her, did a great job with her character. It was a pleasure to see a movie that is fun, interesting and that can be seen by the whole family. It is already difficult to find good and healthy movies. Thank God for the Hallmark films, they are wonderful! I wish I could buy it, if anyone knows where I can buy this movie, please let me know! I have bought several Hallmark films and I am very happy with them. I hope to buy this one !!
