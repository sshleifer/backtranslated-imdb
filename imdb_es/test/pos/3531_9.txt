It is possible that it was inevitable that with the avalanche of "slasher" films in the early 1980s, that some good will escape through the cracks. This is a great "weird" movie by Jeff Lieberman, who ensured his cult status with his memorable 70s films "Squirm" and "Blue Sunshine". <br /> <br /> Five young people are heading to the mountains of Oregon (this movie was actually filmed in the place) to camp and review the writing of a land that one of them has acquired. In a short time, they will be predictably terrified by a bulky killer with an incredibly spooky laugh. <br /> <br /> "Just Before Dawn" is noticeably more ambitious, "artistic" and smart than some slasher movies. Actually, Lieberman dismisses the characters, well, two of them, anyway, as much as a 90-minute movie will allow. The film has genuine moments of suspense and tension, and actually abstains from graphic gore, except for a murder right at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There's an above-average cast here, including Oscar winner George Kennedy, like a forest ranger who understandably has become a bit unstable from being alone in the desert for too long. Chris, the son of Jack Lemmon, the future of Brian De Palma, Gregg Henry, the blonde Deborah Benson (it's a shame that she has not become a better known artist, judging by her work here), Ralph Seymour ( "Ghoulies"), Mike Kellin ("Sleepaway Camp"), and Jamie Rose ("Chopper Chicks in Zombietown") complete the cast. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots are interesting, and the old music of Brad Feidel (now more known for its "Terminator" theme) is disturbing and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> This is worth it for the important twist of the plot in about an hour, although at a time of about 75 minutes it involves the heroine and a tree. and the murderer is almost comical; Actually it can remind a viewer of a caricature! One of the smartest touches is the killer's final dispatch, which he had never seen before in a horror movie and probably will not see again. <br /> <br /> I did not give him 10 out of 10 because I honestly can not be so scared. Still, it's an interesting slasher that deserves to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> "That action does not mean anything, son, those mountains can not read." <br /> <br /> 9/10
