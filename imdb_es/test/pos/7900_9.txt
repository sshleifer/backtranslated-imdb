Vanaja is a superlative movie. It has an exceptionally well thought out cast, with Mamatha as the jewel in the crown, an excellent production and possibly a preproduction with Rajnesh at the helm, a fantastic journey through rural South India through the eyes of a 15-year-old , a remarkable mix of song and dance, traditional and modern, combined to perfection, and a beautiful backdrop of exuberant color of the flora and fauna that make up the magnificent experience. What a great achievement for a debut director! The casting was absolutely dead. I wish India would come out with more of those movies. This movie will remain one of my best favorites of my life. 9/10.
