After reading some of the previous unpleasant comments, I had to put my two cents. This show was NOT, despite what that thug thinks in Essex, the worst that has been aired on television. I think most of today's television is much worse (when will this stupid "reality" end to fashion?) And there is no current program that I can watch. Give me the things that I grew up with. I'm a 1965 baby and I'm not ashamed to admit it. <br /> <br /> This program has been my favorite of all time for almost 30 years. I was in high school when it was originally broadcast and I think it helped me endure during those miserable days. I was so misfit back then, and "Fantasy Island" attracted my imagination. Since I was a budding writer in those days, he gave me incredible opportunities to practice the trade. What a wonderful premise! I will not say that he did not have his faults. Sometimes the scripts were pretty bad, and some of the problems seemed trivial; But it could be good too, and it was wonderful to look at and still is. As for the cheese factor, well, I think it's unfair to label every product of the 70 as cheesy. There were a lot of great things back then and this was between the ranks. (BTW, most seasons were aired in the 80s! ") My favorite episodes came mainly from seasons 2, 3 and 4. <br /> <br /> To those who disparage Herv√© Villechaize for his strong French accent and his short stature: GROW AND LEARN SOMETHING It's so easy to make fun of when you're "normal" and "perfect." That man did the best of what he was treated in life, and if you do not like it, it's difficult. A bit of compassion, he's been dead for 15 years, and how easy it is to cut someone who can not defend themselves ... There's no longer any shame. <br /> <br /> I love this program, so it seems old-fashioned. but we did not have special effects and Blu-ray discs, we were lucky enough to have VCRs, live with it, accept it for what it is, and that's just fun. "Escapist TV" describes it perfectly, and that's what it was for me: an escape from my rotten life, and it's still fun to watch.
