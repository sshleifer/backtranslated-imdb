Then, when I first saw the announcements for the Greeks, I had some questions about how they would approach Greek life, if they were going to reveal sacred secrets of brotherhood and brotherhood, if they were going to focus on brotherhood and brotherhood, a fraternity. or the brotherhood of women, or what most college students think of Greek life as a big party. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it covered everything. The plot of the story was great, it gave you a character to love, hate, someone you want to be with, someone you do not want to be with and, of course, a crazy roommate! <br /> <br /> It was one of my first looks at how the writers believed it was the life of the Greeks, and I can honestly say that they were quite successful. <br /> <br /> I love how it was one of the most important things that they covered throughout the season. The relationship between Rusty and his crazy roommate. It's hard enough to move out of the house and be forced to live in a small room with someone you do not even know, then come and find out ... you have nothing in common. Probably all the newcomers to the university are the worst nightmare. <br /> <br /> Casey, Rustys' sister, was practically the typical girl on campus that EVERYONE is jealous of. What did not she have? Oh, that's right ... Evan everything for herself. Rebecca and Evan had an "issue" at the beginning of the season, which made you feel quite sympathetic for Casey. His character evolved, and his relationship with Rusty became increasingly loving and sociable. <br /> <br /> Cappie is one of the fun loving characters, and absolutely crazy. One of my favorite episodes included him being completely trashed in a strip club, and Rusty had to call Casey to rescue them. I like how they approached the issue of gay people in Greek homes, Calvin was a character with very real feelings, and really respected him because he sticks to his standards. So Jen K was pretty crazy, but she really liked Rusty. It was surprising and I kept questioning her from the beginning, but, of course, I wanted it to work between her and Rusty. <br /> <br /> I am definitely waiting for the return of the Greek. It takes you to the truth of Greek life, something that many people look beyond. One of the greatest things for which fraternities and brotherhoods are known are parties and drinking. The Greek is a great show, and the characters are easy to relate.
