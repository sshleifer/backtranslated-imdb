Yes, I'm ashamed to admit it, but this program is absolutely factual. It's so entertaining, and I have the best time to see it. Since Cycle 1 it has been great, and I have not noticed a fall in it. glory in everything. Tyra Banks, as you know, is the host, and as fabulous as she is, there are also the other judges and co-hosts such as J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Nigel Barker and Twiggy. The main point of the show is for all the girls invited to become the Next Top Model of the United States, they have to make their way to the top completing and winning photo session competitions. Sounds good already, right, and let me tell you, IT'S GREAT? It's amazing to see all the different types of photos that the girls take, and each one is different, great and daring. Anyone who hates this program, has no idea, and I will tell you that this program will be available for a long time, so deal with that!
