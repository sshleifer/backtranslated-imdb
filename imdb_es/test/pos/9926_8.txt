One of his lesser-known films, many terror fans have not yet grasped this offer from Dario Argento, which is unfortunate. It is underestimated mainly due to the fact that there really are not enough people who have seen it. The film features grade A Argento gore, with its close-ups accustomed to wild rock scores. While it is true that this script is not very complex, it is not as bad as other entries in its genre, or your own personal resume. <br /> <br /> This film symbolizes more the 'terror' that he likes to portray in his films by his own admission. It is worth a good look at any night.
