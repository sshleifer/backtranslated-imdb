Great movie. Post-apocalyptic movies kick ass. This is not an exception. He kept pace and interest without a shred of dialogue (mainly through good character development). The fight between Reno and the hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and weapons of medieval style to show how primitive and wild humanity had become without its technology and guzzalina. The connection between the beginning and the end was a bit spacious, that is, it cost me to understand the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence. In short, the progression of the character, the design, the story without the mattress of dialogue and, what is more important, the always desolate scenario of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
