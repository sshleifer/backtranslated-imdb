Rainy day with little to do. We were browsing the channels of the movie network and discovered that it was just starting, so we gave it a try. <br /> <br /> The more we looked, the more we became absorbed in the story. It's the old story of the weakest of the working class trying to succeed in a sport that at the time (1913 I think) used to play the wealthy upper class, but this film was as interesting as Seabiscuit and also based on a true story. <br /> <br /> The acting is credible and the casting is brilliant. Y . . . We are NOT golfers, so do not miss it just because it's about golf. Any individual sport would serve the plot, because it's about the people. Golf works well for this story because of class distinction and snobbery that seem to involve some of those who play the game. <br /> <br /> In a few words. . . . It is a good movie to feel good. It is well organized and it is not always fun to see that those who think they are better than others are collapsing one or two.
