I had never been so surprised by such an old movie. Only "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" holds this well, in terms of performance. As someone who has seen heroin addiction firsthand, I was surprised at how realistic this film was. The performance of Frank Sinatra is completely intransigent, realistic and heartbreaking. The direction of Otto Preminger is perfect for the film, with long shots and a very mobile camera. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's performance is good, as is Eleanor Parker's. In fact, the entire supporting cast works very well, with discreet interpretations, as befits the style of this film. The documentary style is part of what keeps this film updated. Highly recommended <br /> <br /> 8.0 out of 10
