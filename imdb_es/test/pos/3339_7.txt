I want to start my review by thanking the creators of this documentary, it's obviously a love job and I think they did a good job of putting together a nice documentary about a person who has had so little information available about him. He definitely has a feeling of worship from the fans, which is good. <br /> <br /> I had heard about Bruce Haack but I did not know much about him, and I found the beginning of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talking about him, but Bruce Haack himself was too far in the distance . I wanted to see this guy from Bruce Haack! I felt as if the creators assumed that I already knew him as well as these musicians on the screen, which I did not know, so I felt a bit in the dark. <br /> <br /> When Bruce finally showed up in action it was great and it gave me an idea of ​​who Bruce Haack was, but it was just a pleasure. They treated us with more musicians and I felt as if they had said to me "Look, all these great musicians are interested in him, so he must be great!" I really did not care much about the musician's comment about Bruce. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see Bruce, as a person. You know, the important thing: more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. More about his life, and yes, his use of drugs and other issues. I would have liked to know much more about his project "Hackula". I wanted to get into his mind. Even if they did it through some "voice of God" comment and pictures, it would have been fine. <br /> <br /> The animations were good, but once again I felt that they were used as fillers, they really did not. Anything else that does not allow me to listen to your music and see some images based on the records of Dimension 5. I thought it was smart and creative, but again ... I wanted to learn more about Bruce! <br /> <br /> Maybe Bruce Haack was so elusive in real life? <br /> <br /> Anyway, at the end I enjoyed this documentary and I felt a kind of sadness that pioneers and geniuses as amazing as Mr. Haack is forgotten as the march of time always marks. I'm glad that this movie is to educate people about Bruce Haack, even with his flaws.
