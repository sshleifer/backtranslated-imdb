As far as the story goes, it is not among the best Columbo movie or the most artfully written, but the film is extremely well made, with excellent direction and a truly excellent performance. <br /> <br /> Especially the performance within this movie attracts attention. The director Nicholas Colasanto did a great job with the actors of the film. Apparently, it gave Peter Falk and John Cassavetes a lot of space to play, as both are being credited here as non-accredited directors of this movie. It must be part of your management style to allow the actors so much space. It works very well for this movie. Maybe he did this because Colasanto also used to work as an actor. He is perhaps best known for playing the role of Coach in the hit series "Cheers", from the beginning in 1982 until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Peter Falk seems better than ever. in his role as lieutenant columbo. Also the veteran actor John Cassavetes does a great real job since the film is his killer and is a good opponent for the lieutenant. Along with them, the movie also features Myrna Loy. A great star of the silent film era and also Pat Morita, in a small initial paper. <br /> <br /> But not only the direction in the film is really good. Visually and technically it is also a really great movie, with long and slow shots, without the use of cuts. Also, obviously, the reason why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. It really takes time to set things up and tell your story. The film also presents a couple of beautiful artistic and experimental shots. Of course, all really appropriate for the 70s. <br /> <br /> But as I said before, as far as history goes, this is simply not among the best Columbo movies. Also, the clues left to the lieutenant are too obvious this time. It makes the killer look a bit silly, like he does not think his plan was good enough, while the character is obviously an intelligent man. Columbo this time also tries to irritate the suspect and other characters a little more than he usually tries to do, to solve the crime. This and the different acting approach of Peter Falk are one of the reasons why his character may look different from other Columbo movies. But different does not mean worse in this case. <br /> <br /> The film also has a good musical score by Richard DeBenedictis, who after that became a kind of stable composer for the Columbo films. <br /> <br /> A great Columbo movie to watch! <br /> <br /> 8/10
