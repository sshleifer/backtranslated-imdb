You will love or hate movies like this thriller that takes place inside a solitary asylum in a distant and lonely land. It is not so much a horror show, but a mixture of frightening images and crazy mental patients. "Scream" is the best term to use in what was obviously a classic drive-in known for some strange and perverse behaviors. Look at the "judge", who is about to put the ax behind the doctor! Brr-r-r-r !!! Here you can not describe anything other than a damn and tasty goodness, but when you have the chance, remember the old family saying of the witch lady: "Get out! Get out! Never come back!" Would not you like to have not looked in the basement?
