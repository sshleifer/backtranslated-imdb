I saw it last night and again this morning, that's what I liked. There's something about this movie ... When the movie was almost over, I was about to cry. I would highly recommend my friends "Last days", it is definitely worth seeing them! I agree with those who say that some parts of the film do not seem very realistic. For example, both main characters are totally cute and in perfect physical condition (although, round is also a kind of form :)). I rarely meet people as well as singles and have never met anyone in pairs. Other parts of the film, including all those "coincidences", do not seem very realistic either. BUT, after all it is A MOVIE, not a life story.
