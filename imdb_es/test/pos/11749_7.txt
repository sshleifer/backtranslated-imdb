"Love is a thing of many splendors" takes place in Hong Kong in 1949-50, and tells the story of the relationship between Mark Elliott, a white American journalist, and Han Suyin, a half-European doctor from half of Europe. This story of a mixed-race love story was a pretty daring theme for the fifties and, as it often did, Hollywood tried to soften the blow by choosing a white actress as the supposedly non-Caucasian woman who falls in love with a White. Man, something that today would be considered politically incorrect but that was quite acceptable then. (Think, for example, in the casting of Ava Gardner in "Show Boat" or Natalie Wood in "West Side Story") The scenario of the story in a British colony was also perhaps a way to explore racial problems in a way that would cause less controversy in the United States. Suyin loses his job in a hospital in Hong Kong because his British superiors are opposed to the fact that he is dating a white man, with whom he can not marry because his wife will not grant him a divorce. As was sometimes the case, European colonialism became the scourge of some of the failures of the United States. Imagine the rage that would have been unleashed if a similar movie had been made about a black or mixed-race doctor in an Alabama hospital. <br /> <br /> In addition to the racial problems, the film also raises issues of international politics. referring to both the seizure of communist power in China and the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a real person and a well-known author of the time; in fact, he tended to support Mao's communist regime, but here he is shown as firmly anti-communist. However, this is not primarily a "problematic" film about racism or politics, but rather a romance, a good example of what would be known at that time as an "image of a woman". Such films, although mostly made by male directors, were aimed primarily at female audiences. They dealt with love and romance, often unhappy romance, from the woman's point of view, and had a strong feminine character in the main role. The genre often provided roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard romances. The previous examples used to be in monochrome, but in the fifties generally, as here, they used sumptuous and sumptuous colors. <br /> <br /> Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress would have been more convincing on paper, Jennifer Jones, yes. A very good job as Suyin. I found William Holden, like Mark, quite uncharismatic, but this does not matter much, since Suyin is the dominant figure. She is much more screen than Mark, and the film examines her family and professional life much more than his. Although Jennifer was still surprisingly beautiful, she was in her mid-thirties, quite older than most of the romantic heroines in the movies of this period. Holden was about the same age, unusually during the fifties, when "boy with girl" often meant "older man with girl". <br /> <br /> The film is not particularly profound, but it is well done with some The attractive photography, particularly from Hong Kong, reflects the growing trend in the 1950s to shoot on location rather than in studio settings. Rarely has Hong Kong been so beautiful; The view from a hill that dominates the city acquires a special meaning, since this is where Suyin and Mark go for their romantic tasks. The general mood is one of the moving and fatal feelings, a state of mind accentuated by atmospheric photography and the musical score, including one of the most memorable film themes ever written. 7/10
