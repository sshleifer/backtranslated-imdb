If you liked the TV series, Diagnosis Murder, you'll love Murder 101. It's great to see Dick Van Dyke in a murder mystery again. If we are lucky, this will be the beginning of a television series or at least a series of movies. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely had some remarkable and excellent actors that filled the roles. But, it did not feel like a "face" movie. It really was a story that attracted you to make you forget the fame of those who were on the screen. <br /> <br /> I made an assumption about the ending and I was so pleasantly surprised by the ending that I had to see. again! This is a must see for any mystery lover or lover of Dick Van Dyke!
