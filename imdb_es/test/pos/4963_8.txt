This movie is a tour de force by Julie Taymor who directs and makes the stage design and the masks. Nobody comes close to matching his imagination on the modern operatic stage. Since he made this film in 1992, he has been very successful in making films and directing musicals. She can only be expected to be persuaded to return to the opera one day. I would love to see a cycle of rings run by her. The current Rheingold in Covent Garden has giants with large hands as well as the characters in this film. The current butterfly in ENO uses Japanese puppets. Maybe coincidence, or evidence that Taymor's influence is widespread. <br /> <br /> Taymar uses fantastic costumes, masks, puppets and origami birds to recreate the story of Oedipus on a stage on stilts over a lake. Red ribbons are a recurring theme. They are used as an umbilical cord when Oedipus is born, they hang from the eyes of Oedipus after they have been blinded, with an impressive effect that they use to make a crossroads when the Oedipus bully on the part of his father is represented by puppets. <br /> <br /> This Stravinsky neoclassical opera ballet enjoyed a justified darkness until this movie gave him life. The music has no inspiration but is harmless and Philip Langridge, Jesse Norman and a very young Bryn Terfel make the most of it. The singers are quite immobile, according to Stravinsky's wishes. Min Tanaka is the dancing Oedipus of the singing Oedipus of Langridge. This creates a slight confusion towards the end when the dance of Oedipus rears its eyes to sing Oedipus. <br /> <br /> The script is in Latin, but do not worry if your Latin high school is a bit rusty. There is a useful narrator who presents and describes each scene in Japanese.
