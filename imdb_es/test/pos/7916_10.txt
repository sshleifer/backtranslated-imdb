Alexander Nevsky legitimately holds himself up as a cinematic masterpiece. However, he has aged very badly. People decide not to mention this and talk about great battles and great music. The sound effects may have been good then, but apart from the presenting organ, all the sounds are laughable. Film fans may shoot me for this, but I'm sure that the modern viewer of Alexander Nevsky will agree that the brazen propaganda and atrocious music to detract from the film. I gave him this movie 10/10 because it is undeniably a masterpiece. However, it has its big bits. The suits of the Teutonic knights are excellent and the battle scenes are quite good for the moment. However, it is a masterpiece that shows his age.
