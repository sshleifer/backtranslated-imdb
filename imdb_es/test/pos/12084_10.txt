I was looking for "who will love my children" to buy, when I found this website and an entry made by a British compatriot! I am a big fan of this movie and would have recommended it to everyone. What I found comforting is finding someone who also finds comfort in the goodwill of others. I also have a son with Aspergers (among other things) and it is also a fear of mine to think that if something happened to me and my husband, that someone would not only want to face my beautiful "normal" daughter, but also My special and gifted son as well. Missing the home and being able to relate to people raised with the same values ​​that I have more meaning than you know. Living here in the United States, I still have not met anyone who has seen this movie. So, for all of you who read this, if you have not seen it, make an effort to do so. It is a very moving experience, especially for anyone who is a father or mother, or even if you only have a sympathetic bone in your body, you will cry and beg. After that, you will count your blessings, and for anyone who has gone through an experience like this, or close to it, my heart is directed towards you. It makes me realize that no matter how difficult or stressful it is, just remind yourself that there is always someone worse than you. An amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story. Do not be discouraged by how sad it is, at the same time that this film is comforting and makes you feel encouraged by the strength and kindness of humanity.
