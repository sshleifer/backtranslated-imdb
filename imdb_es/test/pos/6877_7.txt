I remember seeing this 1978 comedy in one of the negotiating marriages I took when I was looking for a break in my university studies. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson do some efficiency in the Tracy-Hepburn style and the parrying in this featherweight game led by the trusty Howard Zieff (he did "Private Benjamin") about the aggressive re-entry of a newly widowed doctor in the game of appointments. Everything shines quickly, mainly thanks to the clever script of veteran screenwriter Julius J. Epstein ("Casablanca") along with Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer. <br /> <br /> Dr. Charley Nichols has just returned from Hawaii after the death of his wife. Upon his return, he realizes that it is an instant catnip for each and every one of the single women in Los Angeles. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile chief of staff, Amos Willoughby, whom Charley has to pacify to maintain his residence. Enter Ann Atkinson, a transplanted English woman who makes cheese pies for a living and has certain concrete opinions about the medical profession, which she freely expresses on a PBS talk show. Of course, Charley is in the program discussion panel and the sparks, as they say, fly. This leads to the standard complications about the seriousness that Charley is willing to be with Ann. At the same time, the hospital has to deal with a possible wrongful death lawsuit by the widow of a wealthy baseball team owner who died in the hospital under the careless supervision of Willoughby. <br /> <br /> It is simply refreshing to see such a mature and encouraging love story between two characters inhabited by actors who offer lines with the skill of scalpel surgeons. Matthau is his usual bluff of the 1970s and a whole show rambling with his arms ungainly in his gait of power. Far from his heavy and award-winning Elizabethan roles, Jackson is starkly sardonic and charmingly vulnerable as the fighter Ann, who believes that all doctors should aspire to be Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with predictable swagger, while Richard Benjamin provides kind support like Charley's colleague, Dr. Solomon. Everything is very compact with some nice bumps to greed within the medical profession. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.
