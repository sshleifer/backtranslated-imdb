I saw this movie in the base cinema while I was in the Air Force, so my affection could be influenced by the reaction of the scandalous audience that attended the theater that night. But I do believe that this movie was one of the first popular Kung Fu movies and helped start the trend in the early 70's. It's worth watching.
