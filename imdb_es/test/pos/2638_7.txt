_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_, and _The Wild Life_ falls short. <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> Some other stan wrote the previous comment. Of course, wildlife is not Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the quintessence of the '80s. However, Wild Life is nice if you do not complain that mindless movies are meaningless movies (especially when you know it's supposed to be a meaningless movie in the first place). . The little Latin of Scarface is in this film and is directly disrespectful ("I have Visa ... Masterrrrr Charrrrge!") The Colonel also makes an appearance ("Demand ..."). RIP The Colonel 1931-1997. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worse than a 6 compared to other genres, by the way. It's not worse than a 7 in terms of other teen comedies of the '80s in that. It has a lot of the feel of a Cameron Crowe movie. Only the staniels gave him a 5.
