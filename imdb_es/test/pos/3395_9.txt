Having seen this with my mother (who got it for Christmas) I was excited to find something different from what I normally see. All the stories were detailed and you can feel a strong emotion towards each character from the beginning. Each plot is followed brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for each character. The cast is amazing, my personal favorites are James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, like George Hazard and Madeline Fabray / LaMotte / Main. All this is deep and wonderful, which makes viewing very compulsive, I recommend it to almost everyone.
