Renee Zellweger is a Kansas housewife whose dominant husband is involved in drug trafficking. Two professional assassins: Morgan Freeman and his son, Chris Rock, murder the husband in his dining room. Zellweger, not observed by the assassins, witnesses this and experiences a dissociative reaction, assuming the personality of a nurse, the eponymous Betty, who is a character in her favorite telenovela. "Zellweger, who believes herself to be the television character, leaves in her husband's car, which has a lot of drugs in the trunk, and travels to Los Angeles, where she hopes to connect with another character in this dramatic drama of The afternoon, "Dr. David Ravell," Greg Kinnear, not realizing that he is being chased by the two hit men, heads to Los Angeles, where he manages to connect with Kinnear and is actually written into the program as a nurse named Betty, a handful of men who know, including the local sheriff, realize what is happening and also look for Zellweger in LA The ending is believable and touching. <br /> <br /> If that It sounds crazy, it is because it is, and it is the responsibility of the writer, John C. Richards The funny thing is that Richards and the director, Neil Labute, with the considerable help of the artists, almost achieved it This is not a plot that has been molded into a family mold, I do not give extra points for pure originality. Someone came out on a limb. Someone took a risk in a movie that was NOT a copy or a new version of something that had made money ten or fifty years ago. I imagine the people involved, kneeling every night, praying fervently. I do not know if the movie was profitable, but it is mostly successful on its own aesthetic terms. <br /> <br /> It is what could be called a movie "initial premise". You start with a single transforming event, in this case the murder of Zellweger's husband and his adoption of a really new personality, and follow the resulting logical paths realistically. The "Groundhog Day" is another better and more intricately traced example. "Nurse Betty" has its logical cracks, where the incidents renounce their plausibility. For example, at a party in Los Angeles, Zellweger finally meets Kinnear, the guy who plays her ex boyfriend on television. She is stunned (because, after all, she thinks it's Betty, who lost her boyfriend a long time ago). She approaches Kinnear and a couple of her colleagues and introduces herself as "Nurse Betty," the character. She addresses Kinnear with the name of her television character, "David Ravell." The group is puzzled at first, then becomes convinced that she is an aspiring actress who insists on staying "in character" during the conversation, and then, after Kinnear has become fascinated with her and the others, they get bored. Kinnear takes her home and even when she kisses him goodnight, he's still in character, leaving Kinnear in awe at the relentless way he captures Betty's character. At the next appointment, Kinnear returns his love. That development, the relationship between Zellweger and Kinnear at this point, is a crack in logic, of the kind that is absent in "Groundhog Day." At the end of Night One, Kinnear, like everyone else, would realize that Zellweger is missing some clowns for a circus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film, which includes many digressions, has a success that exceeds expectations. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his insolent and nihilistic son is wonderfully explained. Morgan is impeccable in his exasperation. He manages to fall in love with the image of Zellweger while discovering clues about his whereabouts and activities, and in the end he does not dare to shoot him. She is too sweet to shoot. After her transformation into Betty, she left a note in Kansas. "I want to help all my life, be it animal, vegetable or mineral". Who could harm the author of such an absurd connative statement? His admiration for her comes as an epiphany, as it is near one of the spotlights on the edge of the Grand Canyon. Zellweger, dressed like Dorothy, or maybe the Good Witch of the East (well, the characters that, like Zellweger, are from Kansas) appears to Freeman and he hugs her and kisses her tenderly. It is a scene that is both mysterious, romantic and a little spooky. Once I stood in one of those lights and threw some shredded paper upstream from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand swirling bats who had mistakenly perceived the fluttering fragments as moths. <br /> <br /> Right. Where it was? Good. I was trying not to run out of space. Zellweger's performance deserves praise. Everything she does, every movement, every expression, is naive and tentative. She really is a nice character, and that despite the fact that she is not a glamor girl by Hollywood standards. But - what an actress. Compare his performance as the clumsy nineteenth century in "Cold Mountain." Just the opposite. But then everyone is ready for this nice movie. Allyson Jannings does a good job in a minor role. Watch her when she tells Greg Kinnear that she is considering killing her character in the telenovela in a drowning accident. Kinnear is one of those narcissists who uses the kind of thin ten thousand dollar black leather jackets that were popular at the time. He laughs and says: "Oh, one of those shipwreck deals, right? Well, how do I get back?" Jannings does not answer. She just smiles at him with those huge blue eyes and tilts her head mockingly. <br /> <br /> It is not a masterpiece of cinematography, but a good, original and professional work for all concerned.
