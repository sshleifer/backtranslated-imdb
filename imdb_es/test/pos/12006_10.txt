Probably very underestimated by all those who never experienced the hell of living under the communist regime. Although, it seems hard to believe, everything happened, in reality the reality was even worse than the movie. It looks like Orwellian fiction, only this is not fiction. John Hurt is excellent as always. Yes, the script is not full of action, but life is not either. The plot is impressive. Yes, people were shot, yes thousands of them. Their "crime" was that they wanted to leave the communist "paradise" without government authorization. Sometimes the film carries the tears in your eyes. We need more movies like this to really appreciate what the United States gives us. Excellent movie, highly recommended! God bless our country, USA!
