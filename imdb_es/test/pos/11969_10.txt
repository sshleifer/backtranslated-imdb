Fear in places, although the effects left something to be desired unless you have bad eyesight or are afraid of the dark. However, most of the action was convincing and most of the effects were well done. I thought the creature looked too much like a man in a gorilla suit for my taste. It reminded me of the original movie of the pink panther.
