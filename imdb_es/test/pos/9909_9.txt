I really enjoyed this movie. For one, it did not have the kitschy special effects that big-budget movies have. The performance was decent in this case, only you can say immediately that it is doubled, but once you get over that fact, and you can not change the language in the DVD version, it's great. The plot line was very unique, you take a situation like a heat wave very common all over the world, especially in Frankfurt, where I've been many times, and you take a garbage strike that happens quite often in this country and you have a Recipe for disaster. I loved the way the hordes of rats went everywhere and the idea that if you picked up the garbage, that's the last thing you want to do, you pick it up, the rats do not get what they want. Pick up the garbage, so ask if the garbage men are on strike, who picks up the garbage, the private contractors, anyway, the military wants to quarantine the city. , then add a mayor who wants to control the budget and take the pockets, has a realistic movie and the female protagonist is also a pleasure to see it on the screen, a very decent movie, I thought, I wish more were made this way, another small problem is that the representation of Frankfurt could have been made a little better, but for the average spectator who has never been to Frankfurt ... I was born in Germany and I've been to Frankfurt many times ... it won 'It does not matter, but in general it's A big big thumb up.
