It can not be denied. Science fiction on television is difficult. There are so many problems that gender brings with it. Like the need for a good budget, solid writing, decent acting. Maybe the budget and the writing of scripts are the departments where I believe that most of the attempts have failed. So, "Surface" is successful? Not completely, but more than most. <br /> <br /> To my way of thinking, a good science fiction program does not need a lot of CGI to work, nor does it need a lot of money. What you need is the ability to create a bigger feeling than life. The feeling that there is more than what is seen, something that makes me feel curious and willing to try to find out how it will end. Adding the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes saying "Aha!" is what makes or breaks a show like this. <br /> <br /> "Surface" had a couple of failures. First of all, its basic premise is not as exciting as it could have been, nor is the revealed story as exciting (or daring) as I expected at first. Also the television sensation is very present most of the time. From the crappy CGI (which goes from decent to horrible) to the rather changing quality in the acting department. He also feels sometimes a little too family oriented in the sense that he takes the limit of sometimes and becomes almost cutesy. But apart from these flaws is a nice sight. It may not be as spectacular as some of the other science fiction programs out there. But he manages to keep me interested all season and also offers a couple of good fangs between shows. The ending for me is not so attractive. I do not like programs that end unfinished, so to speak, leaving the story unresolved. It is especially unfortunate in this case, since the program seems to be canceled after the first season (it is not yet decided). <br /> <br /> For me, HBO is the benchmark for quality television. His series have the best actors, the best production values ​​and above all the most solid writing. This is not HBO quality, but it is good for what it is. Good enough to want another season without a doubt.
