I think the basic idea of ​​any movie is to entertain or inform. If you want information, you're watching real-life movies and historical movies. Sometimes these are one of the same. The other side of the coin is entertaining. Did Hitch entertain me? If he did. Well, the formula is standard. Boy knows a girl or in this case guys know girls. They get together they have a fight and then they get back together. However, the way it happened in this movie was refreshing. I especially liked the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. The romance with Allegra Albert was a pleasure to see him develop, most REAL men are shy when it comes to courting the woman of his dreams and if he had Hitch's advice, he would probably have raised the altar to my wife in half of the times. I read the first comment about this movie that seemed to suggest that this movie had been reproduced safely and good has laughed a little more. I tend to disagree, there are so many laughs that you can put in a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce. In addition to relationships there are serious moments. In general, I found Hitch quite entertaining, the actors did a good job (I'll look for them in other movies) and Hitch is a movie that I'm very happy to have in my DVD collection.
