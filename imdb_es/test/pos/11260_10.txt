What can I say? I could not sleep and I found this movie on MTV. I began to see it with all the intention to change the channel if it started to weaken, as do so many anti-drug movies, but I let myself get caught up in this movie and I could not stop seeing it. Nick Stahl did an amazing job with his character, and in my opinion, he really made the movie something worth seeing. I was interested in buying the movie soundtrack (or even the movie itself) and MTV.com did not help me at all, but believe it or not Amazon.com is placing pre-orders for the August 5 release of the movie in DVD. . I know it took me a lot to track him down and I'm sure other people could have had the same problem. I'm buying my own copy so I can drool over Nick Stahl while I raise my eyes at the same time thanks to the emotional story!
