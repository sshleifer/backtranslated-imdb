Great movie. I laughed all the time. Why? Well, I'm from Austria, I can get along with German (Bavarian) humor. So I guess this movie only makes sense to see it when you're a native German speaker. Stefan and Erkan are speaking with a new type of Turkish-German accent, which became very popular in our countries (GER and AUT). But of course they are very stupid. As in every comedy, your personal mood will decide, either with your thumb up or down.
