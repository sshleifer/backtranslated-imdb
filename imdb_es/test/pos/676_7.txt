We are in a small city, a home widow (Ida Lupino) hires a maintenance staff (Robert Ryan) to take care of her house. Soon he begins to lament as Ryan becomes erratic by the hour, it seems to be the seat of a dangerous schizophrenic, and now he can not escape from home. <br /> <br /> Beware, My Lovely is adapted from The History and Works of Mel Dinelli {The Spiral Staircase} called "The Man". Almost like a one-set movie and a two-character piece, the film features two major central performances and offers an interesting insight into mental illness. However, one should not be fooled and think that this is a violent and harrowing image, because it is not. From the beginning, it is clear that Ryan's Howard Wilton is a man with dangerous problems, but this is a different kind of "dangerous" movie. One that has another inclination with respect to psychosis and, therefore, makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino are a great combination. same year. So with the two actors clearly comfortable together, it brings up a well-tuned character story, based on the confines of a house, re: prison. Ryan is particularly strong as his character enters and leaves the madness, with some powerful scenes and, sometimes, causing fear and others generating a deep compassion. The direction of Harry Horner is safe (in reality, he does not have to do much more than let his actors do it) and George E. Diskant's cinematography contains some intelligent and impressive visual touches. With one that involves immensely memorable Christmas tree ornaments. When falling somewhere in between and great, Take care, My Lovely has enough to do as a recommendation for Borderline fans and easy to follow Film-Noir. For fans of Robert Ryan tho, it's something of an essential visualization, oh yes, and something more. 7/10
