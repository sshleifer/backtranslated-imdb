Patricia Arquette plays American doctor Laura Bowman, who takes vacations in Burma in an attempt to heal her spirit after the murders of her husband and her young son. He stays in Rangoon during a military repression and leaves the city with an old man who works as a "tour guide". But he is not a simple tourist guide; he is a teacher who introduces him to life outside the tourist traps ... the two are caught in political turmoil and Laura sees with his own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses his own people. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites because of its themes. First, it is informative (it describes some of the injustices that are happening in Burma). Second, it's about a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. Third, it's about compassion and sacrifice, and people who come together, without even knowing each other, to endure pain and fear. <br /> <br /> Almost all the beautiful scenes in this movie are important; nothing is wasted here. It is a serious and moving film. There is also a very emotional score composed by Hans Zimmer that complements the scenes very well. <br /> <br /> A definite recommendation, especially for people concerned about human rights ... and people who want to know, "For what purpose can I serve?" <br /> <br />
