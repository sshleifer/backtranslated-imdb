This movie is a gem ... a classic of Gerry Anderson to discover. <br /> <br /> The origins of "UFO" and "Space 1999" are evident in this film, including the list of actors that includes the late Ed Bishop. and George Sewell, who went to "UFO". <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Anderson, despite his many television successes, did not have the opportunity to develop his talent on the big screen. Just think what you could have done with the movie version of "Thunderbirds" (which, rightly, he refused to be himself!). <br /> <br /> I am sure that you give "JTTFSOTS" / "Doppleganger" a fair possibility that you appreciate their good qualities.
