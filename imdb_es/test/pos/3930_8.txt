I did not expect much of this film when I entered the theater, but I had been waiting for it for many years. In short, it was pretty good! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought it was going to be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good, but the best performance has to be for Brian Van Holt. He played the bad guy too well, I mean he was sick, sadistic and very cruel. The background story between the brothers was good, and I liked that there were no murders until about 40 minutes into the movie. It gave you time to choose the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die. Jon Abrahams was pretty good as CMM's dumb best friend. I liked the way Chad cried when I found him dead, it was better that only he said "Whatever, my friend is dead, who cares". It showed how he really cared. So in general, this was a goddamn slasher of God with some great effects. Bravo!
