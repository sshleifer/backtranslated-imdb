It's a shame that House Calls is not better known. Is it perhaps because the romantic protagonists are middle-aged, worn-out and timid, instead of exaggerated stars? Could be. If you are over 35, you will probably get this comedy. If you're over 45, you're really going to have this comedy. If you are 25 years old, wait until you are older to see it. <br /> <br /> The improbable pairing of Matthau and Jackson works precisely because it is very unlikely. There is a wonderful line by Matthau that summarizes what is happening between the two: "I like old people because you do not have to explain who Ronald Coleman is". (If that's not the exact line, it's close ...) <br /> <br /> The premise of a sub-paid hospital run by incompetents seems to be true. Art Carney's portrayal of a senile chief surgeon is absolutely brilliant. It is impossible not to laugh loudly at his delivery. The secondary plots, if you can call them that, are also fun, as between Matthau and Jackson's teenage son. Everything hits exactly the right tone. <br /> <br /> Well, there's the part where Matthau has to wear women's clothes that's a bit overdone and an easy brand. But, still, it's Walter Matthau in friction! It is funny!
