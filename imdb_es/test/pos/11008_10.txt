Yes!!!! Fassbinder and Ballhaus are at the top of their game, in 1973! It's about the same subject, but in my opinion it's a much better movie than THE MATRIX (1999), at least it was 200 times cheaper! Very good camera work by Michael Ballhaus and the wonderful "Albatross" by Fleetwood Mac at the end. Fassbinder is creating a very capricious tone for the whole movie. It's a pity that this movie has never been released on DVD. But now, after 37 years, they finally came to the conclusion that this TV movie is not just one of Fassbinder's best films (although there are many quiet Fassbinder films), it is a shining example for a science fiction movie. Done without much money. Buy it! Look at it!!
