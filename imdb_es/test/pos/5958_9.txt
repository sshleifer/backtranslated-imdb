It seems that M.Hazanavicius is back! The man behind "La Classe Americaicaine" returns with a very funny and clever sequel to those antiquated OSS-117 ... While the directors tend to "over-update" the sequels of old classics (remember the avengers, urk) , Hazanavicius chose to work on a really cheap hero, OSS-117, a kind of low budget French 007, and decides to do it in a traditional way ... Photography, body attitudes Choreography of fights and effects, all It's like a tribute to the way the movies were made in the 50s. And it works, since the tone and jokes of the movie are really good! Jean Dujardin perfectly embodies this stupid, arrogant, macho, selfish French spy, lost in a country that understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority. Yes, that is, as the West used to consider its colonies at that time (and, oh no, I will not say it has anything to do with what happens today in the same area ... ah ah) .. It looks like a defrosted Ventura Lino, with something like 40 pounds less, which is perfect for the role. The other members of the cast also fit perfectly, with everything you can dream of Russian spies, Egyptian independence and old Nazis. And, of course, women, since there must be "fatal women" in any good spy. movies ... The plot is good (maybe not bright, but good enough ...), taking place between real historical facts, and reminding us in a funny way how France (and the others) treated their colonies in those days. It all starts in 1955 with a British spy disappearing as he tracks a Russian cargo full of weapons in Suez. Then, France sends his best friend, the agent OSS-117, to discover what happened to both the agent and the dispatch ... The fact is that this agent is really as stupid as he can be, and slips through the story without even understanding it, resolving it in a very clouseau-esquire way. I must say that I had a bad feeling about the film, since the publicity that was made was quite terrifying, and since French humor tends to be quite populist and flat (forget the bronzes 3 or the camp ...) but really I was surprised, and in a good way! I highly recommend it, whether you want a good parody of the Bond-esquire movies (much more fun than in DEBS, for example, but with fewer skirts) or if you're a fan of the genuine and sincere way of filming they had in the 5Os. . Yes, that's smart and (seriously!) Funny, you have the point one more time, Mr. Hazanavicius!
