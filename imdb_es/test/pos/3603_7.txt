Just exactly how director John Madden came to an agreement with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian officer and a Greek villager in an honorable story: "Captain Correli's mandolin", it just slips away! Witness: a wobbly and incoherent accent on the part of Cage in the middle of an exaggerated and horrendous performance, with Cruz, more appropriately interpreted as a spoiled Latino with Johnny Depp in "Blow", basically in a replay under the guise of a Greek nurse. .. oh, it was painful But there were saving graces. <br /> <br /> The story itself is exciting to tragic, and Cage has some musical ability (that's it!). Next, an excellent performance by John Hurt (Cruz's father, the village doctor) of Oscar Callibre, as well as Irene Papas, each of them as elders of the village, as well as by Christian Bale (son of Popes) ) among the fighters for the freedom of the village. , go far towards the counterbalance of uncomfortable performances (especially at the beginning) of Cruz and Cage. Well, the last two seem to grow in their respective roles as the film progresses, but it's a gnashing of teeth from the start. Finally, the landscape itself and the photograph could get a technical award, and that provides pleasant distractions when they are most needed. <br /> <br /> John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and this would be a third; I hope he gets it as his performance as a Doctor makes it worthwhile to watch this movie. The real test of a supporting actor / actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the character in question, and in this case, it surely would not be ... not even close. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value, but for the most mentioned factors that help raise the level. See it if you do not have it. Score = 3.5 stars (out of five).
