I went through the maximums. I went through the low ... I cried, I laughed, I vomited my beloved entrails. But in spite of everything, I was healed. I became a better person for sitting in this experience of self-imposed degradation. Not every day we can say that we have experienced the worst, and we have come out on the other side with something that closely resembles our sanity and intact. Friends ... neighbors, unite and be like one now. Go out and find this movie and languish in its extravagances. Place it on top of the shelf and kiss its polystyrene box. Take him to bed. Take it with you when you go shopping or have blind dates with strangers. They will appreciate all the best for their sublime and singular schizophrenic inclination in the cinema. And then they will throw you the drink of your choice (but you will have the last laugh). I ran for Governor with this little beauty to my credit (and you can too!). It is a gift that is worth having again and again.
