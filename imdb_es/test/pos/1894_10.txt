I believe that this film is deserving, tentative, lethargic and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw a script, turn on the camera and act like a fool. I find the performances, the lighting, the cinematography, the sound and the laws of the film school that D 'Urville Martin violated unusually. Speaking from the perspective of the film directors, there are times when I just want to leave everything and have fun on the set. This movie seems fun. When other aspiring film directors ask me for advice, I simply tell them to watch any Rudy Ray Moore movie. They always return a puzzled look asking me why not see the teachers Woody Allen, Scorsese, Lucas, Capra. I laugh and I include that you always want to know what not to do first in telling a film story.
