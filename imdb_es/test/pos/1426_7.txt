A middle-aged man, Robert Jordan, on his way, faces a troop of Boy Scouts after his predecessor goes under duress. Jordan takes the package mainly to learn what the guys like so he can relive his radio show that is losing its appeal to the younger ones. At first, he has problems with children, especially with Mike, an 8-year-old boy who forms an attachment for the older man, which is anything but reciprocal. Do things work for Jordan and the scouts? Take a look at this entertaining and funny movie from the old days.
