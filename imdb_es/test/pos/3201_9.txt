I guess I was not sure what to expect from this movie, I had a good cast, an interesting story and a lot of other things going for it, but still I could not help the feeling of fear I had. in my stomach about how it would be. I am pleased to say that I was very pleased with the result and I regret worrying about it all the time. The opening scenes of the films were extremely intriguing and were sufficient to maintain the initial interest in the film. As the film progressed, we were introduced to the characters in the film, as well as what happened in the prison riots. Like most reviews of this film, I must admit that there are some non-secretarial clich√©s, but it can not erase the general power of this film that reads like a good novel. All the actors are great, especially Chestnut and McGowan, and the movie is rated one of this year's best television movies. It is definitely worth seeing if you are looking for a good drama at court.
