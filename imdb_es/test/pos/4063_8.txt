"Showtime" falls somewhere north of what some critics have said, and a little south of what I expected a few months ago, when I first heard that Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro joined for a comedy. In general, it was pretty good! As the crime or the "real life" police go ... and conspire, for that matter ... it's quite illogical, but DUH ... it's a comedy. Also, although the special effects, the chases, the aerial shots, and the skyscraper bursts were present, but they were less important than in a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit boring and exaggerated. Leaving aside the sensitivities of 9/11, for me, all those things of hyper-effects of pyrotechnology have become very old in recent years. It seemed a lame substitute for characterization, history and attractive emotions. I hope that the smaller amount in "Showtime" is an indicator of a trend in Hollywood. A downward trend, less use of the fool, less use of the building in explosion. <br /> <br /> Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. His presence on screen and his charisma, and even the depth of his character, have been "a joy to behold" for many years. That can not be ruled out here: they are attractive, entertaining and attractive actors in this film. I can not point it out, but maybe the explosions, the excess FX and all that decreased the final product? Maybe, or maybe it was something else, or a combination of factors that gives one the feeling that the movie did not reach its full potential. Whatever it is, "Showtime" was entertaining. I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out, but I had the feeling that it was not all it could have been. At least not everything I expected. <br /> <br /> Very good movie, but not a great movie. I gave him an 8 out of 10.
