Leaving aside the drawbacks and deficiencies of the film mentioned by other viewers, I must say that I thought it was a movie about power, which in my opinion is one of the most attractive illusions. I saw the drama of an emperor and the people. It seems to me that the director wanted to ask a question about what is the benefit of the nation and what is the price of "happiness" for all. Is there justification for forced benefit and "happiness"? How much can be lost for the security and peaceful existence of the nation? Is it worthwhile to reduce the idea of ​​a powerful potential empire to misery and kill thousands of its citizens now? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time that the film takes place. He is desperately divided between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin. He seems to hate his subjects for having to give up his father and his love, and he loves people like a good emperor. No wonder their actions are controversial and their emotions confused. It seems to me that, like another film that presents the problem of the power of man over other men, the film is a success.
