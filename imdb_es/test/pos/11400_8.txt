This is not so much a review as a testimony that it has been shown, once again, that the Academy rewards money, not artistic achievement. And I must say that it saddens me that this usually artistic and intelligent band of imbd members has left this out of the top 250. Boogie Nights is powerful, raw and brave through script, direction and acting. Very few films can claim this triple crown.
