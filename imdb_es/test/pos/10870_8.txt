Presented this morning for the press at the Rome film festival, "N - io e Napoleone" is easy to love. First, you can count on great production values, like very few Italian films today, with wonderful sets and costumes. The cast is also great. The director Virzì talks constantly about the young leader Elio Germano as "a young De Niro". Now, of course it goes too far, but surely the child can act. I loved his performance, and he did a great job with the accent (Tuscan). Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and he did very well as Bonaparte. It's really great to see him act in Italian. I hope to see you return to work in Italy very soon. The cast also worked well: people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem like unlikely options, but they all gave good performances. Even Massimo Ceccherini, best known for appearing in his own moronic films and poor quality television reality shows, adapted well and it was really fun. The lowest point of the cast was the "Diva" Monica Bellucci. Sure, she was a little better than usual, but she managed to look (and sound) completely unnatural even in Baronessa Emilia's part, in which, with a good deal of self-irony, she used her own Umbrian accent. The script, by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzì himself, is intelligent, with lots of laughter and also some very emotional moments. Of course, the end left me perplexed. The message is somewhat ambiguous: the whole movie says that political ideals can lead you to blind hatred, but if you get close you will learn that the object of your hatred is, after all, a small human being like everyone else, sometimes funny , sometimes sad, sometimes pathetic, so it is suddenly hard to hate him; then, in the last minutes, he says that, after all, it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning. Personally, I do not like this notion very much. "Io e Napoleone" is still a pleasant film, the best presented so far in the Festival (the other one is Fur and the Hoax). My score is 8/10
