I really liked the wood camera film. I think he's a bit influenced by the Brazilian movie "City of God," but perhaps this parallelism between the two possible clues (crime and art) in the social neighborhood is a reality. <br /> <br /> I think the movies made by Madiba are really beautiful. I do not think it's unreal that he films such good films, because there are many artists who do not have any education and can be really great. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the soundtrack. It fits the images. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie ... it's good to show what a life in a social neighborhood can be like.
