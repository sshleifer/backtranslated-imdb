I saw this movie on its premiere night, and I enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I had not been sitting next to my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking about the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked and that it was stupid. The point is that he did not understand that the creators were making a little mockery of the horror genre with the movie. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character represented. If they were not in the movie, well, you may not like it too much. The trademarked characters are: <br /> <br /> "The main character": Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) "The main character's boyfriend": Wade (Jared Padalecki) "The main character's brother / (Soon-a -Ser) Reformed Jerk ": Nick (Chad Michael Murray)" The annoyed and disheveled character ": Paige (Paris Hilton)" The characters that are around to look beautiful ": Dalton (Jon Abrahams) and Blake (Robert Ri ' chard) <br /> <With those characters, it's a little predictable who will die and who will live. Obviously, you know who will do it with what I just wrote. The film can be predictable (in fact, I had a very good idea of ​​who would die just to see the trailer), but it was still nice. It may seem stupid (why is there a sugar mill in the middle of an abandoned camp that was not there at the beginning?) Sometimes, but it is very easy to observe. Comedy and gore were the perfect amount for filmgoers who have a weak stomach, it gets bloody, do not get me wrong (less than "Final Destination 2) but it works very well." So in conclusion, this movie was not As hot as the fire the set went up, but the temperature could still burn the "Wax".
