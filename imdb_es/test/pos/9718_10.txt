Jim Henson always seemed to have wonderful television shows. This was sadly one of the shortest in life. It was endearing to hear each story with its delicious morality. Each episode was a new story, with new characters. John Hurt did a wonderful job playing the Storyteller, and Brian Henson's sarcastic tone as the dog was always nice. <br /> <br /> The scenography designs and the costumes were very well made. The work of the Muppet, when required, is the classic work of Jim Henson. You know it's a Muppet, but it's an endearing appearance rather than a forgiving one. You are happy and forced. When each episode comes to an end, you realize that you were quite entertaining. An entertainment that is satisfying, not the type that disappears after a few moments. Sit and think about each episode, realizing that each story is really timeless and presents a strong morality story. <br /> <br /> I still have to show this to my own children, but this is really a series. That is more than family entertainment. I implore you to find it on DVD and take it away. If you can not do that, then find that somehow.
