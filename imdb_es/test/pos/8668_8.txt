At first glance, The Bothersome Man seems like many other movies / books merged into one. The Trial of Kafka, Bartleby of Melville, The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin and Groundhog Day come to mind instantly. A man, Andreas, arrives at an anonymous city where he is immediately given a job in an office and finds a beautiful new bride. However, there is a problem: his colleagues are all kind, insipid and lacking in character, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation: interior design. Welcome to the hell of modern consumerism, in which people are thrown from buildings and nobody raises an eyebrow, or spend their days reading furniture catalogs and eating food that they do not know anything. <br /> <br /> Andreas quickly realizes his situation. and he spends the rest of the movie trying to escape, in various ways. Suicide turns out not to be an option, and when he finds a new girlfriend, she is as devoid of feelings as the previous one: there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to move in with him and everything he can say. It's, 'I do not care.' <br /> <br /> In fact, much of what The Bothersome Man has to say has been said before, and after about 45 minutes you start to feel that you are really experiencing a certain sense of deja vu. However, his point is one that is probably worth repeating, over and over again: an unexamined life is a life that is not worth living. Added to that, it provides a decidedly modern version of the perennial theme of how capitalism is destroying our souls. More than one character reminded me of the people I know, especially his girlfriend obsessed with furniture, and if at the end of the film the filmmakers run out of ideas, maybe that's the point: there will be no end unless you can Find other people who share your sense of alienation.
