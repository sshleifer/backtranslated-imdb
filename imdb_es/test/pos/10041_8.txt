Errol Flynn at his best as Robin Hood of the West, fighting against the military bureaucracy, the Confederates, the Indians and the business thieves of the masons with one hand until his great and final heroic end. Do not forget the always reliable O. de Havilland as Lady Mary of the West. Never try to link this story with the facts and real people, it does not work. Just enjoy it, because nobody claimed to make documentaries when Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn worked together.
