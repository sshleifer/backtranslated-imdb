This is my favorite game for the Nintendo 64 platform. I've played many different first-person shooter games, and I've never liked any of them very much, but this game has something that I can not point out that makes for an incredible amount of fun. . Maybe it's the extraordinary detail put into the game. Maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters. Maybe it's the gadgets and weapons. Maybe it's the soft character of James Bond. Whatever it is, this game never seems to age, no matter how many times you've played it.
