Seeing this movie, I was surprised how media perception can shape a person's opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very insecure girl whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard raise the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities today, they were often criticized for their music, as well as for their looks, styles, etc. This had a great effect on Karen, who struggled against her diet and lost weight drastically, which ultimately caused her death. This movie felt in the heart was not initially something I would have thought to see. But when I started to see it, I was hooked. In the same way that the story of Tina Turner does, this film illuminates you and allows you to see the lives of the young performers. The performance was excellent and even after almost 20 years of being done, the direction and the dialogue are still entertaining. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone who has not seen it yet. It is incredibly accurate and emotionally charged.
