I thought that Besson's film managed to do without words what few films could have done with them; Capture the true human emotions. The fights, triumphs, setbacks, hopes and desires of the main character are shown so honestly that one wonders if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and, obviously, is made without the glitz and glamor that most Hollywood productions offer, but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotype of science fiction labeling and become a true drama. However, to call this film only a drama would remove the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot. It is true that this type of film has been made before, but I think it captures the joys and sorrows of that kind of world, possibly better than any other.
