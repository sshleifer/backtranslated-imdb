In the 1980s in the struggle the world was simple. Hulk Hogan would face Roddy Piper, the friends of Bobby Heenan or Ted DiBiase and he would be victorious more often than not. Occasionally, he would get an ally like Randy Savage in 1988, but above all it was Hulk Hogan vs. Bobby Heenan, and that's the way it should be. <br /> <br /> But on this night, that was about to change, a new champion, a man that WWE thought would be his man for the 90s was crowned. It did not work But the WWE was right about one thing: Hulkamania was over and it was necessary to establish a new order. <br /> <br /> This historic Wrestlemania, the first one to be held outside of the United States, started with Rick Martel defeating Koko B Ware. Koko never had much luck at Wrestlemania and was defeated in a short time here. <br /> <br /> Next, the colossal connection Andre the Giant and Haku put their team titles on the line against Demolition Ax and Smash and lost. The new champions of the tag team were crowned. <br /> <br /> The next match saw the earthquake defeating Hercules. Hercules was another guy who did not really have much luck at Wrestlemania. Good luck to Brutus Beefcake when he ended Mr. Perfect's unbeaten streak. Well, I guess someone had to end this. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown fought a double account in a slow but fun match, and then the Hart Foundation defeated Nikolai Volkov and Boris Zhukov in 19. seconds. It's not really a party, unfortunately. The BÃ¡rbaro then defeated Tito Santana in a short game. <br /> <br /> The American Dream Dusty Rhodes and Saphire then defeated Male King Randy Savage and Queen Sherri in a messy mixed game. This was the only female fight that is really happening in the WWE at this time. <br /> <br /> The following was a fun game, as Rockers Marty Janetty and Shawn Micheals defeated The Orient Express in a fast-paced encounter. There were a lot of good tag teams at this moment in time. Jim Duggan then beat Dino Bravo in a game of nothing. <br /> <br /> Next, Ted DiBiase put his most prized possession, the Million Dollar Championship on the line against Jake Roberts. Roberts was distracted by Virgil and counted allowing Ted to retain his title in an entertaining match and one of the longest in the program. <br /> <br /> Next, the Twin Towers collide when Big Bossman defeats Akeem in a few words. This is followed by Rick Rude winning a short game with Jimmy Snuka. <br /> <br /> We finally made it to the main event with Hulk Hogan putting the WWE title on the line against the Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior. This is an entertaining round-trip game won by the Warrior after Hogan missed a leg. The crowd was extraordinary and the game was a great show. <br /> <br /> And so he passed the torch, but would he prove that the Supreme Warrior was the Champion that WWE expected him to be?
