I think it's been more than 40 years since I saw this series, but his memory has not faded a bit. This would be something natural for the DVD reissue, I think. Many of the artists have achieved a greater fame (Robert Hardy, Sean Connery, to name a couple); Although it was a small paper, I still remember Judy Dench, then in her 20s, like Katherine from France (Henry V). She was very charming then like now. <br /> <br /> There is an indication on this site that the series was filmed in color, is that correct? Who of us would know, there is virtually no color television in those days. More pity, without a VCR; If so, some could have recorded it. As a way to teach the history of English, this series came to life in a way that few teachers can handle. <br /> <br /> What an excellent reissue it would be!
