Ann-Margret did the best job she has done in her film history. I felt like she was Mrs. Frey. There may be one or two Ann-Margret movies that I have not seen since her film debut in "Pocket full of Miracles" with Betty Davis in 1961. I think she has been totally underestimated in the industry. Although she was nominated for an Emmy for her role in "Who Will Love My Children," she was overlooked. Just as it was nominated for an Academy Award for its roles in "Carnal Knowledge" and "Tommy," it was rejected. In general, I think everyone did an excellent acting job, including all the kids in "Who Will Love My Children." Yes, it's a sad movie (such as real stories), but it's worth the time. Thank you.
