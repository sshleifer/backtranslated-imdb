The fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a little complicated and the performance of those who nicknamed the voices is almost universally bad, but the premise is attractive, the fight scenes are quick and flashy and the movie is often quite funny. It is a pity that history is a disaster. There are a couple of places where I had no idea what had just happened, it was almost as if they had cut five minutes and suddenly you were in the next scene without knowing how you got there. The film is deficient to explain things and some things do not make much sense, but the film moves quickly so their defects are hardly recorded. It's not a great movie, but definitely a fun one.
