I thought this is a wonderfully written movie. I love little Scamp and the street angel. This movie is very easy to understand for young children, but it is also a good movie for adults. I liked this movie because it continues with the original Lady and the Tramp, and that movie is a classic. The adventure of Lady and the Tramp 2 Scamp's was full of new characters, catchy songs, bright animations and unforgettable classic characters. I've loved the movie since I first saw it. I also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character. It also shows the disadvantages and the good things about making new friends with whom you can hang out. My favorite song in the movie was always there because it showed the different characters sharing their opinions about how they feel. I definitely recommend this movie to all who were fans of the original Lady and the Tramp.
