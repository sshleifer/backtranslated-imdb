The movie is amazing, it has a sound track that sets the tone of the movie. The lines of the film are great, like "Nothing for good friends" and "It's Charlie's collection time". I can watch this movie again and again and keep laughing because the lines and the action are unique. I feel that when I see this movie, I want to go out and shoot down the bad guys, if there is a movie that you do not want to miss, this is it. "They killed the man Giggler, they killed the Giggler" "They had no right to do that, it's in our territory and take care of it". The lines keep coming in the movie. Deff. Go out and do not rent, but buy this movie. It's worth the money trust me.
