This time, the friendly imbecile is summoned to a jury, where a corrupt lawyer realizes that he looks like a jailbird that wants to escape, so the two change. Of course, most of the movie is a series of gags; in "Ernest Goes to Jail", most of the gags are related to electricity. I liked the whole sequence of the vacuum cleaner from the beginning. In general, the goal of the movie is simply to have fun, and I'm sure you will. This is possibly the best movie you see with a cocoon. It is quite safe to say that Jim Varney will really be missed. Know that FYI: the only other cast member I recognized was Randall "Tex" Cobb, who played Lyle. Surely you've seen it somewhere.
