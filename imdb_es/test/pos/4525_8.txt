"Murder Over New York" is fun, but not as good as most other Fox Chans. This movie would have been better named, "Charlie Chan in New York," the movie's working title. This is Toler's chance to play Chan in the Big Apple. However, here are many things that I like, including the guest star Shemp Howard of the Three Stooges. <br /> <br /> This has one of my favorite sayings from Chan: "Coincidence is like the old egg: it leaves an unpleasant smell". Toler and Yung are good in this case and so is the cast. But there is little or no mysterious atmosphere that I look for in these films. Still, it's good to see it.
