I think it was a pretty good movie. It shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man, but unfortunately, because of his ambition and the people around him, it led to his destruction. Show that you can not trust anyone, especially in a world that deals with a lot of money and envy. The character that I liked the most was Sebeva. She was another ambitious woman, powerful and ruthless in a world of men who loved and respected Kilo. She also knew that business was business and that it was dangerous. Everything she did was risky, but she did the job. She helped Kilo enrich himself with his connections. In general, I really liked this movie and I have it in my collection and waiting for The Godfather 2.
