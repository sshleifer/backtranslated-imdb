I like this movie. It can be partial because I love dolphins. However, my 3 and 4 years. The old man will sit down and watch the whole movie ... It's not Oscar material, but definitely entertaining. The dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful background of ocean landscapes and sunsets. My favorite scene is when Flipper "flips" the pop that comes out of the water hitting Sandy in the head. It's a fun and endearing moment that makes me laugh all the time. On the other hand, the villainous jokes of the evil boatman (forget his name) are a bit difficult to take. And the shark scene is far from reality. Question: Do the dolphins really make so much noise? Or is there some serious dubbing happening here? In a few words: my children like it and continues to recycle through our video recorder.
