Well ... so I'm looking through the extensive DVD collection of my mom and dad (mainly because they do not charge late fees ;-)) and I find "A Thousand Acres". I was surprised that here was a movie that had Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer (with a small appearance by Jennifer Jason Leigh) that I had not seen. I think I've never heard of that before. Well, this is exactly the kind of discovery I dream of, since I have to admit that my parents increased two films on my brother and me. With some exceptions (neither of them can make them consider watching The Lord of the Rings films, but my father LOVES the Matrix trilogy - GO FIGURE), we have similar tastes in the movies. <br /> <br /> Today was a particularly horrible day, in terms of weather. It rained all day, so I exploded in this movie and shortly after I was mesmerized. <br /> <br /> This has to be one of the best "sleepers" of all time I've seen. Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are GREAT in their roles, especially because they interpret very different types. The character of Jessica Lange is a follower who pleases people and who, despite being the oldest daughter of the family, rarely assumes a leadership role. Rather, she bows to her father (Jason Robards) and her sister Rose (Pfeiffer) and is determined to teach her little sister Caroline (Leigh) how to follow her example. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a cancer survivor with a very strong will who can barely keep up with her unhappy, contained life. This movie is five years before White Oleander, of course, so it was definitely inspiring to see her playing such a strong and angry character. <br /> <br /> I would have to say that this movie probably appeals more to women. However, true movie fans who enjoy a movie for what it is, regardless of the genre or target audience, will have a hard time denying the allure of this moving drama about family secrets and what the people involved and those involved do. they love them I do not know how I missed seeing this movie before, but it sure was a good distraction on a rainy afternoon. ENJOY!!
