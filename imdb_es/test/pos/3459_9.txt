This is, by far, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Top 20 of my life. I laughed more than I have done since the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and I cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a moving movie without the boring edge ... this is the only one. It is real and powerful. See it and you will not regret it. At the beginning I was reluctant and I only saw it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is much more than that. It is about life, free and independent of the way the world would sustain you. It's about the disabilities that each of us has that prevent us from seeing ourselves and what we miss, but allowing everything else to stand in our way.
