I watched this movie every time I was on the cable and never got old. Who can forget some of the best lines in the history of cinema? --- ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡FAT BOY BURGERS !!! FAT BURGERS OF FAT BOY DE JOHNNY !! and LOOK AMONG THE GIANT MELONS! I used to wish I could run around the city in a fun treasure hunt like this one. It's an all time favorite and I'm glad to know it's on video. I'm sure this is where MTV got its original premise for the Road Rules series.
