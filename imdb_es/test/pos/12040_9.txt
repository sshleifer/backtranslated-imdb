Darr, although it is a copy of a Hollywood movie, is one of the best movies I've seen. Not only is it beautifully portrayed, it also has excellent songs and beautiful landscapes. Shahrukh is his usual self. His expressions and voice coincide with his character. I was pleasantly surprised by the portrait of Sunny Deol in the film. He is a bit romantic and kind in the movie, unlike his other characters in his other movies. Sometimes you feel that Justice has not been done with your character. Sunny was destined to be interpreted as the good person in the movie, but ends up looking like the villain at the end. Juhi Chawla is beautiful and bubbly. She is his usual self. In short, a great love story with passion.
