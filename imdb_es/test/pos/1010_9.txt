Hehehe This was one of the best funny movies in history! I laughed so I fell off the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for films like Agent Cody Banks and of course One Night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> These are crazy fans from Norway, who go to the World Cup in German soccer in Germany 2006. From the crazy fun that comes with it. It was hilarious I could not stop laughing. I have not had so much fun in years. Rumors say that number two will arrive, but I do not know. It will be difficult to beat this one. <br /> <br /> recommended to all! It is a movie that must be seen. I was supposed to see him at the movies, but I had work when he showed up. And I've been trying to rent it for a month, but all the time rented. I have it today on DVD. Good worth it.
