If it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin that contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites, then the cinematographic portrait of Erika Kohut has its reality. Professor Kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while yearning for the same thing for her. Your outer expression projects your desire. That's why he can hurt without guilt or remorse. <br /> <br /> The talented, charming and handsome young man comes Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is attracted to her by his passion and intensity. He wants to become his student to be close to her. She rejects him out of hand, but because of her talent, the Vienna Conservatory votes. He falls in love with her. Once again, she distances him, but he will not accept a no for an answer, and in this way he begins his own descent towards depravity and the loss of self-esteem. <br /> <br /> The question that the spectator can ask at this moment is: who is in control? The sadist or the masochist? In effect, who is the sadist and who is the masochist? It is hard to say. Is it the person who has just been abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying wounded on the ground in grotesque triumph and satisfaction, or is the person who runs out of the door, satiated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened. <br /> <br /> But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic phenomenon. She is an extreme freak of sex. She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability. Actually that is not even true. She says she does not care what others think. She does not care if they come in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love. Love, she calls him. For her, sex and love are the same. <br /> <br /> At one point, Walter tells him that love is not everything. How ironic it is for her a superfluity. How gratuitous has been the comment. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully directed and directed by Michael Haneke, who tells the story with expert camera work and carefully constructed games in which the essence of the action is not only clear but exemplified ( Like in the bathroom when Walter pushes himself over the top of the position to find Erika in. He also uses a good position of the players so they are always where they should be with well-timed cuts from one angle to another. important in the scene in which Erika, like a corpse drained by black and white light, lies beneath her lover, rigid as stone, here, for the most part, we only see her face and the rigid contour of her neck with her pulsating artery, we do not need to see more. <br /> <br /> The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert, who is not afraid of extremes, in fact she excels in them. or what makes it better than almost nobody is to become the body and soul of the character. Like the woman who plays in this film, she does not fear what others think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. What matters to her is the acting and the challenge. No part is too demanding. No character too depraved. It's as if Huppert wants to experience all of humanity and wants us to see her as she does. She is always fascinating and almost perfect. She is not simply one of the main lights of French cinema; She is one of the great actresses of our time who has done an incredibly diverse job. <br /> <br /> I think it is very instructive and offers us a wonderful and surprising contrast to compare their performance here with her. Performance at The Lacemaker (La Dentellière) since 1977 when she was 22 years old. There was the sweet apple in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her pretty little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian apprentice hairdresser. His character was shy about sex and modest, just an ordinary French girl who one day expected to be a beautician. Here is a self-destructive witch, embittered by the odious knowledge of herself, shameless and totally depraved. <br /> <br /> Huppert is lucky to be an actress in France where there are parts like this for women older than starlets (Hollywood could never make a movie like this). In American cinema, only a few of the best and most hardworking actresses can expect to have a career after thirty years. Huppert increases her exposure considerably due to her ability and range, but also because she is willing to play unfriendly roles, here and also in La Cérémonie (1995) in which she plays a vile and spiteful murderer. <br /> <br /> See this for Isabelle Huppert. You will not forget her or the character she gives life to.
