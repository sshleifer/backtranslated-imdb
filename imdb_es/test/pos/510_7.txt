I admit that I'm going more for the traditional vampire tale, but this is a true winner. Lots of output graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours. There was a lot of blood with vicious blood suckers that attacked mortals and even each other to control the world. A good one for all of us, lovers of vampires.
