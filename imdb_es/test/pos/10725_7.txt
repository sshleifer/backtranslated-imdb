The child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit. It was a pretty weak field for the Best Film that year. I think "Apocalypse Now" should have taken it, but the Academy probably felt that it was too violent and strange, besides that Vietnam was still too recent. Meryl Streep was tremendous, as always, playing a very unpleasant character. I do not usually congratulate the directors, but I really liked that with the elevator doors. Grade B
