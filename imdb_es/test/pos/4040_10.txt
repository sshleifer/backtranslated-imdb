This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It's so magical and fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you that you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so attractive, so real, you'll love them! The story that Gerda and Kai fell in love will really surprise you and put that little spark of magic into your life. <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone would care if the film fit the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I have not even read the book, and guess what? I do not care. In fact, if the movie and the book are so different, then you can call them two separate stories and be happy with that. <br /> <br /> I thought the performance was tremendously brilliant! Bridget Fonda plays the Queen of the Snows, so evil and so cold: you just have to hate her. Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerda, a girl in love who is determined to find her love no matter what the cost, and begins a wonderful adventure. And I love all the sisters of the Snow Queen (the Witch of Spring, the Summer Princess and the Autumn Thief) are very funny and different in many ways. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie in a long time, so forgive me if I make a small mistake ... but there is no doubt that I will always love this movie.
