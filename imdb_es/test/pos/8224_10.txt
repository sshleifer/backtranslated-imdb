The Regard of Flight, written and performed by Bill Irwin, is a true piece of classical theater that translates pretty well on the small screen. Filled with a quick and sparkling dialogue and some of the best physical comedies of the decade, is well above 99% of "Comedy" as presented today. I am sure that one day he will take his rightful place with great shows like "The Fantastiks" and "Waiting for Godot". Why it is not available on DVD is still a mystery and a tragedy.
