This movie was great. He had everything a true action fan could want. A lot of people who get shots and / or mutilations, a minimal romance related to sex, a hero with whom you can identify, violence at many intervals instead of a useless plot that stores only one scene at the end, and villains They only ask for it. Bronson seems to be at his lowest level of tolerance in this movie and it shows. Ed Lauter is a great cop and he integrated seamlessly into Bronson's plot without stealing his attention. The film does not imply a plot so boring or excessive that you see it once and never again. Rather, you want to see Kersey in action and the plot simply reinforces it. This is great.
