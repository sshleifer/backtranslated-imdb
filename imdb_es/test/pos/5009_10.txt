I mean, remember where and when you saw this show because I think if Fox gives Talk Show a chance, Spike will be with Conan in a few years because, like Conan, he's incredibly funny and seems to be grateful to have his own show. what adds to the humor. <br /> <br /> The funniest parts that Spike has had so far are The Idiot Paparatzi and Comedy For Stoners and if you're not tall and you get CFS, what does that say about you? <br /> <br /> In short, this program is more fun in 25 minutes than SNL in an hour, so let's hope that Talk Show gets the attention it deserves, like an extra half hour, more money and a band.
