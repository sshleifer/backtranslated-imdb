The NYT review says that the character of Sigourney Weaver is tense and frustrated and, later, that she could be the sister of the MTM character in Ordinary People. What what? No way. This lady was peculiar from the beginning. NOTHING as MTM in Ordinary People. Sorry. <br /> <br /> Next, the NYT goes on to say that Sandy Travis, of Sigourney Weaver, and Ben Travis, of Jeff Daniel, are 40 years old or older, "children of the 60s". Ms. Weaver must be dancing a template. I think that at the time he made Imaginary Heroes, he was 55 years old. He was born in 1949. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the corrections of NYT perception, this was a pretty good movie considering it was made by someone so young. Obviously Sigourney Weaver thought that, and so did Jeff Daniels. The young man who plays Tim was outstanding. <br /> <br /> There are some critical comments you could make about the script. For example, I never knew why Sandy Travis missed his son. His kind of deranged behavior was perhaps triggered by his death, but that behavior lasted the way it developed in the movie that I felt had more to do with his stagnant marriage, his relationship with Tim, where he really came from and other issues Unresolved, that of any mourning of his eldest son. Ben's mourning was much clearer. <br /> <br /> So Matt Travis was a jerk. Did your mom think too? Still, a very visible movie. What is becoming increasingly clear is not that there are no roles for older women, but what is needed is that a director like this one is so clearly in love with an older woman (Mrs. Weaver) and almost do it His movie is a tribute to her. A kind of anti-Woody Allen.
