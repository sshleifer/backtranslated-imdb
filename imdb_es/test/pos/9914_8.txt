He sympathized with the difficult situation of the first man, Schmitter, that we see dead in this episode. It reminded me of the restlessness associated with being a lone security guard at night somewhere, the kind of work I did briefly about 20 years ago. Of course, I was never in danger of being burned to a crisp, as the head of the colony (Lynch) likes to describe. The monster in the dark here, murdering members of a deep mining colony, creates a terrifying impression in the first act. We do not really see it in the first scenes and, as many of us realize, the best monsters are sometimes left to the imagination. 'Big and shaggy' is an expressed description, but in reality it looks like a large, lumpy pepperoni pizza, which slides on the floor like a silicon centipede, a limitation of the show budget, unfortunately. This is also shown in the latest matte paint, famous for Trek fans, the only way to transmit a large part of the mining operations. <br /> <br /> But, the whole subject of this episode is about what's inside, rather than external appearances, anyway. Of course, this Horta, a way of life based on newly discovered silicon, seems like a monster without sense at first sight. Thanks to Spock's telepathic ability (probably the best use of a Vulcan mental fusion for conspiracy purposes), we learn that he is a highly intelligent, even sophisticated creature. In addition to Spock's instrumental use of his talent, McCoy replaces his usual medical routine: healing a creature that looks like rocks or asbestos. He also comes to pronounce one of his most famous phrases: "I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer!" It seemed very real to me in his scene in which he rejoices in his success, although he can not get Kirk to share his enthusiasm: Kirk is too busy organizing the results. The episode throws unexpected turns of character and motivation to the audience as the story progresses; Spock defends the need to preserve this discovered life, since Kirk adopts his habitual position to avoid the death of any type of red shirts (there are no half measures, as in "The Man Trap"). But later, it is Kirk who, for some reason, stops to shoot a burst of death, as if the heat of the hunt had disappeared and he had time to reflect on Spock's point (I think it was during the filming of this episode that Shatner knew that his father had died, uncharacteristic during most of the first season, has a happy ending.The conflict stems from the needs of basic capitalism, such as meeting standard quotas, rather than protecting the environment natural and its inhabitants, a version of the space age to protect the owls from the tractors of modern advancement Somehow, despite many murders and the feeling that everything could go to hell at any time with a high phaser, Kirk and Spock manage to negotiate an agreement that satisfies everyone, I suppose people and silicates are more reasonable in the 23rd century.
