The connection with James Dean? In a brief plan, we see Emilio Estévez playing with a teddy bear (remember the first scene of Ray's "rebel without a cause"). In addition, the main conflict is Estévez against Sheen, father against son, as in "East of Eden". The soldier has returned home and nobody has been able to communicate with him, not even his sister (a psychology student, what a mockery). The mother, a coarse matron (an excellent Kathy Bates), gets stuck in nougatine, can not understand that her values ​​(religion, family) have become something of the past, especially for someone like her son whose innocence was betrayed. The father, an irresolute man, under the thumb of his wife, although he strives to interpret the male, wanted to compensate for the mediocrity of his life. So he saved his "honor" by forcing his son to do his duty. The scene in which Estévez's hatred for his father explodes is very intense. The actor-director gives a moderate, internalized performance, as the students of Lee Strasberg used to do, and his final outburst of anger multiplied by ten.
