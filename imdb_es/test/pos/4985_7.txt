This is another Westerner about a greedy cattle baron who seeks to drive out small ranchers and farmers. Certainly, everything has been done before and since then. But The Violent Men is something special. <br /> <br /> What makes it special is that Barbara Stanwyck plays the role of vixen, as she used to do in her last films. She is married to cripple Edward G. Robinson, who is the cattle baron here, but Robinson is crippled and there are some indications that his wounds may have left him powerless. It does not matter to Barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother-in-law Brian Keith. That also does not sit well with Dianne Foster, who is the daughter of Robinson and Stanwyck, or Lita Milan, who is Keith's Mexican girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The secondary plot of infidelity almost takes over the movie, but Glenn Ford is the unconditional little rancher who is a Civil War veteran who comes west for his health, he manages to keep yours here. It is every inch of the silent Western hero, in which people make the mistake of pushing once too often. I almost hope that those famous words of Wild Bill Elliott come out of Ford's mouth: "I am a peaceful man". It would have been very applicable in The Violent Men. <br /> <br /> The fifties were the time of the Western adults, the subjects entered into operas of horses that had not been explored before. The following year, Glenn Ford would make another western, Jubal, one of his best results, which also explores infidelity as a component of the plot. <br /> <br /> There are enough traditional western elements in The Violent Men and a lot for those who are addicted to soap operas as well.
