This image does not have large explosions or expensive chase sequences. However, it has really wonderful performances and an exceptional script that puts this at the top of my "indie-must-see" list. Taylor Nichols and James Remar are great together. The young cast surprised me with a really consistent performance. Usually, independent images have some weak link, but there are no weak links here. Awesome. Go for this one
