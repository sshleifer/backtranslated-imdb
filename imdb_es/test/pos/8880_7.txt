I am surprised of the people, after those bad films were among the 250 best or just in the 7.0, I thought that more people would be angry with "Throw the train mom". This was a great comedy of two great comedic actors, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together they made a great duo of madness and obsession. Billy is a man who just lost his million-dollar story with his ex-wife and wants her to die repeatedly. Danny has a demented and senile mother who mistreats him. When Billy gives a "misunderstood" advice to Danny, Danny offers Billy a proposal, if he kills his ex-wife, Billy has to kill his mother. This is a crazy and funny story that can always make you laugh. Please, sit down and enjoy this movie, people! It's a good one! <br /> <br /> 7/10
