I saw Five Fingers on the Drive-In in ... what, 1973, '74? It was the first Kung-Fu movie I had seen and I entertained a lot. I recently bought it on DVD and I saw it again. The second time I also entertained a lot. I think this is probably the model that Kung-Fu movies are most modeled on. Rival schools, different styles, revenge, good guys from the "white hat" and bad guys from the "black hat". They even released the Japanese styles (VERY bad) of Karate and Judo. I remember that I enjoyed the dubbing dialogue, like "Hey You! You're a very bad guy!" and "You should not get away with it! I'm going to try this bad crowd!" This time it was not so annoying, I guess I'm used to it. If you have the slightest appreciation of this genre, this is one you should see.
