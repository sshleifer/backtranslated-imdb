As another IMDb critic says, "... imagine 2001: a space odyssey in the desert" and it would not be far from a brief summary of what you can expect from this piece of cinema (I very much doubt in using the word "film"). "). A lecture on the philosophical views on creationism, the myths that surround the existence of the humanities, the before and after, that was, what is and what will be. This for some maybe a "2001" in the arena, but they address different philosophical points of view, one about evolution and the future, hope and potential for humanity, while Fata Morgana itself is a somewhat more metaphysical journey . I just hope I can transmit it effectively enough. <br /> <br /> Herzogs's style will not be to everyone's liking, and those who are not part of a branch of cinematic vision that is perceived as such can, and will most likely find it, extremely difficult, and it may not even reach its end after 72 minutes. Fata Morgana, with a somewhat surreal rhythm, music of several genres and an almost mythical narrative, fuses a montage of images of the Sahara, including villages, villagers and several other places. <br /> <br /> Upon opening with a montage of several shots of airplanes that landed for almost five minutes, you arrive at the immensely confused film introduction, and the feeling that this will not be like anything you've seen Before it echoes clear in your mind. Divided into three sections, creation, paradise and the golden age, Fata Morgana tries, and manages, to juxtapose images of the natural beauty of the desert with the instruments made by man that stain it. Its three segments are narrated by different people, each one specifically of the particular section that they are expressing and they provide an additional emphasis in the long soliloquy and desert montages. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana is a film about the existence of man in our land. Observe the natural beauty for which the Earth was designed and, at the same time, analyze the potential beauty that we have within us, which most notably shows us our negative contributions to the world in which we live. Each shot has been purposely constructed, using what can only be described within the context of this film as 'The Holy Trinity of filming' in images, words and music. Each part of these three pieces provides something remarkable to each shot, but when they come together, they create something greater than the totality of their parts, they create unbridled beauty and deep thought within our minds. I can not make this movie with the justice it deserves with mere words, maybe if I had pictures and a score, and I know the masses will not appreciate it, but this is profound and I will not use the term "art film" because this it is simply art. This is an art in movement that moves the mind and stirs the soul. Whether or not creationism is your desire is irrelevant, because this film is about intelligent design.
