When I reviewed the video for a local magazine, I called it "the greatest achievement in the history of American cinema." That was not quite the tongue on the cheek. TW & TL is still Milius' best work, and it's sad that he has so few opportunities to work. However, TW & TL continues to be a striking exposition of what was once known as The American Character, thanks in large part to Brian Keith's magnificent interpretation of Teddy R. (Obviously, Milius and Keith admired TR tremendously to make two films about him, including "The Rough Riders.") It's hard to criticize this film at any level: a splendid balance of action, lightness, relationships and the serious theme that America is coming of age in the world. In addition, TW & TL has an exceptional appeal in all areas: consider the statistics that show that it qualifies better with men under 18, women aged 18 to 29 and over 45. Clearly, Candy Bergen played a sensitive chord with the women and men.
