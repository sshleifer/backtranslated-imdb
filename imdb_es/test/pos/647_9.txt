Meant as a kind of social commentary on the way our lives got out of control in the 1970s, this movie is more like something that Mr. Schlesinger threw together after having a bad day on the highway. A mixture of fragments of the nuts found along the highway in Florida and on the highway of life, the distribution was almost wasted and probably ended up on the floor of the cutting room. The problem is that what did NOT end up on the floor of the cutting room probably should have! Now available on DVD, it's kind of funny to see a comedy that would have cost $ 100 million to produce if it had been created in 2004. It develops and it's not too hard to understand, and, surprisingly, in 2004 we're all still practically alone <br /> <br /> jumping in our cars and going faster and faster, without going anywhere.
