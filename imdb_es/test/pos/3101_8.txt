The More Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle retake almost perfectly where The Egg and I leave it. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles, a new writing team and a new director are presented. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was a producer on The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses, MacDonalds' approach to Kettles works very well. There is a reference to that Ma beat Birdie Hicks for the first prize at the fair for her quilt, an important scene in The Egg and I. The prize money from the quilt contest would be used to send Tom Kettle to college. In this film, Tom returns home when he graduated from college. <br /> <br /> There are two intertwined arguments in this movie. One is the comedy of the simple family of the mountain that moves to a modern avant-garde house. The other is a slight morality game about how the environment affects children as they grow up. <br /> <br /> Pa Kettle (Percy Kilbride) wanted a free tobacco bag to participate in a contest and ended up winning a house. Your disappointment at not getting the free tobacco bag is played to make you laugh a little. When Pa plays with dynamite, he is totally oblivious to the explosion. Kilbride never shuddered at the scene when the debris from the explosion fell around him. He played the role perfectly. In his autobiography, Jack Benny mentioned how impressed he was with the deadpan delivery of Percy Kilbride. Kilbride brought that comic device to a high level of perfection. <br /> <br /> Ma (Marjorie Main) and Pa move into the new house with modern conveniences that confuse Ma and Pa almost as much as they help them. Ma adapts much more quickly than Pa. Modern amenities include a television, a very new item for the home in 1949. Movable walls, hidden beds and plumbing fixtures are used as comic accessories, but the attention is in Ma and Pa, never the accessories themselves. <br /> <br /> Tom Kettle (Richard Long) meets Kim Parker (Meg Randall), a magazine writer who believes that hygiene and the environment are essential for children to succeed as adults. Tom is a brilliant, self-made man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment. This topic is discussed briefly in a couple of scenes, but it is left aside. It was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise capricious movie. <br /> <br /> Seeing the Kettles move out of their dilapidated old house to move into a new house would be almost a disaster if it were not for the Kettles. The characters remain true to themselves. Ma was the practice, just as it had been in The Egg and I. Pa. It was the fish out of water that provided the best comedy. He never felt at home in the new house, but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never worry him.
