i L-O-V-E this movie ... everyone and the dentist of the grandmother of his grandmother's sister must be the owners! It's witty, diabolical, exciting, comical and full of kindness full of toast action! With this movie, those amazing people in Troma give you a new perspective on the history of Romeo and Juliet in ways you never would have thought possible. It has all the characteristics of an instant classic: car accidents, deliciously lascivious sex scenes, family confrontations, street fights, incredible music, severed heads, and Mot√∂rhead's Lemmy tells the plot of the story! And that's just a sample of what it has to offer! every person with whom I have seen this movie now owns his own copy or wishes ... A +++++ and ++
