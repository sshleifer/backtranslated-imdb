Being both a fan of Dario Argento and a fan of Phantom of the Opera, I was dying to see his first version of the story, before Dario Argento's "Phantom of the Opera". The film is simply great, even the plot, that here is one of Argento's best in a coherent story. The way he turns a classic romantic story into a spooky slasher is just great. The movie has a nightmarish feel, which helps keep you on the edge of your seat. The colors have never been better in an Argento film since the amazing "Suspiria". The murders are intelligent and bloody, all done in the characteristic style of Argento. The thing with the eyes in this movie is simply unsettling, and it's much better than in Fulci's splatter. The acting is regular, but once you see the movie more times you better understand the motivations of the characters and get used to it. My two biggest complaints about this is the use of rock music. I think it was a good idea to mix beautiful fragments of opera with heavy metal, but it does not run very well here. The ending is VERY disappointing, which is the worst of the film, it seems that it echoes the previous "Phenomenon" of Argento, but done terribly, it just did not have to end that way. The same happened in the court of the director of "The Exorcist." I wanted them to keep the original ending. But it's still a fantastic movie and really a must-see, if only for the memorable sequence of murders by Daria Nicolodi.
