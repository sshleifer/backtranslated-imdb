This movie was excellent from start to finish. I was captivated by the action, the black humor and the incredibly bad luck that our hero found at every step. Thomas Jane is a great actor and I hope to see him in many more films to come. When I read the comments of other people, I must admit that I never thought of Tarrantino while watching "Thursday," but now that I think about it, I think there are some similarities. I guess I did not spend a lot of time trying to relate everything to everything else. The rape scene between Porizkova and Thomas Jane is one of the record books, the sexiest scene in history.
