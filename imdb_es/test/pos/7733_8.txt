I watched this movie like Skywalker02 did, but when I could see it again and with formal training in the cinema, psychology and life have had the time to take my hand and start hitting me, I really click. with the movie. I remember that pay-per-service cable channels played almost to death, like the poltergeist when it came out, and many other popular movies. At that moment I felt it was not worth the fuss and constant "time in the air" (I know the cable is not really aired) given, but I was very young and the drama of the adult situation should not have worked. However, the recent visualization of the film has illuminated me in the film. I think Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald were probably studying the script together, and I would be a little surprised if Surandon had trained Ringwald during this project. The other Ringwald projects, while good, do not have it exhibiting potential depth like this role. Surandon nailed hers, as did Raul Julia. Cassavettes and his wife had acceptable performances, but I will admit that sometimes the first class performance becomes mediocre. A constant ebb and flow to the performance takes place during many scenes, but in general I can see why the story might require that the dynamics become more subtle. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not find This movie will be the kind of boredom party "take me out and drown me" as Skywalker02 would make you believe. I think that maybe with the right psychological training and a little more difficulties in the strategically placed domestic life, along with some film courses, this movie might seem different. I would say that if you feel a bit melancholy and long for a simpler life, and have had your share of marital discord between dysfunctional family units, then this movie could provide you with more information and entertainment than you might think. I feel it's a classic and I find it much more entertaining than conventional films that are supposed to share many of the same elements, such as Terms of Love that, as far as I'm concerned, could be divested of some extraordinary performances by Jack Nicholson . , then it burns ceremoniously until there is nothing left. (How could a movie like that get more attention than this? Talk about boredom.) Best of all, do not take my word or anyone else's, watch the movie and support our industry.
