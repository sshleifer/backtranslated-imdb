A line of the plot that later was used to feed the classic North by Northwest of Hitchcock, Saboteur benefits from some very good performances, as well as some master sequences of suspense of the Master himself. <br /> <br /> For any Hitchcock fan, the plot is a bit too familiar, but he was always able to infuse the story with his own supporting characters and memorable charades. Here, the charming and charming Robert Cummings is the protagonist and soon meets many strange and extravagant characters, despite a company of circus artists, a rich businessman with hidden motives and a blind solitary who shows him the best way to judge someone. . <br /> <br /> In terms of originality and quality, this is lacking in some areas, particularly the antagonists' motive. However, there is a good chemistry between Cummings and his protagonist, the very little appreciated Priscilla Lane, as well as a really touching performance like the blind man of Vaughn Glaser. The best part is the final sequence, which perfectly reflects what Hitchcock would later use in North by Northwest, only this time the climax is on a statue in New York. Certainly, it is not your best moment, but the Master of suspense gives us some good moments to wait.
