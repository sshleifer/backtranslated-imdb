Anand is one of those low budget movies but well taken. It is a "cup of coffee" entertainment, without the violence, blood or emotion of "jump out of your seat" that most Telugu movies have. However, it has some own massala. Roopa is a stubborn and down-to-earth young woman who is not afraid to face any kind of situation, even her dislike for her offensive mother-in-law. She even retires from the wedding because her fianc√© does not defend her. However, her air of confidence and independence is enough for Anand, a rich young man who lives in the city, to aspire to be her new husband. His father accidentally kills his parents in a car accident, so why not give him back the money? But Roopa is not the type to fall in love with lovely smiles and polite behavior, she puts him in a lot of situations, it's still rude and painful. It is not until he defends her and saves her life that she understands that she loves him too. But complications occur?
