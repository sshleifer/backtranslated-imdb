The first film at the Fangoria Festival in Las Vegas and the most challenging. It is not a movie for everyone. Several of the films that followed used predictable formulas of classic terror to tell predictable stories. This image seemed determined to do his thing. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini showed some funny jokes as the superior villain. He dominated all the scenes he was in, moving his cloak like Leslie Neilson playing Dracula. It was great to hear his explanation after the movie. He had a good sense of humor on paper. <br /> <br /> I was glad I did not have too many preconceived ideas, because the film offered many surprises. The story was funny and profane and unusual. There was much love lavished on the look. Most important, he had a strange advantage. Unlike many of the films that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, this was a movie that used its appearance with a purpose. <br /> <br /> There were many films at the Fangoria Festival with bigger budgets. , but none that dared to be so different.
