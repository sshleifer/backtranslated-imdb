Well, it's a good movie. However, you must admit that Van Dame's films have not been so good lately. On the other hand, if you're a van Dame fan, you should see this, as there is a great improvement in the fight scenes. Also what I really liked is the beautiful music music. I'm sure this will kill time if you're a fan of the action. As for Isaac Florentine, the director of Undisputed 2, I do not think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed. I can not wait when one day the Van Dame films arrive at the cinema before the DVD. Maybe one day :). <br /> <br /> In the end, it's worth watching if you do not have other action movies to watch, this could make your hour and a half have fun.
