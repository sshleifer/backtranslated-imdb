While it is not the masterpiece that was "Le Samourai" (I have already accepted that Jean-Pierre Melville could never overcome that classic), it seems to me that "Le Cercle Rouge" is much better than "Bob le flambeur". I felt that "Bob le flambeur" was a b-movie above average and influential, but still a b-movie. "Le Cercle Rouge" shows that, as a filmmaker, Melville improved as he continued. John Woo is a huge fan of Melville, even though his cinematic style is different. While Woo uses the rapid movement for shootings and an operative sense of violence, Melville has a minimalist style that fits very well with him. He was not interested in creating fast-paced action movies, but more meditative crime thrillers. In that department, he was one of the best. <br /> <br /> "Le Samourai" is still his best work, mainly because he has more character development than this one, but at the technical level they are probably the same. In addition, while "Le Samourai" had a great main performance, this has four. Alain Delon is once again an ultra-cool gangster lurking: this man's silence is fascinating. Bourvil is excellent as the police inspector in the case of the robbery and escaped swindler. He steals all the scenes in which he finds himself, and proves he was a skilled dramatic actor (in France he is best known as a comedian in the Buster Keaton mode). Yves Montand is also great as an expert in trembling and paranoid weapons. Gian Maria Volont√® (a regular in spaghetti westerns) is overshadowed by his three cast stars, but still does an adequate job. <br /> <br /> Once again, Melville's address is excellent. Taking equal influence from both American crime thrillers and the new French wave, man always seems to know which are the best shots and angles to choose from. This is slower than most caper movies, but it's really worth it in the end. "Le Cercle Rouge" is a little less than an absolute classic, but it's still one of the best movies in history. Tarantino must have seen this before doing "Reservoir Dogs." (8/10)
