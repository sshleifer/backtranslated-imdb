I did not read the book or care about The movie was a beautiful romance, and I think women will enjoy it. No, it was not a "10" movie, but it was nice. Women, if your man is bored like mine, then look at him. The pain is wonderful as the philosophical doctor who delivers a reflective monologue about "in love" and "love". <br /> <br /> Also, if you like Nick Cage, it was fantastic and fun. I enjoyed watching the romance unfolding. <br /> <br /> also, if you like Christian Bale - see it in balance. This is a science fiction movie of "10". <br /> <br /> watch this movie. Ignore the comments of the previous user. <br /> <br /> one - especially the ladies! Also visit my website in my name as a word and a "dot" com.
