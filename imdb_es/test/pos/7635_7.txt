L'OSSESSA, also known as THE TORMENTED or THE SEXORCIST, or the ridiculously titled THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCISTAS scam that contains one of the best horror moments I've seen. The scene is when the crucifix comes to life. This great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective (great effects). It is a pity that the rest of the film does not maintain the level of chill that is exemplified during that scene. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most frustrating movies in history. Imagine the producers who decide to make an EXORCIST copy, but while they are doing it, they really manage to create something truly original (a sculpture possessed of the crucified man, which is shocking when one thinks about it), but then completely forgets about his original idea for to be able to make a boring and uninspired EXORCIST scam. If the film had continued with the concept of possessed sculpture (with the characters that tried to destroy it, etc.), this movie would have shaken. But once the girl is possessed by the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone where the devil came from. She, and the script, completely forget about the enchanted crucifix, which is STUPID !!! <br /> <br /> If you like the so-called "Euro-cult" movies, the first 45 minutes are delivered unlike any other Euro-cult movies. But after the scene, when the girl has the vision of being crucified and gets stigmata, the remaining 45 minutes CHUPAN. Boring. It is not going anywhere as fast as it tries to emulate (badly) THE EXORCIST. So, look at the first 45 minutes of L'OSSESSA and enjoy the fashions of the 1970s, the sordid and amazing scene of the statue that comes to life and strips the girl, but after the first 45 minutes, press Stop and eject, and you can so go cut your toenails.
