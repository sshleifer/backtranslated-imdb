I really liked this movie ... but the ads I saw implied, and a published review actually said, that this movie "benefits from a light touch". For me, that is very deceptive. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of humor: eccentric humor, not subtle, sometimes something twisted: the kind of humor that I usually find very attractive. But most of the humor is of the type that seems conscious at all times of things deeply serious, deeply sensitive, even deeply painful. The film weaves themes of Past and Present, Perception and Truth, Memory and Activity, Life and Death. The whole film is imbued with the history of European anti-Semitism in general, and the Holocaust in particular. <br /> <br /> How can humor and horror be combined in the same movie? The review I saw suggested that humor is absurd. I do not think this is the case at all; At least not in common sense. Instead, I think this film follows the tradition of a lot of literature and Jewish / Yiddish theater. I do not pretend to be any kind of expert in this area; but from what I have seen, humor is used, in this cultural context, as a tool to deal with the horribly tragic experiences of these people; and humor is also used as a means to "recover the Divine" for men and women who choose a path of Faith instead of a path of Despair or Absurdism. See "Fiddler on the Roof" to see the humor used in both ways in this rich tradition. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Jonathon) Wood uses horn-rimmed lenses that really make it look, well, weird: compare the city of sin when wearing the same types of glasses with chilling effect. In this film, it is easy to see how glasses become a metaphor for both their quest and their struggle between perception and truth. Eugene Hutz (Young Alex) and Boris Lesking (Old Alex) are really wonderful. Jonathon and Young Alex are from the same generation, but they seem very, very different; and then find that they are not so different after all. And the way in which the apparent narrative Voice gradually changes from Jonathon to Young Alex's ... as a journey of discovery for Jonathon becomes one of discovery for Young Alex and Old Alex ... it seems very moving to me. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful scenes and panoramas of (I have been told) Prague and its surroundings, representing Ukraine in history. Everything feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of the place; although I have never been to Ukraine and I can hardly bear witness to this from first-hand experience. <br /> <br /> In short, if you're looking for a light comedy, I would not recommend this movie. . On the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, charming and moving movie, please take a look at this wonderful movie.
