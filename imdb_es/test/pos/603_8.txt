You know, it's very interesting to see this ... half of the people involved are dead ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have not seen anything related to Muppet for a long time, but this things are gold pure. I'm a big fan of word games, and this movie has pretty well placed, but one of the surprising aspects is its rhythm: it's not really the high-speed children's rhythm where the filmmakers simply decide to move the story at random Without giving depth to the character, it's just a kind of movement along with the characters where they want to go. <br /> <br /> Kermit the Frog is simply an incredible character. His voice and the expressions on his puppet face are fantastic. But above all, he points out why he is popular: "he can also sing and make jokes!", But more appropriately why he is so attractive, he, without any effort, inspires everyone to seek his dreams. Meanwhile, he also has to deal with himself, which is an uncommon topic in family movies. <br /> <br /> It also contains a set of comedians who make appearances here and there, some with great effect, others for a little less (I think Mel Brook's part was a bit exaggerated, right?). Some parts of the movie are a bit strange. But it is very imaginative and goes to the same destination from a very different direction. <br /> <br /> Moving along ... <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
