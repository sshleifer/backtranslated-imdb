I will divide my review into the following 5 categories, each with a maximum of 100% (if perfect) ________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Visual pleasure: [100%] This is a visually very nice movie. I had a great time watching him. The golf scenes are very well filmed and the dramatic effects on the green were quite surprising. I also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bag. <br /> <br /> Director's work: [70%] Bill Paxton is more associated with acting, but this movie shows that he has talent. He did a decent job. <br /> <br /> Acting: [90%] Shia LeBeouf was very good in his role as Francis Ouimet (this guy can ACT well). The rest of the cast was also good. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value: [100%] Enjoyed every minute. It was overwhelmingly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Script: [91%] Based on a true story and, therefore, makes the film much more special. It was intriguing from the start and loved each scene to the end. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> <br /> My advice: Definitely, you MUST see all sports lovers, especially golf (I will love all). Anyone who is looking for a good movie entertaining and who does not hate Sports can see it. <br /> <br /> _____ <br /> <br /> 10/10
