Aaliyah blows all female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest Marguerite Moreau. <br /> <br /> I would have loved to see this movie as Akasha's power trip. Aaliyah is simply electrifying when it is on the screen. She is sensual, beautiful and threatening to the power of 10. See her take a bar full of vampires is something worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Lena Olin is chosen for the ungrateful role of "the older woman", which is enormously unjustified. She looks fantastic and at 46 (according to the IMDb) she still looks awesome. <br /> <br /> The story unfortunately is very limited in the plot, we have seen everything before, etc. <br /> <br /> The most heartbreaking is the scene of Akasha's death, especially considering what happened to Aaliyah after the filming. <br /> <br /> In short, an extraordinary vampire movie.
