William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never seems lazy and never seems to prefer to be somewhere else. In short, it is what more actors should be. "A Slight Case of Murder" is directed by Steven Schachter, who then made two other great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap). <br /> <br /> Television movies have long been a lot of exaggerated acting, bad cinematography and sub-pair scripts. That's why it's so refreshing to watch a television movie that does exactly what it was created for. Tell a small story (not a simplistic story) that does not require viewing on the big screen. <br /> <br /> "A mild murder case" is a light, entertaining rate and a great watch. <Br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
