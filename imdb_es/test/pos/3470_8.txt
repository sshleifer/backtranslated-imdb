Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the "blossoming" of one of them. A young "Spike" type bitter (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly befriends a young man (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside the house, but McAvoy does, and he is bound and determined to return to the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this amusing and moving story, often heartbreaking, of inner strength that overcomes physical deficiencies. The two tracks are incredible, especially Robertson, who surely should have spent some time studying the disabled to carry out this complicated role. It appears in almost every scene, and acts as an absolute storm. For anyone who does not know, they may think that they really have CB. Highly recommended
