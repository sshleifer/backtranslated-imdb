I was born in 1946, I was about eight years old when I first saw this film and it left a deep impression on me. Not only did I get scared, for want of a better word, this movie persecuted me for more than 50 years. The mafia fan played by John Larch was terrifying. The only scene that came to mind during those 50 years was the murder of the girl and the carefree policeman, referring to her as a "small n ----- boy". These words were replaced when the movie was shown. Recently on television, maybe there are two versions of the movie or someone felt obliged to alter this heartbreaking scene a bit. Precisely or not, the film was a long way to formulate my opinion about the South and even today, the closest to me. I have come to visit a southern city in El Paso. That position may seem extreme, but there is a little more in the story. When the film was shown recently, it became clearer why it persecuted me for years. With the news as the beginning of this film gives the impression that what is shown is a fact. The film is supposedly made only one or two years after the incidents depicted, which increases its realistic credibility. The terror in the film is not provided by creatures or extraterrestrials, but by people who live in our society at that time. : The recent visualization helped to clarify the impact it had on my 8 year old mind. When this movie came out, the only school I attended was mostly African-American. The victim looked like a child in my class, it was like watching a real murder. It made a horrible scene much worse. Maybe this revision is not useful to anyone, but it helped me.
