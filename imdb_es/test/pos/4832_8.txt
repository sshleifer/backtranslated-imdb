Having finally been able to get the DVD of this 1997 HBO movie, I can not see it. By the time I finished, the old saying "those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it" was echoing in the mind. First shown four years after the first bombing of the twin towers (and four years before the events of 9/11) Path To Paradise reveals the series of close encounters, mistakes and official decisions that led to the first bombing of the twin towers. and the lessons we should have learned from them. <br /> <br /> Path To Paradise presents a good cast of credible actors. Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden lead the cast as FBI agents John Anticev and Nancy Floyd, who face not only the threats of terrorism but the lack of official interest from their superiors along with their NYPD counterpart, Lou Napoli ( Paul Guilfoyle). Art Malik, Andreas Katsulas, Shaun Toub and Tony Gillan are among those who plan and carry out the attack, all of whom fulfill their roles not as possible clich√©s but as real people and make the film as good as possible. Of special mention is Ned Eisenberg as Emad Salem, the man who, had it not been for the skeptical FBI officials, could have potentially informed the plot. <br /> <br /> The movie is also well produced. Despite being made for cable, this film does not look like a low budget movie with its production values, especially in its sets and in the locations of New York City. The fascinating cinematography of the film gives the film an almost documentary style at times. When all these elements are combined with the script, all this helps to give the film a sense of reality that makes the events that take place even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing part of the film is its script. . The events of the film are true (less a dramatic license that is always necessary) and, in retrospect, they become even more shocking than they should have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago. The film reveals how a group of men could smuggle a bomb into the World Trade Center. They did it thanks to the lack of Arabic translators, government agencies that do not transmit information to each other, the FBI ignored the leads of a source and the police departments could not find clues. Worst then, the inability of researchers to connect points is the fact that many of these same things not only allowed attacks 9.11 to occur, but in some cases (such as the lack of translators) are problems that continue to this day. Even more chilling is the ending that really happened and it seems very prophetic today. <br /> <br /> Path to Paradise is a movie that should be essential to watch today. The film is not only well acted and produced, but it teaches us a lesson we should have learned before. The lesson of the movie? That those who can not learn from the past are condemned to relive it. If you can find this movie, look at it and learn from it.
