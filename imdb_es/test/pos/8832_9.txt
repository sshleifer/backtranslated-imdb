I came across this movie on DVD purely by chance through a Blockbuster rental. Voyage to the Planets is an excellent documentary / drama of 2 hours of the BBC on a future "great tour" of the solar system. Doing everything possible to adhere to current knowledge about planets and space flight, and the plausible extropolations of existing technology, this film tells the story of astronauts on a trip to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto. <br /> <br /> The special effects are excellent for a television program. I found credible actors as astronauts. The situations presented are for the most part plausible, and you learn a lot about the science of planets and space flight! Only two minor complaints: I found some situations and dialogue, sometimes, in some way, very uncommon. Also, I'm not sure that a single crew and a ship are sent on a single mission to see all those destinations at once. Most likely, visits to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. be / are separate missions. <br /> <br /> They did not try to skimp on this show with production values. The scenes of Venus and Mars were actually filmed in the deserts of northern Chile, the driest area in the world and a cul-de-sac for the Martian landscape. The weightlessness sequences were filmed on a Russian transport dive plane. The producers could have been wrong with any of these studies and CGI, but opted for the real thing. <br /> <br /> I would like to mention especially the wonderful music that was composed for this movie. The exciting theme of Don Davis is the first thing that catches you when the film begins, as the magnificent shot of Pegasus goes through the screen and David Suchet says "it is the destiny of man to explore the stars ...". <br /> <br /> Seeing this on a small television screen is something I regret. What a thrill to see this in a movie theater, or even better an IMAX presentation!
