This is a classic unfortunately not recognized. <br /> <br /> The appearance is magnificent, the design, the wardrobe, etc. They are impeccable, the post-battle scenes and the cavalry charge are chilling and exciting. <br /> <br /> The characters are alive and very human. Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini as the lawyer Derville steals the film with his clever pedantic performance of rodents, reveling in the ups and downs of other misfortunes. Depardieu is good but perhaps a presence too big for this role. <br /> <br /> Where the film really stands out is the story and also its changes with respect to Balzac's novel. These changes are editorial because Balzac has a lot of discussion about society and this film breathes with characters. However, Yves Angelo has retained the key ingredient, not only the lost man trying to regain his place in society, but each character has to find his place in society: Comte Ferraud is trying to buy a family home, his wife (Ardent) comes from a humble birth and when he married Colonel Chabert, they achieved their position in the turbulence of post-revolutionary France. Everyone has something to lose in terms of status and that makes it a good drama, since their goals are in conflict with each other. <br /> <br /> It also feels very modern: money is essential to buy the state to achieve power, but someone can go down as fast as it rises. Derville enjoys the strategy, has seen the worst of the people he tells Chabert when he takes the case. The original place of this speech is at the end of the novel, since Balzac summarizes the human comedy with great irony.
