This is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen. No movie has affected me like this one did. This is a great movie and you have to see it for yourself. Normally I am impregnable with these sobbing stories, but this one did it for me. I was crying in the end. You will long for the friendship that is portrayed in this film. If I could give this movie a billion stars, I could.
