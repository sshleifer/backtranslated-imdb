It is said that this movie is banned in the USA. UU Since its launch. As there is no information in IMDb, I must trust my other sources and believe it. If this is really true, the film is even more hurtful and terrifying and, anyway, it is. <br /> <br /> The movie is a supposed mockumentary, although I think the subject is too serious. Call it like that. It creates a scenario in which the United States is like a military state and all revolutionary objects stop immediately without evidence. After a mandatory court, they have to decide if they go to jail for a few years or choose the punishment park. In that, they have to walk through the desert for three days to reach an American flag, placed 50 miles ahead, while being followed by police and army troops. <br /> <br /> The film itself aims to be a documentary on these incidents and follows both the courts and the hunt in the desert, filmed by European film crews. All the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and they film everything. People look directly at the camera, yelling at him. It seems very, very real. To speak of realism here is nonsense. This movie is not about how to make a realistic movie, it's about what that movie would look like, if it were real. And it certainly would look like this. If it was filmed anyway. In a 'utopian' state like this, there surely would not be a European film crew authorized to film those things. <br /> <br /> There are many things that scare us. The accused are people of all social classes. Political leaders, musicians, authors, philosophers, unemployed, etc. They seem desperate, rebellious or frightened. They are not heroes. They talk a lot in court, knowing that it does not lead to anything, saying however everything they said in speeches, books and songs before. One says that he is not afraid of dying. Is this true? Well, he does not have to run through the desert hunted by cops. The defendants have no chance, or at least their only chance, the decision between the prison and the punishment park, is not really a possibility. The way they decide at the end and the way the film ends makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide. <br /> <br /> These courts remind us of many courts in the Third Reich. Officials use the same kind of idealistic discourse, ignoring all the defendants' arguments, starting to yell at them and then telling them to be quiet. They warn the accused of "observing their language" and insult them much more. They ask them questions, the defendants can not answer, but never intend to do so. These scenes are a statement about what we call justice. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the desert are on a different level. When we see the prisoners for the first time, we realize that they realize they have no chance. Seeing the desert and the mountains, feeling the sun and thirst, they have no idea how they should endure these days off. The film crew follows them and speaks to them as they try to escape this madness. They argue, should they play the game, or escape, or rebel? Everything leads to the same and nobody is surprised. Will some wonder if such parks would actually exist in such a state? Why not? It empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries as they wish. It is not a gas chamber, but the Nazis killed Jews before the concentration camps were built. The comparison is fair, since there is no real difference. <br /> <br /> The movie is scary and depressing. The problems spoken of are too familiar to ignore. This is not science fiction. Talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not utopian. The film shows us that government and democracy, as it is presented to us, are not only useless but also dangerous. It also shows us that the revolution is definitely not the solution. The defendants seem to be confused because they really do not know how to fight against this. They do things, but for nothing. Even if this does not offer us any solution, it's still a statement. <br /> <br /> For me, the most frightening thing is the fact of the banning of this movie. Here we have a film that accuses the loss of freedom, morals and peace. It accuses the government, a fictitious government, however, of being dangerous and inhumane. And such a movie is forbidden. Think about it when you see the American flag next time.
