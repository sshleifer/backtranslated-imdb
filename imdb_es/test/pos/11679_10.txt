I love this movie. It was done RIGHT before the Los Angeles punk scene got worse. It perfectly preserves the mood and attitude of that time and place. I feel very fortunate to have been present at the filming of four of the bands at Fleetwood that night. The only part that does not fit very well are the sections with Catholic Discipline and their sociopolitical comments. I did not see too many people who were interested in that. The rest of the film shows attitudes that I witnessed a lot; people who face difficult lives, or who throw themselves into the music industry and / or the evil hippies. I do not think I've seen a documentary that captures the subject matter so authentically and personally.
