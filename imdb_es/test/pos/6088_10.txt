Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. It is horribly burned from an ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) takes care of him, body and mind, because she fears, with all reason, that he can be a very troubled soul. In the course of his care, the Count begins to tell Hana about his recent past. It seems that he worked in a government in Africa, where he met a beautiful married woman named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid themselves, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Katherine left him, leaving the Count desolate. Even so, the two would meet again, under heartbreaking circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana falls in love with a Sihk man in the British bomb squad. However, the war is being fought tirelessly. Can love exist when the world is in crisis? This is a tremendous movie, based on an equally good but complex novel. The plot has many story lines that are beautifully intertwined, each of them touching beyond description. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is magnificent, as much as the victim burned as the man who thought that love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also very good as the woman who fights against her passions. As for Binoche, he deserved the Oscar that was presented to him, since his nurse is a shining example of hope in a desperate situation. The landscape is absolutely beautiful, as are the costumes, the management and the production. If you missed the opportunity to see this movie, correct it soon, very soon. The English patient will continue to be one of the greatest achievements of cinema during the next centuries.
