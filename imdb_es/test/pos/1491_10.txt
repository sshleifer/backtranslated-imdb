Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean is between Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and other comedy greats. I've never seen people laugh so hard and literally fall out of their chairs like when I introduced Mr. Bean through my videos and now on DVD. I will never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was visiting and I asked him if he had ever seen Mr. Bean. "Who?" he said. So I took out my video and showed him where Mr. Bean is at church and he starts falling asleep. My brother laughed so hard that he fell off the chair and was holding his stomach to keep from laughing so hard. He became an instant fan of Mr. Bean. We all know how fun these episodes are, but the fun is sharing them with others. I've seen so many people laugh until it hurts! The favorite episodes are: the visit of the queen, the stay in the hotel, afternoon for the appointment with the dentist, the Christmas episode (a classic ... more the children love it!) And the New Year's party . Rowan Atkinson is a comical genius!
