I like both this version of DORIAN GRAY and the MGM version. They both add a little girl at the beginning of the story that grows to partner with Dorian (this is not in the original book), and that is my only complaint. I especially like Angela Lansbury as Sybil Vane and George Sanders as Harry in the MGM version, but Shane Briant as Dorian in the TV version looks a lot better (I think) and much more relentless than Hurd Hatfield in the MGM version: I think Briant is more faithful to the Dorian of the novel. In the end, this is a very good adaptation of the novel (it even alludes to Dorian's relationship with men, as well as Wylde, which could not be done in the MGM version).
