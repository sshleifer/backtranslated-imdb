It was a rare gift to see "Checking Out". I was touched by the characters, I laughed a lot with the wonderful script and I was deeply touched by the genuine emotions that this set of actors and, above all, Peter Falk portrayed magnificently. In fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children where he recounts his experience of his life, his deep love for his wife and his decisions about the future of his life is so profoundly real that he is at the top . Level of the best Academy Award winning performances. He is an accomplished actor who overcame himself in this movie. The screenwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge, time, a gift for dialogue and fun situations that made me laugh out loud in the theater. I highly recommend "Checking Out" to all those who want to enjoy a quality story with an excellent performance.
