This excellent film starring Elizabeth Montgomery has long been released in DVD format. The same can be said of her previously, also excellent movie, A case of rape. I can only hope that my comments will encourage some entrepreneurial souls to place BOTH Elizabeth Montgomery films on a DVD so that they are available to their many fans. For my part, I believe that the role of this excellent actress was, unfortunately, stereotyped by her role in Bewitched and, as a result, the most serious acting roles were not put at her disposal. I'm sure if these two films, maybe even a trilogy with The Legend of Lizzie Borden, were released in the form of a DVD, their fans would set the record of how they will consider their serious skills.
