This is an extraordinary movie. As a judicial drama, it is convincing, as an indictment of the American justice system, it is frightening. For Brenton Butler, the consequences of this system could be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, which is not about discovering guilt or innocence, but about who is best presented in court. In truth, the implications of this case go beyond the possibility that an innocent man is found guilty, or that a guilty man is free. Every citizen has the right to justice, be it a perpetrator or a victim. But do they get it? The film has a good rhythm, it is discreet and it is one of the best documentaries of the court that I have seen.
