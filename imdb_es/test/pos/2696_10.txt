In a time of bad, if not simply frightening, comedy, King of Queens is more than a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all time. Nothing has been so good since Married with children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, I find it hard to label someone as a comic genius. These guys really understand what is fun. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and I would not get half the laughs of seeing KOQ just once. Other fun people in this show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (Carrie's boss). I'm so happy that they managed to get so many seasons of this gem. The show has been a hilarious winner at a time of mostly comic losers. Check it out if you have not done it!
