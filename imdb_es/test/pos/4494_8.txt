Kite Runner is without a doubt one of the most incredible books I've read in the recent past. Maybe he had high expectations regarding the film, but nevertheless the film was good, the whole scenario seemed realistic. nothing was made to fantasy. The dialogues were not very attractive or powerful, they were correct. The movie was not a bad experience at all, especially in the last 15 minutes, where it got really emotional and even the hardest man would probably cry. But my imagination was much better than the movie ... I cried more when reading the novel than watching the movie But in general, a good movie to watch for those of you who are not readers. but the readers: the novel would be a better experience, so if you want to see the movie, first read the novel and then compare it to the movie.
