When Salinger's "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" ends with the suicide of a prodigy, this film begins with the death of the legend of high school star swimmer Matt, who shoots himself in the head with a revolver in the initial scene . But the death of Matt Travis serves as a key to open the door of another prodigy, his brother Tim, who never in his life seriously bothered with the question: "What am I going to do?" <br /> <br /> When he finds his brother dead, with his head broken like a fallen watermelon, the Travis family starts throwing up their secrets one by one. The film focuses on Tim. He is the victim of bullying, domestic abuse, family alienation, anguish, problems of sexuality and friendship. <br /> <br /> Tim reveals his injuries by physical bruises, but these are not the only injuries on his person, as we slowly realize, since the script painfully reveals the origins and the result of the scars of Tim. All those who love him hurt him. Hirsch plays the character quite well, revealing box after frame in the visual expression of his body, a lot of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a child that nobody seems to hear or know very well, without knowing it and without realizing its depth . Soul and prodigious talent. <br /> <br /> Two brothers who share a doobie, huddled in a red and red play dish, Tim asks Penny: "What am I going to do with the rest of my life?" The scene is framed in a familiar and recurrent image of the film: the comfortable playing field where Tim obviously feels at home, filmed from a bird's eye view, because with each character, Tim feels comfortable sharing a part of himself, and we see these intimate aspects. moments that he shares on the red plate for children's games, with child graffiti carved in pencil, from above. After advising her to move abruptly to the meeting, Penny says, "Tim, well, the secret to life's success is finding something you love, and you should do that for the rest of your life? that you wait for the devil that you are good at that because if you are not, you will probably fail ". This simple line of advice from Penny serves as the central theme of the film, the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure. Why does a person have a talent that he can not stand, like Matt, who hates the attention that his swimming fame gave him, but nobody notices Tim's talent? None ?? Because nobody bothers to ask him? Not even us. The film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know Tim as well as we think we did when we first met this handsome and sad boy; In our intimate understanding of Tim, as he progresses, we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be. This is the other side of the film, the failure of those who should? parents, friends, teachers ?? Whoever notices and sees the gifts of people who say they love. Not even his mother Sandy, played by Sigourney Weaver, sees Tim's gift, despite his love for his son. Weaver does a skillful job of a middle-aged woman dealing with her own inner demons while trying to play the roles of domesticity and random support. When it is discovered that Tim was harassed at school, he torments the boy's trailer, threatening his life. "You can bother, torture, hit, drive drunk with me, I can forgive you, damn, I can understand, I'm a good Christian, you know, I can forgive and forget, but you mess with my son and God himself descend from heaven to protect you because as long as I live and I will outlive them all, I will wake up and go to sleep at night just dreaming of ways to make your insignificant little lives become hell on earth. " After throwing a paper cup at the mother's face, she looks around the trailer and, looking at both of them, the child and her stunned mother, says "good tow" and leaves as fast as it came. Weaver has an ability to match taste with a visceral wit that is acid and witty. And Tim's father, played by Jeff Daniels, is blind about who his son is, treats him like a stranger, does not tell his family that he took a break from the office, spent his days in the park the city, apathetic, with a sculpted soul. , and sleeping in Matt's bed, tucked into his high school jacket. Jeff Daniels does an excellent job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and a lover, because we realize that even an inept father can show his love for his son. In an emotional scene, Tim confronts his father. Just when you think his father is going to hit him, he grabs him to hug him. Without letting go, he says to Tim: "I am your father and you are my son and I am fine here, but you have to talk to me, I do not know how to do it alone". It is here, in this moment of the film, that a father tells his son, you have to tell me what is happening inside you, you have to tell me who you are; I want to know who you are. It is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment, the visual movement of Tim, angry and alone, until his father embraces him as he breaks and cries, revealing the emotions hidden under his shell. Tim experiences this moment of cleansing with his father as a catharsis, especially when considering the mistreatment, manipulation, contempt, violence and betrayal that has been treated in the long year spanning the film. I recommend this movie.
