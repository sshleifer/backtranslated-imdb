Father Hood is an entertaining story of a reluctant father who is definitely a BELL! Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles, who is a capo who is always attentive to the great "score" that will put him on the easy street. His wife died while he was in prison and his two children were placed in foster care. When he "came out", he thought they were probably better in foster care? He still had to earn his fortune. His daughter Kathleen Charles (played beautifully by Sabrina Lloyd) escapes from a foster care institution that is abusing children and misappropriating money that is supposed to be spent on children. She hunts her father; he tells him how bad the place was and that his brother, Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsall), "only a small boy of 7 years", was transferred to the institution from which he had just left and convinces his father to kidnap him . The three of them start an adventure all over the country, while Jack keeps telling himself that he has to get rid of the children! Patrick Swayze is really good at this comedy, playing a "hood" (probably a little less than this criminal character) that is similar to his Johnny Castle character from Dirty Dancing, except that Jack is more fun in this comedy and more optimistic Johnny Castle. Swayze is fun and the rally makes comedy quite well! Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer, a reporter who tries to learn the truth of the foster care system that becomes Sawyer's ally. Diane Ladd plays Rita, the swindler mother of Jack Charles.
