I was surprised by the quality of this film, especially after seeing pictures of the director as an adult, all 140 pounds (?) Of him! In truth, a boy directing a movie about a boy. I hope to see more Luke Eberl movies. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a bit too long. He spent too much time demonstrating that Connor was unsuccessful (and unwilling) to make a move on Owen. Caleb did not try hard enough. Owen, being so young, could have easily approached Caleb and later decided it was not his preference. And Owen would still have learned the "valuable lesson" about corruption and politics. On the other hand, there was not a good opportunity to learn about their sexuality. And poor Caleb? Owen could have been a good influence. <br /> <br /> Although the film aims to show Owen as a hero who overcomes perverted corruption, I felt sad for Owen. He was offered the opportunity to have fun with a boy with Caleb, who was extraordinarily beautiful. Owen did not have to accept the political perversion as offered. But he could have tried to have some fun with Caleb, and still get away when he wanted to. It was clear that Owen was in charge, nobody forced him to do anything he did not want to do. But he could have had more fun, and with a very good boyfriend, with that. <br /> <br /> I hope Luke makes more movies where the young and attractive characters have more fun.
