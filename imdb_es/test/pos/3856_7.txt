There is a selection of animated films where animals or something "nonhuman" portrays human beings and I think this movie is one of them. Apart from some plot points and characters, this movie could be changed with all people instead of mainly with animals. Although, it is good that someone has not done it, I think that cats are very good in this film that portrays humans. :-) <br /> <br /> This film also focuses on many adult themes, which is quite strange for a Disney movie. Mention alcohol *, show a dog teaching another dog how to attack the "tresspassing" of humans and show a male cat named (Abraham Delacy Gieuseppe Almost Thomas) O 'Malley, imagining a cat, in a surprising way human and adult <br /> <br /> Like a cartoon movie, or just a movie in general, I think it's very good quality, the story and the characters are especially good. The film (in general) is set in France and you come across a family of cats: Mother Duquesa and her kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. You also meet the kind (rich) old woman who loves cats, the butler Edgar and an old man (who has CLEARLY lost his marbles) named George. The kind old lady discusses her will with George and Edgar overhears what she will receive from the will she will have after the cats have her. Unbelievably, he comes across this - and he has a bad plan in mind ... <br /> <br /> A very nice movie for all ages - enjoy "Aristocats"! <br /> <br /> * Not included "Detective of the basil the great mouse" and some others that perhaps I can not think at this moment.
