"Rififi" is an excellent theft movie, and one from which they have released subsequent films since then. Jules Dassin had an idea of ​​the sordid underworld in which these thieves live. You will not find here the Hollywood glamor of "Ocean's Eleven". The thieves in "Rififi" do not steal because of the emotion, and they are not playing a game. They steal to survive, to pay for the education of their children, to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. The praise scene is a nail biter, filmed in virtual silence. I had the feeling that the plot lasted a little longer than necessary, but the high-speed race to deliver the child to his mother who finishes the film is classic. <br /> <br /> Be careful: -This movie is very dark. But it is also very good. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
