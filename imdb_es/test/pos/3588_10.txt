This series has much in its favor with beautiful images of some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Considering the five years of manufacturing amazement, it would be difficult to expect one less. I got the impression that some scenes from the first episode were repeated in the last one, which is naturally a minor complaint. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough is great as a storyteller and the comments are informative, leaving enough space for the imagination, and well spaced, so that the viewers have enough time to reflect on the impressive images. If you have the opportunity, try not to see a translated version of this series. <br /> <br /> A definite must see for anyone interested in the complexities of our blue continents and easily the best documentary on this subject. never seen.
