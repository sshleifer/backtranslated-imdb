Okay, then this movie is NOT very well known, and it was not very publicized. I discovered this pretty brutal gangster who came out as a good movie completely crash on one of the Skys movie channels on a dull afternoon, but I'm glad. The opening sequence of this movie is fantastically funny in a very dark way. In fact, this establishes what I think is the overall tone of the movie. I think many movie critics and fans who have actually seen this movie have been a bit unfair to simply write it down as a lower budget gangster movie in the Vein Reservoir Dogs. Well, there are undeniable similarities between Thursday and some other criminal genre movies with which it has been compared, but to be fair, I think that this movie has a much darker and more comical aspect to this type of film, and the end result It is a fascinating film, well made, funny, if not totally original. Tom Jane is good at this and deserves the recognition we now hope you receive thanks to The Punisher. Your acting as the bad guy has gone well is realistic, funny and cool enough to make you believe that Casey really was a bad ass before it will be reformed. That is another thing that makes this film stand out for me, the characters. In the Nicks gang, you get the strangest trio of criminals you've met, a soft and charismatic but very cold leader (Nick), a whore from a woman (Dallas) lover of blood who loves blood and a psychotic Billy Billy with brain with a penchant for torture (Billy Hill). Advance in the strangest police detective. never seen on the screen, very well played by Mickey Rourke, and you have a recipe for ... good for real Thursday. Sometimes it's comical, sometimes brutal, sometimes unoriginal, but always fascinating and worth seeing.8 / 10
