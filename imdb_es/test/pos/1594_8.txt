CAUTION: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although this movie moved a little slow at times, the brilliant scenery, the richness of the characters and the powerful themes make 'Morte a Venezia' a rewarding experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am sure that the visual splendor, the musical score and the powerful evocation of Conflict and Desire of Visconti must do it justice. <br /> <br /> Gustav von Aschenbach's study alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behavior and passion. This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes that the music is mathematical, that is to say. quantifiable - and emotional. This conflict reappears in the scene where the young Tadzio is only playing `Fuer Elise 'in the hotel lobby and Gustav remembers his visit to a brothel, where he is attracted by a prostitute who plays the same song. In his flashback, after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically trapped by the consequences of his actions. This reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that Tadzio represents. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Gustav is forced to make his most important decision: stay in Venice and resign himself to his lust and temptations. Or flee Venice to save his own life? His first attempt to flee from Venice at the train station resulted in a uselessness and presages the result of prolonging his stay. <br /> <br /> Complementing the character's captivating interaction, Visconti's powerful stage (especially Venice at Dawn and the final scene) of Tadzio walking in the water and pointing to the horizon) makes this film a true masterpiece .
