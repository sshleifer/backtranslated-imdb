This animated short is a new version of one of Tex Avery's previous shorts for Fred Quimby on M-G-M (Dog Gone Tired). An escaped convict (here known as Joe) who has just left the 'Alka Fizz prison' tries to stay one step ahead of Droopy (known here as the Sergeant of the Mountains), but always manages to meet him, one way or another. This is easily one of the funniest funny shorts that came out of the M-G-M animation studio. He manages to get most of his laughs from Joe's shock reactions every time he meets McPoodle (including some equally deranged sound effects, ie, horns, shouts, elephants, etc.). As with any Avery M-G-M, a frantic and frantic pace is to be expected (along with some visual and surreal gags, meaning Joe, who tries to get away from McPoodle and, in reality, gets off the side of the movie). Put this on your DVD player and laugh silly.
