One of the most pleasant aspects of watching movies is getting lost in a movie. To have it totally on you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, you experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is a movie like that. Over the years it is an image that critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at their vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is due to the tone that the film brings with it instead of its more obvious characteristics. It is both prohibitive, remote, possibly dangerous; Be careful with what's inside! The disturbing chords of the music, seen in the 20th-Fox logo, lead us to turquoise titles from another world. <br /> <br /> Strange! Archaeological! Decadent! It is as if we were descending in some vault of antiquity, where they could be great treasures, mixed with uncertain dangers. (One could imagine Darryl Zanuck in command: 'Do it old!') Then, a dramatically dark story unfolds, all in the same tone set at the beginning. <br /> <br /> From the Egyptian trilogy of the mid-1950s, 'The Ten Commandments' portrayed the severity of civilization, the phenomenal' Land of the Pharaohs', their nuts and bolts, while 'The Egyptian 'shows everything, from glamor to tragedy, so we can be surprised. <br /> <I do not need to say much about the players here, but I think that, with the passage of time, Bella Darvi is being redeemed. What a perfect face for the role, right after a symbolist painting. If his performance does not please some, it could be argued that, in his role as "courtesan", he is obviously better in bed than a poor helpless admirer. I think Curtiz captured the perversity of his sadomasochistic relationship with the character of Edmund Purdom with aplomb, with censorship being what it was at that moment. Sir Peter Ustinov, in his memoirs, was very kind to 'The Egyptian', and wrote that it was' like being lost in a great set for 'Aida'. Your pronunciation of the word 'beer' I have adopted forever. (One of the historically accurate references of the film: the beer invented by the Egyptians!) Henry Daniell, egads, what a perfect performance. Gene Tierney, what a screen treasure. Bless DFZ for giving him this 'late' role. Come on, folks, do not be so hard on Victor Mature! He is the son of a cheesemaker! Who got up to be Pharaoh? It sounds like a peculiarly American opportunity. One of the best moments: the existential observations of John Carradine on the sands of time. And Purdom's expression on the abode beyond the sunset of the world. If that is not the epic Grade 'A', what is it? <br /> <br /> Of course, along with everything else, the music is sublime. It is often observed that Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann created one of the most convincing scores on the screen, perfectly harmonious, although each theme is well developed, with a life of its own. Newman, pressed for time by DFZ, called Herrmann, someone he could implicitly trust, to take half the burden. <br /> <br /> Benny, he's not the easiest guy to work with, he obviously respects Newman enough to give up. inspirational music They alternated signals, an ingenious approach. There are no spoilers as to who did what here, but Benny brings with it an advantage, mysterious, amazing sounds. Alfred brings sympathy, longing, shock. Both are extremely epic. Even when viewed on a squeezed TV print, the effect of seeing the names of the two composers side by side in the main credits, which the ultra-wide anamorphic screen could comfortably accommodate, is tingling. <br /> <br /> Leon Shamroy, the dean of CinemaScope, will not leave us here. The green leaves and grumpy shadows (probably distortions in all the terrible TV impressions I've seen over the years) perfectly accompany the multidimensional script (of the great Philip Dunne and the WB veteran Casey Robinson, whom Curtiz must have brought with him) to 20). How surprising it is that Shamroy, who was a film institution on both Fox and Newman with music, would play Cleopatra a few years later, but in the brightest and clearest images of Todd A-O of the sixties. These old study guys are really my heroes of mine. <br /> <br /> For me, who wants to worry about all the imperfections and critical opportunities in an image like this? I prefer to give in completely to his spell and immerse myself in its sea of ​​splendor to emerge after the inspiring climax of 'The End' renewed, moved and hungry for more. <br /> <br /> And yes, we should shout at 20th-Fox for a DVD release worthy of DFZ's legacy.
