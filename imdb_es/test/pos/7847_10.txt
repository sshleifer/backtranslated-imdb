During the civil war, a wounded soldier of the union hides in an isolated school of confederate women; where the school principal and the school teacher decide to take care of him and keep him close, until the problems begin to arise among women and lonely girls and those who are sexually frustrated. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but everything has a price in the end. <br /> <br /> "Dirty Harry (1971)" (which was performed almost at the same time as "The Beguiled") could be my favorite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but after seeing this, I tend to think that this be the best work of couples together. A very atypical, smart and stylish vehicle for Eastwood is always on the mark with an address richly controlled by Don Siegel and a disturbingly moving music by Lalo Schifrin. It strongly emphasizes its sordid and somber nature that is introduced in an intrusive way in the psychological composition of the film and the manipulative strangulation in sexual depravity. It is played assiduously and makes it more oppressive and bloody when those random commotions and shameless intentions take hold with overwhelming tension. The way in which Siegel illustrates the engaging and daring slow recording script of John B Sherry and Grimes Grice (taken from Thomas Cullinan's novel) is effectively achieved through marked emotions and the lyrical and adjusted context of the script. Siegel's strong direction captures the idyllic southern Victorian scene with photographs so powerfully adorned and creates some strangely penetrating images with great clarity and sobriety. <br /> <br /> While the performances, they are truly praiseworthy and of high quality. Clint Eastwood is a soldier of the union of chameleons who speaks softly soft and sweet, is very impressionable and deliciously secure. A deeply stolen Geraldine Page steals the image as the owner of the hardened head and the elegant Elizabeth Hartman adds a delicate sincerity to her innocent character. Mae Mercer is very well adapted as the black maid and Jo Ann Harris is the chosen one among the young students with her seductively astute character. <br /> <br /> Honestly, while the charismatic Eastwood character plays the field for his own selfish needs, there are still conflicting intentions that the one being played (where rivalry between women grows) is not better than your guest at the end. In everything there is a perversely dark sense of humor and an ironic touch that is based on the material. What is shown here is simply more than your basic astonishment, but it is full of intrigue and a sense of realism that is hard to shake. That also goes for its extremely mysterious title and its closing song. <br /> <br /> An effective and discreet element that is hard not to be tempted by its undulating hospitality.
