Having never read or seen Bard's original work, I can not begin to compare this work with his story. So I will not. Instead, I'll just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that seemed a little lower in the budget, but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought that all the primary actors did a good job. The style of the magic seemed more black than white and almost certainly would offend anyone who was upset by that kind of thing, but I thought it was well done.
