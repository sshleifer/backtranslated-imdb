Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in character-driven studies in naturalistic-style films about the kind of little people who spend every day, without anyone noticing that they are there, in New York. <br /> <br /> These are people who have been pushed to the edge of society. They exist in a kind of gray world, many of them migrants whose legal status in the United States seems somewhat dubious. Where do they come from? How did they get there? How do they manage? Where will they end? These are not good stories as such, but stories about survival at its most basic level, day by day. <br /> <br /> Ale is one of those street children. It has no education and hurries anyway, to save money, is not beyond resorting to theft. He is most anxious to be reunited with his older sister. We see it in the first scenes surrounding a safe house looking for it, but without real success. A young friend, Carlos gets him a job at a second-hand goods store, in the shadows of the Shea baseball stadium. Finally, his older sister comes to live on the site with him, but he is jealous of the motives of his friends and suspects how she earns extra money. She dreams of buying a food truck and establishing a sales business with her older sister. <br /> <br /> Bahrani records all his films on location. There is nothing brilliant or glossed about them. This is life, since these people have to live it in the natural way. It's not pretty, although it's never sinister, and the slightly desperate air that hangs over a large part of the film is the same one that hangs over the daily lives of these people. <br /> <br /> The script is also very natural. and the characters are given ample room and space to work. Polanco stands out in the lead role, and Gonzalez provides solid support as the older sister.
