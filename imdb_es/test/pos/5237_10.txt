If one overlooks the technical problems of this early sound film (1930), such as the sound quality and the occasional rigidity of John Wayne, you will find that this film is an epic film that is more realistic than almost any film made since then. Beginning in the Missouri, a large caravan of cars, people and animals from Conestoga heads west. The cars are knocked down by huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with a considerable risk for the riders in the cars. The Indians meet with Wayne and let the train pass through their land. Later, the Indians gather to the west of the train to fight them. The carts form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle, and shoot their rifles creating a veil of smoke with the surrounding Indians. <br /> <br /> When the battle ends, the dead are buried in the place and the people and the cars leave. This scene is remarkable, since the camera stays with the dead while the living go away. It is unique in the way it links the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from life. The cars are facing a big storm with torrential downpours and mud everywhere. They finally arrive at their destination near a redwood or redwood forest in Oregon. The film is made in 70 mm widescreen with a ratio of approximately 2.0: 1 (in 1930!). <br /> <br /> I have not mentioned the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the huge amount of work involved in the making of this film. Movie makers will never work so hard again to make a movie or any other movie. Given the technical limitations of sound, music sometimes moves, like when Wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friend's murderers and in the end. <br /> <br /> While all critics rave about The Searchers and The Psychology, Racism, Bad Temper and Wayne's complex characters. The Big Trail tells the story of simple people who face extraordinary difficulties. One of the best westerns I've seen.
