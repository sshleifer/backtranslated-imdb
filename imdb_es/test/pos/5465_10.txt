I just got back from holy faith. NEW MEXICO. I visited the Loretto Chapel. As I looked around this building, which had been acquired by a private owner, I relived the film version of the staircase. It is an overwhelming mystic that occupies this building. It is about what can happen if you really have faith. The bookstore there has a narrative on the subject, which is the story of the staircase. I read the narrative in its entirety. The environment that surrounded people absorbed me. It was as if we were totally locked in a distortion of time, all with the same thoughts and astonishment. When we left, the silence was overwhelming. Everyone should visit the Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe. NEW MEXICO.
