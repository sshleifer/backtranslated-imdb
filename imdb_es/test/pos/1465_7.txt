The Soap is an interesting and very bright movie in some parts. It should be noted for its strong characterization and the risks involved in the plot about two people with problems that fall in love. You must know the story through several other reviews, so let's talk about how great this movie is. <br /> <br /> In the first place, the two protagonists are personalities so real and so intriguing. The first is a woman who has opted for a four-year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with someone who approaches her. The second is a man who has always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness are shown with such sensitivity and brilliance. You hate the first and your heart bleeds for the second. <br /> <br /> The second thing in this movie is the whole concept of loving who you are, regardless of gender. So, would you still love your partner if he / she changed their sex? The film explores that idea and is beautiful. <br /> <br /> But there is a point at which the movie fails. I wish the relationship between the protagonists had developed in a better way. That what they feel is love does not reach the end. But look at it, and publish your thoughts here ...
