Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget the fact that it is wonderfully performed by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stand. Although history became impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems to have been devised, the only thing that should be remembered when contemplating this film is that it contains some of the most surprising and disturbing images that have been filmed. It's as if Salvador Dal√≠ decided to make a criminal drama. A must for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film as a canvas on which to show true works of visual art. I would have to give this movie a 9/10 for its incredible visual screen.
