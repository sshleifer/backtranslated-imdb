Many people are burning this movie because of the presence of Paris Hilton, but this is not a fair reason to object to the film. The reality is that Paris has a rather minimal part, she spends most of the movie off the screen. The film also mocks her on several occasions, usually with a camera and at least once in night vision. For those who enjoy the theatrical presence of Paris Hilton, this may be a movie to watch at home when it premieres on video, because at the screening I was in, we all laughed at their misfortunes through the film and portrayed it as a "woman of questionable values". <br /> <br /> The movie itself was pretty good (unlike the recent flood of weak horror movies), it has everything a horror should have; a creepy villain, excessive violence, acts that make that average person tremble ... this movie reached all bases. Definitely worth a watch.
