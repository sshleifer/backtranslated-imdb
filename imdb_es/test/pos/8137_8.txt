What are the movies? I mean, what are the movies made for? Shots? Murders? DO NOT. They are made for life stories and this is what this movie does. It presents how life has changed between two ages. The father and the son, the father who needs a job and asks him for help. <br /> <br /> Although there is another generation, there are some characteristics that include caress for the family. <br /> <br /> The main theme is, in my opinion, the son's love of the father and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The movie is composed of ONLY one dialogue, but that dialogue is more than you could ever want. This movie is a pure art! Once again, after "Marfa si Banii", Cristi Puiu gives us another beautiful film. Well done !
