Each frame of the film is a lesson for new directors or existing directors to know how a movie should be taken. I take my hat off to Sekhar. It is underestimated in the Indian film industry. The director has all the qualities to bring this film to the rank of Satyajir ray, Adoor. All the characters are represented effectively in the film. Although it is a simple story, it has been considered that it can be considered one of the best in India. I do not have enough adjectives to praise the movie. In the same way that life develops in the atmosphere of day to day, the film has been taken. Although the songs in Indian films are considered a weak area, the songs in this movie have given extra energy to the potential of the film ... especially the background score ... it's amazing
