If you see this series, you will get 10 interesting chapters on the history of a sleeping cell and each character. And more intense with the infiltration of an FBI. <br /> <br /> Good story, good characters and performances, but something is wrong (for me, of course). The final is wrong. Wait ten chapters waiting for a big final (it does not matter if they meet their goals or not) but ... well ... I think it's not enough. It's a small ending to a great series. I also expected more definitions about character stories. <br /> <br /> But, I repeat, it's an interesting miniseries. If you do not want to wait with large series (22-24 chapters), look at it. I give 7 out of 10.
