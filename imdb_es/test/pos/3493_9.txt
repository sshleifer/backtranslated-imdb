Ali G's show was really something incredible: he was a stupid rapper candidate, but nobody he interviewed realized he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually a very smart guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people ... And it's really fun. So I did not expect the film to be good, because everything was acted, not people or real interviews. Thus the basic point of every show was lost. But I was wrong: I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest movies I've seen in my life. Of course it was stupid, but who cares if you can not really brake to be sure with a car battery, as someone said? It was not supposed to be a realistic documentary ... And it's not like the show, it goes in a totally different way, but that does not mean it's bad. When I finished watching it, I was totally impressed, but now, when it was a while, I realized that it was not so special anyway, but it still deserves a nine, well, at least for what it's supposed to be.
