It's a good movie. I read the brief synopsis and it did not impress me, but seeing it (mainly for Caroline Dhavernas) grew in me. <br /> <br /> It's such a nice change to watch a movie in which girls / young women are not punished. Your sexuality The girls have full license to explore and even the possibility of making mistakes without ridiculous repercussions. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are absolutely funny, and many of them are supposedly erotic scenes, which were not exaggerated. or unpleasant The male characters in the movie were great, David Boreanaz was great as the fickle gallant, and what is great is that the movie does not make us hate him so much. The other two younger male characters were also good, without being dominant. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I've seen that has girls growing up and it's quite powerful to see how they realize their mistakes. but eventually come and continue with their lives instead of dragging their mistakes along with them.
