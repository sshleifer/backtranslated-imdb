"Closet Land" was sponsored by Amnesty International and has many political nuances, but there is much more in this story so moving than that ... <br /> <br /> This is not just about the political tension of the late 80, it's about the personal persecution that a woman poses as a girl who was molested by a friend of the family. We see the subtle allusion to the parallels of a dishonest structure of government / society and the culture of sexual predation where one in four small children are molested and one in three women has suffered some type of rape. <br /> <br /> For In my opinion, a chilling question arises: does the attitude of our sexual repression, which leads to predation, create the political environment of fear and censorship, or sociopolitical dysfunction fuels a culture of predation? sexual? The psychological ramifications of even asking this question force us to a place where we are led to develop our own answers. <br /> <br /> In the end, our young writer (Stowe) has a moment similar to the one at the end of Hensen's "Labyrinth": in a brilliant and brilliant moment she realizes that the idea of ​​the secret police (Rickman) steal his power is an illusion. No one can steal his power; They can only trick you into abandoning it, and then you have the right to recover it at any time. <br /> <br /> This is not a film in which you can participate lightly. and surely you enter it. The minimalist aspects together with the children's animation stir the deepest parts of the psyche and do not leave viewers unchanged.
