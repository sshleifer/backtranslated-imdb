The fact that the reviewers feel very intensely negative towards the show is an interesting fact in itself. If you do not like it that much, do not look at it. <br /> <br /> Some critics claim that you must be stupid, stupid or an old primitive to enjoy this show. Au contraire, my friends. I'm not saying that all the contestants are smart. There are intelligent, and there are fools. But I would say that they probably have an average IQ higher than the average of the reviewers on this website. That is correct, I said it. There's a lot to be said about the science of seducing girls. I'm sorry, but please remove all the canes from their asses, and understand that the reason they hate these guys is that they threaten them. <br /> <br /> Those who are not aware of the social sciences, and more specifically, the science behind. Clearly the mating will miss the boat completely. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear: clubs are not the only places to meet girls. Personally, I think women who are worthwhile do not even go to clubs, so they are not victims of men like the ones we see in the program. But what are men like these? Apart from those whose games suck, they are the personification of men. They are men who know women in the most difficult situations. These are men who appropriate their own sexuality. These men do not beg their brides not to break up with them, and these men do not say "OK" to the phrase "let's just be friends". <br /> <br /> Sound familiar ???? In fact, these are the guys you're afraid of when you take your special long-term girlfriend to the club. We all are. These guys know what women like. (again, only those who have "game") <br /> <br /> And even those who are bad ... it's worth laughing! <br /> <br /> If you have gone out to a club and interacted with the people around you, this show should be entertaining. <br /> <br /> Look, I do not understand why there is so much hatred for this show. My best guess is that it aggravates the insecurity in men who have had bad experiences in clubs, or threatens men who believe that women are beautiful creatures who do not want to do anything and who just want a good guy to get their attention. <br /> <br /> I personally love this show. It's pure entertainment, and best of all, it's REAL. It is a very perceptive vision of the most recent state of sexual psychology. Sex roles have never been so different from before, and this program offers a very real vision of that, <br /> <br /> I think that actually some intelligence is needed to remove something positive from this program. <br /> <br /> This program attracts a certain target market, and if you're out of it, I guess you should not tune into the program. We could say this about any other program, right? <br /> <br /> Grow, <br /> <br /> ApolloHelios
