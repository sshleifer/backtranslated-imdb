I saw this in Horror Zone and I expected it to be a competition like most of the films they play, however, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie revolves around 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck that is chasing them (I know it sounds horrible, but it's actually pretty good), the movie is creepy when it intends to be and laughs out loud in part ( and not in an unintentional way either, it has a good rhythm and it's very funny, besides being very bloody, it also includes a bit of funny black humor, it's not the most original movie, but what if you after Shakespeare, This is not so, if you are after a funny movie, this should be fine.
