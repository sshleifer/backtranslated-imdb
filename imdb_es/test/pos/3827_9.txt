To begin with, this is my favorite of the ST operating system. <br /> <br /> In addition to the critical comments of StuOz, I will include some more: Technical techniques, when the Enterprise fires its photon towers at a blind target, they would have to be powerful near direct hits (I think) to cause any disturbance and much less damage to the Romulan ship with the vacuum of space to deal with. <br /> <br /> He had something of a problem with the Romulan commander questioning his faith in the Romulan "protocol" or his leadership, unless it has to do with attacking vulnerable targets (outposts in the neutral zone) that do not They are at war. Also, I do not think the commander will fall for basic or simple tactics that Kirk played, such as "playing the dead" or falling into the stratagem that the subordinate imposes on him whether or not to attack the Company when he is playing dead. <br /> <br /> In the company: I'm surprised that after seeing the attack method of the Romulan ship before, Sulu said: "Are they surrendering?" when it attacks the Enterprise for the first time. <br /> <br /> It's funny how Spock can only do gun control repair right after the emergency ends. <br /> <br /> Also in the final attack, I thought that the Romulan ship had not been hidden for too long (while Spock could run down a couple of corridors and return to the weapons room and activate and fire the photon torpedoes I would have used phasers at this point, but I'm sure it had to do with the technicians and the budget). <br /> <br /> On the positive side: it's a good drama played on the Romulan ship, in which he introduces us to the Romulans. Great scenes with Stiles counting much of the human knowledge of the Romulans. Also, his conflict with Spock is up to the task. I wished that Stiles' character had stayed on the show for a while, if it was not for the energy he added. <br /> <br /> It's just for fun that I point out the negative and foolish aspects, (I'm sure there's more). But for me this is as good as it gets! "Balance of Terror" is always the one that I place at the top of my ST classification.
