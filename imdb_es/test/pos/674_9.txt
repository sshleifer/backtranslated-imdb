The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as maintenance personnel. She is a war widow. <br /> <br /> The set is limited but the performance makes up for it. Robert Ryan is in conflict: at one point he seems pleasant, then confused about where he lives. At first Lupino tries to help him. He seems worried but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense accumulates. I really enjoy movies like this, which are based on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of? There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying guy in the store who sees something is wrong. We keep thinking that they will help her, then Ryan's personality changes again. He becomes a character of Jekyll / Hyde and, finally, pursues Lupino with a knife. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing these two excellent actors. 9/10.
