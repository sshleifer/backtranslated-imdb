one of the best movies in history ... Fire ... does not have much to do with the sociological description of India today ... it's the use of light that blows the mind that never stops, never it returns ... normal ... even when ... in this sense, the film is almost unique ... both tracks are of very good quality ... the origin of Das as a street artist is quite obvious ... acting is an excellent "cammeo" ... but his use of light ... I looked at him and I looked at him, again and again ... I still regret after the ages ... nothing torrid in history .. rather "pure" way of dealing with the subject ... in a way, it is sad that in the strange world we live in today, an important work of art is known as a genre film ... Fire can be expensive to face with the Jeanne D 'Arc of Dryer or Biruma no Tategoto of Ichikawa or some of the main Kurosawa films, just to name "some". I wish my contribution could help this film a bit to its deserved form of fame.
