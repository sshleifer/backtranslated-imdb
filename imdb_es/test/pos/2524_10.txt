The story takes place in the streets of Sao Paulo in Brazil, where a boy named Pixote grows up alone without his parents. Left with problems and without direction, Pixote is taken to a children's home with other teenagers in the street. Behind closed doors terrible things happen within the staff and within the groups of children. And there is one last trigger that blows up the place, the last incident that makes Pixote and his friends decide to escape and escape. From there begins a journey overwhelmed by strong friendships, torn friendships, love and hate, criminal activities and simply relaxing on the beach talking about things, something that someone like you and I also do sometimes. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is perfect in many ways because it touches you on many levels, anyway it did with me. The style of document used to represent Pixote and its surroundings seems more realistic, and the actors, who are really street children and have lived similar lives, help humanity in the conditions seem more natural. It also has a social commentary on child abuse, but I think what makes the movie so good is that the pressure is on the story and not on the political opinions. The last scene, in which I find the best piece of the film, seems to me something more than anything I've seen before. So full of emotions and so unsentimental makes this film a true story, credible, unbearable and unforgettable. A truly heartbreaking masterpiece that is so understated! <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10
