Before continuing with the new millennium, I will go back in time once again because I had completely forgotten about these gems !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 1987, Disney, although it was still a "low" company in the 80s, was able to start a series of movies on television called "Not Very Human", about a teenage geek who, As in "Inspector Gadget", it looks like a human being but in reality it is a robot. Now this SCREAMS 80S, along with other films like "Tron" and "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids" because it combines everything of yesteryear with the technologies of tomorrow !!!!! <br /> <br /> My parents remember seeing this on TV back then, when I was just born or something like that. However, my first encounter with this movie was on the Old Disney Channel (once, I've seen this, and the other parties, on my 12th birthday in May of '99 !!!!!) <br /> <br / > "Not Quite Human" is a very good series of movies to watch, if you can ever find these movies again. <br /> <br /> Has this been shown recently? If so, send me an email or a personal message. <br /> <br /> 10/10
