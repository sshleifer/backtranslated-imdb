I saw this movie in the early 70's and was hypnotized by Judy Geeson. For me, he captured the clandestine nature of Rod Steigers, the irrepressible obsession with the young and extremely sexy hiker, played by Geeson. <br /> <br /> He could not help but feel a little sorrow for his wife, played brilliantly by Claire. Flowering. I was very disappointed to see that the original cut could have been lost and that there is little chance of it being published on DVD. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone who has seen the film, and it is a strong message that is not equally absorbed by the three main character performances, and I would have loved to have seen it again, if it were not for a reason purely nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Going back in time, about 35 years. <br /> <br /> A true classic.
