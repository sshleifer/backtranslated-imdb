I and a couple of friends from the university - Alberto Lopez, Dave Hall, Celina Alcock (we graduated from UEA, Norwich, United Kingdom in 1997) still meet and watch movies once a month. <br /> <br /> We are consummate experts in the art of making bad movies, and this film was quickly placed in the top 10 of frightful / brilliant films. <br /> <br /> So if you just get the beers and the weeds, and you need a movie to laugh like a leak, DROID GUNNER aka PHOENIX 2 is the movie for you. Marc Singer is fully aware that he is in a movie here, and he prepares it for everything he can! Matthius Hues is sublime in his wooden performance and muscular nonsense (is that a word?) As he growls "But I want my 20 thousand!" Pure Shlock Gold! If you liked this, you can also see: TRANCERS, THE RUNESTONE, DOLLMAN and anything from Charles Band or Fred Olen Ray ... (but be careful, some of your films have no merit and you will be screaming for them). those lost hours of your life !!!?!).
