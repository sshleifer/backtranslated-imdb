This was the first image of Chaplin of all those who speak, and the results are varied. The film is a scathing satire of Hitler and Mussolini, his henchmen and his fanatical way of life, especially with regard to the persecution of the Jews. It was daring and advanced by 1940 and should have caused many people to writhe. <br /> <br /> Compared to Chaplin's previous works, this is pretty pale in comparison. The sweet and funny style of his silences, in my opinion, is far superior to his first talkie. There are many nonsense bits that creep. If this had been a silence, it probably would not have happened. <br /> <br /> I find one of the funniest moments to be the musical moment of barber and dance of the world. One of the most moving moments is obviously the speech at the end. <br /> <br /> The Great Dictator is an effective and, at times, moving film, which is a very important part of the history of the film and of Chaplin. It's defective, but Chaplin is in great shape.
