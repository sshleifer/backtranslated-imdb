Hunt for Justice is about the installation of Slobadon Milosevic for his trial in The Hague. While it was a bit too clinical in its presentation, the subject could have become very depressing very quickly. A Canadian judge, Louise Arbor, becomes the chief prosecutor for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the United Nations in Yugoslavia. She fights everyone to get the evidence she sent to Milosevic on trial. It is not a bad docu drama with a work of direction and production class A. The "evidence" was disturbing because of the discussion of the facts about the shearing, fortunately they did not have too many details or real images of the tortured.
