It is difficult to judge 'Imaginary Heroes' without referring to the fact that director and screenwriter Dan Harris is only 25. You can not believe seeing this movie, which is not only a mature, professional and deep work, but also with some of the flaws of the specific routine of the oldest directors. <br /> <br /> The environment is the American suburb, too familiar with 'American Beauty' or 'Desperate Housewives'. As in 'American Beauty', the film revolves around a suicide, but here it happens at the beginning of the film, and we are seeing a middle class family facing the death of the talented sportsman, brother and son. Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is the mother, both are excellent at dealing with the loss, to find the reason and the motivation to survive. Harris pushes his actors with a sure hand, and the first two sections of the film (there are four in all, depending on the seasons) create a wonderful tension, with credible dilemmas and real questions. It is the second part of the film that disappoints a little, it looks too tired and conventional, and I suspect that the producers may have interfered in the work of the young screenwriter and director, trying to bring him closer to the Hollywood convention. This is how this movie is not a grim version of 'American Beauty', with a different approach. However, I'm sure we'll hear a lot about Dan Harris in the next few years.
