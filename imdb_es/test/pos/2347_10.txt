I'm a big fan of Naruto, although I have not seen all the episodes or read all the manga. <br /> <br /> I really liked Naruto's first movie and, to tell you the truth, I was a little nervous. that this would not be as good (or action-packed) as the first one (mainly because this one in Australia only had one PG instead of one M, which is a PG-13 US or 12 UK). But I was wrong (fortunately)! The animation improved more (although some drawings of the characters in the points seemed rushed) and it was very good, especially in the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, let's talk about the fight scenes! The animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and very entertaining! I especially enjoyed the battle of genjutsu with the kankuro and the fight with Gaara fighting against the shape-shifting female warriors! All the characters you want are here! Naruto, Sakura, Gaara, Kankuro and Shikamaru! If only Temari was in the movie, Shikamaru could save her from the warriors dramatically! And maybe they could have a PASSIONED KISS! In my summary at the top I say that this rating is more like a movie piece than just an extended episode. And he does! The action is very cinematic and the quality of the animation seems very elegant, especially during the fight. In general, this is an excellent anime movie that is a must for any Naruto fan. 5/5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! Well, I'll stop!
