I have described this film as surprising ... this is true in many aspects. The material of the subject (black man wrongly accused), the characters (the people you expect to be stereotypes often show unusual attitudes during the film), the production ... Film, especially for his time (1949). The only possible spoilers are the sometimes cheesy dialogue and the occasional high moral stance. <br /> <br /> But, if you run into him when you do not plan to watch a movie, you may find yourself like me. in the middle of the night just to see what happens. <br /> <br />
