As an independent filmmaker from Long Island, and having had two theatrical releases under my production / management belt, I had always been told how much I could learn from seeing a FRED CARPENTER production, so I was lucky to have his "Eddie Monroe" as my initiation to its excellent budget, production, casting, stages and masterful talents of direction. My heart went to its characters, to its history and was totally conquered by the end of trick / change that led to the plot of the film to fruition! The locations were wonderfully chosen and the human emotions in their characters brought a realistic link to my linking with all the elements that Mr. Carpenter used throughout, for his and the benefit of his film!
