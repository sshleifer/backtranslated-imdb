I have waited years to comment on this program, and I felt it was time for justice to be done. This is one of Christie's darkest, most sinister and attractive works, not just someone who is being murdered for money, it is a dark and captivating story of mystery, intrigue, love and murder, enhanced by the amendments made by the adapter. The level of performance is absolutely excellent, Joan Hickson is sublime in the part, as always! The rest of the cast, including Liz Fraser, Anna Cropper and Helen Cherry, perform perfectly, but I think Margaret Tyzack stole the show, the final scene between her and Joan Hickson is simply magical, the acting is as good as it is , chilling, poignant and totally bright. <br /> <br /> Please let me know if you agree with my words. I'm looking forward to the new version to see how well Geraldine McEwan's version is. Look and enjoy.
