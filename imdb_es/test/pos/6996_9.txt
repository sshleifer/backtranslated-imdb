As a fan of sci-fi movies, I also like Alien. But Pitch Black is definitely better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. It fits well in the Alien series. But it's not strange, it's something else. OK, enough comparisons. This movie, but I think: Why are people afraid of the dark? You can not run away from the darkness. It is impossible. You have to face the darkness and with that, what is dark. In this movie I also liked that the character of Vin Diesel Richard B. Riddick was not the typical good guy. He had secrets and has done bad things in the past. For the other people he is a hero who tries to save them all. In the first place, he himself wants to leave that planet. There are also other metaphors in this story. All the great fans of science fiction should see this image.
