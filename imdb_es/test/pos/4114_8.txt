Much better than what is generally given credit, this version of "Lost Horizon" not only had good music and beautiful scenery, but also an impressive mountain photography. A special edition laser disc was released a few years ago that added more than 30 minutes of previously deleted material, extra music and a lot of additional material. So, why is not this on DVD? It is difficult to decipher the studies at times. Certainly, the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman, but what do you want in a movie, good acting or melodies? The singer and dancer Bobby Van is very funny, Michael York is a properly tragic villain, and seeing Sir John Gielgud disguised as Chang may seem silly, but in reality it works very well on the screen. Trust me, you need to see this movie, if you can find it!
