I enjoyed some of the old Doctor Who many years ago, so when the new one came out, I just had to check it out. I was VERY pleased: with the characters, the story lines, the updated look, I was hooked! From season 1 (27 for old fans) to season 2 (28), it continues to improve. It also relates very well with previous programs, although you do not need to know the old programs to enjoy this latest version. <br /> <br /> Even though there has been a change of cast, I highly recommend Doctor Who - With Chris Eccleston And with David Tennant. <br /> <br /> I like that they have given a lot of depth to the characters. The doctor seems more vulnerable in this series, maybe because it's the last TimeLord. The variety of emotions that Chris and David show are really remarkable, and I felt their pain, anger and sense of adventure along with them. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper (Rose) brings a very human element to each episode, although she is much braver than I would be. With his talent, Billie will go far in the industry.
