I have no words to really describe this series. <br /> <br /> The premise behind this concept (a highly hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality that ends up turning a team of strange bugs into her own representation of the world, which was after all a creation of Haruhi, since she wants a world with extraterrestrials, espers and time travelers) is a breath of fresh air in a world full of repetitive anime series and non-innovative television programs. <br /> <br /> The characters are well developed and you will end up loving them, some less than others. The word to describe animation work does not exist, since "excellent" is really not enough to describe how it was done. There are many fun situations that will make you smile or put you in deep thoughts. Do not be fooled by the impression of the first episode, since it is only the tip of the iceberg, since the novels are still to come. <br /> <br /> The only problem is due to the lack of chronological order in the Episodes, but you can solve that problem, right? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Without a doubt, one of the best series of 2006.
