This film, winner of Im Kwon-Taek as best director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a nineteenth-century Korean painter with common roots and a significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths of the film is that I try to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects that help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik). Inspiration. <br /> <br /> The costumes and the art direction are impressive and the acting is good. It's not a movie that moved me, but one that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice in it. That is very beautiful. It is also interesting to see a version of Korea in those times just before the turn of the century, where the Chinese and Japanese powers are in Korea and the kingdom of Chosun is coming to an end. More than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the film, but they are never the center. He is firmly in the painter. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a well-made film about the life of a painter. But it does not exactly have the regular structure structure of three acts, so you have to be able to take a non-standard Hollywood story to see it. Yay for art! 8/10
