One of my wishes is to be a filmmaker, and I just have to say that there is no way to compete with the powerful drama The War at Home. The reason is because the acting is perfect, and when you watch the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. All I can suggest is to see it, I got so involved and it really impressed me. <br /> <br /> Est√©vez and Sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> And so was his Relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes include these 2. <br /> <br /> In addition to the relationship between Sheen and his daughter, Estevez's sister in the film. <br /> <br /> 10/10, and definitely in my top 10. I want the DVD!
