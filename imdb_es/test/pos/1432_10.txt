The director of "The moon is blue", Otto Preminger, tackled even more taboo subjects in his controversial 1955 release "The man with the golden arm". While he had enraged the Motion Picture Association of America with his use of the words "virgin" and "lover" in his smooth 1953 comedy "The Moon Is Blue," Preminger went far beyond what any movie had ever attempted. with "The Man with the Golden Arm" since Dick Powell made his epic law and order "To the ends of the Earth" (1946) on how to thwart the international narcotics trade. Based on Nelson Algren's novel that won the 1950 National Book Award, this 119-minute black-and-white, blank, black-and-white melodrama is about heroin addiction. Initially, when the Preminger movie came out, the Motion Picture Association of America would not issue its seal of approval because the filmmakers showed narcotic addiction. This innovative film qualified as the first major film to handle narcotics from the perspective of the drug demon and, in fact, showed the paraphernalia that drug addicts used to shoot heroin. The Production Code stipulated that filmmakers should refrain from showing characters using illicit narcotics. However, United Artists released this unique photo of Frank Sinatra and raised more than $ 4 million. <br /> <br /> The critical and commercial success of "The Man with the Golden Arm" eviscerated the Production Code. As a result, the MPAA modified the Code so that filmmakers could delve into other taboo subjects, such as drug abuse, abduction, abortion and prostitution. The film received three Oscar nominations. The Oscar nominations went to Sinatra for Best Performance, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silvera for Best Artistic Decoration, Black and White and Elmer Bernstein for Best Music, Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Movie. In fact, Elmer Bernstein made a name for himself with his jazzy score. The producers had thought about choosing Marlon Brando in the main role, but Sinatra gave Brando a good beating. Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang, Darren McGavin and Robert Strauss acted alongside Ole Blue Eyes. McGavin was particularly memorable as a sleazy heroine trader, while Eleanor Parker played the protagonist's wife with a dark and deep secret of his own that surprises. <br /> <br /> "The man with the golden arm" refers to the ability of the protagonist Frankie Machine to manipulate a deck of cards. Frankie hands out letters to Zero Schwiefka (Robert Strauss of "Stalag 17") but has been out of Chicago for the past six months at a federal narcotics hospital that is recovering from heroin addiction. Frankie has not only quit the habit, but has also learned to play the drums and plans to embark on a musical career. Optimistic, since Frank has to do with his future, he faces his past once again when he returns to his old lands. Schwiefka wants him to deal with him again, and Nifty Louie Fomorowski (Darren McGavin of "Counterattack") tries to induce him to resume his heroin use. Meanwhile, Frankie returns home with his handicapped, wheelchair-bound wife, Zosh (Eleanor Parker from "Escape from Fort Bravo"), who manipulates him with guilt. Frankie was drunk when she had a car accident and Zosh ended up in a wheelchair. Frankie appears with high hopes and a battery, but Zosh sees no future for him as a musician and asks him to return to work for Schwiefka. Frankie plans to visit a music promotion and one of his friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang from "My Sister Eileen"), steals a business suit from a department store for Frankie. After Frankie refuses to work for Schwiefka because he goes to see music agent Harry Lane (Will Wright of "The Wild One"), Schwiefka turns Frank and Sparrow into the police. Meanwhile, Schwiefka gets the departmental store of Brach to remove the charges of theft in a store. The suit was worth $ 37.00. Frankie agrees to resume the deal with Schweifka and the scammer rescues him. Not long after, despite her resolve to avoid using heroin, Frankie breaks down and pays Louie the $ 2.00 for a solution. <br /> <br /> Finally, Frankie meets Harry Lane and Lane warns him that he realizes that Frankie is shooting that will have nothing to do with him. What Frankie does not know is that Zosh has regained her ability to walk, but she feels guilty for the accident to cling to him. Zosh is also jealous of her downstairs neighbor, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak of "Picnic"), Frankie's ex-girlfriend, who eats drinks at a nearby bar called Safari Club. When Zosh complains about the headaches that Frankie gives him while practicing with his drummer, Frankie takes them down to Molly's apartment. Schwiefka and Louie are planning a great poker game with Sam Markette (George E. Stone of "Guys and Dolls") and Williams (George Mathews of "Gunfight at the OK Corral"), two great players who have heard of Frank and His legendary 'golden arm'. Schwiefka and Louie persuade a reluctant Frankie to negotiate for $ 250. After an early winning streak, Frankie begins to lose and can not reverse his bad luck. In fact, Frankie spends about two days trying. Exhausted, nerves fired and desperate for a solution, it crumbles on the second day and Markette and Williams catch him cheating. Louie refuses to give a solution to Frankie, so Frankie knocks him out and loots his apartment for the heroine. <br /> <br /> Preminger does not throw punches in "The man with the golden arm" and the film is quite disappointing. None of the characters here is remotely sympathetic. Essentially, they are swindlers or hurried. Sinatra gives another dynamite performance as McGavin and Parker do. Undoubtedly, "The man with the golden arm" has lost much of its impact in the 50 or more years in between, but it is still considered a historical film.
