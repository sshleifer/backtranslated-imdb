Everyone has the right to an opinion. The only critic that counts is yourself. I think this is a great movie. Much better than the original. <br /> <br /> In "Caddyshack", Rodney Dangerfield is funny, but unpleasant. They asked him to do the sequel, but things got in the way. Jackie Mason shows the saying that "less is more." He is fun, but a man with real family problems, a more rounded person. It is not a drama, but a movie that makes you feel. Actually, at some points, you feel bad for Jackie Mason, especially when your daughter leaves him. <br /> <br /> It has a good soundtrack and, in general, a good pardon. A good ending to the series. <br /> <br /> On the TV show "Alf", Alf says he cried in "Terms of Endearment". The wife, Kate Tanner, played by Anne Schedeen, also says she cried in "Caddyshack 2."
