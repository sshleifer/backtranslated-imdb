This is a very modest and charming film, with a great score by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a featured number, We Are The Couple In The Castle, which is totally reminiscent of the period and dates back to the Penthouse Serenade as the opening. The premise (the arrival of Hoppity) could have inspired the opening of Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg (Woody's Coming) at Finian's Rainbow six years later. I totally agree with the posters that have indicated that if the name of Disney had been added to this, it would have already reached the status of "classic" instead of falling into abandonment. It is wonderfully inventive, never more so than when objects barely noticed in the "real" world acquire a much greater meaning, both for and against, in the world of insects. Actually it is a classic, although smaller.
