Hilary was great as Julie, and Pat was again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi, but there should be more references to the other three movies! Well then! First of all, where is Daniel? Miyagi makes a brief mention of him and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and at least he should have appeared in the movie. He could have helped Miyagi to train Julie-San! On the other hand, the music stayed true to the film, with a little more instrumentation (Fretless Bass) to accompany the wonderfully played Pan-Flute. It does not feel like a Karate Kid movie unless you hear that Pan-Flute! Thanks Zamfir! In general, a decent movie though! We miss you Noriyuki!
