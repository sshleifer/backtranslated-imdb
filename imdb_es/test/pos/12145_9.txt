Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is recommended repeatedly whenever I look for a Jean-Pierre Melville movie that I have to give him a watch as soon as possible. Since I've been discovering Melville and apparently working backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to confuse this with one of his films, but it was made in 1960, by Claude Sautet, before Melville came and defended his claim. The French neo-noir. <br /> <br /> Classe Tous Risques has two of the best leading men of the time, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster exiled in Italy with his wife and two children, who want to return to Paris because the police are approaching him. After a big surprise with a big surprise, Abel finally hooks up with Eric Stark (Belmondo) who wants to enter the criminal underworld. Stark becomes Abel's driver and, finally, he is the only friend in an underworld who turns against Abel after everything he has done and has gone through. The film shows the duality of the two men, Major Abel at the end of his time after the tragedy that hits him, and the youngest Eric begins in the same way as Abel, falling in love with a beautiful woman who stays with his man despite the world they are part of. It never ends beautifully for them, or their loved ones. It is one thing to see an individual criminal come to his disappearance, it is different when he has loved ones and he risks taking him with him. <br /> <br /> Like Melville's movie, the seemingly simple story gets more subtly complicated as it goes along. As usual, as I sit with Melville's movies, it left my head spinning ( in a good way) and dying to see her again to pick up what I missed the first time. Classe Tous Risques is a definitive archer.
