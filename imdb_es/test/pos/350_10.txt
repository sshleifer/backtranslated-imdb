Since 1981, Nintendo has created excellent video games such as Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would get a little boring after 20 years. The games made by Nintendo never seem to get bored because they are always adding something new. He went from arcade games to the Wii and I heard that there is a new version of the Wii scheduled for launch in 2011. What makes Wii games so different is the fact that you are really doing something instead of just Sit on the couch pressing buttons. . <br /> <br /> And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be released in 2010.
