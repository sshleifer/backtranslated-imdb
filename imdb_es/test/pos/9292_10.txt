This is exactly what Australian television and Australian politics need, people with a sense of humor! Well on ABC for supporting these guys. The show is based on a couple of Australian dudes who know how to get politicians out of politicians or other people in the spotlight. The children use Sydney as their main base to make a splash in the audience. Look out for questions from the Crazy Wharehouse Guy or Mr Ten. The types that perform these acts are the same as those presented by CNNN. If you enjoyed CNNNN and Glasshouse, you will love this show. I'm still interested in knowing what tricks are real and which ones are acting simply because there are some questionable actions done by the guys ...
