I've seen movies come and go in my years, and when I see a disaster film I'm still waiting for it to not disappoint me. And with this I was not in the least. The story of a whole country sinking in the ocean was a great experience. concept written by sakyo komatsu, a novelist with intense theories about where this land is going. The characters were top notch, and although I'm not Japanese, I did not need a translator to give an idea of ​​how people are in their most desperate state. The needs can be united for the common good. The special effects struck me, I was literally on the edge of my seat observing the tides of lava and terrestrial explosions that must have taken months of work to perfection. As for acting, I thought yes, this is to act in the best way possible, emotions run rampant throughout the film and I cried in the most severe scenes. For moviegoers alike, it is not necessary to speak or understand Japanese to see this movie, you can get the idea and feeling of each person and character to understand it well and follow it. along as if you were there. My congratulations to Shinji Higuchi for directing it, I hope he can get over his work with another amazing experience. Like I said, ... Fantastic movie.
