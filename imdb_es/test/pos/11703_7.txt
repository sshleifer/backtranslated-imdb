I was reluctant to watch this movie before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here. Why? First, because Mick Malloy's humor can (in my humble opinion) be quite coarse and exaggerated, as evidenced by his unfortunate confusion of a television show a few years ago. And secondly, because good Australian comedy films are sadly as rare as the Tassie Tiger. <br /> <br /> Sensibly Mick has restrained his natural comedic exuberance in this surprisingly visible movie. Who would have thought that a bowling club would provide the stage for one of the funniest Australian films in years. The cast is excellent with the old local local users, all with credible performances. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see John Clarke playing the villain in this piece. It's a one-dimensional part, but JC still adds a touch of class, as always. It's good to see that Judith Lucy also gets a Guernsey or should see uniform bowls on the big screen. She is a real talent, pity that some of her replies were expletives. Your own material is much more ingenious. Although the interesting character. Boleros reporter in a local rag. How low in the journalist's food chain can be obtained! <br /> <br /> It's possible that Crackerjack may not be the funniest movie I've seen this year, but it's certainly a nice fun, worth watching. Many other people obviously agree with me because this year will be the highest-grossing Australian movie. It is good to see that someone finally makes a peculiar and smooth comedy without trying to disrupt the laughs like so many Australian "comedies" before. <br /> <br /> Finally, some trivia. If you're wondering what Australian rules team supports Mick, look at the flag on his workstation. Also be aware of your former partner in crime, Tony Martin, who makes the announcement in the final bowls scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
