When I saw L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: "How complicated!" And she's right, of course. When you are used to simple and linear plotting, especially to the schemes of violent hero against thief, L'Appartement is hard to follow. Some of the negative critics here have also missed one or more important points. Other moans about the confused flash backs. Come on! This is not the kind of movie you can go to the bathroom, go back and hook up again in a few seconds. This demands a total concentration and a good eye on the details. So it's really not that hard to find out what's happening and when. The director has left more than enough clues in all the scenes. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film focuses on the question: why did Max and Lisa separate? The film, as my girlfriend commented, begins as a romantic love, suggesting that two lost lovers will meet again. Having experience with French films, I predicted that the story would soon take a sick turn and he was right. At the end of the first part, after many twists and turns, it is clear that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know, that Lisa was gone and why. Lisa did not know why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without a trace when she returned to Paris. The only one who did it was Alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut. <br /> <br /> Once Max and Lisa discovered the truth, the question is: can Alice's manipulations be undone? Well, of course not, time has passed and things have changed. <br /> <br /> Many European films use a storytelling technique that I fully enjoy. There is no disclosure of the basic conflict at the beginning, after which two (or more) stakeholders try to decide for their own benefit. Instead, the viewer is fed gradually with fragments of the plot and barely knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half, Alice seems to be a secondary character; It slowly becomes clear that she is a key figure. <br /> <br /> Acting is simply great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a safe life only to hunt a dream of the past. Monica Belucci is very beautiful, of course, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comic touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, plagued with feelings of guilt and regret. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give him a 10 is the somewhat unsatisfactory end. Of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events, Max is exactly at the point where the movie started, only that it's wiser and sadder. Alicia has paid for her sins. But still the small turns at the airport are a bit artificial. Max easily exchanges Lisa for Alice; Alice too easily decides to reject Max, who has been his dream for so long; Max returns too easily to his fiancee. But, again, I do not know how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I suppose that sometimes artists have to renounce realism for beauty.
