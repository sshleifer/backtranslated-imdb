The actors in this dark film are truly credible and well chosen. The quality of the camera work makes you feel like you are there. The script is intense and does not wander. The plot is one that makes you want to see it a second time from the new perspective obtained by the end. We show this movie to a small group of clients at the Cultural Arts Center in Gadsden. After the movie, the client was always eager to talk about the movie and a person called me the next day to say they were still "bothered". While we put an age restriction of 18 years in the film, I would watch the movie with a group of young people, as it is a very real portrait of an unpleasant situation and sets the stage for a great conversation.
