Has anyone found a way to buy copies of this series yet? I can see that many people have asked, but I can not say if any of them has been successful. It is hard to believe that people today can not see such a good series, especially one based on real problems faced by real people during such tense and exciting times in our country. How can it be true and what can we do to change it? Also, I agree with all the comments that other writers have made about this series on this website. This is an excellent story about events that everyone should know and know something about today. Many of us watched this series when we were in college or around that time anyway. Now we want to share it with our children ... but can not we? If that is true, what would be some good written materials that would convey the same information?
