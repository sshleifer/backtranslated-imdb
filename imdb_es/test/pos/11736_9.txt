I've always loved that boy with a harsh voice in all those westerns. He was the partner (Jingles) in the Wild Bill Hickock show in the fifties. In this you have the perfect vehicle for your wonderful presuming character. He is harmless and nobody believes it, but he is not nervous and continues anyway. When you have a guy like this, there is no challenge because the details are not there to discuss. Of course, in this episode, he is taken aboard a spaceship by a group of aliens who have no sense of humor and believe everything they hear. They do not have the word lie in their vocabularies. It turns out that it is so unbearable that they can not handle it; And then, of course, there is the secret weapon. Watch this just to see Andy.
