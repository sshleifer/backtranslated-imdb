I admit that I've been a Harrison Ford fan for many, many years, so I was not surprised that he enjoyed his performance here. But I also enjoyed the way the story developed and I thought the casting was well done. I do not know if I "buy" with Kristin Scott Thomas as a congresswoman, but she is a good actress and a beautiful woman. I noticed her in the first Mission Impossible. Although his part was small, he stood out on the screen. <br /> <br /> Here she and Ford play people whose spouses died in a plane crash. They are sitting together and this is where the plot takes off. Apparently, Ford, a police detective in Washington DC, discovers that his wife was having an affair. In addition, she discovers that the matter was with the husband of a New England congresswoman. <br /> <br /> History takes on many secondary arguments as Ford and Thomas are drawn to the revelations of their marriages, the discovery of disappointment, and the pure grief and anger at the loss of a loved one. . <br /> <br /> I think the movie is worth renting or catching by cable.
