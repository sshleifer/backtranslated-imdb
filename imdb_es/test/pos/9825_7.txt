I read the other comments here about this movie before seeing it. If you have read them, you will know that almost all of them are negative. I really do not understand that. I admit it's too long (you need a half-hour cut to speed it up a little). The music is usually inappropriate. But, the strong performances of Ford and Thomas are enough to carry this. With all her fame as a movie star, she had forgotten that Harrison Ford can really act! This role as a man who has defined himself based on a lie is remarkable. I think it's completely believable that he wants all the details that he can get so that he can see what was real and what was the deception. Thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception. His initial denial that leads to confusion and then inner calm is tremendous. This movie will never be on anyone's big movie list, but it's not that bad. I'm glad I waited for it in the video, but it's worth the $ 3 or $ 4.
