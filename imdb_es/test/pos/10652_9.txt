The photography and editing of the film is exceptional for the period of time. Eisenstein is based on every scene in the film that leads to the sailor's revolt and the massacre in the city. As much as the film is a high point in the cinema, it is also an example of socialist realism. In 1925, the Soviet government actively used the arts, including film, as a means to spread the message of the revolution. Eisensteins description of the revolt in the battleship Potempkin offers the viewer a vision of the message of the Soviet elite. Marxist theory and the perspectives of the class struggle are shown as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officials who represent the elite of society. Much of the film shows the message of the communist party and how the film was used as a propaganda tool.
