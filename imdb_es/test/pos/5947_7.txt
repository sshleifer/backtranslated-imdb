Fans of the Pink Panther, Naked Gun or Get Smart will enjoy this farce that won a Caesar and was nominated for four more. <br /> <br /> Jean Dujardin is Agent OSS 117, a man who would not know. A clue if he hit his head. It is also a reflection of the colonialist attitude indicative of the West. <br /> <br /> All the Russian spies, Nazis and Muslim radicals around him are just as stupid, but there's Larmina (Bérénice Bejo) and the Princess (Aure Atika) to keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> The strange ability of OSS 117 to learn languages, play musical instruments the first time you take them, and sing like a native are all more impressive than Bond's tricks. , but it's still stupid.
