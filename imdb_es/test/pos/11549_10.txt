I have tried to reconcile why so many negative reviews of this film, while the vast majority of critics are given a rating of between 7 and 10. The reason may be that this movie is somewhat difficult to describe in a positive review, although few have already done it quite well. This film is confusing, depressing and does not have a happy ending. I still gave Pola X a grade of 10, because it's basically for me literature and art combined in a movie. That is really my favorite type of cinema. I've only seen two of Carax's films: this one and Mauvis Sang. As with this movie, I'm being pretentious when I call this one of Carax's best movies, but I am. Carax has a minimalist style. If that kind of movie does not appeal to you and is boring, then it would be better not to see this. But Pola X was less minimalist than Mauvis Sang, so it had a lot of intensity for a thriller, at least for my taste. I found it quite interesting and absorbing. The two main roles did an excellent job acting. (I mean the protagonist and the girl he thought was his half sister). Catherine D. is always excellent, but her role was not very large or significant in the story. But everyone did a good job. I thought the cult material was great. It may not have been very credible, but that is because it is quite abstract. There is a lot between the lines in this movie. This is a very Freudian psycho-thriller.
