Haggard: The Movie is the real-life story of Ryan Dunn, and his girlfriend who cheated on him, also with the help of his two friends, 1. A skateboarder who lives for nothing and 2. An attempt to be fun Scientist (who it really does not work) played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo. <br /> <br /> The movie Haggard The Movie also has many of Jackass's characters, etc., but to say it was written by Bam Margera and company. This is a very weak attempt, it seems to me that it was written when it was boring, or as a project with which they did not pay much attention. <br /> <br /> The films are also the girlfriend of stars Bam, Jennifer Rivell, who plays Glauren, Ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him, again very bad acting of Jennifer, another actor in which some people can to be interested is Steve aka Hellboy, played by RakeYohn, that his character does not seem to be with the story, again acting badly, also this character does not really have many lines in this movie that basically makes it very boring. But worst of all, it's the character of Raab, the voice sounds like a smoker who basically has throat cancer, I also think it could have improved. In general, I think that the characters in this film are not with the story, as in a scene, it would be in a certain character, a minute later, a different scene, a different character. <br /> <br /> To say that, this is supposed to be a movie, a kind of documentary, it's not played by the characters like a documentary, the performance makes you think it's a cheap attempt to make a movie with your free time. <br /> <br /> By the middle of the movie, we began to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn, although a lot of attention is on Bam and Brandon. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is fine, if you laugh at things. That's not very funny, stupid tricks, terrible performances and the occasional nude scene! I also think that there are too many scenes of not talking and only music! 7/10
