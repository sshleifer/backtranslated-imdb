All comments on this film are negative, but I must say that I found "The Net" interesting. Few films can keep me on the edge of my seat, but this one did. Another advantage is that most of the action / suspense movies are full of language, but this one had little desecration. I thought it was a nice movie to watch. However, I am a bit biased, being a big Sandra Bullock fan. *wink*
