I gave this movie my rare 10 stars. <br /> <br /> When I started watching it for the first time and I realized that it would not be a movie with a solid plot, I almost turned it off. I am very happy that I did not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie based on characters, a real story, which revolves mainly around the life of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, beautiful (inside and out) Black woman and how she played the lives of so many in the community of Lackawanna. <br /> <br /> Very interesting not only because of his strong characterizations of Nanny and the people who lived in his pension, but also gives us a look at what life and community were like for African-Americans in the 1950s, before integration, and the positive and negative aspects of segregation and how it affected and ultimately changed the black community. <br /> <br /> In addition to excellent performances For all the members of the cast, there is a good song and dance from that time.
