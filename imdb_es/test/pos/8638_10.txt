With an opening segment that mimics the music and cinematography of Todd Haynes' Safe (1995), David Lynch uses dreams, myths and distorted notions of reality to tell the fractured story of a failed actress and Hollywood waitress, Diane Selwyn, disappointed by fame and her own demons, and obsessed with Camilla Rhodes, who is engaged to director Adam Kesher. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place effectively in the head fueled by Diane's drugs; We are witnesses of his crazy distortions, his desires, his lamentations, his obsessions and his fears. Using the narrative of the dream as a way to present two notions of reality in conflict, Lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy, but actively entangles them. The last 45 minutes are like a dream like what came before; and the problematic air of ambiguous and extravagant ambiguity still pervades, fracturing the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream that we hope to see in movies about nightmares and dreams. <br /> <br /> Lynch's film is inspired by many films, old and new. But, ultimately, it's a movie unlike any other, with the exception of the director's own Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. It constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen, not only intuitively but also intellectually. However, it is not as pretentious as one would have imagined because Lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist despite his murderous deeds, an element that was missing in all his other films, except Straight Story. He does this by presenting the alter ego of Diane's dream, Betty, as a healthy Canadian farmer destined for fame. Lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and denies in equal measure. Are Camilla and Diane really loving or just friends? Who is the blue lady? What does she mean? Who is the lazy guy behind Winkies? What is the meaning of the rotten corpse in Sierra Bonita? Does Aunt Ruth really exist? Is silence an abstraction from hell or perhaps a self-reference to the state of the film as fiction? Lynch is not prepared to answer the questions he poses, but chooses to present his "love story in the city of dreams" as a set of interconnected abstractions and motives. <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent, especially Naomi Watts as Diane Selwyn / Betty, who has yet to eclipse this performance. Laura Harring has the Hayworthesque requirement as Camilla / Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam brings a free arrogance and a paranoid aggression sublimated to his role. It was amazing and a serious injustice that none of them was nominated for an Academy Award. <br /> <br /> This is a film that demands to be seen and analyzed closely. The mystery at the heart of the film remains in Lynch's hands, but half the fun is finding consistent ideas from the labyrinth of seeming inconsistencies it presents. Upon closer inspection, there is a definite sense of a puzzle, perhaps an incomplete puzzle that bothers us with closure, but negates the imaginary fullness of narrative coherence. Ultimately, this is Lynch's key movie.
