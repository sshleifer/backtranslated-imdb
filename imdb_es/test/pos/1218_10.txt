My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival. It was great. Stormy is a strong black woman and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. <br /> <br /> Rene is FINE !!! Seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the price of admission. Can someone send me their contact information? <br /> <br /> My friend thinks Flex is the better of the two. She has been a fan of Flex for years, so it could be a bit biased. The cousins ​​were funny and as small as Nana described them. LOL. <br /> <br /> I hope to see this movie again when it comes to theaters.
