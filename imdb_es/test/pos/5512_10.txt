Dee Snider was inspired to make a two-part song for a horror movie. This film he wrote / directed / produced and starred in detail the themes of those songs (Horror-terria, by TwistedSister / Stay Hungry). People have commented that they must have a sick mind to express something like this. I do not hear anyone commenting like that on Stephen King, Wes Craven, Dean Koontz, or in his time Alfred Hitchcock. The film describes a modern psychotic created by current trends in society. Personally, I thought it was pretty well done out of pure imagination and inspiration, also without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with real victims / criminals. This movie is perfect if you want something that gives you nightmares and makes you tremble about the possible and the probable. COULD OCCUR!!
