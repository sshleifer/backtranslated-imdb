I've always liked the music of Frank Sinatra, and recently I wrote an article about the story of his life. I've been fascinated by the life and legend of Ol 'Blue Eyes. However, I have never seen any of his movies. So I wanted to see if his performance was as good as his singing. Well ... it was! I was impressed by his performance in this movie! He really does a tremendous job as a recuperator of the heroin addict Frankie Machine, who is trying to rebuild his life and audition as a drummer for a local band. <br /> <br /> The address of Otto Preminger is also excellent. I have not seen any of his other movies. I read his biography in the IMDB. He seems one of those directors who was very misunderstood, and people had conflicting thoughts about him. He seems the type of person that most attracts cult enthusiasts. I have not seen enough of his films to know for sure if he's really brilliant, but now I'm curious. I want to see more of his films, because judging by his attempt with "The man with the golden arm", this guy has talent. I also loved the music for this movie. The score definitely contains the kind of music that I will remember if I ever hear it again. That's when you know you have a great score. <br /> <br /> The supporting performances are also good, including Darren McGavin as the local drug dealer, Eleanor Parker as Frankie's wife in a wheelchair and Kim Novak as his mistress. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how the filmmakers handled the issue of drug abuse, unlike modern attempts in films like "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream". In 1955, just mentioning the word "drugs" caused controversy, and if you watch the movie they kept the topic at a very discreet level. There is only one scene in which Frankie actually receives an injection of heroin in his arm, and they showed a close-up of the reaction of his face instead of showing the needle by graphically poking in the veins. But he delivered his message without feeling watery. In a drama as powerful as this one, with powerful acting and direction like this, graphic representations of drug abuse are not needed to keep the audience intrigued. <br /> <br /> "The man with the golden arm" is a dramatic gem that all film fans should know about. It really is an incredible job! <br /> <br /> My score: 8 (out of 10)
