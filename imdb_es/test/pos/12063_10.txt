The war at home is a splendid television series and I do not understand it because it has been canceled. Please fairy something to continue with this very beautiful television series, with excellent and wonderful actors, good recitation and good situations, please, we want the third series and even many new episodes. I beg you !!!! I would like, if possible, to do this and email those interested, as I can tell you that here in Italy this series is very appreciated, as in other European countries, for example, in Spain. In the effects I have written above, what strikes the attention of this television series is the good recitation of the actors and also the honest one with which numerous matters of real importance are dealt with. I think the two best American television series have hit Italian screens in recent years.
