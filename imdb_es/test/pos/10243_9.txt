The plot of The Milkwoman is an unrequited love story that, despite the decades, remains strong. Now 50 years old, Minako Obha (Yuko Tanaka) lives alone and has two jobs? one as a paid employee in a supermarket, the other as a milkmaid, making his daily round in the Nagasaki Hills. One of his stops is at the home of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a government official who serves his terminal wife Yoko (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita used to see each other as schoolchildren, but after the death of Minako's mother and Kaita's father, who apparently had an affair together, their own relationship was destroyed. Lying in her sick bed, Yoko knows, however, that her husband's feelings for the milkmaid have not completely disappeared and, for Kaita's sake, after she died, she tries to devise a means to reunite them . <br /> <Although the story may be simple, the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them is really where the heart and beauty of the film is located. The film takes time to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters, their actions are recorded by an old woman who is writing her story for a book while caring for her own husband who shows signs of dementia. In the process, describe the social circumstances of people of different life forms, how they interact with each other on a daily basis, how relationships are formed and how the past and the present can collide. The director manages this wonderfully with a strong structure and visual style. It is only later in the film that the story begins to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path, as if in fact it were being constructed to fit the narrative structure of the book being written. Everything is validated by the emotional depths that the film touches, represented more effectively in the exceptional performance of Yuko Tanaka.
