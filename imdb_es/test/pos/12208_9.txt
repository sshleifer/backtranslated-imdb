All I can say after watching the DVDs of the first season is that I can not believe that NBC has "given the green light" to this program. It is so different from what is currently in vogue, except for Lost. Those who miss the X-Files can have a worthy successor. It is not as mysterious or intense as Lost, it seems to me that, in general, it is more entertaining. <br /> <br /> This kind of extended story is hard to do. I mean, it could degenerate into a children's dribble if most of the elements do not come together. But they do, and I think the cast is excellent, the quality of the writing, the location and the first class accessories, and the special effects very good for a television budget. Of course he presses what is plausible, but as he does so, he never becomes foolish enough to insult your intelligence. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is a great science fiction drama for the whole family. I doubt it's a classic with a long term like X-Files, but in the meantime, I recommend you get the DVD if you missed it like I did the first time. This fall, my mandatory shows have increased in one more series! <br /> <br /> PS: I just heard that she was removed from NBC ... I hope Sci-Fi picks it up.
