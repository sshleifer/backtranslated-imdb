In general, I love SRK as a villain (how come?) And I think that SRK and Juhi are a perfect combination on the screen, since both are prettier than pretty. <br /> <br /> This movie is great to look at, although it has some important flaws: <br /> <br /> 1) the good boy (Sunny) - not only is he much less attractive than Shahrukh (which in my opinion is very important in Bollyfilms), but its role lacks character: it would be much better if there were a conflict between two strong personalities, instead, we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier. <br /> <br /> 2) The reactions of Kiran and Sunil for Rahul's actions are incredibly foolish and naive even for a Bollywood production. <br /> <br /> But all this is not so important compared to the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere, great songs (really great) ) and (let's say it again) Shahrukh as a villain, just love him when he's so pagal <br /> <br /> A must-see (along with Anjaam, Baazigar and Duplicate)
