The rating of '7' is not necessarily a blur: this film was made with a low budget, but it was made within its limits. <br /> <br /> A habitual plot of a boiler boiler: the ship that transports a prisoner is Destroyed in space, people and prisoners escape in capsules, land on an unknown planet where their presence awakens something. After Mayhem, a lot of ammunition is spent. <br /> <br /> The special effects were sober and done correctly, emphasizing future technology with screens and holographic controls instead of relying on bulky and cheap plastic props. In addition, the rhythm of the story moved without allowing the viewer to sink into boredom, where they begin to separate things. <br /> <br /> I consider this as a little movie on Saturday afternoon. You can get up and hit the refrigerator without pausing and it will still be nice. Even better, your girlfriend can talk all the time without damaging your enjoyment ... and she will be happy: after all, she talked to you! It's that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the real story has few holes after it hits the planet, but hey, this is an action movie from Guns 'n' Ammo. The lines of cohesive history are not necessarily necessary as long as you have beer and chips on hand. So do not get into a brain cramp by the end.
