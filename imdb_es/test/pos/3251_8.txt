I am afraid that I must disagree with Mr. Radcliffe, because although he is right in saying that this is not a comedy, it has many other merits. The plot is a little angry with some parts, but I think everything fits very well, creating a satisfying and enjoyable movie. The last scene was quite abysmal compared to the rest of the movie, but the actual end of the plot some scenes above is very interesting, as it shows what someone will do under stressful circumstances. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to fans of thrillers and action movies, but if you are a fan of gangster movies, as long as you do not expect to expect something as deep as Goodfellas, then you should still find it nice.
