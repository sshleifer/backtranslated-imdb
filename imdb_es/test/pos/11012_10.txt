The first time I saw this movie, I was very impressed by the kind of atmosphere created by the director. It is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in the year 1974. If you watch the movie, you will see many sets and customs that today are called freaky and modern. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is about the old question "What is real and what is illusion?". If you see "The Matrix" you will find many similarities. But the two films are not comparable at all because "Welt am Draht" is art and "The Matrix" is entertainment. If I prefer the first one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I lost my video copy. <br /> <br />
