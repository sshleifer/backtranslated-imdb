As a non-theist, I will not comment on the theory of the great man who changed the world 150 years ago. It is safe to say that science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff said there then. <br /> <br /> The film was produced by the BBC, and to be honest, it could have been easily shown on television. While the performance is excellent, the film itself is not really worthy of a full movie premiere. That said, if you reach a wider audience in this way, so be it. But I've seen many period-style dramas on BBC television and they were quite up to this. Just do not expect too much from a big budget trip when you go to see it. <br /> <br /> In a way, I found that the film almost risks apologizing to religious fundamentalists. Even though it reaches a good feeling of tension throughout the process, I could not prevent it from coming to the publication of The Origin of Species much faster than it actually did (it will wait until the end for that). And he seemed to inhabit a lot more than I ever knew about Darwin's fight with himself and his wife Emma, ​​and he portrayed him almost as crazy crazy sometimes, which is not true. There are also many other errors and facts related to the real story of the publication of Origin, but the whole premise of the film focuses almost exclusively on the difficulty that Darwin faced in the country with the book, and a small part in The Death of his beloved daughter Annie. This gives the film its most touching scene, where Annie dies when she asks one last time to listen to Darwin tell her the story of a captive orangutan who died of pneumonia. However, you are likely to feel a greater connection to the primate in that scene than to Darwin's daughter. <br /> <br /> With the early controversy that apparently surrounds the film in the United States, it will work well to promote it and ensure that many more people will come to see it. But to be honest, there is really very little in it that insults any mythical Goddess. It is hardly a main news about a theory that has been around 150 years after all. But, as fundamental Christians (and many other religions we all know) like to wave a poster or two whenever possible, I think this movie is as good an excuse as any other. Personally, I can not see what all this fuss is about. But maybe they're just playing ...
