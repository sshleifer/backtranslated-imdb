I really enjoyed Carmen, better than the original sin (Angelina Jolie and Antonio Bandaras), who share some thematic similarities and that I also enjoyed a lot. I felt that the performance was stronger here (Paz Vega showed a wider range, has more fire and Sbaraglia was also great). In general, his performance was rougher, more believable (less dreamy than with Original Sin, and both actors here had less 'celebrity status' and 'pretty face' on which to depend to make the film work.) Vega definitely sizzles, as is to be expected. <br /> <br /> Director Vicente Aranda has also built a detailed world (again, better than original sin) that allows him to feel the dirt and daily events of archaic Spain, for example , people who download products from a car, on the street, the workers change the streetlights, all at the bottom of the action. <br /> <br /> Although I sympathize a lot with the recent idea of ​​redeeming our women Fatals (such as Femme Fatale by Brian de Palma), Carmen is a modern and moving show of the classic Black Noise tradition, and it is a pleasure to see her.This is another good example of the triumph of the audacious European cinema on the dazzling and safe food of Hollywood
