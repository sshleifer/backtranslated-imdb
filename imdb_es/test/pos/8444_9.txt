Reporter Kimberly Wells presents the minor side of the news; Pieces of puff pastry that do not have much news merit. While images of alternative energy are being recorded at a nuclear power plant, an accident occurs. Friend and cameraman of Kimberly, Richard Adams illegally films the men who control the incident in the control room. Jack Godell, head of the control room, avoids the reactor disaster. After an investigation into the incident shows that nothing is wrong, Jack can not help but feel that something is not right. Upon discovering that the welding seals on the generator pump are cracked, Jack with Kimberly and Richard try to tell the public and close the insecure plant. <br /> <br /> Almost thirty years ago, the China Syndrome is a rivet. The drama that still has so much relevance today. Nuclear power has always been a hotly debated issue, whether it is the safest source of alternative energy, radioactive waste, and nuclear plants that hope to be the next Chernobyl. It's just not about nuclear power, the China Syndrome explores freedom of expression, press law and big business. On Jack's findings of falsified information, his knowledge stops a massive investment in the construction of another nuclear plant, from which many men seek profit. Kimberly, desperately hoping to come out, sees that the struggle for the truth is more important than driving her career; Pressed constantly by Richard, he never wanted to be silenced by demanding that the public be informed of the accident. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas and Jack Lemmon are simply impeccable. Fonda shows Kimberly as a fragile woman on the outside, but emotionally hard and determined to reveal this cover-up. Douglas brings a strong performance as Richard, fighting for truth and honesty. Lemmon shines mostly like Jack. His performance is a very charged drama. <br /> <br /> The China Syndrome is fascinating, and even today it has a lot of relevance as it did when it was first launched.
