I loved. In fact, I saw it again and again, and I could see it again. This movie does not get boring. <br /> <br /> The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. It is a job well done, excellent for today's generation. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me whenever she wants and with the sexy accent she has. Donal Logue provides a great comic relief. <br /> <br /> This vampire movie is like no other. I can not wait for Blade 2.
