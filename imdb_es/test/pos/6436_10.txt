I remember seeing this movie in 1981, when I was 7 years old. It was absolutely brilliant! I found the DVD just a couple of months ago. I was almost jumping for joy with joy! I bought it and showed it to my children. They also loved him. They asked what words the seahorse was singing (although I did not tell them, because I do not think that saying the words "gay" and "ecstasy" to 6-year-old children is a very good upbringing). The songs are brilliant. I still remember them all. I will still remember them when I am 60 years old! There, or near ones. Tommy Pender is (was) such a brilliant actor. It's a pity I left him. <br /> <br /> If you find the movie, buy it! You'll love it!
