I've seen several films by Yul Brynner, but this is his best performance, as the camera captures his emotions closely as he grunts, smiles and laughs. Brynner could have been similarly arrested in Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot, but none of these films has captured his talent range in close-ups as in this one. It is captivating and seductive to see in every shot. <br /> <br /> Equally fascinating and sexy, without taking off her clothes, is Deborah Kerr. The script allows you to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive. She repeated this type of paper years later in The Night of the Iguana. The film does not suggest that she has slept with anyone to help her free the group from the grasp of the Russians, in fact, she is shown as running away from the Russian commander (in contrast to the story of Maupassant or the story of Isak Denisen). However, the film is replete with an attractive, but real physical appeal, of Kerr's character. <br /> <br /> Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress, but she is an excellent actress. She puts her soul into dignifying the characters she portrays, which often clashes with the spirit of the character. It is this contradiction that makes his roles in The Voyage, Quo Vadis and The Night of the Iguana memorable. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie unusual? In Hollywood it is not easy to see the Russian characters represented as good people: Dr. Zhivago was an exception. The Romance of a Brynner horse thief was once again a great film by Abraham Polonsky, but it was never recognized as such due to the intolerance towards the leftists in the post-McCarthy era. <br /> <br /> The movie is also unusual in its casting. French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee rub shoulders with Jason Robards Jr and British actor Robert Morley. In many ways, the film is international than American. The four are great actors and add to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Those who have read the works of Maupassant and Denisen will find that the film is not faithful to either of the two works. However, the film can stand on its own, since its disinfected version (censored?) Has a dignified charm of its own, provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group. I think that Litvak deserves to have the last laugh by providing an interesting and plausible turn to the stories that led to the making of the film, while weaving fragments of both written stories (for example, the last bus ride and the final kiss) < br /> <br /> But I have one complaint: why does Hollywood never recognize the sources that inspire the stories? Only recently (for example, Insomnia) the original works began to be mentioned prominently in the credits.
