This movie has the appearance of having been organized in a matter of days, like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Despite this, it remains a classic ranking among my favorite creature features. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW ******* Count Dracula and Larry Talbot; Also known as Wolfman, he arrives at Dr. Edelman's lab in search of a cure for his antisocial nocturnal behavior, such as killing people. Meanwhile, kindly, Dr. Edelman discovers the body of the Frankenstein Monster. By obsessing with returning it to life (a common trait among scientists, angry or not), it goes against their good judgment, resulting in monstrous chaos and madness. One of the final universal classics of his time (Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein followed 3 years later), qualifies a 10 with this critic. Onslow Steven steals the program because a good doctor turned bad after being infected by Dracula's blood and becoming a half-wolf / vampire creature, reaching a tragic end. At 1 hour 7 min. It has a good blow. A worthy addition to my video collection. <br /> <br /> Rating: ***** out of *****
