Without going into the details of a good one ... if it's a provocative TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among users that "there is nobody to blame here". <br /> <br /> I disagree. Yes, the young lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes, can be young and horny (and handsome) because he is not getting as much from the mother he wants, that does not mean he can go to bed and have sex with his daughter. Ok, he can use the excuse that he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I do not buy it. People have to take responsibility for their actions. Not only did he "cross the line" when having sex with a very vulnerable adolescent, when he was supposedly "the responsible adult", he said: "Your mother should never know this." How responsible was it then? Yes, it's a good movie, but he received what was coming to him. Do not be fooled, friends, that what happened was "nobody's fault".
