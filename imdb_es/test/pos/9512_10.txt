I do not know what Dick Steel was talking about, but I found that this movie is one of Japan's most exciting epics to date. As for Armageddon or Deep Impact, or for that matter, the day after tomorrow, it is pale in comparison. As far as I know from movies, most of the catastrophes in the movies are, basically, a series of asteroid films or one of them from Global Warming. This as always ran a different course. A course of natural environments where the earth's crust is beginning to erode to such an extent that it will carry with it another piece of land for the trip. What the scientific teams had to do was to create a way to prevent erosion from reaching far and sink Japan completely. In most cases, this would simply be called tectonic displacement of steroids. I found the characters quite attractive in every way, from the girl who lost her mother only to face her own disappearance among unknown friends. Or the rescue girl who does everything she can to save lives in the face of disaster. Or a man who thought he could change his mind to not be such a daring demon and go with him to safety, only to become the hero and save his homeland. And let's not forget, how the rest of the world rejected them all just to be forgotten, causing the world to turn its back on the Japanese citizens who asked for help. This was a great movie in all aspects. What Dick is trying to say is that this movie was not made in Hollywood, that it was made in Japan, that it had characters that rivaled other actors from all over the world, that the effects are very beautiful as it was mentioned, but it's all that he was waiting for. , and nothing more. He lacks the vision of what is important to everyone, and why this film had all the elements of feeling, greatness and humanity. I thought that this movie was of the best quality, and I have seen many disaster films to know that Japan Sinks was possibly one of the most original and best thought projects I have ever witnessed. I really hope that Shinji Higuchi makes another one of those movies. Oh, and by the way, I'm not Japanese, although in many ways I would like to be. I am Canadian, born and raised. And an avid movie enthusiast in all aspects. Prejudicial views are bitter and do not deserve the effort of being recognized as an opinion. Dick, you should see it with the most open heart and mind, not just look for the sweet eyes that make movies happy, let's find what is most important and understand it. They may not be Americans, but the Japanese have hoarded the market lately to get some of the most impressive films that exist to date. That's why spending 25,000,000 is just what the doctor prescribed. You listened well, 25,000,000 to make this movie. Now tell me, was it worth it? Or was it worth it because the American actors were not in it?
