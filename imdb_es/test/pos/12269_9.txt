For me, this wonderful roller coaster of a film brings repeated pleasurable presentations. It is about the tangled life of three very different people. Holly Hunter is the obsessive producer of a workaholic. Albert Brookes plays the unattractive but brilliant journalist. William Hurt is the affable but silly new kid on the block, news anchor. <br /> <br /> The classic love triangle emerges with Brookes' incredibly witty and self-loathing in love with Hunter, but of course she's attracted to Hurt. <br /> <br /> This movie works on many levels. At the very least, it's a brilliant comedy with the flyers so thick and fast that each view brings a new crop that you may have missed the last time. It is also a film about attraction and romance not fulfilled. <br /> <br /> But perhaps most importantly, the film examines the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over the intellect as a valued human attribute. This is personified in the meteoric success of the career of the wounded character in contrast to the relative decline of Brookes. <br /> <br /> Despite being fifteen years old, the film has some relevant initial messages about the values ​​of modern news and the continuous decline of journalistic standards. . <br /> <br /> This film is a classic in every way and it is difficult to understand why it has been neglected so much.
