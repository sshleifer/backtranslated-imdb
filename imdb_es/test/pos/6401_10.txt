We all seem to agree. It was an excellent show and he left to die long before the time came. I have decided that if I really enjoy a show, it is often the kiss of death. I love extravagant ensemble shows, and an excellent stage always helps. I really expected to see many of these stars in other television productions, but apart from Mariska Hagartay, who played the crazy girlfriend of Fisher Stephens, I have not seen many of them, except in occasional cameo roles. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Key West, Northern Exposure, Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars ... all the great shows, all sadly missing before their time. <br /> <br /> Listen to us, loud and clear, we want Key West on DVD ... please.
