Alistair Simms is a wonder in this. She is a good director. The paper given here for George Cole was made for him. Therefore, the casting work in this movie was perfect. I think it was one of those rare occasions when everything clicked. the story was good, the comic dialogue a shout and the elder majors a delight! Every character you're dear to, even the villains. Why can not we make movies like this anymore? Basically, this is a very English comedy with good movement and fluency.
