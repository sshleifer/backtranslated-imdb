A young girl becomes the correspondence friend of a navy officer, and when he visits at the end of the war waiting for someone a little more "available", comic complications occur. Ultimately, everything works well, of course, but not before everyone involved has completely chewed the stage. Errol Flynn's impression of Humphrey Bogart's "Casablanca" is a highlight, as are several posts of his own swagger image (the "jumping" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot). However, it is Tucker who "tucks" the film under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line. He demonstrates the comic style most fully developed twenty years later in "F-Troop" and imparts a vivacity and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays to increase his own performance. Eleanor Parker does a good job as the woman who is being persecuted, and little Patti Brady loves her as Tucker's true friend. A fine and light comedy "back home" in an elegant atmosphere that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining.
