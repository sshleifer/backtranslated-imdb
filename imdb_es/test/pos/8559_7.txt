H.O.T.S. It is not for those who want hardcore porn. Instead, this film is a precursor to many films from the classical cult era of the 1980s, such as REVENGE OF THE NERDS and PORKY'S, and a post-cursor to the world-renowned ANIMAL HOUSE. A good time if you dig a lot of 70s and 80s Playboy girls with big boobs and slapping comedy, but it's not a big deal if you want to use it as a material ... <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. is an "unauthorized" brotherhood of sexy marginalized women who fight against the popular and modern Pi girls. He has jokes, an aunt Jemima-ish, a caretaker of the house, and even an overheated robot that makes it relatively fun if the boobies are your "thing" ... <br /> <br /> Well ... I like tits as much (or probably more ...) as the next guy, but with all the scandal I've seen, I could not help wishing some hardcore scenes so that this really is worth it. I knew it was not going to happen, but I still wish that H.O.T.S. I had a little more sex and a little less cheeze. It's not as remarkable as NERDS, PORKY'S or ANIMAL HOUSE, but it's worth seeing for fans of that kind of movies ... 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS .. and I forgot: this one has a great shower. -rag Danny Bonaduce in probably the best role of his career outside his "reality show" ...
