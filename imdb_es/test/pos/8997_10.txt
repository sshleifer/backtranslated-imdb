This film has made me a fan of rugby and coach Larry Gelwix. The characters in the story slipped and fell before they began to grow as they fought for incredibly strong conflicts. Those were understandable and completely credible. As in life, there were no easy answers to the problems faced by all of them. Magnificent actors and an excellent script gave life to this real story. I wish there were more movies like this one. These days, I see almost exclusively valuable stories that are worthwhile because, in general, they are much more interesting than fiction. In addition, this is inspiring and teaches us not to give up with anyone too quickly.
