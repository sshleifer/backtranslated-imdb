Linda Blair has been acting for forty years, and although she will never escape the part of Regan MacNeil in "The Exorcist," few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such a great effect as "Witchery." She plays Jane Brooks, a pregnant single who travels with her family to an abandoned hotel on an island that her parents want to buy. They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth) and upon arriving on the island they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his girlfriend writer (Leslie Cumming) who are illegally squatting at the hotel while they investigate the legend of a local witch (Hildegard Knef). It seems that a long-time witch hunt resulted in his suicide, and she was pregnant at that time. Unaware of the danger, Jane has recently dreamed of the dramatic death of the witch, and her brother Tommy (Michael Manchester) has been more directly visited by his spooky spirit, dressed in black, whom he calls "the lady in black". The time of the group in the inn of the island begins quite calm; However, unknowingly, the Lady in Black has already dispatched the captain of his hired ship (George Stevens). In a short time, isolation and cold begin to affect everyone, and it is during this period of bad mood and tension that the Lady in Black begins her reign of terror. She plans to take revenge for her own destiny by possessing Jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child. Each of his other victims fulfills one aspect of his vengeful curse: greed, lust and the blood of a virgin. As the sun sets and the sea turns wild, it chases them one by one in horrifying and horrifying ways. The location of the island is indeed terrifying, and the inn is very spooky and is recorded disturbingly. It is a film so colorful that it reminds me of the work of Dario Argento. The lighting is excellent, and the decor is perfectly spooky. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The effects of terror are extreme, terrifying and unforgettable. The cinematography is great, and this is what takes us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this movie shoots him as if it were a horror star: many dramatic shoves, persistent close-ups subtly detailing Jane's incremental possession, and moments that resemble other great horror films. There are hidden tributes to "Rosemary's Baby", "Jacob's Ladder", "The Shining", "Black Sunday" and, of course, "The Exorcist". She does a great job, and absolutely steals the show with her capricious and discreet performance. That does not mean that the rest of the cast disappoints; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and veteran performer Annie Ross is memorable as Jane's evil mother, Rose. Hasselhoff gives the best of himself, but he is not essentially a movie star, and his television character gets in the way of his performance. Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. The film is so violent and spooky (in a good way) that it desperately needs its warmth (Blair also played a mother in "Monster Makers" in 2003, and her mother scenes in that movie have the same tender feeling as them). Finally, Hildegard Knef (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch, and has the most surprising voice and accent. Along with Blair, she was also perfectly cast. But it's Blair's movie until the end. Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability, and this aspect of the film is reminiscent of "Exorcist II: The Heretic". I think "Witchery" is up with "The Exorcist", "Exorcist II", "Hell Night" and "Summer of Fear" as Blair's best genre work to date.
