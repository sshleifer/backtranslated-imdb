Humphrey Bogart in his first leading role seems very young, acts well, but has a pronounced accent that was only hinted later in his career. Even so, he is very good and very attractive as the young and idealist inventor of a new airplane engine. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Mackaill is the real star here, playing a once-rich woman who is torn between her true love for Bogart (also bankrupt) and the comfort and security of marrying an older man ( Hale Hamilton). <br /> <br /> Along with the trip is Astrid Allwyn as Bogart's sister, Bradley Page as her possible producer, Barbara Leonard as the cosmetologist, Jack Kennedy as Gilligan, and Halliwell Hobbes as the faithful (and wise) butler . <br /> <br /> Both Mackaill (who had been a silent movie star) and Bogart were trying to gain a foothold in talkies in 1932. Bogart was an actor who grew slowly from the Broadway stage; Mackaill was slipping and would soon appear in the skid-row production as PICTURE BRIDES. However, both are very good here. Mackaill was not even 30 years old when he appeared in this movie!
