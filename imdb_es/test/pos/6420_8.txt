In a strange experiment, an astronaut is left on the moon while Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a troubled translator living in Italy, wakes up from a nightmare about a moon mission mixed with an old movie that scared her as a child. He also has no memories of the last three days, except for a torn photo of the Garma hotel he finds in his apartment. When she says goodbye to her work, Alice heads to that tourist island to try to reconstruct the mystery ... <br /> <br /> It is often touted as a giallo due to its director (Luigi Bazzoni of the FIFTH CORD) and the presence of Evelyn Stewart, Nicoletta Elmi and Klaus Kinski, FOOTPRINTS is really a psychedelic suspense game of deliberate rhythm with connotations of science fiction. Clearing the distinction between dream, reality, memory and movies, the disturbing story is beautifully photographed by Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro with a thoughtful score by Nicola Piovani. It also combines elements of films as diverse as MACCHE SOLARI by Armando Crispino and DEATH IN VENICE by Lucino Visconti in his representation of alienation, isolation, hallucinations and perhaps madness. Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan, on the screen all the time, makes a cut from her Carol Hammond in Lucio Fulci's A LIZARD IN A WOMAN as Alice, a young woman who gets into a mystery that makes her question her sanity. The locations reflect Alicia's unstable mental state; The island of Garma, out of season, with its Arab influence and its ancient ruins, is a solitary, almost mystical place that is not willing to give up its secrets. Evelyn Stewart has a bit of interest because as interested friend, Nicoletta Elmi and Oscar winner Lila Kedrova are guests of the hotel, Peter McEnery plays a handsome biologist trying to help Bolkan, and the always intense Klaus Kinski is "Blackmann" in the movie -in a movie, "Footprints On The Moon." <br /> <br /> FOOTPRINTS is an elegant case of "Guaranteed 100% Euro-rare" but not for everyone. There is only one murder towards the end, but you will not see it coming when the movie starts to join.
