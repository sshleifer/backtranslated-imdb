Rules of Engagement is one of the best documentaries I've seen. It is well built, superbly assembled, and provides excellent images to back up the claims it assumes. The best quality of the film is that it is not based on sympathizing with the Dividians, but on enlightening the audience in the face of flagrant governmental errors and the lies that surrounded the whole situation. I am left with feelings of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger at the way the government handled and then covered a tragedy of this magnitude. The cover-up is what really left me furious. It is one thing to make a mistake in one operation and admit guilt, but another is to look directly at the Americans and lie to them. I guess I should not be surprised by the story of our beloved country that has witnessed the murder of JFK, the Vietnam War and other important events that smell so bad of a cover-up that you have to hold your nose every time you drive. Washington DC Images of an airplane with special heat detection technology and autopsies on some of the bodies clearly show that the FBI is lying to the public. One of the things I try to keep informed of when I watch a documentary like this is that I usually only get testimonies from one point of view. But again, this is undoubtedly one of the brilliant successes of Rules of Engagement. Present your evidence so conclusively that even if you were presented with FBI statements, how could you really believe them? I remember clearly when the confrontation was taking place in the manner in which the media presented the dividends as this crazed group of cult rebels with David Koresh, the professed car that is reborn from Jesus Christ, as its leader. None of this was really real, but rather a story based on fragments of facts. They simply defended their rights to bear arms and practice their religion as American citizens. If you were ATF and you wanted to search the compound, attacking the building with a unit of men armed with rifles and bulletproof is the way to do it? If you are the FBI, why participate in a psychological war and offer little in a real negotiation to help resolve the situation? Why pour gallons of harmful gas if you want to save children? Why open large holes inside the composite structure when you know the possibility of starting a fire? Why lie about not firing weapons when you can see clearly on video? Unless. Unless you wanted to see the situation end like it did. The scene at the end, when the Star of David flag of the Divided popped the flagpole into the fire and the ATF got up shortly after, it was an emotional climate scene that made my head tremble with disgust and my stomach I will spin without control. The filmmaker William Gazecki deserves one of my highest congratulations. It takes a lot of courage to make a movie like this and I'm sure the government has also had many repercussions. Due to people like him, the truth can be shown to the public instead of garbage that is filtered through a media that presents information that can hardly be considered genuine. When I think about how I felt at that moment towards the Dividians due to the representation of David Koresh's media and how I felt after seeing this movie, it is really amazing. It reminds me of the line in the Bible of a man who was healed by Jesus and the elders were asked how it happened "before I was blind, but now I can see," he told them continuously. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You may have to look for it, but it is really something special.
