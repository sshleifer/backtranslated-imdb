Well, the other critics have practically covered the main points of this little gem, that is, the story began in life as material for the classic and silent "7 possibilities" of Buster Keaton. Comedy, or acting in any genre by far, is simply interpreting a scene and the lines that someone else has written and interpreted previously, if it is not a totally original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially making material that was written and made by another person and, however, for a low budget, short period of time of a movie, they are managing things well. Regardless of what the credits say in their films, the real "braggarts" know that they had many contributions in the lines and the direction. They took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. Words pronounced by Emil Sitka himself during a documentary about children. Here, what seems to be his usual anarchy about something as simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. Each line is perfectly synchronized with a related physical action. How many comedians are there today who can claim such dominance? Obviously, the crew of Seinfeld, but none other I have seen in the last 35 years of watching television. Critics will always "make fun" of The Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others, but again ... who remembers the names of the critics or what they said? Just look, laugh and enjoy!
