Blue banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated generals and unconditional surrender of enemies that required tons and tons of radiation, this was the substance of the victory of the United States in World War II! The celebration in Times Square, as well as anywhere else in the United States, suggests a national zenith. America is up on the right! one thing, a dying and painfully perverse thing ... The adaptation period !! .. The real celebration ended when the champagne bottle was finished ... Now everyone needs to move on with their lives ... although there is only one problem ... they have to get new lives ... the old lives are gone forever ... The polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water. All the characters in the film are past the primary doubts, and can not mask a claim that nothing was really wrong, for the simple reason that it was not true. Once the sergeants, and the generals, and their wives, daughters, sons, and practically all Americans affected by World War II, were exposed to disabilities, nightmares, and recriminations of World War II and what they actually achieved and denied, nobody did it. the same!! For now, social and moral issues had a self-serving interest ... Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start over! Dana Andrews realized that she should never have married Virginia Mayo in the first place! Theresa Wright has painfully realized the fact that she is constructively selfish! The, but not least, the character, Homer, is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as he is, basically in the sense that they can not or do not want to deal with this. . <br /> <br /> The reason why this movie is so fabulous is because the happy ending was achieved in the most difficult way, once everyone recognized the new beginning of the new United States and the new world in general , the tragedy of World War II and the things that were emotionally recognized were recognized. The pieces were taken calmly, and dealt with accordingly! Frederick March and Myrna Loy need to return to chapter one of their marriage. Homer informed his new girlfriend what it takes to marry him (that is, half the time, she will feel like a nurse) and Thresa Wright's participation in Dana Andrews means that her entry into adulthood has been translated into a partial responsibility to break a marriage ... This amounts to learning to drive a car to get your driver's license in Indianapolis 500 ... The characters in the movie are the typical Americans of World War II are stuck by the rude awakening of the coercive changes in their lives ... Happiness can no longer afford the adjective police-aesthetic ... now it is about formidable conditions and a good victory. The evil for the less ugly choice !! ... The Second World War did not just happen !! From now on, the social patterns of American life will dominate! <br /> <br /> The added catastrophe of World War II has reflected the feelings of personal human inadequacy of most Americans as well! I loved this movie and so did AFI Probably for the reason that it brought to light issues that were unjustifiably taboo at the same time! .. In conclusion, watch this movie !! Nightmares about combat, dilemmas about marital unhappiness and / or readjustment, coping with your life when hit by a disability and simply acting like a human being, are constantly portrayed in movies and on television today. BUT NEVERTHELESS! this is 1946 !! Very new for Americans then ... REMEMBER THAT !! Director William Wyler has illustrated how Americans feel about the aftermath of World War II in the days when the film industry left him with a hand tied behind his back. Keep that in mind and you'll probably realize how great this movie was!
