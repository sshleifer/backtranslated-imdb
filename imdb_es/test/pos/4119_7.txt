George Saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of Hamlet, killing a guard in the process. Months later, one of his associates is selling counterfeit books for large sums of money. One of the fakes is sold to a man who works for the Nazis. Not content to have been taken, the Nazi leader insists on recovering his money, at the same time that a researcher appears who works for one of the other scammed clients. The middle-aged woman, in an effort to stay safe, begins to confront each other and organizes a meeting in the New York public library between various parties. However, as people begin to die, the library is closed and there are more murders (and maybe some weird book, robbery, seems to be close to happening.) The mystery of complex murder is a good little thriller with a great cast (Saunders is accompanied by Richard Denning and a cast of solid support players) If there is a flaw, the film is almost too complicated with plots in the plots and everyone almost on their own.The layers of theft, forgery, murder and intrigue in wartime (this was in 1942) are almost too many for the brief execution time of 70 minutes.It is still a nice little movie with a darkness and an inescapable death feeling for some of the characters that clearly mark this as one of the first movie noirs, until Denning appears, we're down among some charming thieves, who we like, maybe even more than the hero, but it's clear in word and fact that this is not going to have a completely happy ending, and they know it, even if they fight it. A good little movie that is worth looking for.
