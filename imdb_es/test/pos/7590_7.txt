This reeler produced by MGM in 1936 shows the talents of two of its young contracted stars, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. In a way, these short films were promotional trailers that presented new talents in front of or behind the camera. Felix Feist directed this, which was a way to promote the two stars with talent to the public. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple. The orchestra that entertains itself in a public park every Sunday does not receive the attention it deserves. Enter two music fans, Judy and Edna, who love to listen to the band led by one of their grandparents. Two of the elders of the city who feel that there is no public for this type of entertainment have decided to cancel their Sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra that will attract a wider audience. <br /> <br /> The two girls embark on a promotional tour on their own doing what they only know, calling and doing errands and helping their neighbors in exchange for a promise that they will attend the park concert next Sunday . Well, that day arrives, and to his surprise, almost nobody arrives when the music begins. The two girls decide to take things by themselves and ask the driver to play a song for them to sing. The result is clear: people from all over the park gather to listen to talented young singers, thus ensuring the existence of the orchestra. <br /> <br /> Of course, the only attraction of the short film is the inspired song of the two stars. That they are wonderful in their interpretation. Ms. Durbin's operatic voice combines well with Mrs. Garland's natural creating a beautiful duo. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it every time it appears on TCM!
