First I must admit that I had some doubts about the director. He has made some films (with Jarkovsky) about the recent history of "Czech = East" or, more precisely, about families (individuals) how they survived some historical moments. But it was always like Chinese food, bittersweet. This movie was totally different. It was pure, it shows the bones of life, it shows the variations of human nature. This movie is an excellent work of art (history, acting, image, music) but it shows you the life around you with a much brighter light that we do not want to see. By the way, I've seen it on a DVD (with English subtitles), but I'm afraid that in the United States I will not be able to get it.
