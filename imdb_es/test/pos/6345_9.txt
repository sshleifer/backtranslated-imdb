Let me start by saying that there is not a bigger fan of the original "lonely dove" than me. Both the Pulitzer Prize-winning book and the imposing miniseries adapted from it are, by themselves, moving, dramatic, credible, and absorbing works. There is no comparison between "Lonesome Dove" and any Western film, at least not since the legendary collaborations of John Ford and John Wayne. I sat down with real reservations to see this new miniseries, with the non-participation of McMurtry and the original cast members that were missing. After seeing the first episode, it became clear that it is not a "Lonely Dove". In almost all measurable forms, this sequel does not reach the original. And that? I did not expect it to be up to par. Taken as an effort of its own, this film is attractive, entertaining and of very good quality. If it were made as a new story, not as a sequel to "Lonesome Dove," there is no doubt in my mind that I would not have received so many negative grades. Jon Voight did a creditable job as Call, Barbara Hershey was a stupendous Clara, and new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well represented and credible. Louis Gossett jr. It deserves a special mention as the horse breeder Isom Pickett. The movie made me worry about the characters, and I do not ask anything more than that of an actor. It is unfortunate that this worthy effort is in the shadow of its predecessor, it is worth seeing in its own right.
