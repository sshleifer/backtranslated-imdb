A review that I have postponed for too long ... <br /> <br /> Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science fiction movies made to date, if not the best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a filmmaker and this is one of his best works. And although it is misinterpreted by many, and underestimated respectively, it is considered one of the best movies of all time and I will have to agree. In 1968, nobody had done something like that before, and nobody has done it since then. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects stay today, it's no wonder why. The movie still looks wonderful after almost forty years! Take note of the CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects that have been applied to celluloid. This aspect alone created almost by itself the chilling emptiness of the spatial atmosphere that is also attributed to music and realistic sound effects. I can not think of another movie where you can not see anything in space, as it is in reality. The absence of sound effects in space is realistic, it is used intelligently as a tool to establish the mood and works perfectly. <br /> <br /> Apart from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors. They play a role in establishing the feeling of the movie. The reproduced music, all classic, complements what the eyes see and makes you feel the meaning of the journey of man through his evolution from the ape to the space traveler. <br /> <br /> The story, although apparently simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and, basically, trigger certain events that are an integral part of the film. What are they? Where do they come from? What do they do? These are all the questions you ask yourself as you watch the story unfold and you are asked to find your own way. While the majority leaves with a general idea of ​​what happened in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Either way, one decides to answer these questions resulting in deep solutions. It is not left entirely to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experiment it for more clarifications. The end result is quite chilling, no matter what your personal solution is. <br /> <br /> Although it is a long film and, sometimes, slower, it has to be to accurately portray the journey of man. It is not a theme that would have adapted well in a shorter film, a faster-paced movie. Those with short attention spans do not need to apply. <br /> <br /> Last, but not least, is the epitome of a relentless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine had such a chilling screen presence. What reminds me, for a film with such deep ambition and execution, is a surprisingly small dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius. <br /> <br /> In short, one of the best movies made to date and one of the best science fiction movies made. A personal favorite. Everyone should watch this movie at least once. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
