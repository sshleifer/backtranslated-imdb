I was wandering through my local library, surfing on VHS tapes, when I saw a movie that left me speechless: Waterbabies. I was hoping to see this movie again, more than 22 years ago I've seen it (cable movie channel between 78 and 79). He had remembered many of the details, especially Grimes. My son, who is 4 years old, and I saw him. <br /> <br /> He agreed with me that Grimes was not "nice", and the best way to describe it is that he did not love Tom. He accepted that. It was amazing that I still remembered some of the songs too! They had stayed in my head for 22 years, which means they had to have a memorable memory, huh? <br /> <br /> It is a good film for children, with guidance from parents in case of questions about what children should do. Going through that were not nobility / society in the time frame. This is what every child faced every day (except for a lucky few), and while trying to make movies with the Disney coat, making them more PC for children these days, does not mean that cruelty did not exist, or even still he does not do it I enjoyed the animation. It was not Disney, no. I do not think Don Bluth touched a brush in this movie. <br /> <br /> However, there are many things in favor. David T plays two roles! (I really like it!) James M too. The waterbabies themselves are cute. You feel sorry for Tom, and encourage him. So, Billie is extraordinary in the multi-role part she plays, it's as if her eyes were Magical! I'm a big fan of WoO, TLW & TW, and the company (AND LOOKING FORWARD TO HP!), And I presented this along with that kind of movie. Yes, he jumps in the water, but not by suicide. He jumped because he trusted the lady in black; He had been showing up all along. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie! If you have children, pick up a rental copy. If you find an affordable copy, let me know where! Ian liked it! :) <br /> <br /> Dee
