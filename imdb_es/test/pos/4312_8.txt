It is a good watch if you have time; deal with three friends who get into an unnecessary fight in a bar and get into serious trouble. They find themselves fighting against some people in the shade, and they can not deal with them. A very, very disturbing description of Japan, the arbitrariness of modern life ... some intense scenes, but a bit like a potboiler <br /> <br /> the spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on the subtitles in English. Obviously, I do not know Japanese. <br /> <br /> the only other Japanese films I have seen were kurosawa, which is different and much higher than this modern genre. so, it really can not be compared. otherwise, it compares better with most Hollywood "box office hits" for the plot of the story and the accumulation. <br /> <br /> taptieg24
