I must be getting older because I was fascinated with this movie from the first time I saw it. I'm seeing it again right now on HBO. It is a very simple movie about 2 people who fall in love after discovering that the spouses had an adventure. The plot is very thin, but the actors performed very well in this movie. In the mix of Kristen Scott Thomas who is running for Congress and Harrison Ford as a police officer in internal affairs, these two meet, in unfortunate circumstances, and fall in love. I love the soundtrack. Perfect adjustment. One thing I can not understand, this movie had a budget of $ 68 million dollars. Was it spent? The plane crash or Harrison Ford's salary?
