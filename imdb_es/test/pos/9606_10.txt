I saw him back in '99 and I remember having loved him. Still today I can remember parts of the movie in my head, like the inclined tone. Unfortunately since '99, now I could never remember the name of this until I was reviewing the filmography of a friend of my uncles and I found this (played Clive Kennard). Immediately after reading the description I knew what it was. After catching up, I was surprised to discover that not only did he not make a video or DVD release, but it has not yet been repeated. This is a massive shame, I beg you, at least, to repeat this excellent movie for TV. Nick Hancock showed in this film that he could do more than present a show with his character Mike Tonker. This is a movie that most football fans would love and even those who are not very interested in the sport could enjoy the comic value of this. Yes, this is a brief review, but there is not much to say, apart from this, it is an undervalued movie, which deserves to be repeated or released on video / DVD, so ITV, me and other fans of this movie we beg you . PLEASE CONSIDER ONE OF THOSE!
