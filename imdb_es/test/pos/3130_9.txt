Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, such as The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a sensation. Of amazement and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a train of Mormon wagons get to California. On the way, they meet a healer whose mules escaped, a group of bank robbers and some Navajos. There is a lot of adventure and excitement along the way, and the film is imbued with fun and beauty. The music is absolutely beautiful. The landscape, once again of Monument Valley, is as beautiful as it ever was. Also, how can you go wrong with James Arness? The Wagonmaster may not be one of John Ford's best-known films, but it's still a must-see if you have the chance. 9/10.
