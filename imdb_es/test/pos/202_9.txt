In Moscow, the young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are deeply in love with each other. With the Second World War, Boris volunteered to join the army and was sent to the front the day before Veronika's birthday, and they did not have the opportunity to say goodbye to each other. While waiting for news of Boris, Veronika is raped by Boris's cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) and they marry each other. However, Veronika does not forget Boris and continues to wait for him. <br /> <br /> "Letyat zhuravli" is an impressive and heartbreaking romance in times of war. The direction is excellent and uses ellipsis throughout history, even in the scene of the capital when Mark violates Veronika. The camera work is amazing, with sophisticated planes and angles and long trips. The scenes of Veronika in the middle of the tanks, or in the train station with many extras are impressive. The magnificent cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the DVD. T. Samojlova has an extremely beautiful face and a poignant and sensitive performance. The speech in the last scene is another great example of a film against the war. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Quando Voam as Cegonhas" ("When the stork flies")
