It's not a bad movie, but it could have been done without the frontal nudity of a 10-year-old child in one of the opening scenes. This movie has an excellent dialogue; What is certainly common among foreign films. Foreign actors still know how to act in opposition to American actors who let CGI, acrobatics and special effects do all the work for them. This movie is just a good performance of old fashion. Gerarde DePardieux did an excellent job as always. The costumes and the landscape are precise over time. My only complaint is that they should have dubbed the English words about French instead of using subtitles; This could be simply because I hate reading the subtitles.
