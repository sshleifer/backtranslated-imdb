George Barry is a genius. "The deathbed: The bed that eats" is a prototype for much of the "sliding" fiction and camp surrealism that is so elegant now. Truly innovative, non-conformist, and simply brilliant. Hyper-strange performance, subtle nightmare environment. I recommend reading the book "Nightmare USA" by Stephen Thrower (there is a chapter dedicated to Barry and "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats"). Available in FAB Press. On a related note, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" and "Beyond Dream's Door" make a perfect double bill. In addition, it is trivial and tired, and ultimately stupidly ironic, to criticize a low-budget cult movie for being "poorly made" or "technically inept." The aesthetics of the B movie is part of the charm of these films. No amount of CGI could duplicate the cumulative effect that "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" has on the viewer with an advanced palate.
