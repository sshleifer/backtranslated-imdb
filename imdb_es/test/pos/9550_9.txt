When Fellini committed to filming 8 1/2 to film, many commented that it was the most personal vision he had found to find his perfect expression. When Dante threw himself into the flames of his eternal passion, many were horrified by the honest brutality of his unrequited feelings towards a younger woman. when onur tukel and a happy band of poorly endowed and ill-equipped filmmakers, from the mecca of cinematic madness, joined during the course of two cold weeks in December 2000, many commented that nothing more sophisticated had been committed. ... much less in the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, for those who doubt it, look at this original piece and discover why the identification is both charming and powerful. And if that does not come, turn it around and rub one ... it's probably time you did it. <br /> <br /> congratulations on a great work of art
