L'Appartement is, I think, a very successful Hitchcock movie. The plot was full of symbolism (ie, white and red roses) and twists of the plot that wrapped perfectly. The look was very Parisian and brought you closer to the story. I saw him in London and I'm very sorry that he is not on video in the United States.
