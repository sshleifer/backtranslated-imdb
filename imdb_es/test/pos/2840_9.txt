This movie could make you cooooo. The movie was worth the dark trip to the city. Betty (Renee Zellweger) is the only fan of "acceptable" soap that exists. Your character is SO charming and SO compelling that you find yourself in forgiveness for your great nonsense. I could even afford to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it were not for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George ... And talk about the devil; "Looker" Greg Kinnear fulfills his role VERY well. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) makes you want his wish to come true, Wesley (Chris Rock) makes you want to tie him to a chair. And Rosa (Tia Texada) takes you back to those bright friends of elementary school. The sheriff encourages him to give him donuts and lose his name. The rest of the cast fits well. Never one to do the same movie twice, Nurse Betty is the exception. One of these long, cold, they need to smile at something from the winter days.
