Even if you do not like documentaries, you are likely to find this fascinating. Not only does it have a well-drawn plot that, although it is easy to follow, contains interesting detours; It also has a very strong emotional resonance, and not one based on a simple specific tone. Instead, the emotions here are as deep and turbulent as the seas that are shown. <br /> <br /> That said, if you do not know anything about Donald Crowhurst and the 1968 boat race around the world ... as was the case for me ... please stop reading and rent / watch this movie <br /> <br /> FOLLOW THE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> My friend Brian recommended this to me at the same time that my aunt had sent me a clip that linked this film with Antonioni's work. In 2007, I was hypnotized by several of Antonioni's films, I'm still! To connect this film to Antonioni, I think it's a bit of an exaggeration, the character most likely to be seen in one of Michaelangelo's films is Francoise Moitessier de Cazalet. It's funny on the main IMDb page, it does not even appear on the list as "The Same", which is probably a function of its extensive name, as opposed to its self-realization / renunciation. As Moitessier leaves the race, it could be considered that she is a bit like Anna in L'Avventura. A very important character. <br /> <br /> Although there are many things to love about this film: the real images of the time, the stoic best friend, the absolute power of the Roaring Forties, I left with a simple connection. A man, truly in the sea. There have been moments in my life where I wonder how I got to such a point, caught between dreams and reality, feeling like a stowaway in my own skin. It may be that I am reading too much in this documentary, and that the directors in turn read too much in Crowhurst, but I found that sense as fascinating as the other secrets kept in this film. <br /> <br /> In the strange possibility that Crowhurst's wife (who seemed a remarkably moderate study with understandably conflicting connotations) and her children (so young in the found material, and still young at this late date in the sense of his pain and pride for his Father), I am sure that the comments here and the film itself do not capture the man who was your father. However, in his death, he has given the world a vision of something like a lost myth, it is a pre-GPS Odysseus. Never finding his body adds to the air of fragile immortality, if not to the stature of a cosmic being he had written. <br /> <br /> This movie stays with you after the visualization, as if you expected another turn. emerge from the deep waters. Or at least, wait for the sequel to Moitessier. <br /> <br /> Thurston Hunger 8/10
