Alfred Hitchcock's remake of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is generally not considered as good as the original, but for me it is one of the best films in history. I prefer "Vertigo" and "Rear window". <br /> <br /> Like "North By Northwest", it is the story of an average man who is reluctantly thrown into the world of international intrigue. James Stewart plays the father of a son who was kidnapped because he was mistaken for an international spy. He will do whatever it takes to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family. <br /> <br /> While the original was good for its time, it is difficult to see by today's standards. The new version has an excellent production quality, a lovely Doris Day and a really creepy villain. <br /> <br /> Do not bother renting this one because you will want to see it again and again.
