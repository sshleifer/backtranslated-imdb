"Lifeforce" is a really strange adaptation of the novel "The Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson, written by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. A joint American-British space exploration team makes an amazing discovery: an alien spacecraft that rests inside the Halleys comet, which contains three entities that look like people, one of them a female beauty (the oh-so-fascinating Mathilda May). <br /> Take these discoveries aboard your own spaceship. Big mistake. <br /> <br /> It turns out that these creatures exhaust the lives of human beings, and like the American colonel Carlsen (an intense, nervous and committed Steve Railsback) and the British S.A.S. Colonel Caine (a solid Peter Firth) observes with horror, an infestation of vampirism surpasses London, with the fate of the Earth in the balance. <br /> <br /> This image certainly does not lack imagination. It moves a little slowly at times, but it offers so many strange and fantastic and visual ideas that make it hard not to have fun. The first of the director's three-film contract Tobe Hoopers with Cannon Films (which followed him with "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" and the remake of "Invaders from Mars"), makes it truly unique. Incorporating elements of science fiction, vampire movies, movies of zombies and sagas of the end of the world, is not like anything I've seen before. <br /> <br /> Railsback and Firth have the backing of such a strong team. British actors such as Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Aubrey Morris and John Hallam. Mathilda May is very memorable as the fascinating and enigmatic villainy; it certainly does not hurt that she performs many of her scenes in the nude. It is also worth noting a touching music from none other than the "Pink Panther" composer Henry Mancini. <br /> <br /> It may be ridiculous, but I also found it fun. It is an extravagant and lively entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
