Quick times are not. But look at this movie, it has a heart. Have a drink and enjoy. It's loaded with a bunch of newly started stars. Sherilyn Fenn has her first accredited cameo on the screen. Chris Penn, Lea Thompson, Eric Stotz, Jenny Wright, Rick Moranis, etc., all look very young. Oh, and if you look closely, the cop's wife is Nancy Wilson, from the rock band Heart.
