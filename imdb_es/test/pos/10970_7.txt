1959 was a milestone in the world of cinema. Several great directors of the classical era released classics that limited their career and were among their best. Just a look at the titles is instructive, North Like Northwest by Hitchcock, Some Like It Hot by Billy Wilder, Rio Bravo by Howard Hawks, Imitation of Life by Douglas Sirk. Add a couple from the previous year, Touch of Evil by Orson Welles, Vertigo by Hitch and Wind through the Everglades by Nick Ray, and you will have a pretty good summary of what was possible within the classic Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> At the same time, two films appeared that suggested a new way of making movies. One was Breathless by Jean-Luc Godard, the other was John Cassavetes Shadows. The two films had certain things in common, largely improvised by no stars, handheld cameras, low budgets and a certain jazzy youthful arrogance. In a way, however, they could not be further apart. Godard was still a believer in the director as referee of style. He knew more about cinema than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was full of the iconography of the classic crime film. Cassavetes, on the other hand, was an actor and a refugee from the underground theater scene in New York. His first film shows him little impressed with the cinema and a great believer in the actors. Godard's film constantly references his own artifice, while Shadows points to a certain kind of naturalism. <br /> <br /> It is not enough, mainly because naturalism is a myth, especially in the cinema. But it feels powerful, kinetic, but like the best jazz in the score, undoubtedly the main inspiration for the cinematographic style that is shown here. Ultimately, it does not hold together, mainly because the actors of Cassavetes here are amateur beatniks, where the Cassavetes style requires strong and imaginative actors. His later work with Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazarra and Peter Falk blows this out of the water. Due to the technical inexperience of the director, some pieces of dialogue had to be redesigned later, which defeats the freshness of the improvisation. It is still fascinating to see, both for the great moments (such as the scene in which Leila Goldoni talks about her disappointment at losing her virginity) and for seeing an innovative artist find her way.
