I was very curious to see the original six-hour miniseries on which the last Steven Soderbergh film was based, and now that I have it, I am pleased to say that one is not better than the other. Both are intelligent, enveloping and extremely entertaining. The only real advantage of the miniseries over the film is that it is three and a half hours longer, so we can learn more about the characters. <br /> <br /> There is not a false note to be had in this production, one for which you should definitely make time for when PBS reissues this miniseries sometime in 2001. You will not regret it.
