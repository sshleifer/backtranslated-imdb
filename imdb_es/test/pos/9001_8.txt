Forever Strong is a type of film that we have seen many times before, only in different types of genres. However, having said that, I really thought it was a great movie, Sean Faris is showing the kind of potential that generally takes the actors to stardom. Apparently, this movie had a limited release, since I did not even know it, but I saw it in the video store and decided to take a chance after I remember enjoying Sean's performance in Never Back Down. I ended up making a big decision, I'm not a fan of rugby, but the movie really is not about rugby, it's about taking a position in your life, challenging yourself, reaching your goals, there is much more than suggested by the simple plot. At first we do not care what happens to Rick, he has his mouth full, he is full of himself and he is completely arrogant, we believe that he has completely sealed his destiny as a problem maker. On the way we see the changes in his character, he starts walking with better people, he begins to improve, we learn how much negative impact his father has had on his life, it's just a big turn and the film had a great impact. The great job of turning Rick from conceited to conceited became a kind-hearted person. <br /> <br /> The action of rugby itself is not so bad, unlike the things I played and saw in high school, it was actually quite fun. Look and beautifully choreographed. A great young cast combined with some veteran experience helped this film immensely, it just did a fabulous job of avoiding what could have been a mill-like career of moving and effective drama. I also liked the conflicting contrast between The Coach | Garry Cole | and Rick | Sean Faris |, it became a very interesting story, and I loved seeing him help Rick along the way, it was moving and touching at the same time. This is a true hidden gem that I'm really glad to have discovered that made me think about my life and many times I need something like that. <br /> <br /> The Performances. Sean Faris stands out as Rick Penning. It reminded me a lot of a young Tom Cruise arrogant but very charismatic and talented. It was a difficult role to go from being a hot teenager to a good-hearted young man, but Sean achieved it with pure perfection. He clearly put his heart and soul into this movie, so great congratulations to Sean for putting so much effort into this great movie. Gary Cole is excellent as the preacher but nice coach who wants to help children. I have always found him pleasant, he always has a kind of presence that leads to his films. Neal McDonough is fantastic as Rick's selfish and depressed father. For most of the film, the script makes you believe that he is just a selfish and bitter man who wants Rick to be exactly like him, but in the end you start to see how the real man comes out. I felt sorry for him. little bit. Julie Warner is a good character actress and plays good-hearted mother, but with no idea. Penn Badgley is required to play a real jerk, and boy, do you ever do it right? On numerous occasions I wanted to beat him up, so I must say it's a great performance. Arielle Kebbel is the love interest, not a big part, she did it well. Nathan West plays a somewhat mysterious character, he did quite well. Sean Astin is considered an important player for the film, but he barely does anything, he did well with what he had to do. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: Forever Strong is a movie that feels great. I will definitely stop you and think how your life was much better than you thought. Do not let it escape, you will not regret it. <br /> <br /> 8 1/2/10
