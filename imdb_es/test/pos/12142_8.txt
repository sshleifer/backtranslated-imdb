I've only seen about half a dozen movies starring Lino Ventura, but this one looks a lot like the others. Play a laconic criminal, one who does not have many words and who is moderate but occasionally explosive. Given his quiet personality in films like ARMY OF SHADOWS and SECOND BREATH, I've noticed that his minimalist acting style is extremely effective. In other words, because he is so calm and polite, when he does bad things, one tends to realize. And, like these other films, it also has a very strong moral code, although twisted. <br /> <br /> Abel Davos (Ventura) and his partner, Lilane, both live in Italy and are career criminals. Both grew up in France and finally had to flee because of their criminal activities. Now in Italy, when the movie starts, they continue to live the life of the thugs and the heat is about to catch them. Interestingly, instead of running to a third country, they decide to return to France, even if Davos has been tried and sentenced in absentia, and if captured they can mean a life in prison or the death penalty. Much of the first third of the film refers to his covert return. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Davos, the return is not perfect and now it seems as if all the policemen in France were looking for him. In addition, the reaction of his old compatriots in crime is not at all what he would expect. In fact, his lukewarm response upon his return ends up unleashing a series of terrible events towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> On the way, Davos meets and is captured in me by a stranger, Eric Stark (Jean -Paul Belmondo). Although Davos apparently has no friends, Stark and his friend do everything possible to make his return successful. However, what is it that puts another wrench in this, are the two very small children of Davos? What should Davos do with them, keep them with him in his hiding place? <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very good crime movie, something like French Film Noir. Unlike American Noir, the many French versions I've seen have a more realistic and grim perspective. Fatalism reigns supreme, that's for sure! The performance is first class (especially from Ventura and Belmondo), the address is very safe and the writing is very good, although I am sure that many will not like the end. It just seems to be stuck, like a late occurrence. I understood why they did it this way, but I can also see how I could leave many dissatisfied. As for me, it left me a little flat. Otherwise, an exceptional movie.
