This movie is my favorite comedy of all time and I have seen many comedies. First of all, should not this movie had no script. Only a storyboard The dialogue is almost completely written by the actors. What makes this movie absolutely hsyterical. The cast is one of the best sets of comedies you've ever seen. The story is about the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia and some of the participants in them. Parker Posey shines and is absolutely great. This is one of the films that more Laughter comes from the absolute pathetic of the characters. ***** / *****
