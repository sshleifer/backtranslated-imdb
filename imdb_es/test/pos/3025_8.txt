"The Cell" is a very difficult movie to classify. If you read the scheme of the plot, "a psychotherapist travels inside a comatose serial killer with the hope of saving his last victim", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that really does not do justice to this movie. There is an aspect of fantasy within the subconscious minds that is impressive, with luxurious visuals and incredible scenarios of mental shooting. There is a drama when the psychotherapist mentioned above (played by Lopez before he becomes a component of romantic comedy only) establishes contact with the child and witnesses his frightening education. And there is definitely a facet of horror due to the unhealthy actions of the evil person of the serial killer. The film tries to work on many different levels and crosses the boundaries of the genre at will. While I think it ends up being a rather strange experience, I think it's completely fascinating. <br /> <br /> From the first credits, when Lopez rides a horse across the desert incredibly dressed in a white dress, you will know that you are in a visual treatment. Each time the audience leaves reality and follows it to the subconscious depths of their "patients", they are guaranteed a feast of visual and auditory delight. The costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colors. The camera leaves regularities at the door and goes through a world where up and down are equal. The characters become rulers of their own domains and transform themselves into creatures worthy of such stature. If you do not like anything else about "The Cell", you will surely be impressed by the work done in these scenes. <br /> <br /> The casting is also first class. Jennifer Lopez is in her element here, using her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensitivity, while combining her own eye-catching looks with the lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and I personally wish that someone find another role for her outside of the rom-com world in which she has been typecast and that allows her to experience more. Vince Vaughn is quite convincing as an FBI agent who will do anything to save the life of a young woman. But it is undoubtedly Vincent D'Onofrio who has the greatest impression here. It is an extremely difficult role since it is required to show multiple emotions within the viewer. We are disgusted by his actions, but we sympathize with him because of the trauma he has experienced during his life. He looks magnificently powerful within his realm, but at the same time insecure and vulnerable within the real world. It's a great performance by an underrated actor. <br /> <br /> Although "The Cell" does not work as well on all levels that it tries ambitiously (some of the actions of the characters are not credible) and while doing it all based on a rather weak scientific logic, it is an occasional stunning and visually stunning journey that rewards multiple visions.
