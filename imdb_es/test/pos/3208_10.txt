Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, smartest, treble, sarcastic and poignant television shows I've ever seen (surpassed only by my favorite television show of all time, F * R * I * E * N * D * S). The fast pace and many pop culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you take over the Gilmores' paths, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, recently (finally) I started watching season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far. I love Luke-Lorelai and all the drama in the various episodes is (as always) exciting. The only thing I do not like is the surprising bad attitude and reckless actions that Rory has suddenly "adopted." Unfortunately, I do not find this very realistic and I hope it is not just a way to create more drama to keep the season strong. However, in general, it's a great season and I can not wait for the next one !!! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashly a.k.a. "Tookie Clothespin"
