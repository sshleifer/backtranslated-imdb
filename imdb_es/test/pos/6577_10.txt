A moving documentary that puts a human face on the 9/11 tragedy by showing how a small community came together to honor two high school friends lost on that day. The film weaves the lives of Chris and Tom through interviews with family and friends and fragments of old photos. Through its reminiscences we glimpse two lives tragically cut. The film also documents how, through a series of coincidences, an inspiring memorial garden was created thanks to the efforts of many people, known and unknown to the two victims. Through laughter and tears (and sweat) we see the power of hope and honor and love. This film evokes many different emotions, but the final feeling is one of admiration for the human spirit undaunted by the tragedy.
