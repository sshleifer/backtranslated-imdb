If you are among the IMDB audience that places High Fidelity in the top 200 of all time, then this movie is probably NOT for you. This movie is as unique as Steve Frears is aware of himself. Renee Zellweger is an excellent urban magazine writer who returns to her suburban nest in Bucks County to take care of Mother Streep (who offers another Hall of Fame performance). William Hurt is the ideal cast and the irresponsible, infidel and selfish husband. If this movie does not make you cry and laugh, then you are too modern to enjoy it.
