"Just Before Dawn" by Jeff Lieberman is definitely one of the most underestimated horror movies ever made. The film, although somewhat influenced by "Deliverance" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre," is extremely spooky and memorable. The suspense almost never fades and the atmosphere is genuinely disturbing. The cast is excellent, Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are great female protagonists. The consanguineous twins are really frightening and ruthless killers. The movie is beautifully shot; Actually, it was filmed at the Silver Falls Park place in Oregon. There is very little blood, but a murder, when Verchel is stabbed in the groin, is quite unpleasant and unpleasant. A must for fans of slasher.10 out of 10, what else?
