In the "errors" section of this movie there is a comment that there is a continuity error in which it is seen that Auguste's car is parked in a different place than that seen in a previous shot in the same scene . This is incorrect. One of the views is from Auguste's apartment, the other from Valentiné's apartment across the street. The purpose of this segment is to show how Valentiné and Auguste, who can be made for each other, almost cross (as it happens several times more) but never do, until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the movie. (And here is the implication that Joseph has manipulated things so that Auguste is on that ferry, after having inspected Valentiné's ticket to see what navigation is reserved).
