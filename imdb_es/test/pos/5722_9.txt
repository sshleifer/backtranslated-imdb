Definitely not a film to revolutionize the industry or introduce new techniques of film creation, this is a very attractive and solid production. It is miraculous that today we can enjoy it in excellent quality on DVD. Probably, the majority of the spectators 100 years ago saw a black and white copy, since the luxury edition in stencil tinted de Luxe was only available in the best theaters. Even if you do not love this movie or the theme of it, you can not stop admiring the copy published by Image Entertainment (along with another jewel, From the Manger To the Cross, 1912). It is virtually impossible to see a movie that is more than a century old but shows so little damage. The process of coloring the template was very effective and, compared to the blurry and sometimes blurred images of hand-colored films, the colors are sharp and well defined. Filmed within the limitations of filmmaking as it was known in 1902 when filming began, the static nature of the scenes can now be considered almost intentional, meditative and solemn. The paintings continue to move in a constant paste, so the film never becomes tedious. It is possible that this film does not fascinate him as a work of cinematography, but it is a work of academic and picturesque art. If you are a religious person, the fact that you are watching anonymously, long ago people who have left and who play for a long time, adds to the mystery in a significant way. An appropriate visit for Christmas or Lent. <br /> <br /> P.S: I have checked the box "contains spoilers" just for fun. As you can see, I have not revealed the end.
