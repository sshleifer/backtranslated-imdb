My mother and I went to the premiere of Ft Worth mainly to see George Strait, but ended up having the opportunity to see the premiere of the movie in Bass Hall. What a wonderful and beautiful film that not only shows the beautiful landscape of Texas, but also has a great story to feel good. It was well written, directed and produced and my mother and I loved it from beginning to end. Thank you, Jay, for giving us the opportunity to be part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was a night we will never forget. As if watching the movie was not enough, we were also lucky to be seated 4 rows in front of my favorite singer, George Strait. Thank you thank you thank you!! Keep up the excellent work and again, thank you! <br /> <br /> Debbie McClendon & Maureen Daugherty Ft. Worth, TX
