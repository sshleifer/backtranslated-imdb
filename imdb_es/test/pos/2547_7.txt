Some critics have compared Chop Shop with the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote. I have seen both, as well as Chop Shop and, as in many cases, I do not think the comparison is justified. City of God and Pixote surely had a much higher budget. Chop Shop is an independent low-budget film about survival and hope, disillusionment and continuing with life. One of the scenes was supposedly filmed during the US Open and the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the US open video was added. UU I say this because I live in the area where this film was filmed and security is crazy while tennis matches are in progress. It is also worth noting that the real names of the actors were the names of their characters in the film. Return to the movie It's a nice story about survival. However, he ended up getting a 7 because ... sometimes the actors acted extremely well. At other times, they seemed to be simply reciting their lines. If the actors were less competent (for example, in the budget under "The Big Dis"), it would have been more lenient. But in several scenes each and every one of these actors gave exemplary performances. At other times, they seemed bored. The director could be at fault here. I also had problems with the end. This is one of those movies that "just finished". Maybe there will be a part 2? Definitely worth it to get on DVD. I will not bother to summarize the story because that information is already available in IMDb.
