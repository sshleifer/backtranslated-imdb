Hey look, you do not see this movie to change your life! But you're a woman especially and you've always had something for Richard Gere; This movie is on your street Diane Lane and Richard Gere have in the chemistry of the screen for a long time. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not an Oscar-winning movie and will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later, but if you want an atmospheric and beautifully recorded love story between good-looking MIDDLE AGES (they do not turn your stomach and even when Gere is 'on top', does not seem too perverted), then this is the movie for you. I loved the theme of the story and it was quite relevant in many ways. Of course, everything was presented superficially, it was overlooked and it was not really addressed ... I mean, I would have liked to know more about the father / son relationship between Gere and James Franco, but the story was really about the idea that a great love can CHANGE you for the better; if he is a lover, a child, a friend, etc. The theme of the film is about love and its mysterious forms. I was a little surprised that James Franco took such a small part in this movie, but it's always good, even for a few minutes on the screen. I really liked this movie because it was moving and sweet.
