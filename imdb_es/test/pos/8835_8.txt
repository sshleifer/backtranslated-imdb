The history of TV to the adaptations of the film is full of aberrations that demonstrate almost conclusively that the tradition should never have begun in the first place. There are, however, some examples that manage to achieve it, alone. Rising Damp would seem, at first, to be the last sitcom suitable for the big screen treatment, since this hilarious series was based on the tiny confines of a northern room. In addition, the writer, Eric Chappell, was not paid enough to devote time to the development of a completely original script, so he garnered a series of television episodes and joined them to form the body of the film. This, in itself, did not necessarily mean that the script would fail. David Croft and Jimmy Perry did the same with their script for Dad's Army and it worked perfectly. Although, the first episodes of the Army of Dad, with its great rhythm and its plot of arcs, they lent much better for the adaptation to the cinema. The episodes of Rising Damp, however, were high energy issues from the first scene to the breathless climax. As a result, when one story ends and another begins, the scenes within the film become disconnected. Another pitfall for the film version of a television series are the inevitable comparisons that are made. In this sense, the film pales in comparison to the brilliant Rising Damp series. Despite all this, Rising Damp the Movie manages to be entertaining and occasionally outrageous. It is perhaps not surprising that the best moments occur during the sequences written especially for the film. This includes a rugby match in which Rossiter makes a brilliant forehand. In fact, while all the members of the cast manage their roles perfectly (excluding a lower level substitute actor for the deceased and really great Beckinsale), it is Leonard Rossiter as Rigsby who shines the brightest. In fact, Rising Damp should have been made like a movie so that Rossiter could be eligible for an Oscar, such is the magnificence of his talent as an actor. Criminally, he was not even nominated. Ultimately, the film fails to match the vertiginous heights of the television series while remaining a comedy in itself with some beautifully played moments. Recommended viewing <br /> <br /> One last thing: the opening and closing of music is by far the worst in the history of cinema.
