Like a modern Marco Polo, from Venice to China, here we meet Amelio, again, assuming the task of becoming the gray area in the middle of two worlds in solid colors. Eroded by the collateral damage of globalization, the pessimistic view of Europe is mutual with the Chinas. <br /> <br /> The view of that charming but disconcerting country is treated from below, without any claim to learn or impose opinions. Reality, however, is hard. The abandoned and exploited children, the homes of the hives, the backward areas is the OTHER Chinese that we ignore. Vincenzo (Castellitto), a technician of a steel factory, is one of us. Your trip to China is a pretext to understand, to learn from within a country where progress and problems of the third world live together in an infamous balance. It is not clear if Vincenzo knew for the first time that the mechanical component was already fixed, I think so; Anyway, it's a minor aspect. Liu, the Chinese girl, is the key to the whole movie. She has many difficulties in her back, she has the strength to overcome, but how could she fight with little money and little help? <br /> <br /> The realistic and impartial vision of the facts by the girl, rejecting Vincenzo's money, moved me a lot. A packet of tickets can not recover her husband, her baby (forced to be treated as a stranger by the Law), protects her with contempt. Liu knew that his intentions were benign and friendly, far from being an act of cold charity. Your friendship is beautifully narrated, the way it grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. A legacy that has no price to keep. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are impressive, either by the performance (Vincenzo crying on the ferry) or by the dialogues (in the restaurant, on the railways). In addition to a careless editing and a rather lazy start, "La Stella che non c'Ã¨" is brilliant and clear only because it tells the untold truths. <br /> <br /> In the competition at the 63rd Venice Film Festival, I bet on Tai Ling for the Mastroianni Prize, dedicated to emerging stars. She definitely deserved that award. <br /> <br /> [8/10]
