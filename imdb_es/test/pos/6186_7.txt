Years before pre-nuptial agreements became common, Ernest Lubitsch made a film comedy in which they are the base. Bluebeard's Eighth wife involves Gary Cooper as a multi-millionaire living on the French Riviera, who has been married seven times and now marries Claudette Colbert for number eight. But Cooper is a good sport in this regard, always satisfied with his ex-wives for $ 50,000.00 a year according to an agreement they sign before marrying him. It sounds like what we now call a pre-nuptial agreement. <br /> <br /> Of course, Claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels that Cooper adopts a totally commercial approach to marriage. She would like the real deal and is willing to make a considerable effort to achieve it. <br /> <br /> Bluebeard's Eighth Wife has some really fun moments, the original meeting of Cooper and Colbert in a men's store where Cooper is. insisting that he only wants pajamas tops and Colbert looking for just pants. And, of course, my favorite is Colbert who follows and blackmails the detective Cooper sends to spy on her. Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the film as that same detective, nervous. <br /> <br /> I often wonder how in the days when Hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are not French. A movie like this. Of course, Cooper is an American and Colbert, of the cast, is the only one of French origin. Although David Niven is charming as always, to have him as a Frenchman is ridiculous, he is incredibly British. <br /> <br /> However, Bluebeard's Eighth Wife is a nice movie and a great example of what was called 'the touch of Lubitsch' in my times.
