I loved this movie, the best independent cinema. The cinematography, the rhythm, the rhythm and the performance were perfectly synchronized. The best work of Fred Carpenters to date! The movie is well written with many twists of the plot that take you to a great ending. It moves well and keeps you involved. Being a photographer, I was very impressed by the cinematography. The lighting creates an atmosphere and beauty that is usually found in a much larger budget movie. This gave the actors a great canvas to begin with, to work their magic. And that is just what they did! Great performances by all the actors and each one was well embedded in their roles. As I said at the beginning, it's a wonderful movie and one of Fred Carpenter's best movies. You will love it.
