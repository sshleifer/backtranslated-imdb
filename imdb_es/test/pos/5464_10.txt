Captivating story of stabbing behind the curtains. The film follows the difficult situation of David Letterman and Jay Leno as they fight for the difficult place of Tonight Show. Letterman led by his desire for the coveted space of time and Leno led by his agent and the little demon on the shoulder, Helen Kushnick. <br /> <br /> Kathy Bates (Kushnick) is excellent in this film, alienating herself from the best dogs like Bob Wright, Warren Littlefield and Howard Stringer. Towards the end of the film, you are so fascinated with the way you handle each situation, from guest reservations to deferred recording, that you lack more. <br /> <br /> John Michael Higgins (Letterman) does his part up to the tee. Sometimes I wondered if he had any connection with the real Letterman. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or in the world of corporate negotiations.
