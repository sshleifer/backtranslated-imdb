As is the case with many films of this kind, my non-Catholicism prevented me from understanding it. The church has this mass of rules that have been gathered for centuries. We have little time to learn them and we have to accept them at face value. Then, throw some bad guys to take revenge for a very far act against them, work according to these rules and try to outwit them, and you will have this book and this movie. I found myself thinking: "That's very good, why did they do that?" There is something casual in the character of Robert Langdon where, no matter what the problem, it seems that he always makes the first correct move. I guess it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the disposition of the earth. In this movie, there is a lot of land and very little time to really understand everything that is happening. But if you believe Robert Langdon, you must put him to work. That's fine because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever. I thought the movie was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think. This is a wonder to look at and it never stops for a second.
