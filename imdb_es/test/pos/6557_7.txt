A couple of weeks after watching this movie, he began to remind me of John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness (not for the story!) For the atmosphere, the quick surprise elements and the dream sequences. On the other hand, this film mixes the image and the music very well (note chapter 4 in the film)
