"The next Karate Kid" is an excellent movie full of adventures and new surprises. It has a wonderful and moral plot that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job to achieve the role of Julie. I have seen the actor who plays Mr. Miagee and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. The movie is fun and charming, and I can not emphasize enough about how interesting the movie is. I will definitely go to this movie for 10 out of 10. I suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie.
