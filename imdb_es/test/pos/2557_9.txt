Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), called Ale, for short, works in a car body repair shop in what is known as the Iron Triangle, a stretch of twenty blocks of scrap yards of cars and sleazy car repair dealers near of the Shea Stadium. Queens, New York. Here customers do not question whether the pieces come from stolen cars or why they can receive such large discounts, simply deposit their money and hope that everything is up. Sordid outsides like these do not stand out in the tourist guides, but the Iranian-American director, Ramin Bahrani, shows them live in Chop Shop, a powerful independent film that received a lot of love last year in Cannes, Berlin and Toronto. As a follow-up to his acclaimed "Man Push Cart," Bahrani spent a year and a half at the place that F. Scott Fitzgerald described as in the Great Gatsby as "the valley of the ashes." <br /> <br /> Despite its description of desolation, Chop Shop is not a work of social criticism, but, like Pixote, by Hector Babenco, a moving study of character in which the survival of a child is bought at the price of his innocence. Shot on location at Willets Point in Queens, Bahrani makes you feel like you're there, sweating in a hot, humid New York summer with all its noise and chaos. The focus of the film is on the charming, 12-year-old, street-ready Ale, who lives on the edge without any support or supervision from an adult (Rob Sowulski), the real-life owner of the Iron Garage. Triangle. Polanco's performance is raw and slightly irregular, but he won the standing ovation he received at the premiere of the film in Cannes, along with a hug from the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami. <br /> <br /> Huddled in a small room next to the garage. With his sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales), 16, who works in the food distribution of a van, Ale is like one of the interchangeable spare parts he deals with. While he dreams of having his own food service van, in the city that never sleeps, he knows that the only thing that can make "the top of the pile" is another dented fender. In this environment, Ale and Isi use all the necessary means to keep their heads out of the water, while their mutual love remains constant and they still laugh and represent the childhood that was never theirs. As Barack Obama says in his book "Dreams of my father," the change may occur later when his eyes stop laughing and have closed something inside. Meanwhile, Ale complements his profits selling chocolates in the New York subway with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata) and pushing pirate DVDs in the corners, while Isi makes tricks so that the truckers save enough money to buy the rusty Van de $ 4500 in which they hope to start their own business. <br /> <br /> Although Ale is a "good boy", he is not above stealing purses and hubcaps in the parking lot of Shea Stadium, events that the Bahrani camera observes without trial. In Chop Shop, Bahrani has provided a A convincing antidote to the success stories of the unearned Hollywood dream factory, and it has given us a film of amazing naturalism and respect for its characters, similar in many ways to the great Italian neo-realist films. and the recent Iranian works of Kiarostami, Panahi and others. While the result of the characters is far from certain, Bahrani makes sure that we see a giant poster at Shea Stadium that says "Make dreams come true", leaving us with the clue that, according to Rumi's phrase , "the drum of the realization of that promise is beating"
