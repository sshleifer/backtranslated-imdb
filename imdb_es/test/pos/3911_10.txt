I really liked that movie !! I've been waiting for this movie to come out so I can see it. I saw it on the opening night and I loved it. Some people told me that this movie was not good and that it stayed away, but I thought it was great. The actors did it very well and I was scared and they made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everyone is having a hard time when she did very well and did not even have such an important role. The set was great, it's made of wax and how it was made. The two brothers did a great job and the sense of death was excellent. The murderers were very afraid and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them. I can not wait until this movie comes to Video to be able to watch it again and again. The general view of my review is to see this movie if you like Hororr's films and you will not regret it. I really liked that movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10 ROCKS IT !!!
