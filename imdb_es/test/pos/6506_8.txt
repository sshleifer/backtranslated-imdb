Being a big fan of hip-hop and turntablism, I always knew that I would like this movie. However, I was not prepared for how good the documentary really is. It covers almost all the important aspects of the one element of hip-hop that has been there since the beginning. The "history" begins at the beginning of the decade of the 70 and follows the evolution of the turntablism like an art from principles of 2000 (the fans to the turntablismo will indicate it like significant). <br /> <br /> The editing is almost perfect throughout the movie. Apart from the excellent "scratch" visual techniques they used, the quick cut between the interviews and the footage is excellent, which gives the rhythm of the movie when necessary. The sound editing is also very good, with some nice sweeping sounds that are used to help with the transitions. <br /> <br /> The absence of a narrator was also welcome. We do not hold hands through history and, as a result, the public can make their own assumptions easier. Each DJ adds another side to the story, and it is very interesting to hear about the unknown stars of hip-hop, especially those who were there when hip-hop was being rejected to the left, to the right and to the center by the music business. <Br /> <br /> Although there are many excellent things about this movie, I have some complaints. The biggest of these is the absence of several notable DJs, such as Ca $ hMoney and Jazzy Jeff, and also DJs from outside the United States, such as Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. However, if you see the comment on the DVD (something I highly recommend), the producer and director explain in detail how they regret not being able to present them. The deleted scenes contain many interviews with Ca $ hMoney, Jazzy Jeff and Scratch Perverts. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best documentary I've seen about hip-hop culture and music. It does not stop showing the true potential of the tornablismo; for that I highly recommend reviewing the DMC and ITF videos. However, that is a small objection. I highly recommend this movie, among other things for the fantastic soundtrack, with excellent music everywhere. (9/10)
