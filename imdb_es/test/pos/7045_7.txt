The quintessential "let's prepare for the summer movie". It's silly, silly, and maybe a bit old-fashioned, but my kids saw it and laughed as hard as I did when I first saw it. In the style of all the films of "small boys in front of the establishment", so yes, the plot is very predictable, but it is warm and fun. And no, it's not Bill Murray in his Bill Murrayest, but it's starting to get longer in what was his first leading role. However, it is strange to see how some of the "young and fresh faces" of this film did much more.
