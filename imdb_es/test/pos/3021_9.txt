A crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) whom two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) urge to use their therapy in Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Ofornio) , a serial killer who (uses strange and horrible torture tactics) is found in a coma by the feds. What Novak wants in exchange for Deane is the whereabouts of Stargher's latest victim and if she is alive. Once Deane gets into Stargher's mind, he has the look and atmosphere that resemble a colorful combination of "Dune" or "Blue Velvet" by David Lynch and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" by Wes Craven, the adventure begins. Deane sees a variety of strange people ranging from Carl as a young man (an adorable Jake Thomas) to a man similar to Freddy Krueger without the razor claws. I do not want to reveal the ending, but the film is great, in addition to the dynamite, music and musical direction of Howard Shore (by Tarsem, who shows he can direct).
