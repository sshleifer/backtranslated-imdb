The hawk and the snowman are based on a true story. Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee, (the head traitors), played by Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn, received their code names from the KGB. Why? Boyce was an avid falconer and Lee was a coca head. The film is based on a true story. It is based on the book of the same name. Another critic asked what his motivation was? Disappointment is not. Ideology is not. (Excuse my bad grammar,) but I'm making a point here. What was it if it was not disappointment or ideology? In a word, greed. At the time of the Boyce-Lee case, money became the great motivator and not the ideology. Do not Believe Me Then, look at the Walker family spy ring, which broke down in the late '80s. Three spies did the worst damage to our national security in the 70s and 80s. John Walker, who began his career as a spy in the 60s, Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee. The three sold this country for thirty pieces of silver. If you are not familiar with that phrase, I suggest you read the Bible.
