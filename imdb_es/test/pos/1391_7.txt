Seeing this strange little adventure movie, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us high-quality Giallo classics like Mrs Wardh's The Strange Vice and The Case of the Scorpion's Tail, but it must be said that Although it is a low-quality production value, Island of the Fish Men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it receives. Like many Italian films of the seventies, this is a scam of a successful American film, this time in question is the Isle of Dr. Moreau, critically criticized. Sergio Martino's film takes ideas such as mutation, greed and adventure and molds them into a slightly convincing film, which compensates for what is lacking in coherence and logic with a load of mostly intriguing ideas. The central plot follows a ship that crashes on a small island. It quickly becomes evident that not everything in this place is normal, and soon it is seen that half of the population has become "fishermen", a cross between a man and a fish, which exists for purely selfish reasons ... <br /> <br /> The truth about this movie is that it is much more fun if you ignore the trashy production values. The central monsters seem completely ridiculous, and much of the film takes place on stages that seem to cost someone a few cents, but despite this, the film is well filmed, with underwater photography as a particular highlight and rhythm of the movie. The movie is well made, because the movie never gets boring. The way in which the plot comes together is not exactly great, but it includes many ideas and I've seen films made in plots with much less thought put into them. The most prominent place in the film is definitely the lost city of Atlantis. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of adventure films and, therefore, I do not see much mention of this lost city, but it's always nice to see it in a movie. The central location of the island is good, as it provides a suitable configuration for the story and also provides the film with the right amount of mystery, since Martino makes good use of the voodoo theme. In general, this is not exactly a classic and, certainly, there are junk adventure movies far worse than this one.
