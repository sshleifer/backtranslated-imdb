I'm not a big musical fan, but I was always in love with Ms. Hayworth's appearance, so I thought I'd try it. <br /> <br /> This may be the best showcase for multiplayer. the talented Mrs. Hayworth. She never looked more charming in a movie (with the possible exception of 'Gilda', where she is the sex symbol par excellence). <br /> <br /> Rita has more than adequate assistance from Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy may be dated, but it's still pretty funny. Kelly does one of her dances of force tour, dancing with the image of himself from a window. <br /> <br /> But Rita manages this whole movie. An excellent cast, with Otto Kruger and the always wonderful and wise Eve Arden does not hurt. <br /> <br /> Rita sings, Rita dances, everything looks incredibly beautiful! The music may not be classical, but the lyrics of most of the melodies are quite intelligent. <br /> <br /> I think this movie works better than 'Gilda', which I consider a defective film. For Mrs. Hayworth's credit, she also runs 'Gilda', and Gilda drives any man of red blood crazy. <br /> <br /> The movie stays well after all these years. A lot of leg candy for the male audience is a good advantage!
