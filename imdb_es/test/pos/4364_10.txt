I think this is an impressive but deceiving film because it seems very simple and direct: a survivor of Vietnam tells his heartbreaking story and part of the story is re-enacted in the place. Reviewers sometimes even claim that Herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are. We know that all documentaries are "mediated" to some extent, and this has the subtle hand of Herzog, especially in the impressive music, in the incredible selection of archival footage experts and in the handling of cascaded images. The evocative power of this film is amazing, beginning with its title, the first title card of the book "Revelation" and the initial voice-over. This is a movie that one can watch repeatedly with growing amazement, not a simple product that is swallowed with your favorite beverage on the way to the evening news. This is one of those movies that can resonate with you throughout your life.
