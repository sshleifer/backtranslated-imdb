This special of Bravo is one of the most entertaining things I've seen on television. Unlike Me First and The Gimme Gimmes (the most important punk-supergroup / cover-band in the world), The Dan Band really should be appreciated. <br /> <br /> On paper, The Dan Band is just one. The joke boy sings female songs and inserts gratuitous profanity into the lyrics. If you listen to your CD "Dan Band Live", that's all you'll get, and it will get old quickly. (I only bought it because I had some songs that were not in the TV special). But what makes Dan Finnerty a cult hero of Hollywood is his surprising presence on stage. This guy deserves his audience for every second he's on stage. And backup singers are also a big part of the visual line. As for the current band, they remain out of sight for the most part, but they are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than the typical lounge-act accompaniment band. Hopefully, a DVD version will be released soon; almost certainly some songs were cut and, although the generalized censorship adds a little involuntary humor, it also eliminates the INTENTIONAL humor. <br /> <br /> If there is any sense in Around the world, owners of Las Vegas casinos will soon fight over who can build their own Dan showroom faster. <br /> <br /> "Re ------- member my name ... FAME!"
