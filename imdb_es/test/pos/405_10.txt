Note: After writing this review, I see that this list is in fact about the television series and not about the original movie. My mistake. I thought IMDb for a database for movies, not TV shows. But since most people will look for this film in BAGDAD CAFE and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM, which, strangely, is the name that appears in this film, I will leave this comment here. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something, but when I read that other review, it seemed to be a complete revision of the CBS series, which should have been based loosely on this movie. I did not watch the television series and I would like it or not, but one thing is for sure is that it is very different from this movie. This movie is NOT like a TV show and Whoopie Goldberg is not in it or in any other famous Hollywood star (apart from Jack Palance, who was very charming in his role). <br /> <br /> This is terribly sweet film that thinks totally "out of the box". It looks nothing like a Hollywood formula movie, which is probably why (what's a pretty word for idiots?) Who decide to market movies or do not decide not to market it. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie captured my heart and my imagination from the first moment. From the music (which is only part of the time, so you can not really call it a musical) to the cinematography, to the really great story. <br /> <br /> A German or Bavarian woman (very pretty and pretty chubby). ) gets into an argument with the other German or Bavarian man with whom he travels through the desert of California and leaves with him. It goes in the car and will stand by itself on a deserted and deserted road. In the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Find the small and messed up, but charming Bagdad Cafe, in Baghdad, California, and register. The rest of the story is magical. I do not want to try to describe this movie because I want you to enjoy all the surprises. <br /> <br /> Warning: if you are racist or have something against big women, you will not like this movie, since the main romantic protagonist is a big woman and the brown and red skin characters have important roles and are included as "part of the mix" without any racism involved. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 10 for originality, entertainment and pure delight.
