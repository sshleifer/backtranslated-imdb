I bought this video on a VCR tape at a goodwill store for $ 50 cents. I have taken enough videos that I bought to sell them to others after having seen them considering the cost of 50 cents as rent. This is the only one that will never come back. It is an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. I do not know if I should call it circus, dance, or both. It is bigger than life itself. They can only do well for a few years in their life. These are the performers for the performers. If Gene Kelly and Burt Lancaster were alive today and saw them live, it would surprise them. I would lend it to others to see it, but I know that if I do, I'll never get it back.
