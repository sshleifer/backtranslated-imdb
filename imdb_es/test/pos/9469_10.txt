I thought that this movie was absolutely hilarious. I already knew it was going to be a fun movie, but it was more fun than I expected. Of course there were some boring jokes, but they made me laugh. I thought the actors were going to be pretty bad, but the actors were good at acting this comedy. I have to congratulate Amanda Bynes, she looked surprisingly like her brother and had an amazing performance as a child. As for the other actors, they were also fun. Of course, there were times when you shouted to the screen "how can you not know?", But that's part of the fun. In the end the plot turned out quite well. There is a happy ending, but what did you expect? <br /> <br /> In general, simply hilarious.
