The best compliments for the other commentator here at IMDb, who wondered why this series did not "get stuck" in its time to last much longer than many other series in the 80s. <br /> <br /> It is not true that the series would have worsened if it had continued. <br /> <br /> At the end of this commentary, I will publish some reflections on the other realizations of the film, rather: attempts of the legend of Robin Hood. <br /> <br /> First of all, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever. <br /> <br /> Nothing is as fun as the two complete, if you want, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. And at the same time, absolutely in accordance with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of Terry Jones's historical documentations about Egypt, Greece, Rome, Konstantinopel, the Goths and the Barbarians, and the Middle Ages and the Crusades (... yes, THE Monthy Python- Terry Jones): <br /> <br /> If you've seen those bright and fun Jones-Docs, you'll understand much better all the historical background of Carpenter, the writer of Sherwood's Robin series (what happens to be the brother of John Carpenter, who made "The Thing", his third brother makes music), with the intention of telling us. <br /> <br /> The writer of "Dick Turpin", "Catweazle" and the first two seasons of "Robin of Sherwood", called "Kip" Carpenter, is my lord of the film. It is better than all the others who criticize their element of "sword and witchcraft" or "malfunction" (taken from Robin of Sherwood Webring) of this series (which I can not see) or have other unfounded criticisms than there are. There was a lot in that then and still now. <br /> <br /> That's why, when you get to know this "Robin of Sherwood" better, you will be severe. At first you will hate the third season. Not only that: I put myself through this and, besides that, I have only put the first two seasons in the depths of my heart: despite the fact that Praed, Robin's actor, left this series, because after The series had a huge success, he was offered a probably better-paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series called "The New Adventures of Jules Verne", as the title reveals the emptiness of the entire project. Praed was for money, and not for fame, he did not stay with his gang and relatives, I mean: as actors. <br /> <br /> Actors who personally represent the "true" ones later, in our present time, celebrities. And legendary faces and characters from the robin legend. The potential of this series could and should have been allowed to flourish much more without degrading the content and the historical message and the rebellious precision with respect to the current political problems. <br /> <br /> Again, it is mandatory to say: A change from The main role was forced by Praed's stupid decision to leave Robin of Sherwood for a series of foolish remakes of Verne's stories and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story. Still, in some aspects, it is a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Anyway: if one is informed about this, and maybe Connery was actually announced by his father, but the young Connery DID NOT DO IT AT ALL "scared away", as I thought in a damaging way at first place, then one can absolutely enjoy the third season. The sad thing here is that the script was no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we no longer have that critical historical background and free thinking as, for example, in "The Witch of Elsdon" or "The King's Fool" , two episodes of the first series that is A) funny, B) historically educated and C) acted brilliantly. === <br /> <br /> "Do not trust the Lion!" <br /> <br /> Unlike many other characters who wished him death by his own power, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and as in real history, was a greater authority than John or others, but he used it only for his perverse idea of ​​the crusade and the war against Normandie in France. He killed and massacred much more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in the "complete" crusades, and his soldiers even devoured the children they killed by hunger or poverty. In addition to that, after its capture by the Saracens (Muslims) in the Crusades, Britain was squeezed for its ransom, 100,000 marks (at that time, the 11th century, comparable to approximately 30 billion - 30'000'000 ' 000 .- Dollars of current value), to recover it safely, and then only visited England for a month to return to Normandie (in France, where the Norman Invaders were the first) by the crusades (one learns that in the episode "The King's Fool"). For this new crusade, possibly a kind of revenge for his capture, Richard Lionheart again "drains the country of money" (quoted from the mouth of Clive Mantle, when he tells Robin that he is critical even with the King). Robin criticizes this war against the social failure of Richard, addresses himself to Richard and says: "The poor gave everything to free you, how can you ask them more?" - Richard: "... Give me your courage and strength, not your words!" ... Later, in private, Richard orders the murder of Robin ... <br /> <br /> Then, the crusaders were the real "barbarians". <br /> <br /> PS: Already when I saw them Kostner, at 91, I got angry because, after that, I discovered in the history course at school that Richard was not as good as Sean Connery shows in his appearance at the end of "Prince of thieves". Well, as Terry Jones would say: It's a lie, a treacherous lie! "Sean is humorous and charismatic, and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of" Robin of Sherwood. "<br /> <br /> Again: Praed is, according to my information so far, the one that He left Sherwood for a stupid Verne series that no one with a brain will ever remember or want to remember.
