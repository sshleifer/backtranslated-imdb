I've always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high for what your "heroes" can play. And if there's something I've learned about expecting a lot from the people you just love to see and hear, it's never to expect too much, because 99 times out of 100, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although, when I heard there was a Jackass 2 on the way, I thought: "Even I can not, I rejected my expectations for this movie", and as a result of that I sat down today, ready to laugh, but also ready to say at the end "Well, it was fine, but I'm a little disappointed". How wrong I was! Every member of the Jackass team takes this movie to the first one, showing you the trick of one madman after another, making everyone see that there is nothing they do not do to try to hurt themselves, and that is what we love. ! I cried with my eyes laughing from the first minute until the last second of the movie, sometimes I even screamed with laughter, without being able to control myself! Trick after trick, joke after joke, and funny comments about the flow, it just can not be better than this! Incredible from start to finish, guaranteed to make you laugh. I have two things to say; Look at it, and PLEASE, God, let there be a Jackass 3: these guys clearly have a lot to offer!
