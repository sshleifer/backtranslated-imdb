Like most other reviewers, I really enjoyed this TV miniseries. I did not see it when it first came out, but my grandfather, a great fan of mysteries and war movies, recorded it in 1989. I remember seeing it in my grandparents' cabin one night and I felt completely trapped in it. history! It has a very intriguing plot and a good mix of drama, romance and espionage. I have seen many films that were shot during World War II, but none with a turn like this! Fortunately, I was able to make a VHS copy of the film several years ago. I've seen it several times since then and I still enjoy it. I would love for this film to be released on DVD. It would be much easier to see with the chapters.
