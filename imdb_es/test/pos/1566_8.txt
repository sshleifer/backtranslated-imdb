Six of the seven people who took the time to comment on this film have very positive answers. The only negative criticism lies on the first page of the location of the film in the IMDb. <br /> <br /> I found out that "What Alice Found" is one of the best movies that almost nobody has ever heard of that I've seen this year. Its rating of 6.4 is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject than the quality of the film. Who would have thought that a movie supposedly about prostitution at the truck stops would be worth seeing? Guess again. <br /> <br /> For me, "Alice" was an emotional psychological thriller. I was practically on the edge of my seat all the time. It is a very credible story with a realistic script and is very well delivered. In a fairer world, actress Judith Ivey would win prizes for keeping you guessing whether it was good or bad. <br /> <br /> Ignore the rating and see this excellent movie. (And by the way, I wish there was an album of soundtracks).
