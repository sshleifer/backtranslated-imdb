First, I'm a big fan of Buddy Holly. I grew up knowing who he was, and I knew all about that plane ride that put out three incredibly bright flames that way. But I had never really listened to his music. I had heard a lot about that, yes, but not until I sat down with the intention of getting something out, I really came to see the real Buddy Holly. And let me tell you that my world is now different thanks to him. <br /> <br /> Because of this adoration for such an amazing man, I bought The Buddy Holly Story without having seen it previously. I am torn in my views of this movie. Maybe it's because Buddy feels so alive to me that he could not stand to see Gary Busey in this role. I admit he did a good job acting, but his singing sounded so forced. I thought I knew he did not look at all like Buddy and, therefore, I was using too much energy to try a similar sound. In some parts of the film, he succeeded. But others ... ouch. <br /> <br /> The film covered a period of several years, but I think that portraying this time frame could have been handled much better. It was difficult for me to distinguish at what point in Buddy's life certain events occurred. I also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. I think the worst was the representation of the Crickets. I understand how their real names could not be used, and that, to simplify, there were only two of them in the movie ... and maybe this was a good thing. Because the background voices of the film were valuable, and I did not like the way they were portrayed as an obstacle to Buddy's career. Another thing that really made no difference in the movie but that bothered me was Gary Busey's teeth. They exhausted me! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I do not know why I noticed ... but I did. <br /> <br /> I will finish this review on what I felt was the best part of the film: Buddy's last performance. His last phone call to Maria, the Big Bopper performance, took him and Richie Valens onstage, followed by the end of the fixed frame. I was even surprised, and I feel that it effectively shows the audience how in a moment Buddy Holly was so alive and energetic, and that his flame went out in the blink of an eye. I think it was a beautiful way to portray this horrible tragedy. <br /> <br /> Good movie, despite the obvious problems ... 7/10. <br /> <br /> Some obvious flaws, could be useful. ... but I'ts not bad
