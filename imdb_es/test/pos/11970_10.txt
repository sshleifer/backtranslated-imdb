I can not believe that people are giving bad reviews about this movie! I wonder why ... maybe because of the book ... I have to admit that he does not really follow the book ... for sure ... Dean Koontz's book is much better ... But the film is also good too ! he has the suspense ... the acting is good ... especially Michael Ironside, to whom he has given an excellent performance in this film. <br /> <br /> come a boy ... give this movie a chance. ... there is still a lot more worse movie than this ... like the sum of all the fears ... ghosts ... the code da vinci ... these are some of the worst movies I've seen ... really boring if compared to the viewers who really have great elements in the movie ... this movie contains great suspense and non-stop action. I'm looking for this movie ... but it's really hard to find it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> by the way ... I really recommended this movie to everyone ... look at them! !!! you'll never regret! <br /> <br /> 10/10 *
