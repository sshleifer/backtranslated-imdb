Well, I'm not a film critic or anything like that. But I have my opinion for this movie. I think the best thing in this movie was Amanda Bynes, she played her roll for my appearance very well, I've seen many films, this is what I like the most! When you are watching this movie, you can relax, go down and watch it. You do not have to try to search for a subtext or something like that. You only see it The movie is really great. Maybe I liked it for an actress, maybe all over the stage, but I liked it. All the environment that was created. At one point I felt like I was in that university, in that room. It is not another dramatic film that is Made to win Oscar, it is a good movie to watch in your free time.
