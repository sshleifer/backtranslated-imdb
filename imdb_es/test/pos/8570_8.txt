This has to be my guilty pleasure. I am a HUGE fan of 80s movies that were designed to entertain and did not care if they offended someone. This movement has no flesh, no substance, no scenes that provoke deep thoughts. Just old university students have fun and if they have to show a few breasts, then so be it! This movie is for when you just want to relax and NOT think. Live the nudity!
