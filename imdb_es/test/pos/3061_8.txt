This movie should be on DVD because it's the only way I'll buy it. I thought it was very funny because there was no real plot. It was not supposed to be an Oscar-winning movie. I appreciate those movies. Cary Elwes was a very cute Robin Hood. I can not even think about my favorite part of the movie because they are all pretty good. Anyway, peace outside. !!!!
