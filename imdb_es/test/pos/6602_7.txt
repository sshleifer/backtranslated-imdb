I hate movies about sports. I suppose that the prefabricated Hollywood sports film is a bit difficult to swallow because it follows the most identical ideas of each year, what I try to say is that there is not much creativity in this genre. Use "A" exposure? "The Game Plan" as evidence of this if you want. So, needless to say, I hesitated to watch this documentary due to the theme of the sporting theme, but at the same time I could not wait because I love surf documentaries like "Step into Liquid" and "Billabong Odyssey". I took a step, immersed myself in the unknown and, to be honest, at first I was not happy. I did not like the direction, the people or the style that the film included to present these young sports entrepreneurs. The first time I saw it, I thought that the story could not be recorded completely, so I thought that Stacy Peralta was joining archive images with false actors who acted as if they were from the late 70's. The music was intense, it combined well . Peralta had made a mixed tape of this generation for our enjoyment, but the images were anything but stimulating. The long scenes, while using incredible music to support, seemed red and too long for my attention. I wanted to meet the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these children were, where they went during their rise to fame, and where they are now. I felt as if I was watching the birth of our nation with a big score for the settlers who only paddled their boats all day. I wanted to meet the men behind the myths. <br /> <br /> Then, with the thought that I would have another negative criticism under my belt, I saw the movie again with Peralta's audio commentary. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to make this film take place "wow-ed". This suddenly became the movie I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know more about where these children are today, what they still do and how difficult it was to put some of them in the camera. I had not seen many of them in more than 20 years, so listening to these challenges brought the human element to the surface. He was sincere, he was nice, but he showed a lot of dedication to this project. Although I do not agree with everything he chose to do (ie, the Sean Penn disaster is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this movie for me. It was because of this comment that I rate this film much higher than originally thought. <br /> <br /> Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff ho Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just some of the names that should be mentioned and praised continuously for the skateboard to continue the fast-growing trend that is currently seen. While Tony Hawk's name sells products, it's these guys, these smooth-surfaced pavement loafers who redefine a complete sport. Sure, others probably did it in the Stone Age, but these guys did it with style and grace, and they took it to the next level. This was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction that I think none of them was ready for. "Dogtown and Z-Boys" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without TVs to keep us planted and talk about friendship. We have seen so many stories over the years that show the progress of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that. I can not say that I loved this movie, or me, but it should be a standard visualization for all those who learn or wish to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys are not billionaires again? They are passionate people, and very rarely see it in documentaries. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not see this movie again, but I will suggest it to friends and family again and again. I think the fall of this film, for me, was the filming? Attempts to be avant-garde with style, which ultimately departed from the characters and events. As mentioned earlier, there were some elements that went on too long, which left us with little or no time to know where these guys were now. Peralta obviously had a passion for the sport, for the people, but sometimes it seemed out of focus. The music was intense, and it worked perfectly with the movie. Sean Penn, although he was decent with his voice-over, was not necessary at all. They could have spent the money somewhere else. On the positive side, the audio commentary captures everything that was missing in the normal movie. Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of people, places and events. Watch this movie, but do not expect it to discourage you. Listen to the audio comment; I think he will be impressed. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** Â½ out of *****
