This is the forty-minute film that introduces us to the character of the Butcher, who will then be examined more thoroughly in the feature film Seoul Contre Tous. In this film, he follows the first period of his life from 1965-1979, but focuses on the late seventies. The first images are of a killing of a horse, then the birth of a baby, the daughter of the Butcher, whom we see growing every year. The Butcher (played by Philippe Nahon in both films) is a man bitter with the world. He hates many things. His anger reaches a critical point when a man assaults his autistic daughter. The Butcher then mutilates the wrong man, and is in jail. <br /> <br /> This movie follows the life of the butcher right after his release from prison, then Seoul Contre Tous takes over from there. I saw the movies backwards, Seoul Contre Tous first. Try and watch this little movie first if you can.
