I caught this movie late one night and I never knew what hit me. This was one of the most disturbing movies I've seen, but still I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. Alan Rickman is an excellent "bad boy", but this character surpasses all others. I have never been so affected by a movie! It's been 6 years and I still can not forget "Closet Land".
