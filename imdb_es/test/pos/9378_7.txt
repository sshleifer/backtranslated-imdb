Edward Dmytryk directed this dark film about a murder investigation involving demobilized military personnel. Robert Young gives us a lecture on hate, Robert Mitchum covers most of this image and Gloria Grahame reviews the resistance she exhibited in "It's A Wonderful Life". It is Robert Ryan who is at the center of the issue: anti-Semitism. He delves into his role as much as Monty Montgomery (Imagine that the parents were named Lawrence and they call his son Larry!), That the drama sits directly on his shoulders, and he is more than ready for the challenge. Without it, the movie would be commonplace. Ryan has played with several memorable villains in his day ("Bad Day at Black Rock", "Billy Budd"), but this performance put him on the map. With Sam Levene as the victim of the murder.
