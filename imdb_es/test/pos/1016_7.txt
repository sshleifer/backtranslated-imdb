Distributor: GOODTIMES home video <br /> <br /> Plot: a pretty high school student is marked by a relentless terror in this suspense full of television movies. Gail Osborne is new to the city. She makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to go her way. That is until he receives an ominous and terrifying call while taking care of children. After more and more phone calls, she is raped. Throughout most of the movie, she tries to find evidence that the person raped her. <br /> <br /> Audio / Video: This 1987 VHS edition of Goodtimes stinks. There are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen. <br /> <br /> Extras: No extras from the Goodtimes home video. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: this suspense made for the TV movie was made in 1978, so do not expect many deaths (there are none). If you can find this movie with the Worldvision home video logo on the front, then buy it. But the Goodtimes version is pretty horrible. This can be a bit boring, but if you're patient, the ending is pretty good.
