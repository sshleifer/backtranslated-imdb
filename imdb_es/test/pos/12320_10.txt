The latest film by John Huston, the great American director of Irish descent, is an adaptation of the last story in the early collection "Dubliners", the best writer who has ever come from Ireland. The movie is a family affair. The dying director did it based on the script adapted by his son Tony Huston from one of the most moving, beautiful and profound stories ever written in this language and considered by many THE BEST story in English. John directed his daughter Anjelica in what could be her best screen performance. The movie is short, only 83 minutes. It has no action sequences, no plot, it is almost without events and may seem slow. The guests, friends and family attend the party that takes place in Dublin during the week of the Epiphany in January 1904, at the home of two elderly sisters who give an annual dinner with music and dance. What the spectators see during the first hour is the subject of the whole conversation. The guests talk, listen to the music, discuss the last opera premiere and make jokes, sometimes uncomfortable. Little by little, the conversation turns to friends or relatives who died a long time ago, whose memory never faded. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you should stay in, let me stop you, listen to what and how The guests at the party say, how they communicate. Pay attention to the body language, to the looks on their faces when they move away from light, laughter and music from the present to the past, but in reality they never leave the most precious memories where the Dead of the title are not dead but always young and so alive. If you do, you will be granted the final scene of such emotional power and impact that will always remain with you. It will break your heart in pieces, gather them together and fix it again. The film, like Joyce's story, focuses on Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann as James Joyce's alter ego gave a very moving performance) as one of the party guests who arrives with his wife Gretta (Anjelica Huston). Gabriel is still in love, feels a close connection and is fascinated with her. It is after the party, she discovers that even after many years of closeness, she does not know everything about her past, her pains, her regrets and the unforgettable emotions and loss that she had experienced as a child, and he is nothing. part of. For the first time, he looks at her and does not consider her an indelible part of his existence, but as another human being with his own inner world, his own loneliness and sadness and, for the first time, "a strange and friendly compassion." because she entered his soul. "It is he who narrates the most powerful and profound final lines of history:" Snow is general throughout Ireland ... falling faintly through the universe and falling slightly, like the descent of its last end, over all living beings and dead. "<br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie or have not read Joyce's story, do it.They are really the works of art that leave the eternal impression and would change something in you the best.
