I'm sick and tired of people complaining that Never Say Never Again is just a weak remake of Thunderball. Yes, the influence of that film is unmistakable, but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of the recreated films is reserved for such unreflective and unintelligent films as the new version of 1998 by Psycho. While it is true that the opening theme of the twelfth (and Connery's last film) Bond is one of the worst in the whole series, the film itself remains strong, despite many other weaknesses. On top of that, even the weak title song is made to blend in nicely with the closing dialogue in the movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, Sean Connery was getting a little old when this movie was filmed (at least by James Bond), but there's a lot of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to filmmakers . James Bond is about to retire before he is given his homework, since he has spent most of his time teaching, not doing, and even insisting that M pay more attention to his health, diet and training and exercise more . And why not. Besides, this is James Bond, remember? This guy is supposed to be a superhuman type, and all his fans are bothering him because he has some gray hairs. When this guy retires at the end of the movie, M sends poor `Small-Fawcett '(in a hilarious cameo by Rowan Atkinson) to tell Bond that without him, he worries about the safety of the free world, and all of you I can forget the fact that he is no longer a happy young man. Come on, Sean Connery could STILL play James Bond as well as he did, or at least better than anyone could. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is about the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and keep the world hostage (as Dr. Evil would say, 'Oh, hell, just do what we always do?') , so clearly there is not much news there, but this is one of the Bond films that had the best linings. Is there a funny scene where Bond is asked for a urine sample? `If ​​you could fill this glass for me? ' From here? There are many good phrases, but the sexual innuendos directed at Mr. Bond are especially frequent in this installment. But then, later, he throws that urine sample into the face of a villain, making him scream as if his face was burning. It's not a very good comic relief attempt, especially since this guy had been kicking Bond's ass with some kind of super-spring device that could cut almost anything. And, of course, Kim Basinger plays this movie as one of the best Bond girls in the entire series. <br /> <br /> It's no secret that Never Say Never Again has gone wrong, and one of the things that have done it. The worst are the special effects. with the only exception of the flying missiles, which were obviously fake but still impressive for 1982. The color contact lens at the beginning of the film had no effect, and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the whole movie. Only those damn sharks. Evidently, Fatima Blush placed some kind of device in her diving tank that attracted the sharks (granted, they had their own strange guide mechanisms), in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line, "I have a simple request. And that's having sharks with FRICKIN lasers attached to their heads! And then, of course, there is the explosion of the scene of a hotel room that was remade in an episode of The Simpsons, and that was obviously followed by another mandatory sentence of James. <br /> <br /> Domination The video game created by Largo, the villain of the film, is an especially memorable scene, and the film also shows what is probably the best motorcycle chase of the entire series (far superior to the laughable Tomorrow Never Dies). But despite many strengths, the weaknesses of the film are made clearer in the minds of the audience at the end of the film due in large part to the anti-climactic underwater conclusion (one of the most obvious parts taken from Thunderball, and recreated from lower way). It does not matter that Largo revealed some crucial information to Bond when he left him in the tower alive (once again, the brilliance of Dr. Evil). I'll leave it there without really witnessing his death and I'll assume everything went according to plan. What? '), The climax of what is expected to be a fast-paced action movie should never take place in a silent underwater atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In short, Never Say Never Again ranks very high on the James Bond scale, and Connery's wink at the end of the film (as well as the two final lines) suggested at the time I could still go back for another round like Bond. Clearly, this is not very likely anymore, so we can only wait.
