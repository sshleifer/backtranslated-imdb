The fact that the film is based on a true story contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic experience, and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the film. The story is full of unexpected twists that prevent the viewer from discovering the ending at all times. In a moment you think something happens to Coach Jones or Radio. Well, yes, but it certainly is not what you expect. <br /> <br /> The film never becomes boring or overly sentimental and the performances of Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. are some of their best in my opinion. The end puts a lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right. Well, I guess that's what Michael Tollin and Mike Rich were trying to do. First class movie <br /> <br /> Esbj√∏rn Nordby Birch. Denmark.
