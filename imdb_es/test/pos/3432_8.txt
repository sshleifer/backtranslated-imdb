Very funny movie with some of the best Swedish actors. Everything is filmed in black and white with the true 40-ish feeling. Most of the film is on board a train that goes to Berlin in 1945 among a mix of characters, from refugees to 2 gay boys and 2 nuns. I really recommend this movie if you like to laugh.
