Somehow, this movie was buried in the soft spot of my heart. Do not ask me how it happened, but I guess having the feature film Ed "I'll Sponsor Anything" McMahon, as a crack hunter, had something to do with this. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was disappointed with Slaughter's first outing in 1972. Nothing but a quick release together to follow Shaft-mania. How does the sequel get away from this? Big Jim Brown seems stronger as Slaughter here than in the first. Perhaps this is due to the fact that one year later he had something to work with, instead of his simple "Be like Shaft" motivation. <br /> <br /> The most prominent part of the film is the soundtrack provided by chimp daddy number one, James Brown. Almost all the scenes are adorned with a touch of funk by the Godfather. An excellent vintage film, for music, costumes, vehicles, slang and hair. I must also point out that this movie is also an excellent vintage film to represent a moment in the history of the movie in which Jim Brown and Ed McMahon could really GROW hair. <br /> <br /> Fold the chicks, double the stroke, triple the body count, and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You will be in the hell of an action movie of the 70s, and one that surpasses its predecessor no less. For my money, Slaughter's Big Rip-Off can play ball with any Blaxploitation movie that has been made. Even axis. Chances are you do not agree, but Slaughter's Big Rip-Off has its own feeling. Something that was missing from the original.
