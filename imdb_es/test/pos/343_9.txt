Sri Lanka ... is not a country where I have thought a lot, I must admit. I did not even know that I was close to India, much less that there has been a bloody civil war since 1983. It seems that the rebels of the Tamil minority have been in continual conflict with the military regime that governs the country. For many years, causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman's latest film, A PECK ON THE CHEEK, tells the story of a young woman named Amudha, who is separated from her Sri Lanka. Parents for the war and raised by a young Indian couple. Amudha is a bright and naughty girl, whose life is turned around when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child. Although her adoptive parents love her as much as she should, and raised her without prejudice along with her biological children, Amudha can not help wanting to learn more about her biological family. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman is probably best known for his movie DIL SE 1998, which hides a story about terrorism and politics within a love story (or is it the other way around?). A check on the tuft inhabits a similar territory, but it may be more ambitious in the terrain it covers. The central theme that unites the film is the love between all the members of a family, and especially between a child and his adoptive parents. It is a fairly honest and open to feelings, which can be extremely moving and comforting at times and quite painful at others. It is an emotionally complex film, with characters that are somewhat idealized but still behave in a very human way. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Amudha, 9, played with charm and vivacity by the young actress P.S. Keerthana in his first and only acting role. She is a princess and a monster, she always gets in trouble but in such a charming way that no one can be angry with her for long. The young actress is perfectly chosen for the role, and does a tremendous job in the diverse and emotional scenes that are often required of her. <br /> <br /> A PECK ON THE CHEEK has such an innocent name that I was not ready for anything. The intensity of the experience. I had never dared to say that such a small act has not had such an enormous emotional impact. The film is a bold and artistic effort to explore themes that are not often covered on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mani Ratman is excellent, very confident and mature: the most sophisticated work I've seen from this director yet. The film is visually very elegant, with excellent camera work and images. ARKANSAS. Rahman provides the soundtrack of the film, which is not as good as his classical music DIL SE or BOMBAY (based at least on first impressions), but which still shows his great musical talent. <br /> <br /> I do not know of a DVD release for the film yet: I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival, of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight. The production is a true world-class effort, and I'm sure it will be popular with Western audiences, as it begins to receive more exposure. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
