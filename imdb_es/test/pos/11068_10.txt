Ingrid Bergman (Cleo Dulaine) has never been so beautiful. Gary Cooper, like "Cleent", is presented as perfectly as a laconic Texan who knows that this girl is not good. When both eyes closed on the French market, we know that this match will be full of sparks. When you walk through your garden in your restored house in the French Quarter and the theme of love plays, it is a dream for all romantics. <br /> <br /> The costumes are beautiful; The decoration of the set makes you wish that the "Barrio" was like that. And that Saratoga still had that hotel with the wide gallery with all the old gossip. <br /> <br /> From the novel by Edna Ferbers, the story is of revenge for the mistakes and struggles over who would handle the railroads in the early days of that industry. <br /> <br /> In the scenes of Saratoga, Florence Bates as a great lady steals all the scenes. <br /> <br /> But it's the scene of Cleo confronting the little lawyer. New Orleans relatives have sent to buy it, that's a magical movie moment. After Cleo has overcome him in the negotiations, he looks at her with longing and says: "Let me say: you are very beautiful." And Cleo with a happy and evil smile says "yes, is not it luck?" You want to shout "YES"! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite romantic movies of all time.
