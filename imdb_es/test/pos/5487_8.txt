Before, when I was working as a person, I remember having a really obnoxious client to deal with who insisted on doing everything on a personal basis. I was telling him things that my agency could and could not do and he firmly believed that I personally was willing to do what was rightfully his. I swear, but I was thinking about this guy while watching John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their battle of wit. <br /> <br /> The Line Of Fire introduces Clint Eastwood as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was at work in Dallas when he was young when John F. Kennedy was killed. Since then he has had his doubts and has been given to drink and his life in a moment was a real disaster. He has returned to the detail of the White House now and when the landlady of a possible murderer attacks his tenant of the Secret Service, it is Eastwood and his partner Dylan McDermott who take the case. <br /> <br /> But the killer is not an ordinary nutcase case. He is a professional in his work, trained and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but he thought Malkovich was better. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Malkovich could have been better, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge of breaking into his apartment while he worked and he insisted on making everything personal. He calls Eastwood throughout the movie and mocks him. And after a while, what Malkovich says and does makes Clint really personal. <br /> <br /> The presidential assassins we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs, unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the murders. A guy like Malkovich, a professional with a real or imaginary grudge, is the most dangerous type of enemy. <br /> <br /> Others to highlight in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as White House chief of staff (and to be president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent who falls in love with the male charm of Eastwood, John Mahoney as head of the Secret Service, Gary Cole as head of the Secret Service of the White House, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as President and First Lady. <br /> <br /> But when Malkovich is on, he owns In The Line Of Fire. The climax with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.
