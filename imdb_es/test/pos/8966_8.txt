Charlie Wilson (two-time Oscar winner: Tom Hanks) is a carefree congressman ... Who loves to party, enjoys the company of women and, above all, drinking their alcohol. When Charlie's old friend and ex-girlfriend, Joanne Herring (Oscar winner: Julia Roberts) wants Charlie to visit Afghanistan, that country definitely needs help. Charlie is surprised at what he saw, especially of all the different ages that died or were injured in this war with the Russians. He decides to help the people and the rebels to fight against the Russians, who started the war. Charlie, Joanne and a renegade CIA agent by the name of Gust Avrakotos (Oscar winner: Philip Seymour Hoffman) will start a good fight to achieve the biggest undercover operation in history. <br /> <br /> Directed by Oscar winner: Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, Concerning Henry, Wolf) made an animated and entertaining comedy of war satire based on a true story. Hanks, Roberts, Hoffman in an Oscar nominated performance and Amy Adams as Charlie's loyal assistant are very good in their roles. Despite the excellent premise of real life, "Charlie Wilson's War" never really catches fire and is not as perversely funny as you like. Director Nichols and screenwriter: Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men) keeps things moving and the characters are much appreciated in everything. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a clear Pan & Scan transfer (1.33: 1) and a good Dolby Digital surround sound 5.1. The only special features of the DVD are the behind the scenes role with the cast and crew and a real-life role with Charlie Wilson and others. "Charlie Wilson's War" is a good movie that could have been really great, but it's not. But this movie is smart enough to please those who enjoyed well-written or well-performed adult comedies. (*** 1/2 out of *****).
