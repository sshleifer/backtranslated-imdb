I saw the film in Izmir as the closing film of the Izmir film festival. I did not know anything about it, but right now I'm glad I did not turn down the opportunity to see Ding-a-ling-less. It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in my life and believe me, I've seen millions of movies! (I'm a film critic!) Smart scripts and dialogues ... Smart details ... What else can I say? An indie masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor ... One can not help but wonder what he is capable of at this moment. Ding-a-ling minus was filmed five years ago and I'm sure the director Onur Tukel is more mature now. I heard that his next film will be a political satire and I really can not wait to see that too among his previous works like "House of Pancakes" ...
