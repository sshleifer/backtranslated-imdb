Mom has to be one of the uncomfortable movies of all time to see. Count on an old woman you would love to have as your nanny who becomes the monstrous and unpleasant monstrous mother you would never want to meet on a dark night! <br /> <br /> This dinner, Nanny, eats the entrails of a young lady at the opening of the film and becomes sicker as she goes. A cross between howling and brain death seems to come to mind when mom is described! <br /> <br /> A must for horror fans who have the stomach to do it (if you've seen re-animator or dead brain, this will). float in your boat) and you're willing to turn off the brain for an hour or so ... Let the gore spill!
