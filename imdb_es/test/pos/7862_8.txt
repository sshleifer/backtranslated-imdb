It took me years to finally capture this gem of a movie and it was worth the wait. In almost all his films, Clint always plays the hero. Be it hero, antihero or avenging hero. In this film, he is a pure villain and he interprets it well. <br /> <br /> As a wounded soldier in the union, students and teachers take him to a Confederate school to be cured. Soon after, he begins to seduce the ladies regardless of their age and some are quite young. He also plays with his jealousy and confronts them against each other. In the end, you're never so happy to see Clint die as a terrible death. <br /> <br /> That's what makes this movie a gem. Clint has never done any other movie like this and after watching this movie, you wish you had done it. He plays the role of the villain so well that it will make you wonder why he never made more movies like that. It also explains why the movie is not seen very often. Most people do not want to see Clint as the villain and with the release of Dirty Harry shortly after this movie, it has become a hidden gem. If you are a fan of Clint Eastwood, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. You may not like what you will see but you will not forget it soon.
