The caricature of Richard Condie's absolute madness, 'The Big Snit', is a journey through uncertainty, madness, hilarity, pleasant backgrounds, melting characters and a conclusion that almost makes me cry with joy everytime I see her. <br /> <br /> I've seen this short film again and again AND MORE, and I NEVER CALL IT (luckily, I have it recorded on a TV broadcast)! It never stops to make me burst out laughing uncontrollably, and then descend into the depths of my spirit, highlighting the greatness of the human condition. <br /> <br /> Because when someone says: 'Come on, let's finish the game', everything is fine in the world and the problems we face every day we realize that they are small and fleeting things so as not to fight or worry plus. . At first, this movie seems like a simple exercise in cartoon slapstick humor, but it is much more than that. This film achieves a greater sense of spiritual meaning with humanity in the wake when everything seems to be so bad and trivial. <br /> <br /> It's impeccable ... in every way. AND DAMN FUNNY TOO;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10.
