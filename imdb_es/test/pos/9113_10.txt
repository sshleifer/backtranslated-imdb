Tenacious D: in The Pick of Destiny tells the fictional story of the Tenacious D band's formation and their search to find Pick of Destiny, a guitar pick with supernatural powers created with the tooth of Satan (played by Dave Grohl). JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), united by fate, must travel to the Rock N 'Roll Museum and steal the Pick of Destiny to become the best band in the world. The movie is hilarious and offers non-stop laughter. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work perfectly together, they have been friends and real life co-workers for more than 20 years. The movie is in part, a musical. All (or most) of the music was written and performed by The D. All the songs are new material and many of them are classical. The soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. This movie will be appreciated mainly by Tenacious D fans, but if you're not a D fan, I still think you'll enjoy the movie. If you are a D fan, you should watch this movie. The acting is not as bad as you can think, and the laughter and rawness never stop appearing. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get their socks to shake and laugh as loudly as they've laughed in a long time. Look for the cameos of Dave Grohl, Ronnie James Dio, meatloaf, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly and Neil Hamburger. Also, stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits.
