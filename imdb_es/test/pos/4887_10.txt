Okay, I'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler, so I just checked the box to avoid problems. <br /> <br /> I've noticed that opinions about this movie seem to be a fair division. Personally, I loved it, although I must say that I think some of the cameos were there to have a cameo. (Peter Kay?) Personally, I am grateful that it was not the shows of Edward, Tubbs and Papa Lazarou, and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to head the film, especially Sir Goeff Tipps, possibly the most fun of all. the group. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is not so much a summary more as a rather obtuse thing as a blog, but what the hell, the movie was amazing, and I guess that's all that counts.
