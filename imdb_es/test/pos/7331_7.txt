Flipper is a nice movie for the whole family. Obviously it's not a great movie, Free Willy looks much better on almost every component of film making. Possibly, sometimes it becomes a bit naive, and the script and script are not the best part of the movie, but it is an entertaining movie with very good cinematography (including underwater shots) and some important moral messages. Elijah Wood proves once again as an incredibly talented and underestimated actor. It can make a bad movie can be seen, good movie, good, good, excellent and excellent film becomes an all-time classic. Paul Hogan's performance was also very good and he is completely fit for his role. As I said before, all the cinematography was very good. But underwater shots are definitely the best parts. So Flipper is a perfect way if you want to watch a nice, sweet and entertaining movie. If you like it, I will get sick and get tired of the modern Hollywood trash, full of sex, violence, vulgarity and blasphemy that you would probably like to see in this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7.7 of 10.
