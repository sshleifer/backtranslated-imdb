A very funny movie. The "doing" of Michael Douglas is worth watching this movie if it were not for another reason. I'd like to see him do more of these low-life papers. It was fantastic, as were all the artists. <br /> <br /> The movie seemed like an American Roshomon, only more fun and easy to watch because it was in America and did not need any kind of subtitles. br /> <br /> In a funny movie with a laugh every minute, two of the best were with John Goodman (not someone I'm crazy with): 1. He is telling the priest that Jewel is doing something he likes and he says "I had to erase the smile on my face". The visual shows that he does not smile and clearly is a boy who never smiles, but probably does not know it. 2. The scene at the end between Goodman, all prepared for Jewel with his police uniform, and dealing with the leather of Reiser hunched over a table ... and the two protesting that they are not homosexual with another character. Who happens at the scene? This alone deserved a special Award from the Academy of Comedy.
