Broken Silence or "Race Against Fear" (1998): Starring Ariana Richards, William Bumiller, Susan Blakely, Tracy Ellis Ross, Teryl Rothery, Scott Vickaryous, Marissa Rudiak, Ken Camroux, David Neale, Bruce Dawson ... Director Joseph Scanlan, Screenplay Sara Charmo, Jean Gennis, Phyllis Murphy. <br /> <br /> This is another film from the Lifetime channel, made exclusively for television, launched in 1998 and directed by the director of television series Joseph L. Scanlan. Inspired by true events, it is very much like most Lifetime movies, a cautionary tale for women, raising awareness about the predator that hides within the family (a mother, father, wife, husband) and a mentor (teacher, in this case coach of tracks). ). The young and little-known actress Ariana Richards (played the little girl in Jurassic Park) offers a very convincing performance as high school track athlete Mickey Carlyle, who was raped by her trainer, Kurt Ansom (William Bumiller) and must suffer Silently, no one believes his story, except, of course, his own mother (Susan Blakely). Together, mother and daughter struggle to put Kurt Ansom behind bars. The film is quite long, ultimately predictable, sometimes too melodramatic for the drama itself, but in the end it is really powerful. The performance of Ariana Richards is of the daytime soap type, but she is the strongest in the whole cast. Her facial expressions, her body language and her acting in general are realistic in terms of how she, as an aspiring athlete, idolizes her coach, in turn is raped by him and now must live with shame, trauma and more, fight with him in court. William Bumiller plays the role with a kind of unpleasant duplicity, although it is far from subtle. He has abused other star athletes before, who have remained silent and have reached the top, and seem seemingly innocent. William Bumiller, an actor less known than the others, has never played a role like this, but he has a credible and solid performance in general. It is especially disturbing to see him in this role because he is a sexy actor in everything else he does, including some lesser-known films and in the telenovela "Guiding Light". The only real problem I had with this movie is the way the movie is structured. When the movie starts, we see Coach Ansom about to rape Mickey, who tells us immediately that this guy is not good. But this makes for the development of the weak character and history. If the first scene had been the sequence with the initial credits in which we see Mickey running / trotting in the city through a lake, we would have a better development of the character because we do not know Coach Ansom, although it seems that we are interested in success. It is a really unpleasant job and we would have seen Mickey idolizing a person she thought he knew and then received a rude awakening when he realizes that he was wrong with him. Director Joseph Scanlan is no stranger to the drama of television (Knott's Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Leap, The Outer Limits, Lois and Clark, Earth Final Conflict and films like La Femme Nikitta.) In 1996, Scanlan had directed another film by life, similar to this, "Stand Against Fear" (1996), he manages to convey the seriousness of the event, we are really disturbed by the trainer lurking around the showers where he rapes his own student. to be seen by adults, audiences, but its message is clear: predators and sexual violators are not always strangers and can assume different forms, and their prey can include even a secondary school.This movie supports the cause of the fighting to prevent violence against women and urges women who have been silent victims to testify and fight so that rapists do not cause more harm to others. For example, this film does a great job in expressing its message and must be delivered to mothers, daughters, hello students of the gh school (including men and women). As bad as rape is, keeping quiet when it happens is even worse.
