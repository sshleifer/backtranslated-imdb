The director Don Siegel really impressed me with this movie. It is completely recorded, it is graphic without being visually graphic, well acted by all involved, and covers some of the most taboo topics of a day in an almost professional normality, almost expected until now not seen in any other film by this critic. I did not know what to expect to sit down to see this: a civil war movie or some kind of 70s traffic with Eastwood descending into a school for girls in the south. But in reality it is not one of those things, but the examination, exploration and descent into the soul of men and women, a dark comment on what is at the center of civilization. As one critic pointed out, none of the characters is nice at the end of the film and yet each one is interesting, complex and enigmatic. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a soldier of the Union found by the young Pamelyn Ferdin (she will recognize that voice as soon as he hears it), a girl in a school of manners directed by Geraldine Page in the midst of the chaos that was the Civil War, especially in the South. Soon, Page, the teacher Elizabeth Hartman, the charming and young seductive Carol, and even Ferdin (Amy) have emotional / sexual ties with Eastwood, each with their own needs, secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a good man. He plays the girls out of the other always trying to get the sexual advantage. In development we get some really interesting things that reveal themselves from latent lesbianism to incest. Beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that exceeded my expectations in all creative areas. This could be (with the exception of Invasion of the Body Snatchers) Siegel's best film. Without a doubt, it is one of the best real performances of Eastwood. The page is always very good and Hartman, Fe5rdin, et al excellent. The Gothic school is effectively claustrophobic. Some of the tormented sexual scenes. And what happens to Eastwood is an advantage in much of the competition for a spooky, creepy and demented movie.
