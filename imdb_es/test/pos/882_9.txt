Jewel Thief is a rare breed of films, completely noir in its history but nothing of noir about the presentation. A young Vinay, magnificently played by a newly raised Dev Anand in his forties, is separated from his police officer Dad and finds a job in a jewelry store. Soon people randomly approach him and call him Amar. Using only a few concise moments, the presence of a "doppelganger" is established. Then, a Shalini woman (Vyjayantimala) introduces herself and says she is committed to said doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar) who is so convinced that Vinay is in fact Amar, makes him take off his shoe and prove that it is not Aamr, the one with 6 fingers. The super cute daughter of jeweler Anju (Tanuja) is completely in love with Vinay. In the midst of all this confusion, there is a Jew-thief loose and he is stealing at will. Little by little we learned about Vinay's encounter with a super hot nightclub singer (Helen!) That the thief is Amar, the double. Many beautiful women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) are behind the hero. The police force, including Vinay's father, is completely stunned. Vinay is slowly falling for Shalini / Shalu and her brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to Sikkim, since that is where Amar's next robbery will take place. The rest is for you to see: the duplicate, the girls, the men who cling to every word of Vinay thinking that he is their boss Amar, the duo of loving sisters and brothers. Nothing seems entirely correct, and we need to tell the clever story (and Direction) of Vijay Anand to conclude this story in a very entertaining way. The film has numerous moments in which you will be surprised until they mix deliciously in a grand finale at a dance in a palace in Sikkim. <br /> <br /> I was not a great admirer of Vyjayanthi, but she is very competent here, although in her chubby she can join the confusion in the story in a subtle way, but it is better when she is sad or dancing. Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in this movie. I wanted so badly that she got the man. Dev was, well, Dev. If I was not walking like a man with a congenital defect in my shoulder (one shoulder always lower than the other) I would ask who they had found to imitate him! However, his style, charm and charisma were infallible. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look good by carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! Ashok Kumar was simply amazing: Dada Moni did not lose a single beat in the whole movie and turned this into one for the history books. <br /> <br /> SD Burman did magic with numbers like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen in an imitation of blood red cock dancing at the top of a bar), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera and me personal seductive number Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye. <br /> <br /> If you're wanting a great story, with more twists than a pretzel, wanting to keep guessing, but fun and entertaining, then buy or rent Jewel Thief. Better buy it, then you can go back and see it again with your friends. This is a guardian.
