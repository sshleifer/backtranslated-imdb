Personally, I can only agree with Stephen-12: please. It really does not make sense to try to "capture" this movie. I like movies where nothing (explicitly) happens. 'Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes' by Herzog has the same nothing, although that film is less convincing, since the climaxes are rather at the beginning of the story, so Herzog had to focus on nature in front of Kinski. However, Morte a Venezia is completely different, since it has several climaxes, turns, etc. In fact, from the point where Aschenbach's luggage is lost, the film almost rushes towards its grand finale (its last grains of sand begin to run through the hourglass after the moment of happiness, where it fantasizes about warning to the Polish family and caressing Tadzio's hair). <br /> <br /> You can, if you wish, look for some keys / real symbols in this (your attempt to leave behind your luggage from the moment it arrives, the Tadzio points out at the end, the fact that in The whole movie content and form are completely franchised, but it does not make sense to do it: it will not make the film better or worse, since its strength lies in the whole hangover of the story, which is never made explicit. history, the decadence of Europe, the end of the "romantic era", as we have come to know, which has proven to be only the beginning (individual emotions and expression are more important now than ever), but wait, right now I am beginning to develop the only (small) flaw of the film: the parts "let's talk about art." Now there is one thing that I never do, I think it could have been expressed by other means, and I think it's already very clear in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not like explicit movies. I can read books, so I do not want a story that simply refers to my reasoning. I prefer movies that you can not explain with words, but only in the movie (Lynch's Lost Highway, Weir's Picknick in Hanging Rock and Roeg's Man Who Fall to Earth also belong to this category), by then, and only then, has a reason for It exists as a film and not only as a book. So, what about the Thomas Mann novel? I have never read it, but forget it! The film offers a different point of view: it says things that can never be said in a book. Use the art of the film to make you feel, through images and music, the same thing that Mann made you feel, using text. Worlds equally bright, but different.
