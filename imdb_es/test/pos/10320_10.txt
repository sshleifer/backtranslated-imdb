Almost without a doubt the best short of Three Stooges with Shemp, 'Brideless Groom' is as good as any of the best shorts of the trio with Curly. Memorable moments of Stooge abound. The opening with 'Professor' Shemp giving voice lessons to Miss Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green), untalented and lascivious, grimacing at her horrendous singing notes and rejecting her advances, is an excellent example of the best of Shemp Howard. Many considered it the most fun of the Stooges. <br /> <br /> Later, when Moe and Larry try to help him find a wife (and claim $ 500,000), Shemp thinks he has his head cut off. when your mirror is turned back. Fixing the mirror, he screams in relief, "There I am, and pretty as a picture!" "Yes," Moe responds quickly, trying to fold his pants, "from an APE!" <br /> <br /> The best scene (and perhaps the best of Shemp with the trio) comes when he makes a call to the attractive young Miss. Hopkins (Christine McIntyre). Confusing him with the lost "Primo Basil", she smothers him with hugs and kisses (which also leads to a fun moment between Moe and Larry in the hallway), without giving her the opportunity to explain her true identity. Suddenly, the real Primo Basilio calls her and she goes crazy, repeatedly slaps him and accuses him of taking advantage of "a poor" defenseless "helpless"! The final line is delivered while she hits him on the jaw (with a real blow, according to Shemp and the crew members), knocking him through the door and into the hallway with a perfectly executed gag. "What happened, child?" Moe asks. "Can I help you if I'm not a basil cousin?" Shemp asks before fainting. <br /> <br /> Other classic bits include that Moe and Shemp are entangled in a phone booth, trying to find a lost coin, and Larry is slapped by Shemp's bad looks (his face pressed against the glass booth phone ), and the big girl fights in the apartment of the Justice of the Peace. The great Emil Sitka offers his classic line (inscribed on his tombstone), "Take your hands, you love the birds" over and over again while your apartment is shattered. <br /> <br /> I prescribe 'Boyfriend without bridge' as medicine for all Who believes that the years of glory of the Stooges ended when Curly left. It is true that Shemp did not have MANY short films with the group as Curly, but that was due to a growing lack of support from Columbia and his age (and that of others). When Shemp was healthy and the trio was given decent material to work on, they were still at the top of their game.
