The slasher subgenre has been quite exhausted: in fact, even in 1979, just a year after the so-called 'first slasher' was launched, Halloween (which was launched seven years after Bay of Blood); the subgenre was not far from running out; But Tourist Trap represents one of the most original departures. The film follows the same basic formula as most slashers, that is, the madman murders a group of children, but takes its originality from the fact that the madman is shown from the beginning (as opposed to an invisible assailant or a man with a mask) and actually get an idea of ​​his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities, including being able to control the wax mannequins that fill his house, adds to the originality. We begin with a great opening sequence, in which a young man is seen to get rid of having a flat tire after being in a gas station of terror. The scene is incredibly spooky, as the wax mannequins make fun of him and things fly off the shelves, and he gives the audience a great idea of ​​what's to come; I mean, a very scary horror movie! <br /> <br /> The credibility of acting is as non-existent as one would expect from a seventies slasher, but to be honest; It's not so bad Girls look hot, boys do not really matter; and Chuck Connors is more than spooky enough in the psychopath's role. He is not exactly Anthony Perkins; But still, good enough. However, it is not the performance that leads the show and, as expected, the spooky atmosphere takes that prize. The wax models, as shown by the likes of House of Wax (version by Vincent Price ...) are very scary; And the movie makes better use of that fact. There are very few things in the cinema that can scare you just for being there, but wax statues are definitely one of those things. The killer's special ability could have easily gotten in the way of the atmosphere, but the movie makes better use of this fact, even by making several things come off the shelves and doing well with the rest of the movie. In general, this is a very good movie. While the tourist trap may not be absolutely essential to see; It's worth seeing and I recommend it.
