This movie could be compared to the "comfort food" for the soul. Anyone who has tried and tried to save a relationship could relate to this movie. Many parts are so funny and so many parts are so truly heartbreaking. It is not perfect in its production or even in its dialogue, but the story is unique, which says a lot for modern "romantic" comedies. Luke Wilson is, at best, insipid, but Heather Graham does an exceptional job in my opinion. Try it, despite the three-dimensional cover of the DVD. The character of Joline poses many problems in our self-service culture. She asks us if the commitment is really for the other person or for ourselves. In truth, we are ourselves. Fulfilling promises (from marriage to a friend's message) is a great feeling. In addition, our word is no more than a cloud of smoke that changes shape. Joline is like a wake-up call. We must be aware of our words and commitments, they mean more than we think. At the same time, we should not compromise with someone who is unable to do the same.
