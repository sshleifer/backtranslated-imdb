Even though this movie is 11 years old, I rented it yesterday, and it seemed like a really moving movie. The story of true friendship in front of a very real monster is an inspiration and quite moving. <br /> <br /> Although I did not care much about the amount of language used by some of the young actors, especially Renfro - I understand that art is imitating life. Renfro, once again, does a magnificent job of the rough and tough, very (and I mean VERY) annoying imbecile (his role in The Client comes to mind), and Mazzello does a wonderful job of witty, somewhat peculiar , Dexter - a child who realizes that his life must end too soon. <br /> <br /> While there are so many moving and funny moments in the movie, I must say that my favorite was when the boys were cornered by Pony in the abandoned church, and Dexter (Mazzello) was cut off, saying that his blood It was poison. Although it is very ingenious and somewhat funny to see an adult man running away from two small children, it is one of the most difficult scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> Definitely, take a look at this, but prepared with your Kleenex. I'll need it!
