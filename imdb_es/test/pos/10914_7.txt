Hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as lepers. In condemning homosexuality, the film industry has reflected only what the repressive society of its time defended as an ideology. For example, in the 1962 Otto Preminger melodrama "Advise and Consent", the direct actor Don Murray was chosen as a queer congressman who commits suicide instead of confessing his alternative lifestyle. The characters in the gay movie have covered a lot of ground from "Advise and consent". In the 1997 film "In & Out" (** 1/2 of ****), heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is chosen as a homosexual teacher who comes out on the day of his wedding. While the conservative Hollywood of yesteryear stipulated that the queer congressman in "Counseling and consent" had to commit suicide, today's liberal Hollywood dictates that the gay English teacher should be accepted instead of being maced. <br /> <br /> Basically, "In & Out" preaches good citizenship with the attire of a politically correct comedy. Director Frank Oz and guitarist Scott Rudnick endorse honesty as the best policy, because honesty always guarantees happiness. High school teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline of "The Big Chill") will be happy only after he comes out, like his fianc√©e Emily (Joan Cusack), who was once fat but is now thin, will only feel Happy when She can leave her diet. Ultimately, the film argues that heterosexual society will accept homosexuals when homosexuals can act with greater honesty and frankness about themselves. The happy gay journalist stenographer played by heterosexual actor Tom Selleck here effectively dramatizes this open-minded comment. <br /> <br /> Rudnick's light script embellishes the true life incident that occurred at the Oscars when Tom Hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher. In "In & Out," Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a blond, bimbo-style actor Brad Pitt, wins the Oscar for impersonating a fruity foot soldier. Drake pays homage to his mentor Howard Brackett during his acceptance speech. Without wanting to stop there, sincere Cameron reveals to a live television audience that Howard is gay! Suspicion, paranoia and horror began when the media descended on the city of Green Leaf, Indiana. (When would a sexual deviation from a nameless high school English teacher arouse so much media concern?) Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck from "High Road to China") hides among those reporters, and he wants to do an exclusive one week in Howard. Howard, however, does not want to have anything to do with the means of witch hunting, especially the annoying Peter Malloy. Howard denies all of Drake's homosexual charges to everyone, including his girlfriend and her mother. Malloy stops because he smells a spoonful. The revelation has turned Green Leaf. High school principal Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart) nervously writhes with all the media coverage. Halliwell warns Howard that if his marriage was not imminent, he would have to give him a pink receipt. Meanwhile, Peter bets Howard that his marriage to Emily will fail at the last moment and he will be there to record the result on camera. <br /> <br /> Howard turns to audio tapes about macho men. He struggles to reform himself. But Howard's efforts are useless. Guilt swells inside him. And then there is Peter Malloy, who irritates him to clarify his homosexuality. Finally, before the altar in God's sight, Howard explodes. Of course, the future wife Emily Montgomery is surprised by Howard's gay confession. As expected, the school dismisses Howard, but he shows up for graduation. Drake appears, too, and rushes to Brackett's defense. Not only has the school deprived Howard of his work, but he has also been awarded the teacher of the year award to someone else. Drake appeals to the director and beats Howard for unanimous community support. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in the script devised by Rudnick is Howard himself. Rudnick has created a character too chaste to be true, either by gray or straight standards. Howard Brackett is presented more as a saint than a sinner. Help a student to enter the university and train the athletic team. How often do you also learn that an English teacher doubles as a coach? Everyone in his high school loves Howard. He does not have a bad bone in his body. Also, Rudnick and Oz ask us to believe that no one else in Green Leaf is gay. Where are Howard's gay friends? Are you too scared to come out in your defense? No, "In & Out" is not strictly aimed at homosexual audiences. Oz, whose film credits include cute comedies such as "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and "House Sitter", as well as Rudnick are reeling on a politically correct tightrope. "In & Out" is not a gay recruitment movie. The filmmakers show no interest in what led Howard or Peter Malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Rudnick are only interested in propping up a thin premise: is it or is not it gay? They are specified to imply the response of the community to the response. Finally, when Howard admits that he is gay, the filmmakers dedicate the rest of the films to show how a conservative people, in the style of Norman Rockwell can accept it despite their difference. <br /> <br /> The most shocking scenes in "In & Out" is probably when the sensationalist journalist Malloy makes a lip lock on Howard. Heterosexual men kissing in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as funny as they are fake. Kline and Selleck move their faces together in what looks more like a head-on collision than a closed-mouth kiss. Nothing like the controversial 1994 British film "Priest", "In & Out" emerges as an attractive but laborious piece of social propaganda with its message of approval. If "Ellen" were not the equivalent of TV, "In & Out" would probably address TV as a new situation comedy. Seeing "In & Out" is not so much about the subject of homosexuals or heterosexuals, but about how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century. What makes "In & Out" a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal opportunity to cheers and boos about queers and steers.
