Not all films are worthy of Oscar, but let's face it, sometimes this type of movie is more fun to watch and leaves a longer and longer lasting impression. This left me smiling and happy and I could not wait to hug my own son. Anyone who has had a pet (regardless of type) knows how it feels to lose one. I think most people would identify with Buddy almost losing his best friend he raised since birth. Bruce Willis was great when the mogul became a good boy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother. The little boy who played Buddy had a cherub face, and his sister and friend Edgar played great roles. I really liked the movie and it was something that the whole family could enjoy. Thank you!
