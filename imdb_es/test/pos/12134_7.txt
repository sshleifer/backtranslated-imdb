Has anyone ever read or heard comments from Scorsese or David Chase (Soprano Executive Producer) about "Death Collector / Family Enforcer"? I bought the DVD after not having seen it for a while on cable (like 20 years), but after having seen "Goodfellas" and all the "Sopranos" executed to date. In retrospect, both men must have seen Death Collector / Family Enforcer and absorb the flavor, perhaps inspiring the tone of their masterpieces, which are the polar opposite of the Godfather's romantic trilogy. Being a Jersey type, it is interesting to see how the Jersey prairies have evolved since the mid-70s. It is not the marshy landfill that it used to be, although occasionally a body appears on a local waterway. Also, it's a bit bittersweet to see a newly built World Trade Center on the other side of the river in the opening and closing scene. Who could have imagined it?
