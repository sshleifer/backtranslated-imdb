I recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase I'm going through. I was born in 1980, so the film from the mid-80s to the mid-90s occupies a very important place in my growth. <br /> <br /> This particular movie was one of my favorites, and I was thrilled when it became available in the UK. It has not gotten worse over time, it's still a very funny movie, with a lot of emotion in its own way. Sure, it pales in the shadow of bigger and bigger budget movies, but do not let that stop you from enjoying this. <br /> <br /> It's worth a rental or even a purchase at the discount prices you'll find. for.
