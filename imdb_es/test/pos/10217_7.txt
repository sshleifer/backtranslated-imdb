Let me say from the beginning that I am not a particular fan of this type of film, but Nightbreed has a certain fascination for me with a message about perspective. <br /> <br /> In the old days, the people who Inhabited Midian would have been called Zombies, the undead. And according to what Clive Barker has given to certain members of humanity, in this Craig Sheffer are born with the potential to become part of that world. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist David Cronenberg at first seemed like a professional manners man. It has taken a fanatical mission to rid the world of the Nightbreed. He tricks the police into killing Sheffer, but Sheffer goes to a cemetery called Midian Cemetery, where the Nightbreed congregate and live underground. <br /> <br /> Sheffer has also left a girlfriend, Anne Bobby, who still feels something for him even after he was murdered and is now one of the undead. She tries in her little way to be a bridge for humanity. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker's creatures are pretty horrible and are not particularly human-loving. But it is easy to see that if the humans left them alone, the Nightbreed in turn do not bother with them. <br /> <br /> Their sympathies are definitely with Nightbreed, especially after seeing a fan like Cronenberg and Police Chief Charles Haid. action. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker has been a gay man for some time and some have suggested to me that Nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people. I can see where that would come from, especially because there are a lot of people who do not even think of gay people as something human because they are taught that way. <br /> <br /> The Nightbreed awarded is pretty bloody with lots of gratuitous violence, but it also makes you think and I like the way Clive Barker spins traditional theology and makes Craig Sheffer a kind of messiah for the creatures Nightbreed.
