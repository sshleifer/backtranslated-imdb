Nice to see a comedy for adults. Structured masterfully by Aaron Sorkin through the own domain of Mike Nichols. Mr. Nichol's domain is to present characters in all their shocking truth, from the sad and fascinating Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" to the sad and fascinating Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law and Natalie Portman in "Closer ". In "The War of Charlie Wilson" the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and fascinating Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are at the service of something else, it is personal to some extent. Hanks has to bury his brilliance in the individual malts and Julia Roberts organizes parties and presents characters with blatant frankness. Amy Adams testifies and exists as a character, testifying. An unsurpassable task that Miss Adams manages to overcome, to perfection. However, it was Gus by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who monopolized my attention. His character may not be the first, but he is the first in the way Hoffman presented him to us. Someone who survives the indifference with which he is treated by the absolute conviction that he is more intelligent than all together. Hoffman is excellent. The rhythm of the story helps enormously not to fall into a lot of useless questions. A sharp, short, intelligent, sad comedy and when was the last time I could say that?
