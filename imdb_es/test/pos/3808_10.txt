This is an entertaining road movie surreal. It was written by Joseph Minion, who also wrote After Hours, the excellent surrealist film by Martin Scorsese. The film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old boy named Gus, who drives a red Ford Mustang through some fictitious states with names like Tristana (A tribute to Luis Bu√±uel's movie, maybe?), Essex and South Lyndon , looking for Eight Motorama game cards from several Chimera Company service stations. The movie has a surreal feel because many of the things are unusual, like money, for example, like a blank paper with numbers on it. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters are unpleasant for Gus on his trip. They tattoo it, they hit it, but this does not stop the child in his tireless search. Some extravagant actors such as David Lynch, incumbent Jack Nance, Meat Loaf & Flea also make appearances. Jack Nance plays the owner of a motel, who when he meets Gus says: "If you see a squirrel, give it to me." This is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes Gus $ 100; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking rudely. If you are a fan of Twin Peaks and Surrealist movies, you will like this. A little weird jewel of a movie.
