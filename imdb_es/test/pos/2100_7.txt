Nice combination of giant monsters and samurai genres. The giant monster Majin, god of the mountain, is a distant and forbidden figure that looks very much like the God of the Old Testament, who rains destruction and punishment to those who desecrate his sacred land, but it is interesting to note that what finally awakens him is not the suffering of the people but a sharp and personal insult. It is beautifully photographed, with a solid performance, large miniatures and a wonderful score of the great Akira Ifukube. Majin is not a monster over 400 feet like Godzilla: he is 2 1/2 times the normal size, so the evil samurai who steps on the ground can see his disdainful eyes as he supports his strength and breaks it into pieces. Not much in terms of extras, but it's good to see this forgotten minor classic rescued and restored to digital format.
