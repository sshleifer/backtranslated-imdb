A genuinely spooky ghost story, full of chills and sensuality, this movie does not deliver what it promises. Apparently it is based on an old ghost story, and perhaps it is based too much on a simple premise. For most of the way, it's imaginative and genuinely exciting, but in the end it's almost as if Oshima simply loses interest in him and takes him to a quick end. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so they can be together. But their failure of nerve and their returning ghost condemn them to madness. It is beautifully handled, with imaginative scenes, and the passion of the lovers is portrayed beautifully. But all too often, the film really does not keep its promise, almost as if Oshima were disoriented in the same way that lovers do. <br /> <br /> It's a movie worth seeing just to see how Oshima combines his great filmmaking skills with some exploding movie tricks to attract the audience, but unfortunately it's not a true classic in the mold from movies like Onibaba or Woman of the Dunes.
