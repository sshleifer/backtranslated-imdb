No film could do justice to Faulkner's command of the English language. But they did a good job here. Lucas Beauchamp is exactly as I imagined in the book, like Chick. What the film really could not get into was that blacks did not like Beauchamp, because he was just as stubborn. Not that it's a bad thing, but from my opinion about the book that was his attitude towards the world (however, I had the feeling that it was the racism of the white society that started it and spread to black society, which became his attitude towards everyone). <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is that you can see the county of Yoknapatawpha (actually, Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as Faulkner wrote it (the film was made when Faulkner was alive and writing). It does not seem very different today. Just for this, it's worth watching the movie, since it's filmed in Faulkner's backyard. A true must-see for Faulkner fans.
