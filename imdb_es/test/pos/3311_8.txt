Is it a bad soap opera, lascivious, predictable, in bad taste and salacious? "Best of all" is such a guilty pleasure for me, something like "Valley of the Dolls". I mean, "Better" has it all. Someone drinks, stabbings, jealousy and even a tragic but not entirely unexpected death of marriage becomes pregnant (when was the last time you heard that phrase?), There are issues everywhere. <br /> <br /> Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delightful Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the events. Its chemistry is immediate and it is the glue that prevents this film from becoming too fragmented. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker, the magnificent former fashion model, appears as Gregg Adams, an aspiring actress, a role as any biography you've read about it apparently was not too extensive. But Parker does a surprisingly credible job here, rather than defending himself in a couple of scenes with Louis Jourdan, who plays David Savage. Jourdan probably took this role for the money and credit of the special screen because it was clearly directed to the star / who has been on the road. <br /> <br /> Diane Baker is fine as naive, gullible April Morrison, Martha Hyer as Barbara Lemont has a particularly juicy plot, and film legend Joan Crawford chews his usual scenario as Amanda Farrow portion, another paper, like Savand de Jourdan, which Crawford probably took for the paycheck. <br /> <br /> Obviously, there are some dialogue and plot devices dated (this is 1959), and the predictability of the telenovela genre. But if you like a good soap like me, "The best of everything" will satisfy you.
