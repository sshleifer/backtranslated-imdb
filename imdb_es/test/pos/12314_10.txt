It is not often that the last film of a great director becomes a touching masterpiece, brilliantly performed and filmed. The cast is excellent, as is the work of the camera. What begins as a happy reunion of a group of well-educated citizens of a Dublin of the early twentieth century becomes a dark and philosophical narrative about all our fear of death and the dark shadows of the past sometimes. Thank you, Mr. Huston, for this last piece of great cinema!
