This is one of the best solo comedies of Stan Laurel, before the association of 1927 with Oliver Hardy. Laurel is a very good actor in the movie, and provides good comedy. The best scene in the film is when Stan dances with Mae Laurel (his common law wife) at Café Español. Stan does silly dances that are fun, without you listening to the music. I will recommend it to any Stan Laurel fan.
