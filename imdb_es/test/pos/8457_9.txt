The first thing you see in this movie is a static angle (one that will be repeated later in the film), which shows the chaos that happens (without being seen by the public) in a studio that broadcasts news. Shortly after, the typical story of the Fonda character is shown, in that same angle. Do not let this fool you; the film is not about a reporter, a woman who struggles to be successful in a profession dominated by men. That's just an introduction, a way to start the movie (although it's used later). The real point of this production is gradually revealed, and the first thing we see is in a deliberately long scene from the beginning. The whole movie has that rhythm; not slow or prolonged, but deliberate. It is never really fast, even in the few sequences that one would normally expect to be like that. This rhythm (especially because it seems to slow down even more as the plot is revealed, since the disturbing and disturbing nature of the film is unraveled) is strong, almost painful for the viewer. It inspires you, if it were possible, to jump on the screen, grab the people responsible for the necklace and yell at them to * do * something about it, to remedy the situation. I never wanted to get up or even look away from the screen for a moment. It is very important to keep in mind the subject, and it is perfectly here. Without excessive dramatizations (well ... very little, anyway), just an accurate presentation of the problem. The direction is amazing. The empathy felt by Lemmon's character is profound. The editing is masterful ... a scene near the end illustrates it perfectly. The editor, judging by his filmography, is very underestimated. The writing was excellent. The performance was excellent, particularly by Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas (who also produced it). The lack of a score is perfect; No music is needed to improve. The ending is sublime and effective. The film has some negative points ... among them, some of the dialogues are, obviously, and without a doubt, an exhibition, a particular part of the film, although dramatic, does not seem to fit with something that follows it. Not everyone will see the movie because of two characteristics of it that are commonly (and rightly) attributed to bad movies; the rhythm (which can be confused with being slow) and the (lack of) punctuation. It could be argued that to be something negative, since everyone should consider the points it presents, but maybe it is better that way; handle the heavy theme with intelligence and respect (both for the subject and for the viewer) ... something like this, maybe should not be spoon-fed. I was fascinated with the movie, and I was very surprised. I recommend it to anyone who considers himself strong enough to handle it. 9/10
