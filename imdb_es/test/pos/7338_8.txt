"The Gymnast" is developed in short shots and short scenes, revealing their characters and messages over time. The spare edition is accompanied by a beautiful and simple score. This intimate approach is wonderful to feel as if you are on a path of discovery as much as the characters. <br /> <br /> The spare approach is also its drawback; There are some scenes that are confusing because they do not have enough context. There are some decisions made by the characters that looked rather like cartwheels until I saw the interviews that were in the bonus materials. I'm glad I did, because the actors' descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more complete understanding of the film in general. <br /> <br /> Aside from the story itself, it was wonderful to see women like that Comfortable and strong in their own bodies. The shooting was done with very good taste; very in fact One has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfolding, not a voyeuristic sleaze movie. The physicality of the athletes, their reality, is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> It is not a film that I should see again soon, since the story is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time.
