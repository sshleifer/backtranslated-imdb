This film is about a teenager struggling with his social status in school. He is a "good Christian" and feels that he is missing out on all the fun in high school. So he wishes he had never become one. After getting his wish and trying a mundane lifestyle, he realizes that his quality of life has drastically decreased and he wants to be the person he once was. Good family oriented movie with a positive message of being proud of who you are, even if you are not the most popular.
