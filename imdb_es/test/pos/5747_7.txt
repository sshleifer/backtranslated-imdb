This is a very "successful" movie that offers everything almost in your face. I am a Christian and I liked the movie in a way. He had an average performance of the main person, and it was a low budget as can be clearly seen. It may be a bit long, but the movie has some pretty good cars that rescue it from a lower rating on my part. As a Christian movie it was quite good, but maybe a little right in the message. The movie works better on a large screen. * SPOILERS * The fight scene with the two brothers can remind you of the fight scene between the two brothers in the Christian thriller "Mercy Streets", starring Eric Roberts. * End of Spoiler * I give it a 7/10.
