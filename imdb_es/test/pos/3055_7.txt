The movie is not half as bad as people want you to believe it is. <br /> <br /> What is the reason why so many people hate this movie? Is it because it's the last of Laurel and Hardy together and it's not the best? Or is it due to Laurel and Hardy's lack of regular customers? Or because it's not made by Hal Roach or 20th Century Fox studios? <br /> <br /> Definitely true that this movie is not a successful attempt to revive Laurel & Hardy and take them to the '50s. It is also definitely true that the film is far from the best, but honestly, the film is still entertaining, so this film is also far from being the worst. It is not the movie of 'goodbye' more dignified, but a goodbye entertaining and adequate despite everything. Both withdrew from the movies after completing this one. <br /> <br /> The film still presents some great moments and the chemistry between Laurel and Hardy is obviously very present. It also makes this movie better than most of his films together in the '40s. Surprisingly, the slapstick humor still works as well as it does, considering that the slapstick comedy days were over, since the 30s. <br /> <br /> The story may not be as entertaining as it could have been and It presents too many cronies and characters, with the result that the film loses its focus on children sometimes. A pity, because they are still the ones who really wear and make the film. <br /> <br /> It's sad to see how poor Stan Laurel was at the time of making this movie. He really looked sick and old, which of course he was too. I was already over 60 years old. But after surgery, he recovered completely and still lived for another 15 years, before dying in 1965, 8 years after his good friend Oliver Hardy. <br /> <br /> An entertaining goodbye, though not perfect, for children, Laurel & Hardy and the end of 3 decades of fun, humorous and quality entertainment with movies that are still being watched and loved by people from all the world. <br /> <br /> 7/10
