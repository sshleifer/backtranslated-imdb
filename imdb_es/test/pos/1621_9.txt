I recently received the film and all I can say is that it is a good movie. There are many famous monuments of Rome and historical places. It is from the same writer and director of the Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks stars with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The film begins with the experiment of space and time in Sweden until one of the boats is stolen by the most hated enemy of the church, the Illuminati. The plot is difficult to discuss without spoiling anything. It is a race all over Rome that follows the trail of the Illuminati to reach the secret meeting place of the Illuminati. While running against time to find the path of the Illuminati. In general, it is a movie that is worth seeing hell, I saw it 3 times and I still like it, so in the end, buy it. It's much better than the 2010 movie. And the ending has an impressive plot twist.
