Fuckland is an interesting movie. Personally I love the dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems that he has already died. Many critics did everything possible to close it. I do not know why it's the most interesting movement that has happened in the film world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne and Mifune. They were all great, Festen was a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland does not live up to those others. I was fascinated with cinema. It is played as if it were a real documentary, with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to leave it. In some points of the film, it is clear that it is a complete work of fiction, but that illusion lasted for an amazing time. I wish the filmmakers had devised something more interesting to put on the screen. It's basically about this guy, Fabian, who is an Argentine who visits the Faulkland Islands. Argentines were only allowed to enter the islands in recent months and Fabián plans to impregnate women with Argentine children. He puts his eyes on one, and most of the film is spent on his seduction. The two actors are very natural. Camilla Heany only gives a kind of clue that she is an actress. Fabian Stratas seems completely real. The politics of the film is somewhat confusing to me, since I only have an idea of ​​the situation surrounding the island and its recent history. I was 3 years old, I think, when the Faulklands were invaded. The final part of the movie does not work at all. I do not understand what the filmmakers were going there for. Still, Fuckland is an interesting Dogma experiment. However, it does break some rules of Dogma, particularly the rule of non-diagetic extra music. There is a lot of that. 7/10.
