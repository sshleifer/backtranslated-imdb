Malcolm McDowell diagnoses that the daughter of Megan Gallagher and she have a form of disease, when they believe they are watching "The Huldre", troll-like creatures that live with "rocks and roots" (to quote the film). <Br /> <br /> Basically, a family moves into an older house, which has a smaller dollhouse in the backyard. The daughter (well played by Sofia Vassiliova) begins to befriend the creatures, until they become vengeful. The family cat also disappears. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes with Megan Gallagher ("Millennium") and Malcolm McDowell as a psychiatrist. There is also something strange that happened to one of McDowell's patients. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this kind of story, you may also like "Bad Ronald", which had a strange similar theme, and the house is delighted. for the evil Ronald (Scott Jacoby) only that movie is from the 70's. 7/10.
