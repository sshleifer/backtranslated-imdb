The death of Visconti in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. While we observe, we recognize that we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Death in Venice, infinitely opulent, surely is; But in other important ways, it's an unsatisfactory movie. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and from the distance of von Aschenbach's literary career and his production; in his imperious manner, his self-conscious behavior programmed layer by layer. When Tadzio appears and the obsession arises, it is evident that Aschenbach has no idea who he is under his Golden Age ornaments and his carefully tended life. In fact, upon seeing Tadzio, the 'Solitaire', as Mann sometimes calls it, is divided into two. Aschenbach No. 1 absorbs the sight of a beautiful boy of 14 years, then tries to intellectually process the dizzying jolt of blood pressure as a work of art, a "divine" work of art. But Aschenbach No. 2, emerges as a stalker who takes control and then replaces the rational Aschenbach No. 1. Like the original Aschenbach, his sexual doppelganger is mortified to make human contact with the object of his obsession, and so Tadzio . it remains a distant ideal. Thomas Mann has no mercy on this game. Each fragment of self-knowledge arrives too strong and too late; the excitement of the sexual flush is too great to resist. That Venice is trapped by illness does not mean anything to Aschenbach, except that his game now has more bets. When he finally whispers under the breath "I love you", he knows that everything is lost and that the abyss awaits you. Can you film some of this? Maybe, and Visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look the other way. But there are mistakes: he and Dirk Bogarde create Aschenbach as sympathetic; Mann, again, he did not. The Aschenbach POV dominates the film and we are expected to identify ourselves. But nowhere on the screen is there a man being separated from within. Bogarde alternates between the controlled sublime and the ridiculously temperamental with ease, but what's below? Bogard's reactive performance has no tie. Mann writes a character that, in his imagination, is doing the Dance of the Seven Veils, very aware of the consequences that invites freedom, but at the same time, unable to resist. In addition, the Visconti script creates a character that is not in the original, Alfred, a friend of Aschenbach, to dramatize Mann's discussion of art and artists. These scenes are badly written disasters, and the actor who plays Alfred is hard to see. In addition, Vischen's Aschenbach is a Teutonic composer of the Golden Age, which I think works for the film; and Mahler's symphonies replace the Aschenbach novels. The great music of Mahler unfortunately is badly recorded and very badly interpreted. So death in Venice, as Visconti gives it to us, is not the complete success it could have had, but as a purely visual experience it can not be denied its power. All film students, especially cinematography, will want to take a look.
