I was a Marine at Camp Pendleton when the D.I. came out (1st Marine Division, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Battery). I still remember being in line with a group of other Marines to watch the movie at the "Star" theater in Oceanside, California. <br /> <br /> We did not remotely wait for the film to portray everything we experienced on the training field but we were all pleasantly surprised at how good the film was. The idea of ​​using real marines in the movie was a great idea (I think they were also true instructional instructors). As good as actor Jack Webb was, he simply could not "call cadence" as a true marine drilling instructor. <br /> <br /> We all laughed when the mother of the "problem" recruit came to training camp to talk to the captain. Never in a million years would this have happened, but that is Hollywood, and we did not allow that episode to prevent us from enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> I went to a training camp at MCRD in San Diego during the summer of 1956, and at that time there were virtually no limits as to what the IDs could do to you. The "Ribbon Creek" event on Parris Island still did not affect the training camp, at least not at MCRD - San Diego. <br /> <br /> I agree with what many of the other reviewers have commented on the sergeant. The "stiffness" of Moore around his girlfriend. I think this was just Webb's acting style, and although they could have eliminated this part of the movie, it did not really affect the production much. <br /> <br /> A minor note, the (uncredited) character of "Pvt. Rodriguez" was played by one of my drill instructors, the sergeant. Peter J. O'Neill. Sergeant O'Neill used to tell us that someday he wanted to be an actor. We secretly laughed at this, but he surprised us all. He was a great mock instructor, and I thought he did well in his small part. In addition, he really enjoyed throwing knives. He often showed us his skill that summer in the training camp. Many times I have asked myself if he is still alive.
