After renting One True Thing the other night, I have learned to respect my family and not take their health for granted. I've never seen a real-life portrait of a victim of cancer on the screen like Meryl's. She deserves the Oscar nomination, but she has some tough competitors in the race. All I can say is a beautiful movie, a great performance by Streep and Zellwegger. Meryl Streep revealed her true ability in this excellent movie!
