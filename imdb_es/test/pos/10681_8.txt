The trip to the other side of the Sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the Sun that shares the same orbit as the Earth and, therefore, has not been discovered until a space probe on the other side of the Sun Photography. Of course, it sends two astronauts (Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry) to explore it, but due to a malfunction, they crash and return to Earth only 3 weeks after their six week trip. Of course they are reprimanded (at least Thinnes is, Hendry is seriously wounded) and they are interrogated and asked why they rejected their mission, but they claim that they did not. Until Thinnes seems to notice some very strange things about being back at "home". This is excellent, although somewhat trivial at times, and the sets and the sensation are not very far from the territory of the "Thunderbirds", but they will live as actors for once. It is not a big "Star Wars" type production, but a quieter science fiction one in which you have to think a bit. It is worth seeing and it is criminal that the DVD is sold out. 8 out of 10.
