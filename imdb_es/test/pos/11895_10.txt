This movie is a perfect action / drama / and thriller movie, each scene has impacted you. I saw this movie and I was surprised by the number of talented actors in the film. Damian Chapa was great, especially, he played his role perfectly. The story was made for these actors. The characters make the film so realistic. This movie simply gets an A plus from me. Undoubtedly, look at this movie, compare yourself to Scarface, but it has a deeper story. This movie not only gives you a good picture of the gangster's life, but also provides the characters. Emotions, and in the end you really feel for the main character. Watch this movie!
