How many movies are there where you can think when you see a movie like this? I can not count them, but it seems that the movie makers were trying to give me a clue. They reminded me so many times of other films that it became a great distraction. One of the memorable lines borrowed came from a 2003 film - Day after tomorrow. A line by itself is not that bad, but this movie takes so many movies that it becomes a serious risk. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie! Despite his falls, there is enough to make it interesting and perhaps make him look smart. While borrowing so much from other movies, it never goes overboard. In fact, you're probably hitting the hatches and handling the storm. Why? ... Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I've never been a fan of Kutcher and I almost gave up on him in The Guardian, but he emerged in a good way. Costner takes the film to perfection with the best Costner ability. I do not think Mrs. Robinson had anything to do with her success. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast played their parts well. I had no problem with any of them at the end. But some of these characters were used too much. <br /> <br /> From now on, I can only make a thorough selection, so I will save you the wear and tear. Enjoy the movie, the parts that work, work well enough to keep your head above water. Just do not expect a smooth trip. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 but almost 6.
