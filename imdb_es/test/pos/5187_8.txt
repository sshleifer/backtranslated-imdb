I recently bought it on a DVD, since I had not heard it and like Robert Carlyle. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie will not have Hollywood special effects, saying that even though the special effects were decent enough. , and the performance was good too. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was nice and I do not regret having bought it, because with almost 2 hours duration it's just the right duration for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect an exciting explosive action from start to finish, it's a pretty well-balanced movie with a pretty decent story!
