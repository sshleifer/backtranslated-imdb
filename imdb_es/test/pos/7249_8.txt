Therefore, it may not be completely historical. And there is little or no actual development of the character. But for the first try of Jake (son of Ridley) Scott, it's worth the price of the ticket. <br /> <br /> Captain James MaCleane (Jonny Lee Miller, who looks as good as ever) can be a gentleman, but he has not. I got the money or the clothes to prove it. Plunkett (Robert Carlyle with all his clothes on) is an apothecary turned into an outlaw. The circumstances of their strange encounter involve a corpse, a ruby ​​and, finally, an association like the Knights of Roads. As the phrase says, "they rob the rich ... and that's it." Actually, there are not many antecedents, not even an in-depth development, but the objective seems to be to relieve the aristocracy of money and enough jewels to pay for the passage of the two Road Men to America. A small problem: MaCleane falls in love. With the room of the President of the Supreme Court, Rebecca (Liv Tyler). Who has also caught the attention of Thief Taker General. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite original, the casting is excellent (especially Alan Cumming as Lord Rochester, Carlyle and Miller, drag-queenish, also together in "Trainspotting", they have not lost their dynamics), the costumes It's fantastic, the makeup is outrageous, and the music is a hard techno with a strangely classic nuance. Jake Scott has an eye for light and shadow, has a good sense of balance between the show and the plot, and is not afraid to show the most unpleasant side of the 17th century in London. And luckily for us, he likes close-ups of faces, especially the eyes. The eyes of Jonny Lee Miller. And Liv Tyler, too, but hey, who is this movie about? Rebecca? No. Plunkett and MaCleane. But there is more to this movie than just pretty faces. At the risk of sounding cliche, it's a fast, furious and, sometimes, frustrating trip with the noblest bandits from Robin Hood. Decadent, sordid and violent, Scott's debut film becomes an entertaining evening in the cinema. <br /> <br /> As MaCleane says, "I was phenomenal, and it was a very good laugh!"
