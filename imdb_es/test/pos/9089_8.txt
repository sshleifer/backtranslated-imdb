This movie has a decidedly strange atmosphere, which takes place in a school that is very old to start with, but it certainly does not look like any sterile school of medicine environment. Very gothic and atmospheric. As for the movie itself, well, that's fine, the premise is a little exaggerated, but hey, that's why we watch movies, is not it? And it's less unlikely that part of the trash there is these days, that's for sure. Medical students are experimenting with "short-term" death by allowing themselves to be briefly dead so they can experience what life is like after death. It is pleasant, in some cases, until parts of him return with the traveler and begin to meddle in their earthly lives. I had not seen this movie in years until I got it on DVD and I must say that I had forgotten how good it was. And it struck me that Julia Roberts looks really beautiful in this movie, not like the actresses of today who are supposed to be beautiful, but are dressed and made like cheap prostitutes. Ah, the good old days. Anyway, this is a great movie, maybe not for fundamentalist Christians, but many others can enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars
