Utopia, made in 1950 in France, was the last film that Laurel and Hardy produced. With the duo's bad reputation for their post-1930 productions, I expected this movie to be horrible. Although you have to admit that it is not up to your "vintage" comedies, I was pleasantly surprised. It is observable, and in parts genuinely fun! And certainly the plot is of the same level that you would expect. Some gags are derived from his previous work, but if you consider that this movie was the first for five years after his last film produced in Hollywood, "The Bullfighters", the routines are executed with confidence, as you would expect from these professionals. Some scenes are not much, but the value of this movie is that some scenes are fun and, as such, absolutely priceless. I especially enjoyed the bedtime scene. <br /> <br /> I felt sad at the end of the movie. Our heroes stay on their own desert island. It is a metaphor for the truth of real life. Hollywood and the public of the time had consigned the stars to a desert island of memories, and that would be the last image they portrayed in a movie. Ollie died seven years later and Stan died fifteen years later. Stan rejected an offer to appear in "It's A Mad Mad Mad World" in 1963. What a shame, a film in color, only two years before he passed away. However, his health probably was not too much. <br /> <br /> These guys are probably the best comedy performers of all time, and although the film is far from its true potential, it's still an honor to see them. They appear in the film for the last time, and touching the echoes of his great talent.
