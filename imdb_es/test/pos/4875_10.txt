I saw SEA OF DUST at the Terror Film Festival of Rhode Island in Providence. It was the featured film of the Festival and won the Best Film of, I think, a couple of hundred entries. The director and some of the stars answered questions after the presentation. One star, Suzy Lorraine, was even sexier in person than in the movie, and drew attention in the film. <br /> <br /> This film is independent, but it has many cinematographic touches that give it a sense of quality. It even has a musical score of original classic style. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Savini and he is the star villain here, in black cape, he is more an evil force than a real person, I think. He is sucking the souls of people and using them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of the Kingdom of God on Earth. From his point of view, Christ had to do with suffering and Savini intends to make everyone suffer. <br /> <br /> The main line of the story that shows your interest is about a young doctor, Stefan, who is sent to investigate the strange events of Savini. It is causing in an isolated village. He proposes to an aristocratic girl on the way, but his father SOB tells him to get lost. Then he meets a strangely possessed but seductive country girl. I think he falls in love with him, but he also tries to kill him, as do several women in the film. <br /> <br /> The scenes filmed in the forest are the most spooky and most incredible. striking, with strange people along the way (the evil twins scared me very much). <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot to do, a lot to list. There is a lot of blood, torture and gore. Hot girls licking the blood from the boys' fingers. The head of a terrified girl explodes. That was unexpected. The throats open. Some brutal stabbings. <br /> <br /> Then they play it to laugh, making fun of all the evil black forest genre. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the films of Hammer and Ingrid Pitt, it is fascinating to see her in this movie. She removes one of the wires by plunging a cross into his skull. Excellent. The guy who played "Miggs Multiple" in Silence of the Lambs is great in a fight with an ax. <br /> <br /> The film is surreal and with the end, I'm not sure of the events that happened or if they were in Stefan's head due to his rejection by his future fiancee. He returns in revenge and that scene is brutal. <br /> <br /> The director also spoke on the subject of religion that is misused to support wars and murders. I can see that for sure, Savini's vision of religion was terrifying. <br /> <br /> This was an oddly rare movie with stars like Savini and Pitt, a lot of good supporting actors, including hot girls, big bloody scenes, action, and all the time you're wondering what the hell is going on and what will happen next. <br /> <br /> This deserves ten stars because it is an excellent independent film effort, I do not think so. It was low budget, but it had to be much less than a big studio budget, and even then they managed to do something really attractive, unique and stimulating.
