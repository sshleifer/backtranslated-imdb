Christopher Nolan's first feature film surprised critics who saw him when he first came out. Taken with a micro budget of $ 6,000, this is a film of students with real class. The film is shot in black and white, and features people you assume are friends of Nolan who appear in the film. This does not mean that they are bad actors because they are pretty good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects, but unfortunately they have not done it since this was done 6 years ago. <br /> <br /> Nolan's thriller, like Memento, does not play chronologically, it changes the scenes around a lot like Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It is a great twisted thriller, but because the temporal order of the film moves around it makes it even more interesting. I thought that the last ten minutes, particularly when everything starts to clear up, were excellent. <br /> <br /> For a movie with such a small budget and no recognizable names, this is very good. It is superior to most of what Hollywood and Nolan studios offer after three films (this, the top Memento and Insomnia not so good but still excellent) has established itself as the most exciting new talent of recent times. I can not wait for Batman. <br /> <br /> This movie is short and sweet, and it certainly is a great watch. He is very professional and the turns are fantastic and completely surprising. I also thought that David Julyan's score was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a cold quality. He has gone to compose other Nolan movies. <br /> <br /> In general I would recommend this, I intend to get all the Nolan movies. This is a gem of low budget. ***** <br /> <br />
