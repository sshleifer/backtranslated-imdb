This movie is not what it seems to be. Clint Eastwood is not Harry the Dirty or a "cowboy" here. The appeal of the film comes from its careful manipulation of the atmosphere and theme. It is a Gothic tale set in the Civil War and, as such, all the "action" of the film, or the lack of it, takes place inside a house populated by bells of the South of all ages and forms. <br /> <br /> The horror comes from Seeing the whole story through the eyes of Clint Eastwood's character. Seeing him stranded in the house and held captive by women is a very "deceptive" experience. And who is "cheated" here exactly? Are women seduced by the incredible looks of Eastwood? Are we, the spectators, seduced by their sexual attractiveness and the possible deviant sexualities that they unleash? Or "cheated" refers to what the director does here: keeps us captivated by a brief space just to (maybe) let us go? Don Siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing films I had the pleasure of seeing.
