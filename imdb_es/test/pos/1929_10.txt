I remember the events of this movie, the unfortunate cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968, in the Golden Globe, alone, in the world yacht race. I was 13 years old and lived in England. The year before, Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis, was knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the world. I remember it mainly because they gave us time away from school to watch his return (on a black and white TV and grainy!) And then to his knight with the Queen. It provoked a great outpouring of patriotic fervor in the United Kingdom. Everything seems so strange now. Chichester became a national hero, but had stopped halfway, in Australia, to reassemble his yacht, so the next logical step for sailors was to try the trip without stopping. <br /> <br /> It is important to remember that this was a pre-GPS world, when ground communications were still quite erratic, it does not matter in the middle of the ocean. Now, with GPS receivers that fit into a keychain and calculate a position within a meter anywhere on earth, it's hard to remember a time when you could go to the sea and literally disappear. As Donald Crowhurst did. <br /> <br /> A number of yacht men signed up (all men at that time), including the mysterious man, Crowhurst. Essentially a weekend boater, Crowhurst had not had spectacular success in any previous company, including careers in the British Army, the Air Force, and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids. He wanted to do something great with his life, and saw the first prize of five thousand pounds (more than $ 100,000 in today's money) and consequent publicity as a means to start his business. He signed an agreement with a sponsor that turned out to be more hermetic than his boat, which meant that failure would lead to bankruptcy and he soon became a popular figure among journalists as he prepared for the race. Now, the British always love the idea of ​​brave fans confronting the "professionals". (Think of Eddie the Eagle losing endless Olympic ski jump competitions and the amateur riders who regularly start the Grand National horse race). The crowd lined up to see him leave, but his ship was not really ready, and even when it started (the last competitor to leave the UK) Crowhurst must have known he did not have a serious chance. But there were too many things to leave it. <br /> <br /> In the wonderful archive file, we see the doubt written on the face of his poor wife. Abandoned with her 4 children, she was interviewed on the move throughout the film, along with one of Crowhurst's children. She was in a situation of not winning. If she had tried to stop him, she would have been considered a spoiler, but after that she was undecided as to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him. Faced with the certainty that his boat had a leak and would never cross the southern oceans, and unable to turn around and face ridicule, bankruptcy and ignominy, Crowhurst devised a plan to cheat. Lying off the coast of Argentina and Brazil, out of radio contact, he waited for the leaders to circle Cape Horn and begin to retreat across the Atlantic, thinking he might sneak to the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way. world. . He elaborately falsified his records and made 16mm films and audio recordings to back up his plan. But as one after another the other competitors left, he realized that, in fact, he would come in second place and his records would be examined. Unable to face some detection, his diary suggests that he lost control over reality and finally committed suicide. Your yacht was found. He never was <br /> <br /> This beautifully edited film also follows the journey of Bernard Moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic French sailor, who was in second place and sure of the prize of the fastest trip, when he suddenly left the race, unable to deal with the clamor and publicity that he knew he would face, and sailed to the blue width that extended, eventually arriving some 10 months later in Tahiti. After having spent about seven years working on the sea, (although on boats very different from these) I understand the pull of the ocean well. Standing on the deck, watching water in all directions towards the horizon, knowing that there are a couple of miles of water below you, nothing between you and oblivion, except a thin metal hull, without easy access to television or the radio (even today in most of the boats that work) you feel quite isolated), it is possible to escape for a while from the responsibilities of everyday life. There is a careful analysis of what drives people to try this kind of long and lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind. Most people would think that trying to raise 4 children is a sufficient adventure, but there is much talk of the need for self-discovery in the difficulties at sea, the search for oneself. <br /> <br /> I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston, the former naval man who won the race (and many since then) probably knew very well who he was before he left, so he succeeded not only in winning The race but also keeps his sanity on the road. Those who were searching for something deep within themselves may not have liked what they found at all. <br /> <br /> The wonderful file archive of Britain in the late '60s is almost a sufficient reason to see this (did it really look so bad? I do not remember it looking so disheveled, but maybe we'll erase it The worst aspects of the past?), But in general, it's an excellently well-made and fascinating film. Highly recommended
