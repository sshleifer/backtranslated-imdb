Octavio Paz, Mexican poet, writer and diplomat, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, said about "Nazarín": "Nazarín follows the great tradition of the Spanish madmen originated by Cervantes." His madness is to take big ideas seriously and tests, live accordingly. " A humble and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a wonderful performance) tries to live in accordance with the principles of Christianity, but is expelled from his church for helping a local prostitute by giving her a shelter after she committed a murder. Nazarín roams the rural roads of the early twentieth century in Mexico, offering help to the poor and asking for food. His two followers, a murderous prostitute, Andara, and his sister Beatriz, who is a failed suicide who desperately seek love, consider him a saint, but that does not stop him from the hatred and humiliation of the church and the people he meets. the way. He ends up beaten in jail and begins to question his faith for not being able to forgive his attacker. <br /> <br /> Bunuel tells the story in the manner of a Christian parable that combines in a masterly and unique way the admiration and irony towards the main character and the strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and deep, as well as beautiful, ironic and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> I consider Bunuel one of the best filmmakers of all time. I've seen twenty of his films and they all belong to the different periods of his life, but they have in common his magical touch, the masterful combination of harsh realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his sense of humor and his dark fantasies and bright With great pleasure I am adding the surrealistic tragic comedy "Nazarin" little seen and almost unknown but incredibly sincere and touching to the list of my favorite movies.
