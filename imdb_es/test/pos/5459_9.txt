The Late Shift is a great book, I read the book several years ago and I was paralyzed by the libertine profligacy that occurred when Johnny Carson retired and Jay Leno and Johnny Carson tried to get their place. When the movie came out, I hooked up a VHS copy of the movie and, having reread the book recently, it's hard to say which one I enjoy the most, because they are pretty equal in the amount of information transmitted. The two main actors, John Michael Higgins, and Daniel Roebuck, two actors I had never heard of, and of whom I have not heard since, play Leno and Letterman convincingly, despite the fact that Letterman rejected his interpretation of poor. They take parts fairly well, even though many people look for an imitation of both. I was not so interested in that. History is what counts. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates, playing Helen Kushnick, is this movie. She plays this evil bitch of a character, in a threatening way that you realize how this woman can control herself, much less a national television program. Oh! There should be a sequel!
