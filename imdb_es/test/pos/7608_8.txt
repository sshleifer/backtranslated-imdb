Of course, really experienced critics who like things like Star Wars and professional trash will definitely drag this movie and say very bad comments about it. But in reality, it's a nice teen comedy with an incredible story and good acting. <br /> <br /> Josie Gellar (played well by Drew Barrymore) is part of a news reporting team and has been offered a ('') job - she has to go back to school and discover what the teenagers these days. Well, this is going well, until Josie remembers her horrible time in high school and gets scared. But it has never been fashionable, it has never been great, it has never been popular until now! <br /> <br /> Sit back, relax and enjoy Never Been Kissed! <br /> <br />
