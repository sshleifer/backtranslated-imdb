If anyone ever collects a compendium on the modern American horror that is really worthwhile, there will have to be an entry for the ubiquitous exercise of SF Brownrigg in Asylum Horror. Every time I watch this film, I am impressed by the complete economy of the film, from the compact plot, totally autonomous with a startling beginning and a too horrible ending, the attractive performances of what was essentially a group of non-professional professionals. actors, and a prevailing feeling of fear and claustrophobia that effectively consume the narrative with a certain inevitability that is all the more terrifying because the viewers know what is happening long before the heroes, with the only question of when will they go? Awakening and smell the coffee? <br /> <br /> Taken with a budget of dental floss in the native Texas of Brownrigg in an old palatial mansion that well serves as a stage for a private sanatorium, DO NOT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT. Another intriguing turn in the good old Edgar Allan Poe I take about prisoners taking the asylum just before a stranger who is otherwise "normal" joins the ranks without realizing it until it's too late that not everything is it seems, they are totally disconnected and beyond any external help, and inevitably find their own sanity questioned when madness gets out of control. The original TV series STAR TREK had an opportunity with its episode of QUIÃ‰NES DIOSES DESTROY of 1968, Juan Moctezuma gave The procedures of a peyote impelled the Mexican psychedelic trip in the DR. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON in 1972, and is related tangentially to the ASYLUM EROTICA / SLAUGHTER HOTEL by Fernando Di Leo, which injects the elements of an unknown killer and an ending that can only be defined as "Splatter Cinema". It is possible that Brownrigg has not seen or thought. SLAUGHTER HOTEL, but surely you came up with some similar ideas. <br /> <br /> Legalicuos ex Playboy Playmate Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, RN in Clinical Psychology, who just left her good job as a supervisor in a hospital specialty to travel to the middle of some abandoned god wasting a Peckinpah movie to work with a Dr. Stevens in his private sanatorium. Dr. Stevens has pioneered a new form of therapy based primarily on encouraging people with emotional and psychological scars to face their internal obsessions, bring them to the surface and, hopefully, free patients from anything that has slowed down your sense of reasoning. Good idea, but putting together a completely insane man of 6 feet and 250 pounds with an ax and telling him to hit his aggression AND THEN RETURNING TO YOUR ANSWER is probably not the smartest idea, and Dr. Stevens is sent before he appears Mrs. Holotik on the screen with a good punch on the bottom of her skull. <br /> <br /> This event leaves the sanitorium effectively in the hands of a Geraldine Masters [the actress Annabelle Weenick, who also served as sequence supervisor and production manager], a woman of surprisingly professional behavior who Quickly defuses the situation with the help of Sam, the wonderfully unlikely hero of the movie, a lobotomized African-American boheomouth played by an actor named Bill McGhee, who was unfortunately stolen from an Oscar nomination as his turn muscle mass with the brain of a 8 year old boy Sam's only wish is for someone to help him put his precious toy boat "in the water", and his constant request to the various female cast members (and their continued consumption of chocolate popsicles) as * SOME * type of underlying theme, although we will avoid it here because the children could still be awake. There is also a quick subplot about a staff member who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients, but I will leave the details of that to his discovery. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Holotik arrives just when Dr. Stevens has been able to rest and is quickly overcome by the professionalism of Miss Masters, who reluctantly allows the young and young nurse to stay despite of the tragedy that just happened, oh, TWENTY MINUTES ago, which you must admit was quite sporting for her. However, when nurse Beale de Holotik begins to show symptoms of not being the best meat cutter in the drawer, she is informed that she shares the house with a bunch of maniacs and that there are no locks on the doors and she does not move away to the closest Ace. Hardware store to pick up a bolt and padlock to make sure, and invite us to a couple of really spooky scenes where some of the inmates sneak into your room and do things like smell your hair, try to kill it with butcher knives and caress . His neck with ax heads. But that's all part of working in such a radical psychiatric medical care environment, Ms. Master informs her and goes through her strangely defined "rounds" that consist of wearing a leg that defines a nurse's outfit as it can be found on a street 42. Fetishist boutique and meet the interns. <br /> <br /> Allysson is an obsessive compulsive nympho with homicidal tendencies who likes to take off her shirt and offer the film some T & A between cuts of histrionics; Harriet is a young ex-mother who left her son to die in a stupid accident and now tells an old doll that she is also protective of homicides; The Seargant is a true seargeant [and implied Vietnamese veterinarian] that negligence led to the death of his platoon, and now observes from the window with binoculars the approach of an invisible enemy; Jennifer is a Phish fan who could not get a ticket to the New Year's Eve show and went crazy and likes to use nembutol and other barbituates when no one is watching, and has also hidden homicidal tendencies related to her inability to find a bra; Judge Cameron is apparently a homicidal pervert who became obsessed with his own sense of power and now likes to cut things with axes; Ms. Callingham is an elderly poet who serves as a kind of old witch poppies MACBETH before the cat is silent. and Danny is a demented idiot who was included in the cast as the random element that the plot can not control, and who are the antics that serve as a real catalyst for the series of tragedies and murders that ultimately take place in this house dark, spooky in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> The house itself is a wonderful ensemble, with a decoration in the early 70's that is notable for its inconspicuous character, with a fantastic use of color achieved by subtle ambient lighting. The house is a series of corridors and rooms with bright brown, twisted wood floors, confined staircases, cupboards and secret corridors that lead to the different larger areas and, of course, the basement mentioned in the title: we visited only once, but of course. It proves to be an asshole! I love the old frozen freezer where Sam keeps his stash of ice pops, the completely flat exteriors that remind me of a summer house that our family used to visit every year and forces us to suffocate in the heat: all are covered in bills of persistence and appearance. exhausted, and even the ever cheerful Sam at one point begins to suspect that bad things are happening, although he can not understand what it means and Rosie H. is too firm in her belief of her profession to suspect what really happened, and While the actress Holotik's limitations may have diminished the effectiveness of her Big Revelation scene, she is a great crying when all hell starts to break loose, and Brownrigg allowed himself some good camera shots in various suggestive poses or stages of nudity that shows how beautiful she is without exhibiting anything more than stipulated in her contract. That bad! <br /> <br /> However, the real show thief is Sam, and the fans of what I have been taught to refer to as Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed by the shocking end, and there is something moving about how Sam runs to the protection of his friend and brutally kills everyone within reach within seconds, suggesting that he was a mean motha before his lobotomy, or that the film is CUT In any case, he will not be ready for the end the first time you see it, even though, as a spectator, you know what the score is long before someone else in the movie has gathered it all. <br /> <br /> Except for one person: Rhea MacAdams, the old and stereotyped stupid, Mrs. Callingham [who seems to be inspired by the character of Donald Sutherland Old Woman in the 1964 film Christopher Lee by Michael Reeves. CASTLE OF THE LIVING VAD, in addition to a rather unpleasant Death by round spike to the eye], which not only predicts the future, but makes the film laugh out loud in a bit of fun dialogue while walking in the garden with Mrs. Holotik who runs something like this: <br /> <br /> "It's really beautiful out here, does it come out very much, Mrs. Callingham?" Holotik asks, to what the old woman responds <br /> <br /> "You are the one who needs to leave". <br /> <br /> Hilarious, and one of those things that you have to see for yourself to "get". DO NOT SEE IN THE BASEMENT is available in at least half a dozen DVD releases without "cheap bargain" code from companies like Brentwood Home Video, Diamond Entertainment, VCI and the HORROR CLASSICS series from Platinum Disc Corp. I kind of like it the sexually beautifully decorated shoot of Alpha Video from 2003 onwards: <br /> <br /> Dig those bargain containers! But be sure to get one with the 89/90 minute impression contained in it; An older version of 83 minutes is downright confusing because of some of the settings, and you really need to see the final credits with the intention of bringing this sick, twisted and surprisingly entertaining thread to its end. <br /> <br /> Masterpiece? Maybe not compared to THE EXORCIST or ROSEMARY'S BABY, but it's a very unique horror movie in the United States, and a true classic of the drive-in era that deserves to be rediscovered by anyone looking for something done with more than a little of the brain. juice, and not a penny more than they absolutely needed. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
