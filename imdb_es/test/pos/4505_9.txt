THE KITE RUNNER is one of those modern epics with which one is occasionally adorned. This film, which covers two continents, multiple family generations and many decades, touches a lot of elements that include friendship, love, loss and, ultimately, redemption. ), a native Afghan child who often plays with the help hired; Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), a young Hazara whose family is supposedly inferior to the Afghan rulers. But the two form a bond of friendship based on education (Amir teaches Hassan to read), the closeness in the house of Amir and, of course, the flight of kites. <br /> <br /> But the bad times are on the way to the city of Kabul. The communists are invading and Amir and Hassan have separated due to an act of incredibly brutal prejudice of an Afghan boy against Hassan. It is possible that the two never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Amir's father rushes to get him and his son out of Afghanistan, and eventually they will find their way to the United States. Here, the two established a service station and live hand in hand selling in specialized markets. And as Amir's father gradually falls ill, a new revelation will reach the heart of Amir; One that he can not ignore and requires his return to his beloved Kabul. <br /> <br /> A study of friendship, war and reconciliation, The Kite Runner is really a fantastic piece of cinema. History is never spoken inappropriately in English when we are in a foreign country, and only English is broken when we are in the United States. This was refreshing and lent itself to a sense of realism. <br /> <br /> The performance was on par with the best you'll see too. Particular consideration should be given to Homayoun Ershadi, who plays Baba, Amir's sick father and strong patriarch. Also guide Khalid Abdalla, since old Amir plays well, especially when he returns to Kabul to find him in ruins; All the contrast of when he had gone. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of Afghanistan during the flight and the last return of Amir are impressive, with snowy peaks that will make your mouth loosen (I am not sure exactly which mountain range they used in the film, but where I want to go there and shoot it myself!) But it is not the cinematography or the performance of one or two people that makes this film a success. It is a simple story told very well that makes it worthwhile for moviegoers. Highly recommended
