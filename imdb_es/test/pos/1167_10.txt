Sean Connery is very good like Grand Raisuli, Lord of the Rif and Defender of the Faithful. This is an adventure movie with Arabs, Germans and the USMC that will face each other at one time or another. There is also a lot of humor in the interaction between the main characters and support. The story is based on the true incident in which a wealthy Greek-American businessman was kidnapped by the Raisuli at the beginning of the 20th century. Milius has replaced Candace Bergen and her two sons as victims of the kidnapping, and this opens the story to many literary licenses. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film gives Milius the chance to remind the viewer of two of the most famous (though mostly forgotten) political appointments of the TR era. Brian Keith (very good as TR) says: "Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!"; and John Huston (also good as Secretary of State John Hay) asks the Ambassador of Japan at a dinner at the White House: "Do you like the knife, do you like the fork?"
