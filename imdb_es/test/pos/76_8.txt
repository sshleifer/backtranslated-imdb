I guess I like this movie as well as any other that I know; is not perfect, but under the title "The Americanization of Lily", this charming and memorable semi-musical satire could suggest that she was appreciated more and more dearly by those who recognized her special spirit of kindness produced by Blake Edwards, intelligent Humor and narrative solid The plot of the story, improbable but charming, follows Lili Smith, a marginal type of spy for the Germans in a war much simpler and less in black and white; Lili Schmidt happens when Smith is helping his uncle, who is also a patriot, for Germany, but neither cruel nor political, but simply opportunist. Lili's goal is William Larrabee, a charismatic squad leader from the United States who can provide him with valuable information. The plot is complicated when Lili falls in love with Larrabee, has her eyes open to the consequences of her game as a spy, sees the effects of combat on wounded men in a hospital and realizes what it can mean for her men to whom she has known and likes. She becomes jealous of a rival for Larrabee's affections, then realizes that she can no longer do what she has been doing and abandons the espionage business. The logical ending of the film comes when, after the terrible World War I has ended, while singing the main theme of the film, "Wishing" in a dark theater, one by one the members of the Larrabee squad appear, including their own lover, indicating that they have forgiven her and her former opponents; and even Uncle Kurt joins with enthusiasm to the song of "It's a Long To Tipperraree", to indicate that everything is fine with the world again. This is a bold and sometime brilliant idea, written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of the fame of "John Goldfarb"; And it's a lovely narrative. Larrabee's squad, including a drunk who keeps crashing and other adorable guys populate this animated movie; and the sensation of this elegant and brilliant film is almost epic, both in its scope and in its realization. Credit should go to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costume creations, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for their sets, Fernando Carrere for another beautiful production design, Henry Mancini for his sensitive and appropriate music, and Russell Harlan for his brilliant cinematography. In the beautiful film, the main actors are Julie Andrews as Lili, Rock Hudson as Larrabee, Keremy Kemp, as uncle Kurt de Lili, Michael Witney, Lance Percival as the drunken pilot, beautiful Gloria Paul as Lili's stripper rival and many other excellent actors. in smaller parts. It's hard to say enough good things about the pace or intelligence of broad comedy on this side; Edwards introduced this element to illustrate the horrors of real war, by way of example, the almost comical approach with which men waged war in an era of innocent-minded human civilization. This comedy also helps prepare the way for Lili's conversion. from the non-critical acceptance of a duty towards the German state to the acceptance of the reality of what it is doing and, potentially, what it may be causing. This is a rare film of "meaning of life" about Lili's "Americanization", her affirmation of herself in the real world and then, among other things, before the tragedy occurs. It's disturbing, I think, and beautiful in many ways. I consider it Blake Edwards' masterpiece of direction; and under the title "The Americanization of Lili", I believe that with almost no change it could have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film, according to all the standards I know.
