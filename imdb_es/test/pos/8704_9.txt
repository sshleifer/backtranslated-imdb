I was ten years old when I saw the subspecies, I instantly had the affections by Michael Watson and Laura Tate, they really have a great chemistry on the screen in the previous parts of the movie. I ordered a copy in 1993 of Full Moon and I learned this: Ion and Rosa, the servants, have much more important roles in the script along with the King. What most people do not know is that there was an alternative sequence that was supposed to happen in the final scene: Michelle and Stefan are cornered in a room and Michelle has the idea that Stefan turns her into a vampire to help to fight Radu and his controlled demons former friends. However, for some reason or another, that scenario never reached the camera. Another scene in the script, which can be confirmed in the original trailer, shows Stefan drinking blood from a wolf, or actually, in the trailer, he is seen with blood on his chin. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 9 because it is one of my childhood and I have good memories attached to the characters; Even though my favorite characters were Stefan and Michelle, I think Anders Hove's Radu is a performance that evokes feelings, a lot of feeling in his work there.
