Well, it could be a movie for children ... maybe, but I will not let my 9-year-old children see it! So, who says it's a children's movie, huh? but going back to the movie, this is a boy who can lie very well ... so good that in the end nobody knows the truth or the lie. Anyway, it's a good movie to watch a good screen game. I vote an 8 for the screen game and the story. ... I think the writers repair a little lesson with this ... "the truth is never exaggerated".
