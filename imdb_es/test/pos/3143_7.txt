Perry Mason: The case of fatal fashion finds that Perry and Della Street in New York receive an award from the American Bar Association. An unbeaten test record should get some recognition, I would think. Anyway, a friend of Della, the fashion editor Diana Muldaur, is arrested for the murder of a rival, Valerie Harper and, in fact, Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale are witnesses of a confrontation between them in an elegant restaurant. <br /> <br /> These two rivals have one thing that makes Hedda and Louella look like girls at school. Of course, Harper has a number of other people who loved her equally. <br /> <br /> The same perpetrator also ran into a fashion designer who may have exposed the individual. This throws Perry with his trusted investigative lawyer, William Moses, in an alliance with some mobsters. It seems that the designer was a cousin of a mafia boss who also wants to impart some justice in the usual way. <br /> <br /> One thing I could not get is when Moses and mobster Robert Clohessy tracked down the perpetrator. I can not believe that the police were not pursuing the case energetically either. Of course, Clohessy has access to sources that cops simply do not have. <br /> <br /> But the best part of this particular Mason entry is Scott Baio as the young Assistant District Attorney who introduces himself. Raymond Burr said he studied all his cases and hoped to beat him. Foolish Boy <br /> <br /> In fact, my favorite scene is Burr and Baio in a sidebar with the judge. Baio was willing to reopen his case and add a witness and he arrived ready and prepared with precedents. Burr takes him by surprise and says he has no objection to the new witness and then proceeds to demolish him in the interrogation. Absolutely invaluable. <br /> <br /> Scott Baio is the best in this particular Perry Mason movie and should be seen by him alone, if nothing else.
