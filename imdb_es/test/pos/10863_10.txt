Tipping the Velvet was launched three weeks ago in the UK and I can see how countless letters flood national newspapers and TV guides, claiming that it has a thin plot, weak performances and an even weaker script. <br /> <br /> You find me outraged. This is heresy. <br /> <br /> I would really like to dispel all doubts by first congratulating Andrew Davies for allowing Geoffrey Sax to create this wonderful dramatization of Sarah Waters' novel by giving her such a fantastic script. Prestige. But I am afraid that now I must change tactics. <br /> <br /> I saw one of the main TV guides here in the UK (who will remain nameless) who relentlessly describes Tipping the Velvet as a "lesbian love story". If they are, and I assume they are, trying to promote interest in the movie, then this is a completely wrong way to do it (other than that the phrase is a disappointingly inaccurate description). By saying something like that, they are a) rejecting those who would be rejected instinctively for "that" topic or b) attracting a class of people who will only watch to see some "serious girl-to-girl action". Buy a video! Through this show of serious disregard, this and other magazines are reducing what is a brilliant adaptation of one of the greatest works of recent literature. Tipping the Velvet is a story of love, passion, moving forward, losing and losing heart. It is not a lesbian love story. Do not siree. <br /> <br /> The final result is an elegant affair, with excellent performances throughout the year (especially from Stirling, Hawes, Chancellor and May). As for the direction, it is intoxicating and enveloping, sometimes, accelerated, sometimes not, but it never ceases to be nothing less than convincing. In general, it is polished and well distributed, sex is done with tenderness and delicacy, and although many will not classify it as a real "movie", it will remain among my favorites for some time.
