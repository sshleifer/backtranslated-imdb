This film, without a doubt, is the best I've seen, and it really shows what British talent can do. Its effects are extremely good if one considers that the film is set in the mid-eighteenth century, and all the disgusting and disgusting filth of England at that time is captured very well. The characters develop and develop, from the pranks of MaCleane's prostitution to his development as a man on the road and "The Gentleman Highwayman", which contrast well with Robert Carlyle, who is a cynicism and a show of honor that you can love to a thief and a criminal. He has more honor in his little finger than any of you bastards! '<br /> <br /> I do not mean you, of course! But it could be said that it is the most touching and emotionally charged scene that has been seen in a movie, but you will only have to see it to discover it, suffice to say that it is a rope around your neck. <br /> <br />
