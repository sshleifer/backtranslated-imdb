I just saw this marvelously filmed movie that captures the essence of New York, or of any large mid-century city in the United States. The colors, the <br /> <br /> cars, the clothes and the arrival of the Women's Movement. It reflects the welcoming and welcoming attitudes of the relationships between men and women in the corporate world. <br /> <br />. Somehow, things changed and in others, <br /> <br /> they have not changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but now they have all kinds of laws and equality mandates to achieve it. In <br /> <br /> my opinion, beautiful women will throw themselves with men in search of their goals! The laws we now have against harassment and <br /> <br /> were all approved by unattractive women who wanted the same opportunity to <br /> <br /> compete with prettier women who might be getting the best possible positions. /> <br /> based on your looks and on going out! Real competition is not between <br /> <br /> men and women, but women and women! I liked the look of the movie, but the world has not changed as much as the real thing.
