An unwavering descent into psychological and physical oblivion that will undoubtedly burn images of the real brutality and suffering of war in your cerebral cortex in a way that many other films will not. In fact, there is simply no other war movie like this one. <br /> <br /> Director Kon Ichikawa witnessed the unthinkable horror of Hiroshima first-hand only 10 days after the bomb was dropped. He has said that from that day it will always be his mission to express the meaningless and empty violence that humans inflict on themselves and on themselves. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in the war ... because the paths to victory and defeat are paved with the same soldiers who march without roads on roads that only have death and the destruction at the end. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa manages to take his message to the world through this disturbing piece of film.
