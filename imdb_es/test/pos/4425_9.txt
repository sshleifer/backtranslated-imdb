On the other hand, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and it is a joy to see her. I have to alter almost everything she does, since I'm a vegetarian ... but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's great that she's so attractive to her fans and still seems realistic. The studio audience seems to be quite small, but that makes for a more welcoming environment. Some people have reported that the show sucks. I guess it depends on your own interpretation of her and her. If you watch the first episodes of 30 Minute Meals, you will see a completely different personality from the past few years. I am sure that she will also find her comfort zone with this show. Good luck Rachael!
