When I first saw the poster of this film, I dismissed it as another low-budget film aimed at young people. After a few days, when it finally reached the cinemas, one of my friends told me it was a good one. <br /> <br /> A year later, the first time I saw the ad, Anand was going to be broadcast on television and finally the moment came when I switched channels and for a moment I stopped to watch and so I ended up seeing all the movie. <br /> <br /> And at this point, 3 years later, I've seen the movie at least 7-8 times and I do not really watch movies again and again !! <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it tries to be different, when all the Telugu films were composed of 6 songs and 4 fights. <br /> <br /> It's a simple movie, a little slow but a very exciting script, there are no loose ends in the film, well versed dialogues, which is really very hard to find by. <br /> <br /> The music is classical and relaxing, great interpretations of Radha Krishnan, some great kirtanas also come in music, throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The cinematography deserves a mention. The edition is not elegant but suitable for a romantic like this. <br /> <br /> But, what really surprises you in this movie are two things: 1. the way each scene has been treated with the utmost respect for, the now famous, Shekar Kammula. <br /> <br /> 2. The beautiful lyrics of Veturi. <br /> <br /> And one more thing deserves a special mention, Kamalini, part of his success attributed to Sunitha, for lending him such a beautiful voice, I really tell you, the voice does wonders to me. <br /> <br /> The other actors are equally good, Raja in the title character and the girl, and the way she screams when she gets a new dog. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I can tell you that this movie will soon be on its way to becoming another classic with those old romantic classics, along with another classic-romantic piece from Kammula, Godavari.
