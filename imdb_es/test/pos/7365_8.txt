He caught this movie as one of five offers for $ 5 from a local video store, and it was a very pleasant surprise. It is a collection of four interrelated stories built around four children who have just suffered a car accident and are waiting for someone to pick them up. These stories are told to kill time, and occasionally they startle with flashing lights and amusing noises that come together in an O. Henry-esque ending that left me happy. A true discovery Blood (and plenty), breasts and beasts round everything up nicely ... Jacinda Barrett is worth the price of admission alone. This is a guardian: Jim Bob says watch it. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, "Pumpkinhead" was also one of our five options, and IMDB recommends it to anyone who likes "Campfire Tales". I will continue as soon as I have the opportunity to sit down and watch that. Joyeux Samhain!
