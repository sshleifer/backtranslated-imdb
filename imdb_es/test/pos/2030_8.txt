Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolizes a rock star to the point of knowing all his songs, imitating him perfectly and dressing like him. When he gets the opportunity to assume his role as "idol" in the band, he takes the opportunity. However, the role of a rock star may not be what was believed ... and relationships may change ... This film certainly seems to me that having the theme of what you achieve can not be what you think it is. once you get it In general, a very good movie with excellent performances by all the actors, as well as the two protagonists, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. It made me feel sad, especially when Emily, (Jennifer Aniston), met Chris in Seattle and saw the depths of what she had sunk. If someone ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie, you should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, while glamorous for a while, is very lonely and, ultimately, not what you may want.
