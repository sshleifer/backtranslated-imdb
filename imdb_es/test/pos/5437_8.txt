I will actually admit that I am a political addict, so this resonated with me, but the erratic nature of Mrs. Green (yes, I know what they did to her), but the ending was so difficult and totally inconsistent with the movie . in itself. <br /> <br /> Why is Barry L and his team just not letting us know what he was going to do? Let's discuss it <br /> <br /> Instead, they have this "oh, I'm not worthy" shit and that shows that when the chips did not work, it's better to leave the table instead of bending over. Stop the Disney finale and bow. Life is not easy, they should have had the courage to give some support to the main character. <br /> <br /> We had to listen to the rhetoric of the whole movie ... and then it became annoying and the stupidity, the inane behavior of Mrs. Green (when the shit was out of her system) has just become in a ridiculous finale of the movie that was the icing on the cake.
