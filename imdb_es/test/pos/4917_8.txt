Although for most of us, sexuality is a variable quality, I can not remember a movie that did what it does for me. It transported me to a terribly familiar realm of longing and desire. All the compulsive attraction, the uncertainty about the result, the palpable fear and emotion that accompanied that state of excitement were brought to fever by this film. So French and what I consider daring! No matter what your orientation, I think the danger of pursuing your desire is presented in its entire line and center here ... much more, say, than with "Eyes Wide Shut" by Kubrick.
