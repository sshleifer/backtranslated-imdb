A very credible and disturbing film that portrays the effects of war on the general public, Shame gives us a chilling understanding of Ingmar Bergman's beliefs. The absence of color and sound (as in a soundtrack) helps to give the film a more realistic feeling. There is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to give the story a lovely or dramatic effect. Everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality. Sometimes the plot was confusing, but perhaps to give an idea of ​​the mood of the characters. how they also now know what is happening or why. The simplicity of the film made it a bit boring, but I could understand how the director is trying not to glamorize the story and the points. He described the harsh and disturbing events and effects of the war. At the beginning, the characters presented themselves and showed themselves as content with the clearest settings and very long and long shots. When the war suddenly hit them, they were much darker and quieter with less intimate shots. Bergman did a good job of allowing us to be consumed by war on ourselves and presenting an image that corresponded so adequately to war. Although the plot itself was not too impressive, the content of the film was.
