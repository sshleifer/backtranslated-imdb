A jewel little appreciated, invisible. Estevez does an extraordinary job of illustrating in a moving and harrowing way, the tension that arises between a son who has been in hell and has returned, and his parents, who can not begin to understand the emotional scars left behind. It is not different from Born on the Fourth of July, since it is about the emotional and mental crisis of a soldier after serving in Vietnam, but while this one focused more on the politics of the post-Vietnam (speeches against the war, etc.). ), This deals with a much more personal issue: the family. The struggle of a man to return to normal after a life-changing experience, and the fact that his parents have not seen the change that has occurred. <br /> <br /> Estevez offers a fiery performance as Jeremy Collier. You can feel the pain and frustration bubbling beneath the surface. There to match it inch by inch is his father in real life, Martin Sheen. It is a journey to see these two act against each other, as they have the feeling that they are constantly trying to mate. It is as if the presence of each one inspires the couple to give their best, and their performances triumph thanks to it. <br /> <br /> Recommended for anyone who appreciates solid acting, writing and direction. And to any fan of the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> **** / ***** (8/10)
