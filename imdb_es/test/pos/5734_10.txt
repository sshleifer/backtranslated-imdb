I can not believe that someone has given this movie a rating of 1 !!! and it's only an average of 3. What is not to love about this movie? It's original, it has a lot of scary scenes that really made me jump out of my seat and it has some great special effects. The story is fresh, there is some nudity and it is very cheesy. The murderer was scared in his insane way and the end is very unexpected. I must admit that I really love this movie, one of the best horror movies in Spain. If you consider yourself a true horror fan, you should go out and try to find this movie. You will be pleasantly surprised to do so.
