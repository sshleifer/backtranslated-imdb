TEP is like a long drink of cold water after crawling through the Sahara to the classic moviegoers who have long been deprived of that certain cinematic magic! Not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are perfectly represented. If you want the film to be a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed. Instead, he is an excellent "companion" to the book, and I think that's what Anthony Minghella intended. Ralph Fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world; Not to mention a brilliant actor. Juliette Binoche is the protagonist of childhood vulnerability and enthusiasm. And, of course, I'll go see any movie featuring Kristin Scott Thomas. She simply must be THE best actress from the likes of Deborah Kerr. He promised himself so much with this movie, and so much is delivered!
