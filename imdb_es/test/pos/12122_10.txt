I just received this in the mail and I was positively surprised. As a great movie fan of the 70s, it does not take much to satisfy me when it comes to this type of film. Despite the obvious low budget in this film, the acting is good in general and you can already see why Pesci became one of the best actors in history. I'm not sure how authentic this film is, but it is a good contribution to the mafia genre ...
