This is one of my favorite series, all categories, all times. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to get a full VHS series a few years ago. I loved it when I saw it again in -91 -92, when I was around 12. I love it so much, or more, nowadays, which is remarkable considering my (hopefully) better appreciation skills and film criticism. Most of the films that I liked at the time I do not like so much nowadays, besides the factor of nostalgia. That factor is also present here, but there is much more to Sherwood's Robin than nostalgia. <br /> <br /> There are only a few bad things about this series. First, the quality of image and sound is regular, at least in the first episodes. Fortunately, it gets better. Secondly, you might have wanted a bit more blood and realism in the fight scenes, although I know it was not an option in this case. <br /> <br /> So, to the good things! And there are a lot of them. First of all, Michael Praed is Robin Hood. I do not think I've seen it in a single role since then, which only strengthens this fact for me. He offers a performance as credible as Robin. Jason Connery had an impossible task replacing him. The fact that Michael Praed has not become a more important name as an actor is incredible. Or maybe that was his destiny, make this one paper perfectly, then disappear. <br /> <br /> I love Nickolas Graces Sheriff of Nottingham. It really is not a complex character, but it is totally rotten. The relationship between him and Gisburne is simply hilarious. Actually, just seeing De Rainault sitting on his throne, bored, fulminating, makes me laugh even before he said anything. Another actor who deserves additional praise is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet. You can really feel the sadness inside him, as well as his hatred for the soldiers who killed his wife. Winstone is an actor who has finally achieved his deserved breakthrough in Hollywood (in films like The Departed and Beowulf). There are also many other great actors here. <br /> <br /> I love the portrait of the gang Robin. They are having fun, playing, laughing, they really feel the camaraderie between them, the closeness that comes from a very united group like this. Those bonding scenes are very important. <br /> <br /> I think being produced in the UK with British actors really did it better, compared to, say, the full-length version of -92 with Kevin Costner, which just feels fake. , false. (Christian Slater as Will Scarlet, come on ...) The cast of being able to speak English with a British accent makes it more credible, and I have the feeling that the actors, as well as the director and the writers, behind the series can get to themselves much more in the shoes of the Robin Hood gang than what an American crew could have. The music is wonderful, Clannad is perfect for the feel of the series. Music is another of those things that have just stuck. <br /> <br /> An exciting addition is also the fantasy and the magic spice that is put there. It is not exaggerated, but it is credible and makes everything better and more interesting. I also love how well the mixture of comedy, adventure and drama mixes. <br /> <br /> These are some of the things that make this series so vivid and genuine. It is by far the best version of Robin Hood I've ever seen. I will not end with the quote "Nothing has been forgotten". But one thing that will never be forgotten, for me, is this fantastic Robin Hood narrative. Look at it.
