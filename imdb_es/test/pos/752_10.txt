This is such a fun and funny movie. Very entertaining in all angles. It has an extravagant variety of memorable nuts, psychotic but adorable. We have; The judge, the Sargent, the child, the creepy old woman, the whore, the clown. And, unfortunately, they all live in a big house that has no locks and does not have enough staff. So for our enjoyment, we can watch them run, play games and be dangerous. We also learn a lesson along the way ... never give an ax to your patient! <br /> <br /> This was before Cukkos Nest, and it surpasses it. At least at the level of fun. It even has its sweet moments. "Love is pure, love is grace, love is strength, you love me, your love is pure, you will always love me." Now, who could resist that? Walnuts are also human. Only a few loose wires. Be careful, or you'll have an ax in the back! Children playing. Hehe <br /> <br /> The phone repairman was really funny and his reactions to the crazy and malicious bosses were truly genuine. All the characters in this movie are tremendously well interpreted. And I really found them funny. No, HILARO! They can even give you dirty thoughts of how you can take advantage of them. Or how can they take advantage of you. <br /> <br /> It's really a very smart movie. There is a brilliant final turn. I must say that I expected this to be good, but I never expected THIS. It is awful. "The court has made a decision, you are no longer in control!" I love. The end is like that, SO perfect ... you will shed a tear. <br /> <br /> I'm very excited after seeing a movie like this. I will never forget it now. It's not just a cult ... it's a CLASSIC cult. Whatever you do ... Do not look in the basement!
