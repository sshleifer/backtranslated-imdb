*Warning! Some spoilers! * <br /> <br /> Matt, a rich writer, is in fact still a child in his behavior. He does not care about anyone's needs except for his own needs and could not care less about the consequences of any of his actions. Just when he meets Nimi and his ties to his family and community, he begins to feel that something is missing in his life. <br /> <br /> He begins to realize that, in fact, he is alone and stuck in the impersonal. Structures that are only convenient but lack heart and commitment. However, he moves away from any responsibility and is reluctant to change his life. But will he be able to re-establish himself in his old life and ignore the ties that he has already unconsciously formed? <br /> <br /> Nimi's situation is the absolute opposite. They put pressure on the regulations of their Nigerian community, their prejudices and their medieval values. Being a single mother, her position is difficult and it gets worse when she falls in love with Matt, a white demon (as the Referend would say), a man who can not commit. The women of the community plan to marry her to the Referend to end her unique status and give Sammy "a name." But that would mean for Nimi to renounce all independence and self-determination. But is there an alternative for her if she wants Sammy to be accepted and for her to become a respected member of the community? <br /> <br /> This movie has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with VERY sexy scenes from Matt and Nimi) and a endearing child who is eagerly pairing, a beautiful landscape in vivid colors. <br /> <br /> Colin Firth (* swoon *) and Nia Long show great chemistry. It's just fantastic to see them. And Fissy Roberts like Sammy is to die for. You just want to adopt it. I love the way Sammy and Matthew talk to each other. Both are on the same level in many ways. Especially when Sammy asks Matt about sex. This scene is absolutely adorable! <br /> <br /> Almost nothing to complain about ... wait! That is not true. One thing is not good: that the film is not long enough! (Well, and maybe the Referendum is too bad and too stupid to be convincing ...) <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, of course!
