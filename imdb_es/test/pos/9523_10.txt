For all of us, the fans of American Deneuve, this little gem is a bit hard to come by. Fortunately, I found myself so wrapped up in the short snippets I saw in a preview on youtube.com that I was willing to make any effort. I found it on ebay.com, ordered it directly from France and changed my laptop to play Region 2 DVD. Let me tell you it was worth it. Be careful: there are NO subtitles (unfortunately, Pathe should not have released this on DVD, Koch Lorber should have done it, they are good with subtitles). I do not speak a word of French. I can pronounce a syllable here and there, order a drink and all that. That said, this movie was a delight anyway. I could not fully appreciate the supposed "obscene" humor or the witty dialogue. Seeing Deneuve and his companions was enough for me. I understood what was happening without the need for dialogue. It really says something about a movie when those who do not speak the language enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is wonderful. London is adorable as the wounded son-in-law. I loved the lesbian mom. And, of course, what can I say about our beloved Mademoiselle Deneuve? She is unique. Those eyes, that smile. I could watch his movies all day. She really goes beyond beauty. People always say that she is beautiful. Well, yes, she is. But she is also VERY talented. I believed it every second of the way. Your conversation about chocolate and vanilla with London is too sweet. His character is even arrested for smoking drugs with about 15 years on the street. DO NOT BE STRANGE! Fly to France and buy this if necessary. Cool. 10
