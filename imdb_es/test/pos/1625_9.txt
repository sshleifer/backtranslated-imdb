As a fan of the book, this work is fantastically adapted; remaining faithful to the materials of origin and demonstrating an honest respect for literary work. The intrigues translate well into the film, under the good eye of Ron Howard for the details and the sound of authenticity. <br /> <br /> I like Hanks like Robert Langdon.

He is a good dramatic actor and, although I miss his comic efforts, I enjoy his most serious performances. <br /> <br /> The issue is no less controversial than the DaVinci Code, and the Vatican seems never to learn its lesson. As with the aforementioned film, the Holy See issued a scathing rebuke and called for a global Catholic boycott of the movie, which of course generated millions in ticket sales. <br /> <br /> Although the story of "was dramatically reduced, and the science was written from this piece of science fiction, the fiction that was left was entertaining and extremely well done. who have not read the book will not notice any missing or minor elements in the story, since the screen version carries the main story by itself. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is not necessary to have seen the first delivery of this franchise, to enjoy this second, which should have been a prequel with all honesty, although that does not diminish the effectiveness, or interfere with the continuity or flow of this second job. <br /> <br /> In Overall, this is good for a Friday / Saturday night, although the execution can be a bit difficult for the little ones. <br /> <br /> It is rated an 8.8 / 10 of ... <br /> <br / > The Devil :.
