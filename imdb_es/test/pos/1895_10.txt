If you see this movie, you will be quoting it and referring to it for a long time. It's been years since I saw Dolemite and I still quote it until today. It is a true classic. It is so horrible that it makes a hilarious sight. Every terrible line of dialogue is totally amazing. Each wobbly shot a work of art (?). And every blow and kick so badly executed. You will not believe your eyes. It is all I can say. If I really understand how fascinating this movie is, I will not be able to stop and go beyond the 1000 word limit of IMDb. <br /> <br /> Please, watch this movie. You will be in hysteria. Either 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.
