Many years ago I saw this movie (on television, maybe?) And I loved it. So I decided to rent it on DVD the other day to see if it still held in my opinion. Did. <br /> <br /> Located in the famous King's Cross district of Sydney (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex shops thrive), tells the story of "Jimmy" (played by Heath Ledger). Jimmy is a young man ... maybe late teens or out there, he has not had a stable family. He is on the sidelines of society and works as a 'tout' for a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). He is aware of a figure from the underworld called "Pando", which is a local big shot on the Cross. Jimmy's hope is that he is on Pando's radar and approaches him ... a shortcut to upward social mobility, wait. <br /> <br /> One night, Jimmy meets the beautiful young Alex. (played by the lovely Rose Byrne). You only know that a love story will develop between them. Also on that night, Jimmy is contacted for the first time by Pando (played by Bryan Brown). Pando has a 'job' for Jimmy. It's the "foot in the door" what Jimmy has been waiting for! <br /> <br /> Revealing much more would ruin the many surprises that this movie has for the viewer. Stylistically, if you like the movies of Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie, you should be aware of what you can expect ... twists and turns and black comedy. <br /> <br /> What is so good about this movie is its very Australian. -ness'. It is not a mere imitation of Tarantino or Ritchie, but a genuine Australian contribution to the genre. <br /> <br /> A fascinating aspect of this movie is how everything comes together. Sometimes you are presented with characters that ask you what the hell they are doing there. In the end, all these 'loose ends' come together perfectly. It's something like a strip of Moebius celluloid. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is the character of Pando's Bryan Brown. Pando likes puzzles, and it's fun to watch him play games with his friends. They are the little details revealed about him that are so nice ... his taste for music, to begin with! <br /> <br /> Of the Heath Ledger films I've seen (The Dark Knight, 10 things I hate about you), this is perhaps your best role. It was not taken with "10 things". If you're a Heath Ledger fan (Ledger recently died of a tragic and accidental death), this is an opportunity to see him in his best Australian role, I think. There is a great chemistry between Ledger and Byrne in this film, so, on one level, it works like a beautiful love story. <br /> <br /> This movie is not part of the horror of the underworld films of Tarantino and Ritchie, but it does have some themes for adults ... scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty. In that sense, it is not an ideal film for very young viewers, but neither is it a film for which gore-hounds get excited. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must say it's great that Australia can make great movies like this one. In general, the type of films made by my country of origin can be unattractive. This film has strong points where many Australian films have weak points ... that is, it has a great story, a great performance and a great script. We need more popular and quality films like this one to be made here in Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. Other Australian films I have loved include: Breaker Morant (10/10) Mad Max 2 (10/10) My Brilliant Career (not reviewed here by me yet) Proof (nr) The Devil's Playground ( nr) The Year My Voice Broke (nr) Bad Boy Bubby (nr.) A great dark comedy) The Dish (nr.
