This era was not only the beginning of sound in cartoons, but a cartoon character that would go down in history as the most famous mouse in the world. Yes, Mickey makes his debut here, in this joyful story of life aboard a steamboat. The animation is good for its time, and the plot, although a bit simple, is quite cheerful. A true classic, and if you ever manage to put it on video, you will not regret it.
