When Wallace and Gromit stormed the scene in their Academy Award winning short, "A Grand Day Out," they created a fresh new look at the legend. After two more shorts, the dynamic duo of Aardman returned for this very entertaining and entertaining movie. He has an excellent cast of voices, funny jokes and good animation, as only Aardman could do! <br /> <br /> In this film, Wallace and Gromit execute "Anti-Pesto", a rabbit elimination company. When word gets out that a "Were-Rabbit" eats all the vegetables in the city, a frenzy occurs. Of course, Victor Quartermaine, the handsome and charming hunter of the city, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely Lady Tottington ... but can our favorite Aardman duo save the day before chaos erupts? <br /> <br /> The jokes, I should say, were hilarious. At one point, villain Victor Varter Quartermaine was showing off, prompting a character to shout: "BEWARE ... THE MOON !!!" Vintage Aardman! <br /> <br /> The characters are clear and hilarious. Our favorite Aardman team from Man and Dog entertains us as only they could, earning them their second Oscar (remember "A Grand Day Out?"). Helena Bonham Carter was great as the lovely Lady Tottington, the love interest of Wallace. Ralph Fiennes was especially funny and presumptuous as the cunning one, who wore the hunter Victor Quartermaine. But the one who really stole the show was the priest, whose antics proved to be a hilarious comic relief. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Aardman for creating another masterpiece by Wallace and Gromit!
