I went to see this movie to a book signing in Lexington, Ky last night. After a wonderful night that consisted of a few words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (he has to say everything, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell; D), friends while signing the books, and a QnA session with our favorite deadite killer the lights went out. <br /> <br /> In order not to spoil anything, I will not go into details ... but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job keeping the feeling of the classic movie film. The characters were classic 'b' characters, the place was refreshing (what movies * do you know * that are based in Bulgaria?) And the setting was almost original and fun. In addition to that, the humor that is distributed throughout the film made the audience laugh throughout much of the film. <br /> <br /> While this movie does not have as much appeal for people as some, it is a beacon of fun and laughter in a season of (as Mr. Bruce Campbell said) "b-movies" listed like "a-movies" (Haunted, Dukes of Danger, Charlie and the chocolate factory, come on guys!).
