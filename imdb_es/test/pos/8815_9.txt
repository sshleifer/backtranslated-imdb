This movie was hilarious. It gave a somewhat comical view of the British club scene, which, if you really look at it, is kind of funny. The characters in this movie were so realistic for those of us that we saw here in my house that it was like watching a movie about ourselves. <br /> <br /> There were some key scenes that really made this movie work: preparing scenes; the scene "Get me a real doctor"; The white background scene that shows each character in a total state of shipwreck, ending with the infamous line "what was he saying?" and the comedown-sunup scenes. I myself have lived these moments and I found myself laughing hysterically at my own ridiculous behavior. <br /> <br /> I can not give this movie a 10 because it is not up to Groove, which I thought was out of place. This world, but certainly has its moments. The staging and the work of the camera are excellent, it is worth mentioning the special effects and the performance is fantastic. <br /> <br /> After waiting a long time to see this movie, I am pleased to say so. That has not disappointed me. I hope to see more of the writer / director in the future.
