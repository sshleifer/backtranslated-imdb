Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget about the black guy in the action of the white girl. It happens, but it's not Samuel L. Jackson in Christina Ricci. More importantly, this film is about the values ​​and culture of people in this city of Tennessee. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinking causes millions of people in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the city minister, who also struggles with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator. It's an interesting concept and it may not work out well with everyone. <br /> <br /> Brewer shows us the region in which he grew up. Yes, it is still tainted with racial problems, although there are worse problems in many metropolitan cities. . This is in the subtext and not in the main plot of the story. People live a simpler lifestyle, but life remains complex and unbearable. <br /> <br /> Jackson and Ricci do a fantastic job in this movie. Jackson, the old blues guitarist who makes a living on his small farm. His wife of 12 years leaves him for his brother, so he spirals towards depression. Meanwhile, Ricci and Justin Timberlake have one last wild night charged with sex before being sent to the Army. Ricci suffers from a childhood of sexual abuse, although that is not revealed until later, his torment can only be mitigated by sexual incursions with several children (black and white) in the city. <br /> <br /> When Ricci is beaten up and left for dead on the road near the Jacksons farm, he finds her and takes care of her so that she can recover. He believes that it is a divine intervention that this half-naked white girl is in charge of. He grabs his Bible and prays for guidance. He rejects his sexual advances and, instead, treats her with dignity, respect and care. Something that few men in their life have ever done. <br /> <br /> She sees Jackson as a man of honor and morality in time, but she also carries her own pain. He plays his guitar and sings to him. Yes, they are the Blues and very well too. With the minister advising her, little by little she understands how to deal with the sexual abuse of her childhood. Jackson, through Ricci's transformation, realizes that he must let his own pain heal. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake returns, discharged due to "anxiety problems". While searching for Ricci, who has been living with Jackson during his recovery, he discovers that she has been promiscuous and unfaithful. <br /> <br /> He finds her and Jackson in a bar, where Jackson has decided (as part of his healing process) to get out of retirement and play Blues again. Timberlake follows them home and faces Jackson and Ricci. <br /> <br /> You'll have to watch the movie to get the rest of the story. If you decide to watch this movie, remember to watch it from the aspect of a foreign or independent film. It is a part of life, of a particular region of America that few of us can see. It is interesting and revealing. It also shows us that, regardless of the color of our skin, we all have similar problems that can be solved with similar solutions.
