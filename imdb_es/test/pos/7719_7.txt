My comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (the extra in the film) and his unfortunate evaluation of the film. I think your perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. The film was sweet, enough acting, the experience of seeing it as a pleasant diversion from a busy work week. It was not "The Hours" (acting), or "The Matrix" (Special Effects), or even "The Color Purple" (Direction). Most movies will not be. But neither was the poop party that "vinny ..." would make you believe. Sorry boy, just my 2 cents. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, it was at the end very gay stating (+ # 1). It showed a world full of diverse and less than perfect people: you know, like ours (+ # 2)! It opened a door in a culture without excluding other cultures (+ # 3). And I liked the music (+ # 4).
