Surprisingly good done for T.V. Thriller I did not expect too much from this, but I'm happy to say that this is one of the best in its class. It is fast paced and presents a solid performance and interesting events. <br /> <br /> The story hooks you from the beginning and with many successes, you can not help but find the film very interesting. <br /> <br /> The background story of Thiessen's character is difficult but it becomes a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than the stepfather of her childhood friend. <br /> <br /> The concept of "strange" and its actions are disturbing if it is considered to be a common disease in society. A serial rapist does not respect society or even his own family, and this film shows the disease and crime perfectly. <br /> <br /> My skin with the movie was a pointless situation when the character of Thiessen returns home with his deranged husband after he was released on bail. At that time she knew what she did to her young relative (played by the cute Allyson Hannigan). But that's the typical Hollywood scene that causes more problems. <br /> <br /> The climax scene shows Thiessen following her husband when he is about to commit another rape, then calls the police who arrive on time only to capture him. The end tells us that the husband was sentenced in real life for 99 years in prison. <br /> <br /> The acting is also pretty good, and Tiffany is great and beautiful as always. The address is also very good.
