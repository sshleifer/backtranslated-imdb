It's the best movie I've seen this year! Excellent detail and history (for a remake). <br /> <br /> It presents you with a "what if" situation in which the island of Japan could be totally eliminated from this land. A situation that invites reflection, life and death and not to mention all life on earth (good in this Japan in particular). It also presents a great and great solution to this massive tragedy. <br /> <br /> Terror, action, suspense, science fiction, documentary, love story and all the history of human interest that you can obtain, here you will find everything! But I also warn you that it is a true jumper of tears! All the actors, actors and all are excellent, better than any Hollywood movie! <br /> <br /> The thing is ... this could really happen anywhere on earth! Now let me ask you this after having seen it ... "What would you do if you faced this life or death situation"?
