This is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and, without a doubt, the best the festival has had to offer. I entered this movie with little or no expectation after learning that the director was responsible for the horrible vampire movie The Forsaken. And I left pleasantly surprised. The film is starring Lori, who has the fame In Crowd as a young mother whose husband has just passed away. She moves to an old family house in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is a grave for overworked children in the past. Unfortunately for them, the children return with a vengeance killing and eating everyone on their way. The movie works on many levels. It is well done, it has suspense, it has spots of good cinematography and, especially, the excellent performances of Compton. The atmosphere is spooky but a little disappointing, the score is decent and the makeup effects are horrifying and simplistic. The film maintains a spooky and disturbing tone and children with pale skin, ripped lips and hollow eyes are quite frightening and implacable. The film is original and inventive without being artistic or complicated. I can not see this movie turning it into a wide version without some slight trim and fine adjustment. But they definitely have a good product in their hands and should look for some kind of theatrical distribution. However the theater in which I saw it was horrible. The sound was terribly messy, which I felt moved away from the film and stopped in the middle because they could not center it on the screen, which killed a little the mood. In general, although it was the most satisfying of the most horrible entries, perhaps because it had less expectations, but it was a welcome addition to the genre films.
