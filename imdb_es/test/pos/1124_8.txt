As someone who was in a pan-Hellenic brotherhood, I was not sure what to expect when I tuned into this program. After seeing so many dramatizations about "made for television movies" and the madness of reality shows, I was curious to see if the Greek could show the true life experience of the College and the Greek. <br /> <br /> I I was pleasantly surprised by the way the program was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the always familiar characters of this genre, but he was also able to add depth to the characters. Greek life is not just about parties and small conflicts. Although these things occur in Greek life, they also occur in any other social or professional circle throughout a person's life. To characterize it as an exclusive experience for those in a Greek organization would be false. Most of the story lines and situations that take place in Greek can take place everywhere, in every circle of friends, in sports teams, in real life. But I've seen both episodes and my "little sister" to whom I'm still very close, and I've spent both episodes laughing and reminding them how they really captured the spirit of our college years and experiences. <Br /> <br /> I liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggle with the other facets of their lives; school, relationships, goals, etc. Cappie telling Rusty that school comes first and go to your brothers for help, that was very true to life. You can not stay in an organization if you have bad grades. The way Rusty got his assignment to his teacher was crazy, but it was entertaining. Even the dynamic between Casey and Rusty; It happens, you grow and whatever your relationship with your brother (s), changes, so you must adapt. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that Greek is a great show, great entertainment value and enough "real life" there to be credible and definitely worth the spectators' time.
