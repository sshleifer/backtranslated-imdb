A bus leaves a man without a name outside a Standard Oil petrol station in the middle of nowhere. We never learn where the bus is coming from, why it is in it, or who it is. Why is he the only passenger? Is he a prisoner? Is the "annoying man" referred to in the title of the film? Has he died and gone to heaven, or to hell? As our man, we do not have the opportunity to stop and ask ourselves. He is received by a kind of guardian and transferred to an anodyne city. From the first day, all elections are made for him. An apartment has been rented, a job has been found, an office has been assigned. In fact, his life is not totally different from life in the virtual reality of corporate cubicles and suburban condominiums. Women do not have hearts, dinners are a burden, office jobs stink. But some pieces do not fit the puzzle. Silently, gray-clothed hoodlums roam the streets. Are they some kind of paramedics, or the secret police? And why are there no children? Is the story even set in the real world? Every time we think we can get some answers, new mysteries are developed. "The Bothersome Man" leaves you half relieved that it's over, half of wanting more. I hope they become a computer game soon.
