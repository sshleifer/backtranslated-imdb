If you are going to see this movie because Michael Caine or Michael Gambon are in it, then do not bother, it's not your typical role, although I found Gambon fantastic. Instead, look at Dylan Moran. I'm a fan of everything I've seen and this is no exception. I did not even realize that I could act, but even the characters that have to pass themselves off because they seemed completely credible, which is impressive considering that the public knows they are fake. <br /> <br /> The plot is great and, although it is not a constant laugh, it has many other charms. A great movie for people with a sense of humor.
