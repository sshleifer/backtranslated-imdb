If it were possible to award a 10+ ... this would be the movie you would choose. <br /> <br /> I remember having captured this movie on television many, many years ago, and fortunately, I prepared myself enough for the video Now my video copy is getting old, video technology is out of date and I'm starting to Worry about not being able to enjoy the delights of this movie for much longer. <br /> <br /> Like a wildlife movie, it's magnificent. As a film about the relationship between man and nature, it exceeds everything that was projected before or after. How can the film industry allow a classic like this to go unnoticed and forgotten? If there is such a thing as a lobby / pressure group to push this film to re-launch, tell me and send me the details soon. <br /> <br /> My opinion is that there is a mint to be made by Anyone who can relaunch this in today's market.
