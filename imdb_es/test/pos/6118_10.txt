I loved this thing. The most wonderful thing about Pink Flamingos is that he tries desperately to have a horrible taste, but he has really won a cult of followers all over the world. It says a lot about us (being people) it does not. Pink Flamingos succeeds because Waters made the movie he wanted to make. A film does not have to be disgusting to be successful, but it can be. When you look at this movie, you see things that are unpleasant, but that are ultimately brilliant because they are displayed freely. What we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression. All those who want to succeed as artists, whether in a movie or in any other medium, should watch this movie.
