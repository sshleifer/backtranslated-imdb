This is an excellent movie that I've been watching since I was 6 years old with my older sister. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again and still laugh, smile and cry every time without getting bored as much as the other movies. It is a film that will live forever through generations of families. I love it :) when I rank from 1 to 10 in my case I would easily rate 9.9 each time. <br /> <br /> It's a film about changing a girl (baby) and her first boyfriend (Johnny) her relationships within the family, changes in the world view of babies and Johnny during their relationship . <br /> <br /> THE DIRTY DANCING WILL ALWAYS LIVE LIKE A CLASSIC WITHOUT TIME. Thanks, I'm sorry for the brief comment.
