While in one country, Spain, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali combined forces to create the point of reference for short film cinematographic surrealism, Un Chien Andalou, Walt Disney and his collaborator Ub Iwerks in America worked on Steamboat Willie, the most prominent of the first synchronized sound cartoons (it was revealed that this was not the first, unlike other reports). It is also one of the most successful and simplistic Mickey Mouse shorts (even in a silent movie form, the only sounds are tiny noises and beeps from Mickey and the animals). He also happens pretty fast for his career of less than ten minutes. But in these minutes, one has the immediate feeling of how much fun Disney has with his characters, and how the new use of sound changes the way his creation uses animals as musical tools. There is not a story to talk about, just random things that happen and happen because of Mickey (err, Steamboat Willie) on this boat in a river. And like the best Mickey Mouse shorts, his lack of oral expression is an advantage. It is a must if you have not seen it as a child, but if you do, it might be worth taking another look.
