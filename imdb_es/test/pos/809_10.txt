In a better civilization, this and many other films by David Suchet will be released in cinemas. The plots are fabulous (no, I had no idea who had done it, but the clues were all there if it had been more imaginative, the best kind of mystery), the production valued in a surprising way, the performance (by Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Lysette Anthony, Megan Dodds and, of course, David Suchet as Hercule Poirot) are just perfect, the wonderful dialogue, the music and the feeling of suspense and tension are wonderful things. <br /> <br /> One of the pleasures of Hercule Poirot films for a man is the amount of beautiful women that star! Here we had two: the sexy and sinuous Megan Doods and the impressive Lysette Anthony. <br /> <br /> You really can not go wrong with the rental of these, they are wonderful, like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant. with the most perfect company you can imagine: your mind is constantly working because everything is there and you struggle, but keeping your mind constantly thinking that you can keep up with everything, and the configuration is magnificent. <br /> <br /> I can not think of movies that stimulate thought more than these Hercule Poirot / David Suchet movies. It is impossible to praise them too much, and I had never seen one before a few months ago, nor did I read an Agatha Christie.
