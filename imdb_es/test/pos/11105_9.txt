For the 80s, this is a very dark movie. At this point, the filmmakers began to operate on the assumption that all films require a comic comic relief (which, of course, is now taken to the extreme), flashy action scenes (even more exaggerated today) or scenes of torrid sex. /> <br /> Hutton and Penn are stupendous in their roles as childhood friends turned into Soviet spies. Penn in particular is brilliant as the unfortunate drug dealer Daulton Lee. <br /> <br /> What you have here is a real thriller / drama. There are no treats to talk about, but the story is so compelling and the performance so magnificent that (hopefully) most people would not miss it. There are a couple of funny scenes, in particular in which Penn tries to get his Soviet benefactors involved in a major drug trafficking business. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
