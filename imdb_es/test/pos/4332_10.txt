This movie is true action at its best, there is nothing better than this. This is one of those movies that you can relax and see some good and good shots and murders, plus there are some excellent lines that accompany all this. My favorite is that there is a bad guy who is getting into this old couple's house and is stealing a TV or something, and he comes up to them and yells "¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Every time I like it !!! "and just before he jumps out the window, he yells" Anytime! "I mean, this is just classical things in every way, so If you have a choice, you can see Will Smith trying to play an action movie or you can see one of the Charles Bronson Masters.
