Hurray for Korean cinema! Last year I saw "Chungyang" and "Nowhere to hide", now I catch up with the directorial debut of Hur Jin-ho "Christmas in august". The variety of subjects and the level of achievement speak very well of a mature national cinema for discovery. The main themes of this film are death and love. The elegant and thoughtful way that Jung Won (Han Suk-kyu) faces his imminent death and the sublimation of his desires towards Darim (Shim Eun-Ha) by true love towards her. I was deeply moved by his careful handling of behavior and emotions, protecting Darim from unnecessary pain without rejecting it. <br /> <br /> The success of this type of film is based on the skill of the actors. Han and Shim excel, both being quite expressive and naturalistic. Several secondary characters, relatives, friends and clients of Jung Won, are quickly drawn to enrich the story without playing down its main focus. LIVING is love, but all things must happen. The pain gives. Life goes on.
