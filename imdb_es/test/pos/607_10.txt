This film is about the aging of geishas in the postwar period of Tokyo. Okin, played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara, lends money to two other former Geisha, Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki) and they resent the way she is somewhat presumptuous. Tamae has a son, Otomi a daughter, who during the film announces that she will abandon them, while Okin, never a mother, receives visits from two men from her past who, it seems, only want money from her. It is a convincing account of the decisions you make, what you do to overcome life and who you are responsible for and who you are responsible for. Haruko Sugimara has always been for me one of the best actresses of character of all countries, and plays Okin, who is almost inflexible and un compassionate, with an air of superiority that makes you not like her, but at the same time almost envy. At a time when the great films were made by Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita and Kurosawa, among others, Mr. Naruse is by his side. If you have a free region DVD player, you should try to find the two sets of Naruse boxes launched in England. I think this movie was a great study of women's characters who are in danger of being irrelevant. That in fact they are not it makes of this film a true masterpiece.
