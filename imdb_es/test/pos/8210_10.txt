Why all the negative reviews? You did not expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece, right? What we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and worked for me. He is not an Oscar contender, just entertainment. You can really see how the movie has aged, especially with everything the Internet has to offer today. I still remember when it was launched for the first time and the network was still so new. Mad and terrifying thoughts when I saw this for the first time; I was 15 years old and I seriously thought that someone could get your information on a computer and destroy you. But who can say that it can not happen? I'm not the kind of person to kill a movie to death, analyzing it until it's blue in the face. That is not my style. Medium performance, suspensive and once again, very entertaining. Sandra Bullock as Angela Bennett is so cute. This is my favorite movie with her because she is like the genius of the computer, which I find very attractive. Of all the films that were released in 1995, this would have to be my favorite, although I did not see it until 1996. My rating, 9/10, because it slowed down a bit.
