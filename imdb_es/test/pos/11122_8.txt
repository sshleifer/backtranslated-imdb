Fame is one of the best movies I've seen about The Performing Arts. The music and the performance are excellent. The script and set design are also excellent. My favorite part is when all the students start dancing and making music in the canteen. I can watch this movie many times and I never get bored. I give it 8 1/2 out of 10.
