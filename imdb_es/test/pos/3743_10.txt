Oh yeah! Hollywood remembers how to use the old good formula, and when the rays fall, it's a pretty wonderful feeling. Hollywood rarely creates a masterpiece because lately, there seems to be more concern about rushing and getting the biggest rewards in a hurry, or there are too many chefs in the mix. In general, good film scripts are the result of a talented writer who has total control of their property, understands their material and is a good writer. Then, there is a small, important part, often neglected by marketing geniuses who often lack creativity and vision: a good actor. <br /> <br /> A good actor can make the difference between a mediocre and half-hearted attempt. , and a completely realized film that could not be an important and relevant film, but one that contributes to its genre and that eventually becomes a classic of its kind. We have very few romantic comedies, and we are people who are hungry for them. Buried in the sexy mood of "Sex in the City" is the romantic and stormy relationship of Big and Carrie, and people flocked to "Mamma Mia" because she had some romance, played skillfully by Streep and Brossnam. I could have a silly musical, but it touched us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "Nights" offers more of that, with the incredible talent of a woman who does a magnificent job in romantic movies, Diane Lane. From her days as a child actress, we could appreciate how her talent, combined with her appreciative soul, allowed us to see in the hearts of the protagonists of the story. A few years ago, he partnered with Mr. Gere, giving us a tormented, romantic and sexy presentation as the wife who is not quite sure of the consequences of her actions in "Infidel", a job that should have earned her at least one Award from The academy. She is back, doing a more formidable job in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up her romantic perspectives, and suddenly realizes that there might be another opportunity just around the corner. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lane makes this movie vibrate with intelligence and passion. His facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions his character experiences. We can read frustrations, longings, desperation, anger, hope, loss and a range that is far from reaching many of the commercial types that Hollywood constantly pushes down in our throats. Here is a mature artist who has the gift of projecting real emotions and allows us to connect with the material in such a way that we are moved as we become part of the experience. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Lane is such a triumphant joy to see how it goes through the transformations of the first scenes of the film until the end. Her discoveries become ours as we celebrate with her the power of hope and love. She is able to recover the unsurpassed joy of a person in love, just as a teenager does, and yet she never lets you think of her character as silly or irresponsible. His eyes are expressive gems that can move even the cynics of the audience. She is one of the stars that can do wonders with just one look. In her they return the classic sensations of those great films of yesterday. Her work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of Hepburn, Davis, Garson, women who played everyday types and made them memorable because they created complete characters. <br /> <br /> We admire those excellent actresses who recreate real-life legends and are rewarded for it. Half of his work is done by the mystique of the figures they personify; However, as much as anyone can make you think, it is Lane's roles in this film that are a most impressive achievement because they are created from scratch, they are given a personal impression and are capable of reaching heights without any kind of previous theatrical material support, as as plays, and the background of a famous legend whose life is paid tribute on the silver screen. Lane's character is a woman whose experiences could be any of us. She represents our dreams and emotions with a lot of quality, class and the right amount of feeling. It's a pretty remarkable achievement, and we should be grateful that we can still find such a remarkable performance today. <br /> <br /> There are some adjectives you could use to pay tribute to your work, but I can only say that, in my humble opinion, every part of your work in this film is testimony to one of the best performances that a Live artist puts on celluloid. Thank you, Mrs. Lane.
