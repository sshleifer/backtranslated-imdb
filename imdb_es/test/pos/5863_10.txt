This movie is possibly one of the most creative horror plays in history. It has everything you could want: suspense, drama, comedy, confused plots, Native Americans, brains ... If you're looking for the whole, the end of all the brains movies, look no further. The story of a man, determined to take revenge. And what better way to get it? "I know, I'll suck your brain!" With excellent sound effects and impressive special effects, I can not recommend this movie enough.
