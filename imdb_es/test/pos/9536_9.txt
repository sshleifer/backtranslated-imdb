The book "The Railway Children" is a book for children published in 1906 by Edith Nesbit, one of the first British socialists who had very strong opinions about the importance of family values ​​for the education of children, and that the history that I counted was destined to be contemporary. . Surprisingly, it seems to retain an important attraction for today's children a hundred years later. <br /> <br /> A film adaptation of an Edwardian classic tale for children with the main roles played by children does not sound very exciting. the majority of moviegoers in this day and age. But a very good performance of Jenny Agutter, who (near the beginning of her long and distinguished career as an actress) played the role of the oldest girl Roberta (Bobby), combined with the remarkable work of screenwriter and director Lionel Jeffries and the excellent picture of Arthur Ibbetson, has made this a film that can not be missed, and that most of its viewers find memorable. It is remarkable that this book, set in 1905, was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000, (four of them by the BBC for British television), and all these versions are not only very admired but also highly appreciated. (something that the user comments on in this database will confirm it), although this seems almost inconceivable for a story of the nostalgic period designed to attract mainly children. As I have not seen the four versions of BBC TV, these comments refer exclusively to the 1970 film version produced to be screened in cinemas. Unlike most children's book films, 'The Railway Children' can appeal more to adults than to children. The structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children may feel totally lost by the way it is shown in the film, while many older adults may discover that it has considerable nostalgic appeal. Perhaps compensating for this, the children that appear in the film are full of life and vitality, while the adult characters, although well rounded, tend to be mostly "stuffed shirts". The story is mature, it deals with love, support and encouragement, not only is it timeless but it can be attractive for all ages. It can be described as quite sentimental and more than a little idealized, but it is never anything stupid, and that adjective rarely justified "uplifting" fits like a glove. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead. <Br /> <br /> The film begins with its upper-middle-class Edwardian family celebrating Christmas in a comfortable and fairly spacious London home when two unexpected visitors call and take their father (who is a government official) ). The mother has to move to a very small cabin next to the railway in a remote part of Yorkshire and the children gradually build a new life associated mainly with the railroad and the few passing trains. This life is shown quite agitated in small ways and the eldest daughter Bobby grows rapidly as she assumes more responsibilities for her mother. At one point, avoid an accident on the train when your sharp eyes detect that a landslide has created a natural hazard. The father's story is never given much emphasis, but he never forgets it and gradually it becomes clear that he is imprisoned and is suspected of treason. Finally, these suspicions are clarified (we are not told how or why) and reappears unexpectedly at the local station to meet with his family. <br /> <br /> For many years, this movie was not available in any home video format in North America, but Anchor Bay created a DVD with him three years ago, so they clearly recognized that this fairly simple movie It has not lost its appeal yet. For anyone who does not yet have one, I would strongly recommend that you buy a copy of this DVD while it is available. It is very likely that you will not be disappointed unless you have become totally cynical, or your minimum requirements for a movie include blood buckets and / or scenes of intense sex.
