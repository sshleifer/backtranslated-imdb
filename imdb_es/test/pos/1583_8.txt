I recently watched episodes 1-4, and now I can not wait for 5 and 6 to be available! (I heard they will be coming soon). The commander's record seems destined to become a cult success among the people of the university and everyone else with a taste for quirky comedy. It is obvious that the budget was small, but the care taken in the elaboration of the script is quite evident. In fact, the simplicity of the show allowed me to appreciate writing and acting more. Bowlsby is a master of humiliation ... I wish I could remember the best ones to use later with confident colleagues! Let's just say that if you do not like the registration of the commander, I will personally take care that your clothes do not have extra starch!
