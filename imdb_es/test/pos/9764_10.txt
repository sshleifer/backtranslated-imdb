This movie is a dream: I have seen all the miniseries that have been seen on television, sometimes, and this is the best. Beautifully released, superbly acted, and the characters are well developed. Helen Morse fits perfectly on the part of Jean Paget: strident, in control, sharp and a little belligerent. He says goodbye to Joe Harmon, the cowboy / taciturn / "He'll be fine", a kind of boy. I regretted that the film did not adhere to the book, since there was no romantic interest between Noel Struan and Jean Paget. For those who do not know, this is taken from a true story about English women marched around Malaya for 3 years by the Japanese, who in fact did not know what to do with them. Very few of them survived. Neville Shute spoke with one of them, and this is his story. This movie deserves to be in the collection of all those who love the stories of World War II.
