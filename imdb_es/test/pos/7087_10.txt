It can be written by someone who has been there, but only if he has been there. Excellent performances by Meryl Streep (of course!), Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. <br /> <br /> Many people have said that it is a dysfunctional family, I believe that every family is dysfunctional when faced with this type of people. torment. Being NOT dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! You are losing your family as you know it, can there be anything worse? People need to watch this movie, so when they face this nightmare they may change the way they do it. You may see that the father is denying himself valuable time that he will never have a chance again. They may realize how difficult it is to die, or watch someone you love die. They did not miss much of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.
