Helges best movie by far. Very funny, very surreal. If Bunuel made a movie starring Buster Keaton as Krusty the Clown, it would look like that. <br /> <br /> Brilliant performances from the cast that we already know from other Schneider films, especially Helmut KÃ¶rschgen as the partner of 00Schneider. (Andreas Kunze who once again plays the wife in this case is a bit annoying). And, of course, Helge himself as Nihil Baxter is absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S: If this movie had an adequate commercialization, I would really like to buy a replica of that "Holz ist" box.
