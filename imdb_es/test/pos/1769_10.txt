Pavarotti and all the cast are excellent in this beautifully filmed opera by Giuseppe Verdi, the best opera composer in the world. The coloratura soprano is particularly spectacular with its perfect tone. The title role is well promulgated and sung. All production is as perfect as you would expect. <br /> <br /> A masterpiece of cinematography! <br /> <br />
