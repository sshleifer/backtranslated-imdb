Bud Abbott and Lou Costello always had a lot of fans among the kids, but in their careers I think you could say they just made a movie that could be designed for kids. Jack and the Beanstalk was that movie. <br /> <br /> It was part of an independent arrangement of two Warner Brothers films, with the second film being Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd. These were the only two movies that the boys made in color. <br /> <br /> The two, unemployed as usual, accept a job for a very precocious and detestable young man, David Stollery, as a nanny. Although he starts with Costello wanting to read the boy, Jack and the Beanstalk as a bedtime story, the young boy reads it to Costello. Lou falls asleep and in his dreams he fantasizes about being the giant killer Jack. <br /> <br /> Buddy Baer, ​​who threatened the children in Africa Screams, is the giant and has Dorothy Ford of giant size as his housekeeper. Dorothy was a big girl, 6'2 ", and you can imagine that she had some difficulty in being chosen, except when her stature was used as a joke.One of the only players who looked at her was John Wayne in Three Godfathers at 6 '4 " Henry Fonda and James Stewart in On Our Merry Way were also just above her, but again their height was part of a gag. <br /> <br /> Shaye Cogan and James Alexander were the princess and the prince of fantasy and sang beautifully, but I could not act with any courage. This was the last film by William Farnum, whose career goes back to the first days of the silent screen and even at the beginning of the last century on stage. He played the father of the king of Princess Shaye. <br /> <br /> Some not terribly memorable musical numbers came from Jack and the Beanstalk, except the title song. I remember when I was a kid I had the record of 78 of Bud and Lou singing the song and reciting the story. I had my first one-digit years, but I became a lifelong fan through that and its television series. <br /> <br /> Jack and the Beanstalk is still a good image for children, although I warn parents to warn their little hedgehogs not to imitate the young master Stollery.
