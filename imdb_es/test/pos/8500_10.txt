This type of show is not supposed to happen on television. This is the kind of nervousness usually reserved for independent films. This is what only HBO is supposed to do. The fact is that Denis Leary has managed to create one of the best television programs in history, easily joining the ranks of THE SOPRANOS, OZ, ED, etc. Mr. Leary and his gang for creating a truly unique visual experience. My only complaint is that the program is not long enough ... one hour would improve it, but I can not wait for the next episode!
