I really enjoy this particular production of "The Mikado". The producers added some touches to make it more fun for modern audiences, for example, "As Some Day It May Happen" (the song of the "little list") is updated completely, and some lines are improvised throughout the play . They also took liberties with the stage. The costumes are not Japanese, but rather English from the 1920s (although some of the "Tittipudlian" girls wear kimonos inspired by the 1920s). This production is well choreographed with some dance styles from the 1920s, and there are some extra chambermaids and dance buttons to keep your eyes (and ears) entertained during the songs. If you're a Gilbert & Sullivan purist, these changes may bother you, but I think they're fine, and I love costumes! <br /> <br /> Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely hilarious; all her scenes make me laugh out loud (one of my favorite accessories is when she makes an entrance for the first time, the dance buttons bother her with her antics, so she screams at the top of her voice, "STOP!") . All the other main characters also do a good job. I particularly like Mark Richardson as Pish-Tush (that toupee!) And Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yum. <br /> <br /> You should keep in mind that this is a theatrical production that is being filmed and set your expectations accordingly. There are no changes of scenery, although the filmmakers used some cinematographic techniques from the 1930s to add interest. If there is a drawback in this production, it is that the stage makeup was not modified for close-up shots with a camera. The base lines are often visible and there seems to be an excess of eyeliner, lipstick and blush everywhere. I've seen this kind of thing happen before with theater films, and it's a bit jarring at first. However, I hope you get used to it and enjoy "El Mikado" for what it's worth, a completely funny interpretation of a classic!
