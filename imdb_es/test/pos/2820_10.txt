Normally I do not like dark / psychological things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing job. History, acting, filming, psychological issues, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are quite complex and convincing. Rose interprets the complexities and changes of a psychologically disturbed woman quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way in which energy exchange problems were handled. It was so intense for us to see that we were coming out of three rooms to "have tea" and I felt compelled to take a shower. The story was exciting, but clearly we could not handle all the energy at once. (It goes into the rough and grimy side of people, but does not leave you there). I thought about the characters and deeper meanings for a long time. I would highly recommend this one. Stay prepared for an experience that you may not be waiting for.
