Absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all time on so many levels. Hardware junkies will drool over the largest mass of flying Spitfires out of a recreation of the Battle of Britain. No less than eight flying Spits are available for very precise ground and air sequences. <br /> <br /> Those who marvel at the tradition of flying and go crazy reciting High Flight will identify with the reverence of the central characters for the freedom to be fast, free and high in their dark blue world. Be careful: romantics and even dog lovers enjoy a very emotional journey in this film. The central message is one shared by many war veterans, in the sense that their best hours, their period of life in which they felt most alive, was actually during the war when everything else is sad and gray. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns the Czech pilots who escape from their country when the Nazis invade and join the Free Czech Squadron of the RAF. There are some subplots, all of which deserve careful attention. This is simply an excellent old movie that even the most ardent anti-hardware romantics will love (keep the Kleenex handy). Beautiful photography, first class performance, accurate details of the life of the RAF during the Battle of Britain. Easily a candidate for the personal DVD collection of any aviation enthusiast.
