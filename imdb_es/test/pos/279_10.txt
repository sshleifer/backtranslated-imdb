In moments of desperation we were willing to do whatever was necessary to win. I loved how the futility of maple leaves was used as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa. The performance was accurate by far superior to the ingestion of mealybugs given by the film industry. <br /> <br /> Great edition! At the end of the short, I felt it was a bit incomplete, but so is life, and this is if life and art became a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Excuse me while I rinse the cheese genius, but I suppose it's acceptable at certain times. <br /> <br /> Two scenes that I should point out are: The bathtub and the sofa scene. <br /> <br /> The sofa scene for Tessa was a decisive and 360 moment of the human condition. Throughout the short I saw her as a brute beast, but now we see her true reality. His mind spoke before his heart. I need to say more about the bathtub scene.
