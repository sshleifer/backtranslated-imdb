Be sure to make this lovely comedy part of your vacation! If you admire Dennis Morgan or Barbara Stanwyck, this movie is fun to watch. They really work well together as you would see in this movie. The whole cast was very entertaining. Since I'm a fan of Dennis Morgan, this movie was a real pleasure! But ... everyone can enjoy it! Recommended!
