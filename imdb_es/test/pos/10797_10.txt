In one of the lesser-known films of the late 1980s, at a time when Oliver Stone was at the top with Platoon and Wall Street (and before his birthday on July 4), he wrote the script and directed this look a The world of radio, specifically a radio host in central Texas. This man is Barry Champlain, in a unique twist in the career of Eric Bogosian, who wrote the original work and also co-wrote the script. Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those experts you listen to on the radio stations that many of us could turn off. He has ideas in mind, opinions, and not only is he not afraid to say them, but also to face the people who call by phone. The callers, in fact, are the driving force of the film, since Barry has to fight against the senseless, the obscene, the racist and the purely distracted. As this happens, he also has to deal with his boss (Alec Baldwin) and a successful agreement for the entire nation, outside the boundaries of the Southern Way station where he is. <br /> <br /> While after watching the movie I was curious to see how it would have been done on stage (I guess it was a one-man show, since Bogosian has had several on the side), the direction of the film is phenomenal. Stone has been known, almost pigeonholed, as a director who loves the quick cuts, the unlimited effects of montage and the effects of camera styles and other little tricks, which give his films in the 90s a distinctive and almost automatic. But in the 80s I had this energy and a feverish quality in the aspect of the film, and I was not as frantic as the other films. To add the appropriate intensity that is inside the study and the head space of Barry Champlain, he and DP Robert Richardson make the space seem claustrophobic at times, gritty, insecure and definitely on the edge. The scenes in the middle of the film, when Barry is not in the studio, are pretty standard, but the style along with the substance in the radio scenes is among the best I've seen of the Stone / Richardson combination. <Br /> <br /> And one can not miscalculate Bogosian's performance, which can be nasty, offensive, angry, passive, and everything we love and hate in the radio show hosts. There is also a fun supporting role, which distracts almost Michael Wincott as Kent / Michael / Joe, who jokes one night, and the next is invited to the studio. These scenes are a little uncomfortable for the viewer, but they go deep into the space of the subculture of the 80s that Barry is as intrigued as he is critical. The stoner can not "understand" him, but as he says "it's your program". In fact, it is difficult to cover everything that happens inside the talk, and there is a lot of that. But it's never boring, and like Champlain himself, it's not easy to ignore. And when Bogosian gets into his climactic diatribe in the air, with the background spinning in a continuous 360 degree turn, it becomes intoxicating, and it's one reason freedom of expression is so powerful. a filmmaker of hot topics, which addresses issues that were or are still controversial, and gives them a vital force that is not always great, but is all yours. Here, his abilities and ambitions do not get in the way of Bogosian; it is reinforced, in any case, by making an extremely skillful vision of what is essentially a one-man show, which in itself is already well written.
