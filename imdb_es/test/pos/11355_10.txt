It is easy to see why many people consider that In the Mood for Love is the best film of Wong Kar-Wai. The film's attenuated appeal, centered on the studied vision of a relationship set through an emotional timbre, is retreaded into the territory of Happy Together but without the hyper-kinetic mosaic of discordant films and hyper-saturated sequences that have been become a registered trademark of the Kar-Wai movies from Chungking Express. Like The Limey of Soderbergh, this is a different kind of curiosity for Kar-Wai; where dialogue and plot are abandoned by mood and composition to create a story of two delicate lives in an apparently confined emotional stasis. <br /> <br /> It is a testimony of the genius of Kar-Wai that he is capable of. making a story so simple so resonant. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in the next door inside the same apartment building. He is a journalist who dreams of publishing martial arts novels and she is the secretary of a shipping company. His eventual coupling is obvious from the start, but the pleasure here is the way Kar-Wai ambiguously paints such a trip with his big master blows. <br /> <br /> The key to the success of the film is the use of Kar-Wai. of the interior space, playing with foreground and background shots in a similar way to Polanski's works. During the seductive first half of the film, Kar-Wai isolates Leung and Cheung in shots in such a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible. Kar-Wai cares about the environment and space here, creating a close emotional dynamic between his characters. It is also revealing that Kar-Wai never chose to focus on the physicality of the spouses of Mo-Wan and Li-zhen. Their faceless couples are noticeably absent from the film, as they deal with their own love affairs with each other. <br /> <br /> This does not suggest that In the Mood for Love is a limited experience because Kar-Wai manages to flood his film with wide splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sound. There is a shot where the slow and sensual rise of Cheung, a metaphorical staircase that becomes the descent of Leung by the same staircase; their movements complement each other perfectly, corner the shot and create a sensation of erotic duality between the two figures. Their souls have connected but they have not yet physically united. The erotic displacement of these scenes is fascinating and frustrating, since two lovers of the crossed stars reject physical consummation due to their humble fidelity. <br /> <br /> Other scenes in the film are peppered with short slow-motion footage of Cheung. moving erotically through his inner environment, established by the eerily beautiful score of Mike Galasso. Cheung's dresses wonderfully complement her outer space as she moves slowly through her surroundings. His movements slowly build up towards what seems to be an inevitable fusion between Li-szhen and his dream lover, although the process of seduction seems to be completely unconscious. <br /> <br /> If it seems that these two characters are more like two birds releasing pheromones to each other, it probably is not so exaggerated of an affirmation. The close bond these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship with the outdoors. The film rarely moves to an outer space and, when the camera does, usually reaches its peak through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals. Kar-Wai continues to mock us even when the lovers get close enough to touch, breaking the couple's proximity to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps inside garments located inside a closet. Mother Nature even seems to respond to her lust for love, often unleashing a soft ridge of rain on the characters after their bodies have slipped close to each other. <br /> <br /> The shots of a captivating waterfall by Kar-Wai allowed Laung of Leung Yu-Fai to experience a cathartic launch in Happy Together, even if the Po Po wing of Leslie Cheung was not there to enjoy it with him. . At the end of that movie, love was so inextricably linked to the act of war that a third man's declarations of love indicated that Yu-Fai had realized that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if not he returned his. lover. Mo-Wan's journey ends within the confines of a ruined temple. His own emotional exhaustion compares quite well with the political climate of his country, and the absence of Li-szhen is only tolerable by the fact that Kar-Wai allows Mo-Wan to experience a kind of liberation. Mo-Wan deals with an ancient myth and his secret release in a crack in the temple leaves him capable of living his days in the hope that all his loss and pain have somehow served a higher purpose.
