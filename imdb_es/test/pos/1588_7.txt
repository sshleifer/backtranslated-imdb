Luchino Visconti has become famous in the world after his wonderful production THE LEOPARD. Film fans knew the style of the director who was presented as one of the new realists of the postwar period, an aristocrat who developed his individual thinking and, consequently, expressed them as an artist. However, when applied to this film, MORTE A VENEZIA based on the novel by Thomas Mann, is a slightly different story. <br /> <br /> The full movie is, at first sight, so unique, so psychological and much more influenced by the various thoughts of an artist (both the director and the main character, Gustav von Aschenbach), which seems to be "inadmissible" for many spectators. Therefore, such opinions about the film were raised as "too slow", "unbearable" or "endless boredom". Why? The reason seems to be in a significant point of view widely spread today: "THE GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLEL OF AN INCREDIBLE ACTION". Here, it would be appropriate to say: "THE GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLEL OF ANY ACTION". In fact, everyone could say a phrase about the content of the whole movie and that would be enough. Everything we find in MORTE A VENEZIA has a vague sense of reality that is full of both depth and superficiality that seems to be significant for the good of each moment. And this is when we notice the psychedelic scenes in Venice, when we see Gustav at the railway station, when we receive his intensely emotional memories. The perception of your declining mind is sometimes so intense that the only way in which the viewer can continue to watch the film is to do everything possible to feel and experience, instead of seeing and thinking. Everything is doomed to fade, to wither like flowers in the meadow when the time comes. In other words, everything has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogues. As a result, it is very unlikely that you get the idea of ​​the movie after a single viewing. It must be seen more than twice with the mind that is constantly open. Whether you like it or not ... that's a different story, very personal. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​are the factor that is evident at first sight and remains with us at all times. Beauty as something very significant for the main character that seems to come and go; it rests as something for which it is directed so badly and that it arrives in the most unexpected way; feeling that he finds in a teenager who appears as a model of all dreams and desires, like a forbidden fruit of homosexual lust that vanishes. Costume designer Piero Tosi does a splendid job in this movie. Through a lot of wonderful costumes, it gives us a very realistic view of 1911 when the action takes place. The director of photography Pasqualino De Santis gives us a fantastic visual experience that can be called a true feast for the eyes. And in the background is the music of Gustav Mahler, the composer whose life inspired Thomas Mann to present the character. <br /> <br /> The performances are top-notch, particularly from Dirk Bogart as the main character, Gustav von Aschenbach, who wants to rest after an arduous artistic work and in vain tries to find it in crowded Venice. For most of the movie, we have a great idea of ​​their thoughts, feelings and acts of anger, exhaustion and despair. Although sometimes depressing, it keeps us on the right path to the end, without losing hope for the less tragic ending ... Tadzio (Bjorn Andersen) describes the model of decadent homosexual desire, but also a model of beauty and purity that seems to last quite. short ... "Adieu Tadzio, it was too short", says the main character. Mark Burns does a great job, although very controversial, as a kind of "super ego" Alfred with whom Gustav makes polemics about ideals such as beauty, justice, hope, human dignity. For Alfred, beauty belongs to the senses. What a Freudian and, however, how dangerous the idea could be! And always present in the Italian artistic films of the time, Silvana Mangano, here as an elegant lady from Poland, the mother of Tadzio. <br /> <br /> Memorable moments constitute the strengths of the film; However, not all viewers will find them unforgettable. They, like all the strange movie, require a lot of effort to get to the right path in the director's individual ego and within the four walls of his psyche. Among such scenes, I consider that the sequence of the beach is quite important, particularly the way in which Gustav observes Tadzio. The physical distance accurately represents the lack of courage to approach ... I also appreciate the shots when Gustav is sitting on the gondola and the view of the city moves in the background, the memorable thing that can elevate existential transference thoughts. Are not we, the people, a kind of "passers-by" in the world, in the journey that is life? <br /> <br /> In the end, I have to tell you one important thing. I found MORTE A VENEZIA extremely rare until I started to look more deeply at what the director is really trying to convey. Then, each scene turned out to be significant in its interpretation with which you do not have to agree (I almost do not agree with what the main character does), but at least you must tolerate it as something the author did not want to say. Listen to your voice, allow a few words on a page of reality ... <br /> <br /> Therefore, there is a long way to understanding the film since not many films like that were made in 1971 and they are doing now. Paradoxically, it seems that, in the long term, we are all obliged to have the right feelings about this film, similar to what we are all forced to experience once in a strange, inevitable and generally unexpected reality: death is .. 7/10
