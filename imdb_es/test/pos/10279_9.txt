Several years ago I saw this movie, without subtitles, on television, and although I did not understand a word of what the characters said, I still had the general idea, and the mood of the film did not fascinate me. <br /> <br /> I finally saw him again a few weeks ago. My heart jumped when I saw the image in the TV guide, and for 8 days, until the movie was shown, I told everyone that I knew they should go see it. The story reminded me a little of the vertigo of Alfred Hitchcock. A slow and moving film about a boy who one day thinks he sees the girlfriend who disappeared years before. What follows is a wild rollercoaster ride of flashbacks, changing perspectives and really inventive twists in the plot, and by the end of the film I was breathless. I definitely did not get what I expected (and actually had already seen the movie!). prepare to be confused. <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
