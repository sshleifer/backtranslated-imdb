I think COMPLETE SAVAGES is a very good television show and they should do many more episodes. It is one of my favorites!!!! It is very funny and the acting is very good. I say you should give them the opportunity to do more episodes. I know they can and should do it! They must put FULL KNOWS in NICKELODEON more than they do! I am sure that many people will agree with me! I like the television program because it is a very good program for people our age and it is very fun. I also like COMPLETE WISE because it is not always the same and the things that happen can be real, unlike other YV programs. When they announced it, I did not like its sound, but I saw it for the first time and I loved it. COMPLETE SAVAGES is an excellent comedy and I miss her on TV !!!!!!!!!! I really can not compare COMPLETE WISE with any other TV series because it's different !!!!
