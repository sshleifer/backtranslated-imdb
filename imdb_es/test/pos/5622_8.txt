Chris Smith is a top filmmaker with the talent he rarely sees to detect a good story and then get out of his way. "American Movie" by Smith is the true life record of the aspiring filmmaker Mark Borchardt, a loser with the intention of milking his old uncle for money to complete his horror short film. But never, under any circumstances, pursue a paid job or support the children you have conceived. <br /> <br /> Such is the skill of the producer Smith that Mark seems more sympathetic than in any other way. Although it attracts Uncle Bill with dreams of spinning and credits of executive producer, it is his desperation to be someone, to have his name together with Scorsese and Spielberg what touches us. <br /> <br /> "American The Movie" also belongs to that rare subgenre, often tried, but rarely achieved, that successfully combines hilarity with horror. The humor comes from the belief in the style of Ed Wood of Borchardt in his own genius. Of his atrocious attempts to act, to have replaced his mother, who did not know the cinema, by a missing cameraman, and to have hired Mike, a sweet friend but with a damaged brain every time he plays an actor or member of crew. <br /> <br /> the horror comes from seeing what Borchardt can not: it is this very American attitude, I want, then I have a right, which prevents him from seeing how much he has to learn about his chosen trade. He is so sure that he can not fail that failure is guaranteed.
