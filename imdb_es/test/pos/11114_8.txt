Although at first glance, this movie looks like the life story of your parents' high school (and many people will try to tell you that this movie is VERY obsolete) ... and I admit that was my first impression ... but Sincerely, the "lessons" that are learned by the heroes / heroines are def. NOT expired. Who does not want to be famous? And who does not want my colleagues to be accepted? And the homosexual man: is not there a controversy today about gay marriage, blah, blah? This film, although released in the 80s, still addresses some of the biggest problems in the world today. However, this movie has too much blasphemy and nudity for my taste. (therefore the rating of 8/10)
