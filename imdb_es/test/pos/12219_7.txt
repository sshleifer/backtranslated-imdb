What can I say? I woke up this morning and lit science fiction, I saw half of the first season and I realized everything. Strange, unusual, and bright. It gives all the potential, and to think at the beginning I said that this seems stupid. This has to be the next best thing from X-Files, but as always, nothing is going to end up with that program in my opinion. I'm telling you, it's scary and then suspense and then soft. Towards the end you have Miles as a love puppy with a rare pet that is a new species. You have two people running away from the authorities. And a killer tsunami about to hit! Woohoo! And I mentioned that Miles's pet is a potential killer (well, the rest of his species is)? Surface is a brilliant show with twists and turns that offers everything.
