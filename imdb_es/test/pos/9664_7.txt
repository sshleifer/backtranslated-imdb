It's not a bad movie but the acting and the script can be better. I like this movie because I have a life that is largely like that of the movie. It is difficult for a lost generation to have a life in Romania, and 90 percent of us choose something else, and that other thing includes dealing with people with "bad habits" if you understand me but that comes with the territory. This movie represents me and I like it. I have anger in me because I talk to people, I live in a disorderly society and I can not fit and I do not want to, and that's the story of the movie too, if you're like me, you can Understand the real movie, if you will not find it easy and cheap
