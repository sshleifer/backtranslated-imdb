'Blade' would be a vampire comic, action / horror extremely above average if it were not for two minor flaws. # 1 I loved seeing Blade / Snipes all invincible, cutting and dicing, but all the "Yes!" Fist / blow was literally a disappointment. # 2 Bad, do not do that horrible, CGI ?? Even by 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some scattered everywhere. Well, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All the actors did a job in the suburb and the fact that now looks like a new 'Matrix' scam is very funny, considering that this happened a year before. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade'. In any case, it is a film very much for audiences of multiple genres: comic book fans, action fans and horror / vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half man / half vampire, or "day walker" and his achievements, Whisler (the "Batman and Alfred") fighting the undead that apparently almost outnumber humans. Who knows? In a rare act of humanity (Blade is more of an antihero) our ninja / vampire sword rescues a newly infected blood doctor / specialist (casually). Meanwhile, the problems are prepared between the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) the supreme power and needs Blade in some way to obtain it. It's not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but it's still fun. He will want to see Blade succeed, he will support him despite his imperfections and gestures. And you'll know what's coming, since this is the typical 1-2-3 act of a comic book introduction movie. Still, look at this without trying to go too deep. How Vampire SPF-1000 "bronzer"? Really? What's wrong with the scalp? Would not that still be burning? Like the money they burn for weapons? Uh, it's okay, I'm going too deep. Once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun.
