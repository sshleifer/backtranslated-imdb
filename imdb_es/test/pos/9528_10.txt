I try to capture this movie every time it is shown on television, which fortunately is quite frequent. But I always forget to record it on video. As it is, I practically know the memory script, but that does not stop me from having a good scream, in fact, it probably increases as I cry to know what will come next. It's a lovely movie, well made, well released, good photography. I love. One of my ten best movies.
