A girl begins to notice that people in her small town are fascinated by anything that has a spiral shape. Soon, the fascination becomes obsession and things become deadly. While I will not say that "Uzumaki" was an excellent movie, I will say it does not look like anything I've seen before. During my visit, I felt I was watching a caricature. There are fun segments between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. Later, I discovered that the movie is an adaptation of a manga comic, so this makes sense. However, just when you think you are seeing something that could be a children's movie, you are bombarded with unpleasant and bloody images! The story is often delayed and the ending is somewhat abrupt and seemed anti-climatic at the time, but in retrospect, I appreciate it more for its originality. My rating: 7/10.
