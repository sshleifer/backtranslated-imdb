It's possible that the bullets did not bounce off his chest, but The Lone Ranger was the symbolic symbol for me as my other childhood hero: Superman. He portrayed the truth, justice and American style in a classic Western TV environment, following the principle that he would never use his weapon to kill, while touring the southwestern United States with his faithful Indian companion Tonto to take all the outlaws before Justice. The advent of television provided the perfect opportunity for a post-war generation to find it ideal for an enigmatic masked man who defended law and order, while offering unparalleled entertainment for five seasons spanning almost eight years. <br /> <br /> Today I had the opportunity to see for the first time the complete episodes of origin of three parts from beginning to end without the standard opening and closing sequences to interrupt the continuity of the story. For fans of the Ranger, this is the great father of all Western sagas, telling how the Texas Ranger, John Reid, survived the Butch Cavendish Gang ambush and how an Indian friend cared for him until he regained his childhood health . Silly (Jay Silverheels) declares his partner a "reliable scout", and calls him Kemo-knows. I have read several interpretations of the origin of the term Kemo-sabe, but I am satisfied with the explanation of Fool. Reading too much detracted from the story, as did the English translation of 'idiot' from Spanish, which I will not reveal, because it is better not to know if you can avoid it. <br /> <br /> I thought it was pretty clever how the origin story created the mystique of the Lone Ranger, as the sixth tomb that created the illusion that all the Rangers died in the box of the cannon ambush. You never see the face of the man who becomes the Lone Ranger, since he is always rejected or hidden to hide his true identity. Even the origin of silver is handled brilliantly; the voice of the narrator of the story that describes the law qualities of the wild stallion. Would it be related, say, to the pound sterling ..., the silver? I got the biggest boost from that. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the passage of time, watching Lone Ranger episodes today offers a glimpse into how unsophisticated the show was beyond the original story. Some of them are almost embarrassingly ridiculous, especially when it comes to a confrontation with Lone Ranger when he shoots amidst a crowd of bad guys to pull a gun out of his owner's hand. And what about that little wave that gives Tonto when they are about to ambush the bad guys? It is always the same gesture, but Silly always knows what it means in different circumstances. Then you have the episodes in which Clayton Moore takes off the mask of ranger to put on a different costume to pose as another character in the service of history. He even once hid himself as an actor portraying President Abraham Lincoln to discover a villain, a top hat and all! <br /> <br /> Few fans I've ever met know that actor John Hart replaced Clayton Moore for the 1952/53 season in a contractual dispute that Moore had with the producers of the show. If you ever saw that episode of "Happy Days" where Fonzie idolizes his childhood hero, you will notice that John Hart was included in the credits. Actually, it's hard to know if you're watching an episode of Hart or not, the key is to hear the voice; Moore is so distinctive that it is a gift of death. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the chance to try some of the color episodes of the final season, a surprise awaits you. The versions I've seen on VHS are absolutely beautiful, although I do not know if commercial copies are available. Most of the surrounding black and white episodes have been repackaged by any number of distributors in different configurations, so there should not be any problem. What you have to see, of course, is the origin of the three parts, and if you do not look at anything else, this gives you all the flavor and emotion you need to capture the imagination of one of the most famous heroes of the West. Hi-Yo Silver, Awaaaay!
