I have not seen this movie for a few years, so I forgot most of the details. However, I loved it at that moment and discovered that the plot was clinging intensely, the climax stopped. I remember being literally on the edge of my theater seat in 1979. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda plays a Los Angeles reporter, Kimberley, who runs into an accident at a local nuclear power facility. She wants to make the story public, helped by her hippie cameraman (Michael Douglas) who has photographed the event, but a sinister conspiracy tries to cover everything up. Jack Lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the mid-conflict manager of the nuclear plant, divided between loyalty to his company and "doing the right thing" in reporting the dangerous situation. Your facial expressions speak a lot here. <br /> <br /> Aside from the absorbing plot and the fascinating tension, this film is about Jack Lemmon, his character and his excellent performance in acting. As for Jane Fonda (I was a great admirer of her at the time), I suspect she has just moved from her protests against the war to the nuclear industry. <br /> <br /> This movie seems intended as a tactic of nuclear fear. Despite Chernobyl and Three Mile Island (they are different types of reactors), our Canadian CANDU reactor is safe and well respected throughout the world. I would not hesitate to reside near the nuclear power plant within an hour's drive, where my friend works as a very competent engineer. Apparently, they close for every teen problem, regardless of financial loss. I sincerely doubt that there is any conspiracy going on there. You can not imagine any of the highly trained managers or operators willing to risk any kind of collapse or whatever ... it's absolute nonsense. Of course, the moral here is to spare no expense or effort in the construction of the facilities or in ensuring their continued safety. <br /> <br /> If we want our Western lifestyle, we have to get our energy somewhere. For those who claim that nuclear energy can never be completely safe (true, of course), maybe they should volunteer as coal miners or, otherwise, go back to horse and buggy days before electricity. <br /> <br /> Of course, enjoy this fun and entertaining movie, which is apparently based (loosely? Embellished?) on a real story. It's a real cooler, a thriller and maybe (?) Even a killer, but, please, do not understand their attitudes about the operation and safety of nuclear power plants.
