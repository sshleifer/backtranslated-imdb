A group of friends breaks in the middle of nowhere (one had a puncture, the other's Jeep mysteriously does not start). One of them takes the tire to a damaged service station and that is the last time anyone sees him. When the remaining four go in search of their friend, they meet the kind Mr. Slaussen, who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cold drinks and shelter from the heat in his equally dilapidated house, hermit, which is occupied by Mannequins look very realistic. He goes with the group boy to work in the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. Before leaving, he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his hut; He warns them about "Davy", his brother who is on the prowl and is not all there. Of course, one of them decides to venture in search of a phone that works and never sees it again. Is it Slaussen? Is it Davy? The mannequins ?? Tourist Trap has the usual requirements of horror (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity is the best of people and never trains), but it is distinguished from the rest of the genre of the 70s in its final touch. I started to feel sorry for Slaussen (Chuck Conners is a fantastic, creepy and exaggerated performance) at one point in the movie, and you almost see that Molly's character does the same. This is a jewel if you can find it; I had recorded it on the cable when I was younger, and when I walked into a used video store I discovered a copy on VHS that was too expensive, but it was worth it. The fans of Tanya Roberts will not be disappointed either. The best part of the movie for me was the scene with the soup (and cookies !!) <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7 because part of the movie was and it's still hard to explain.
