The only reason it's worth mentioning The Duke Is Tops, one of the "racing movies" made during segregation times, is because it made the cinematic debut of a 21-year-old singer named Lena Horne. She plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who has to leave her mentor to producer Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) to become the big moment. Davis, however, has to pretend to have taken the money for her services in front of her so she does not feel sorry for doing it. He then partners with Doc Dorando (Lawrence Criner) for a series of medical programs throughout the South. Meanwhile, in New York, their new producers have bombed big time because they did the whole show instead of just the act of specialty. Davis finds out about the radio and offers his services as producer and leader of the band to bring his list of other specialized acts, many of which make his one of his few or only appearances in movies here, for his chance at the great moment with Ethel next to him. Guess what happens? While the plot is what you've seen in thousands of other musical films during this time, the fact that it was created for a specific audience makes this one of the most fascinating features I've seen during this Month of Black History. The singing of Mrs. Horne is shown here and it is interesting to see her so young before her professionalism takes hold later in her career. Among other supporting players there is an unconfirmed appearance, according to IMDb, by Lillian Randolph, Annie in my favorite movie It's a Wonderful Life and sister of Amanda Randolph that I just saw in the short film The Black Network, as the woman with sciatica that he complains of not being healed after taking the doctor's medicine before Duke explains that it is for the feet. And as a resident of Louisiana for a long time, I would like to take note of two players here in this movie: Joel Fluellen from Monroe as a tonic client and Marie Bryant from New Orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax. So just for Lena Horne alone, it's worth watching The Duke is Tops at least once.
