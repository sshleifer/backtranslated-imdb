Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Mechanical Orange, of course "there was no doubt", he had to see it. However, I postponed it too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like "extremely boring" or "nothing happened" "a complete waste of time". But when I saw images on the Internet of the mysterious black monolith, I was allowed to see the exquisite experience that is 2001: a space odyssey. I had no doubt that I was going to rent that movie that night. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be the best visual experience of my life. Of course, seeing a painting or a very good image can be wonderful, but seeing a movie built with the same kind of virtuosity in each frame adds a new dimension. My God ... I really like my friends, but it's a pity that I can not share with them what makes my heart shine with enthusiasm and my spirit fly like a bird in the sky. That thing, my friends, is beauty. As you can see in this film, beauty is terribly underestimated in our technologically advanced, intellectually superficial and consumer-oriented western fast food societies. However, that does not mean that I reject these accelerated societies or that I despise them (and neither Kubrick), but that they can be much more if only people stop for a moment and take a little time to do so. It absorbs the beauty of the world in which we live. And what better opportunity there is to do this more slowly to the elegant rhythm of this film and let yourself go to that place between waking up and dreaming. <br /> <br /> When we go to this place it is possible to get a call "natural height". It is something that our spirit can do when we encounter a pure and unlimited beauty. And never in my life this "natural orgasm" or "spiritual orgasm" as some call it or "samaddhi" by others has been more intense. Yes, it is more intense than a regular orgasm ... actually several times more intense. Many religions have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right. They are right? For me, a direct answer to such a question would only detract from the impenetrable hypnotic mystery of the universe. In my opinion, the film tries to convey the same mystery through the description of the black monolith and by stating the following: "Except for a very powerful radio broadcast directed at Jupiter, the four-million-year-old black monolith has remained completely inert ... Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery. " The trance that Bowman experiences is the same as me when I see those wonderful images. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that the mystery can be frustrating for those who need direct answers of fast food to the great ontological questions. But instead of giving us comfort, we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications contained in these answers. The doubt and discomfort caused later will make us point out our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all these problems, while, in fact, we are only to blame for our easy answers. But this film shows us that when fast ontological affirmations are nothing more than doubts, we can always rely on phenomena to make the world meaningful. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only really present itself as a phenomenon and never as a "thing in itself", the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing, frightening or irritating, but rather It turns fascinating, charming and maybe even. dildo. We do not need an answer to what really exists to be in contact with one of the greatest forces in our lives. When we are able to let the mystery be what it is, to embrace it even ... we can finally make our souls rest. However, I'm pretty sure that a film that contains so much beauty and such philosophical and artistic depth can never be surpassed. Especially now that the best director who has ever lived is no longer with us.
