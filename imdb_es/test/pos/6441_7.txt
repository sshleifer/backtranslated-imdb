This is a movie that I saw as a child and I never forgot it. It is certainly not the best movie ever made, but there is something very special about that that I can not say. I love. I am the kind of person who likes everything that was explained to me, and just for that reason, this movie drives me crazy. <br /> <br /> Exactly what / Who is that mysterious witch and what is her relationship with Tom? WHY and HOW did he become a Water Baby ... why did he grow up on earth? It's questions like these that are just eating me! I thought that if I read the book I would get answers, but I just read an article in which the book on which this story is based is very different. So I guess I'll never know what the writer was thinking! <br /> <br /> Although I still love this movie and saw it recently with my two-year-old niece. She also loves it, although she insists on calling it "Baby water" for reasons I do not know. She loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares: "I'm completely clean." (You have to understand that my niece is the cleanest 2-year-old girl in the world!) We watched that scene over and over again. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad we can enjoy this movie together! There should be more movies like this one. (But what about the gay seahorse? !!)
