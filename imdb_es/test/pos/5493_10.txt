IN THE FIRE LINE, in my opinion, it is an excellent / suspense, suspense and action / drama / thriller! I thought Agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Agent Raines (Rene Russo) looked good in the outfit they wore at the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who loved playing with Frank on the phone. However, he looked good with the tuxedo he wore near the end of the movie. One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. Before finishing this, I would like to say that all the cast and crew did an excellent job, I loved the stage and I did not get tired. Now, in conclusion, to all the Clint Eastwood fans who have not seen this excellent / thrilling suspense / action / drama / suspense game, I recommend it.
