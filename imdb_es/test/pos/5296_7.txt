Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, inspired by Disney's Little Mermaid, is the master of Japanese animation, the next great work of Hayao Miyazaki after the well-received Spirited Away in 2001 and Howl's Moving Castle in 2004. In Ponyo, his Characteristic style of Cheering fantasy realms and children's characters are on display once again. <br /> <br /> Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), the protagonist of the boy in the film, discovers a "goldfish" trapped in a glass jar while playing by the sea, under the cliff. . He stays with his mother, Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) above and above her. Sosuke shakes the bottle hard to try to get the "colored fish", but the small "goldfish" is stuck. Then try to remove it, but it can not be released. Sosuke then places the jar on the ground before breaking a small rock on it, breaking it to pieces instantly while suffering a small cut on the finger. Then check inquisitively to see if the "goldfish" is still alive. While watching it, the "goldfish" reacts by licking the blood from his finger suddenly. Excited, Sosuke quickly rushes back to the house and puts the 'goldfish' in a small bucket of water in the hope that he will survive. He did it and called it 'Ponyo' (Yuria Nara). <br /> <br /> The previous scene would mean what will come for the rest of the movie. It's the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. And it's one that Hayao Miyazaki did meticulously well in portraying. Must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before describing this chemistry of communication between the two main characters. The behavior of the children would also extend to the rest of the film in their future encounters. <br /> <br /> The affection between Sosuke and Ponyo grew as the film progressed from the moment that Sosuke took Ponyo to school in Lisa's car. The best moment came when the two met after a brief separation when Ponyo's father, Fujimoto (George Tokoro), a magical inhabitant of the sea, recaptured the wandering Ponyo before encapsulating it in a magic bubble with friendly intent. <br /> <br /> Fujimoto, who was once a human, has grown up to refer to humans with disgust for polluting the sea and stealing his life. But all Ponyo wants is to be human and be with Sosuke, so for the second time she escapes, accidentally emptying her father's magical elixir store in the sea, creating a storm of tidal waves and enveloping the small town in the process. <Br /> <br /> What follows are the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in the flooded city. <br /> <br /> Is there a happy forever in this? Would true love prevail? You discover it <br /> <br /> When observing the art in Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, there seems to be a deviation from Miyazaki's past works in terms of rendering. It does not seem familiar because the environment, apart from the characters that play in each scene, is not colored in the usual way as did Spirited Away (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004). The aesthetic appeal is discounted from what appear to be colored pencil drawings. The objects and the characters are not as detailed as before. <br /> <br /> This is peculiar if taken at face value, but by the way the story is written and told, the possible explanation is that Miyazaki is allowing the audience to see the film with the tint of a child, but allowing adults to remember a Japan when they were younger. This move could have prevented potential viewers, new to Miyazaki's work to see it. The trailer also did nothing to promote Ponyo. However, taking the case to Japan would be a different story, since Miyazaki's credential far exceeds any marketing technique. <br /> <br /> In summary, the set was not equal to its parts. Apart from Miyazaki's ability to launch lively and lively characters, the film lacks elements of emotion and awe when measured compared to previous works, resulting in a deficit of presence on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The sparks of Ponyo and Sosuke could not illuminate the film in a big way, but the moments of warmth, kindness and love can still be found by recognizing that the film is not made for children, but for the children that everyone is or who ever was.
