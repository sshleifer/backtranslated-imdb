OZ is an old television series released by HBO. It shows life in a security prison called Oswald, but the main plot focuses on Emerald City, which is one of the levels of the prison. <br /> <br /> Oz has an incredible plot and an outstanding cast! There are many characters and almost all are very interesting. Basically they are divided into groups (gangs), Sicilians, blacks, Aryans, gays, Latinos and many others who do not have a specific group, but deal with many others like Ryan O'Reily (the Irish). <br /> <br /> The plot is very well constructed, there is a lot of conspiracy inside, a lot of struggle for power. But all this is not only exposed in the form of violence, everything is very intelligent and intelligent, nothing happens without a reason, everything is connected and it is very interesting to guess. I really love this series, and whoever wants to see something intelligent, very well produced with a cast and very good presentations, MUST see OZ!
