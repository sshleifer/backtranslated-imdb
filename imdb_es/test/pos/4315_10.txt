The show begins with the boat. Desmond was. Then they went to try to save Walt. And it blocks the things that the button that presses is a great joke at the same time that Desmond discovered that he was the one that crashed the airplane. Eko tries to open the door that Jhon closed, and Charlie helped him find the bomb. While Sayid and Jack's plan is that, Sasyid is to find the others first and see who and what the others are. And find if there is armed and has weapons. <br /> <br /> Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate and Hugo into a trap. And they are trapped. <br /> <br /> After the show there were more questions than answers, but that is what makes the show so great. And I can not wait until season 3.
