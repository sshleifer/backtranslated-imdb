This movie is a very nice tribute to the Bogart and other detective films of yesteryear. Robert Sacchi nails him as Bogie and Michelle Phillips is a truly timeless beauty like Gena Anastas. <br /> <br /> However, the most remarkable part of this film has to do with the longest belly dance scene ever produced in a Hollywood movie. A well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in the cinema is close to the emotion of the dance. <br /> <br /> The scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, takes place in a lush Middle East nightclub and is fascinating. The pulsating music, the swirling veils and the finger plates, the flowing ripples and the beautiful costumes, and a surprise twist that involves the seductive Sybil Danning, create tension and emotion until the end. <br /> <br /> The three professional dancers and beautiful nightclubs are led by the exotic brunette Morena Kamala Almanzar, one of the most important belly dancers in the US. UU since the mid-seventies. She was chosen by hand by the famous Armenian musician Guy Chookoorian to travel with his orchestra on the way. Guy's set is the live band that the dancers play on the scene. If you see the trailer on this site, you will see Kamala (touching the finger cymbals behind Sybil Danning). <br /> <br /> If you're still not a fan of belly dancing, you'll do it after watching this movie, and if you're an amateur, it stays very well after watching it repeatedly.
