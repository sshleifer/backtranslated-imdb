Wow, I'm sure I've seen a bit of Kelli McCarty this summer. I did not know that this woman had made so many smooth movies in the last three years. It's like watching a future softcore star in front of me, like Michelle Hall did a couple of years ago. <br /> <br /> "Passion's Peak" is the third quality softcore film I've seen Kelli McCarty on, with "Girl for Girl" and "House of Love" being the others. "Desire and Deception" was fine, but it was not spectacular. There are spoilers in this review, so read only if you want. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Christina (Kelli McCarty) leaving the big city and towards the mountains. She has inherited a house from her beloved dead grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain refuge. Before she can leave her things, a woman named Kim (not accredited in this film, but quite aggressive) begins to book guests to stay there. Now she has to put the house in shape quickly; Chip (Bobby Johnston), a childhood friend, comes to the rescue. Chip helps her get the house in viable conditions. She hires two local vagrants to work at her lodging: Bait, Chip's sister (Samantha McConnell) and her sexual friend Hank. <br /> <br /> Now the guests start to come. The first to arrive are Eric and Linda (Flower), two stereotyped lawyers who are the first to make money. Linda and Eric get into a big argument during a dinner in the middle of the movie that leads to their separation; There are sad things. Next, there is the romantic novelist Sophia, played by the goddess of the movie B Monique Parent. She is using that fool aka Scarlet Johansing again, and this time she looks very professional, with blonde hair, of course. It would not be Monique if she did not have at least one scene in which she plays with herself, and she does it during one of the sex scenes of Eric and Linda. <br /> <br /> James and Shene (Devinn Lane - yes, porn star Devinn Lane) also shows up for a little weekend getaway. Without Shene's knowledge, James and Christina have quite a history. James and Christina used to leave, but Christina interrupted him to head to this mountain lodge. James comes to the cabin to retrieve Christina, but his plan fails. Christina spills the beans to Shene, which causes Shene to go out with him and go down to the local bar to get rid of the locals. Shene ends up in the sleeping bag of the now single Eric, and they leave together. Bait realizes that he wants more than just sex with Hank, and Christine finds true love with Chip, with Sophia soaking everything and writing it in her next romantic novel. <br /> <br /> In fact ... if you ask me, this whole movie was developed as a romantic novel. I do not know if the scriptwriter was going for that effect, but I sure have that impression. Sophia had some of the best lines of this film, and echoed the idea that this is a real-action romantic novel. She seems to enjoy all the fights and stabs that are happening. <br /> <br /> Now to sex. There was a good amount of that, and it was the typical bumps and bumps. Monique did her fair share of moans in her two sex scenes. This film was worthy of being heard, and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in the sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Monique was just Monique, of all the actresses I've seen for the longest) years, she's the best in acting, in my opinion. She can really act and be sexy, so she stays in the number 1 position in my Top 10 Skinemax. Kelli McCarty is better at making softcore movies than in the telenovela "Pasiones"; I do not know why he is not doing more of this. Flower was simply a background scenario for the most part in a limited role. Samantha McConnell continues to impress me, and Devinn Lane is another hardcore actress crossing over the softcore realm and doing a half decent job on it.) <br /> <br /> Sex: B (It was good, but not amazing, spectacular. Many moans, do not look at the R-rated version, trust me ... most good things are taken out.My rating is for the uncut version.) <br /> <br /> Story: B (A solid story that ich throws a secondary argument "Ooh, the construction inspector is going to close us" towards the end, what messes things up. "The underlying story between Christina and James was nice, and Sophia's dialogue, full of metaphors and images that are usually found in romantic novels, it was a nice touch.) <br /> <br /> In general: B + (I found this movie is quite entertaining.) Not a member of the Softcore Hall of Fame sure, like "Girl for Girl", but it's a respectable addition to the collection of Skinemax.
