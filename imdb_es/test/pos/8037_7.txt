I found this movie quite nice and entertaining. Good characters, good actors and enough suspense to keep their interest at all times. The twists of the plot could have been a little too much, but overall a decent thriller. If you liked this movie, I would recommend The Spanish Prisoner, The House of Games and No Way Out.
