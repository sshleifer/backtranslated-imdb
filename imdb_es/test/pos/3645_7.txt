As I said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. It is so aggravating that he wanted Sylvester to eat it and pass it on to him. <br /> <br /> In this caricature, Sly has no home again and goes back to feeding on trash cans. He sees a cruise coming out of a nearby port and decides to get on board when he sees that Tweety is one of the passengers. <br /> <br /> The ship provides a suitable setting for the following hitches and Sly tries desperately to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once you get it chewing and swallowing, ending the irritating Canary forever. But, as the cartoons starring Tweety go, this is pretty good, but EVERYTHING is thanks to that bright cat.
