With a cast like this, I knew the performance would be amazing. Still, I was cautious, since I always have sequels. Would you keep the feeling of the first movie? Could they possibly replicate the tension and excitement of the masterful tandem of Ocean's 11? We will never know, because they did not try. At least, not as I expected. Instead, they made a light and truly amusing parody of the heist genre. If you want a logical and exciting steal, do not look at this. If you want a good laugh, with witty dialogues, extravagant characters and an absolutely great scene where Julia Roberts has to pass herself off, then you'll love Ocean's 12.
