This film is a jewel almost forgotten of 1979 that, although in essence it is a comedy, it was based on one of the biggest bank robberies of the United Kingdom. In fact, one of the titles for which this film is known includes "caper", so in itself it is an indication of the type of film. A group of adorable oaks, who are neither violent nor psychotic, who with the cheek and cunning achieve the greatest job of their lives. To be honest, I really do not know much about the real crime and I can not comment if it accurately described the events that took place or the characters involved. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan is very good at playing PINKY Green and is very credible as a US-born thief who feels very comfortable with himself. I have to add that sometimes American actors fight against British actors in a British-made film, chemistry is not always there, however, this is not a problem for Jordon, which fits perfectly with his role. <br /> <br /> It's worth noting that Jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 70s and 80s and never got the recognition he deserved. He seemed stuck in supporting roles and B movies, not in a fair representation of his ability to act. He has played a corrupt cop in THE FRIENDS OF EDDY COYLE, a sadistic killer in THE MEAN SEASON. In THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS he played a kind of comedic character of Gordon Gehco and also in the TV program EQUALIZER of the 1980s he played a good guy. All this shows the versatility of his acting skills while mixing with characters like David Niven, Kurt Russell, Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham. <br /> <br /> In this film, he effortlessly plays his role as a little time thief with The Eye for the Ladies and you immediately take his character and encourage him from the start. You can not stop liking green, ?? ?? You will see that he really wanted to go straight, but once blackmailed everything seemed like an opportunity too big to let go and in the end he enjoyed the idea of ​​all that money. <br /> <br /> David Niven is the boss and takes note of the shots, the police inspector was brilliantly portrayed by Richard Johnson, who typically portrayed a London detective who, while quite skilled, loves the job. The other cast does not say much, but looking at them were all actors of well-known British characters who were often playing villains or police (not that ironic). Elkie Sommers, Oliver Tobias do what they have to do and it's good to see Gloria Graham in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> For some viewers, particularly Americans, it would seem ridiculous that someone with the Green record can get a maintenance job Of all things a bank and comes and goes when it pleases. In addition, the maneuver he did in the crown court after the sentence was not as farfetched as it might seem, in the 60s and 70s the security was not as strict as now. <br /> <br /> As for The movie itself there are a couple of interesting observations. With little time the thieves the tour here was too much. There have been other movies in which this also happens, for example, THE BRINKS MAT. It is not only the elimination or concealment of the booty, but, with so many people involved, someone is going to be careless, to speak or simply to break once they have supported themselves. In addition, the authorities are very hard with the local rouges when a large theft is carried out. Also, they say that there is no honor among the thieves, but Ivan was convinced that PINKY received his blow. You only had to look at his eyes on the dock, if looks could kill, a look of utter betrayal! How could he fold them all after taking care of him? You have to ask yourself why criminals can be so stupid. Did Green really think he could talk sweet and get out of suspicion a second time? Inspector Watford was not fooled at all by his innocent-looking face and by a well-constructed alibi, everything stank of work. Also you have to ask yourself why they leave so many clues? A notebook with the numbers safely recorded, travel brochures for trips abroad, which still leave their telescope around, as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery that was misplaced. <br /> <br /> With some decent but common sense police work Insp Watford quickly took Green's measure, picked it up and soon made him sing like a canary. It just shows how, even though the planning of well thought-out things can unravel very quickly, there is never a clean escape for all bodies, some are always going to be caught. Although it is worth noting that much of the money never recovered. <br /> <br /> In general, an entertaining film, interesting photos of London and England in the late 70s, good pace, with a great ending. I would highly recommend it particularly if you enjoy the capers. (Note: I recently bought a DVD of this, but obviously the transfer was taken from a VHS tape and is of poor quality, so do not pay too much for it!)
