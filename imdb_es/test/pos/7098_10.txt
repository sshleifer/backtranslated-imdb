Despite all the comparisons with House of Frankenstein, this film surpasses its predecessor and is one of the funniest monster movies of the Universal Monsters series, and unfortunately, the last one. In agreement. so it's not exactly like the Bride of Frankenstein as a classic for revered by the fans of all the movies, but with a cast of Dracula, the werewolf and the Frankenstein monster (what? no mummy?) you can ' Help me, but enjoy this feast! And unlike House of Frankenstein, the monsters in this movie interact much more. But this film also offers some unique storylines for both Dracula and the werewolf that go to Dr. Adleman to heal from his afflictions. While the Werewolf actually finds a cure, Dracula injects his blood into the doctor and that's when the real fun begins. I recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. But remember, I never said it was good, just fun.
