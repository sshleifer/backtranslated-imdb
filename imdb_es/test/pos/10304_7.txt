It is not an easy movie to like at first with the two main characters quite unpleasant, but fortunately the heart and soul of the film is the moving performance of Paula Sage that takes the film to unknown waters and transcends the plot quite awkward. This gives the film a sense of real truth and makes you think you've seen something special. (7/10)
