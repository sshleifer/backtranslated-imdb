Le danke a Herr Hacke f√ºr den Filme. Mein Deutsch ist nicht gut. Enschuldigen Sie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I did not know how diverse the sound of Istanbul is, even though I live in Turkey. Faith Akin and Alexander Hacke have done a different approach to Turkish music. Narration, interpretation Seeing Istanbul and the music of Istanbul from a foreign aspect had given the real meaning to the music itself. <br /> <br /> In this film, I discovered how different our culture is (Turkish), how interesting our interpreters are, and how much respect they deserve. Unfortunately no one has been able to serve this kind of documentary before.
