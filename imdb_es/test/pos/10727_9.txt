If you asked me to choose the best films that have been made, this film would be on a short list along with Streetcar Named Desire from 1951. I imagine I will discover others who qualify, but Kramer vs. Kramer is an exceptional exercise in naturalism. So it's a very satisfying experience at that level: just watch the wonderful and sonorous performances of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and the boy Justin Henry in particular. One of the best performances for children of all time. <br /> <br /> But I also find it very rewarding to see her, because it's such an enveloping story: it always makes me forget my own problems. It has an excellent narrative impulse. Once you choose Kramer vs. Kramer, and Alice Kramer leaves Ted to juggle work and her young son, telling her nothing more than she has to discover herself. And even once you know how things develop, every moment of the trip sounds so bright that it's a joy to see it happen again and again. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake: Kramer vs. Kramer is not light entertainment: it's a very realistic portrait of the effects of divorce on everyone involved. <br /> <br /> 10/10. <br /> <br /> For one of the best scripts (born of the conversations between Benton and Hoffman, who was going through a divorce at that time, once written, executed and executed beautifully and flawlessly. how great the story is, in short, a perfect movie.
