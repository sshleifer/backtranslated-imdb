I just watched "Everything is Illuminated" at the Telluride Film Festival. This is a really remarkable movie. Very emotional, sometimes fun and comforting. Bring your handkerchiefs! For those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes, I remember the endings of "Babette's Feast" and "The Notebook". The stories were completely different, but they had the same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes, just as this movie did. <br /> <br /> There are no spoilers here. The summary is, as described by IMDb, the journey of a young man to Ukraine to follow his roots and find the town where his father grew up. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is in English and in Ukrainian (and also in Russian, I believe). This allows for some marvelously based moments in linguistics as a character interprets, more or less faithfully, for the English speaker in the group, depending on the circumstances. <br /> <br /> The landscape is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful influences from Eastern Europe. Make sure you meet the credits for the final tune. <br /> <br /> This is Lieve Schreiber's directorial debut and it's well done. I give this movie a 9, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I highly recommend it.
