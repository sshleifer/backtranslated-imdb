If you can see a 1983 Bond movie that is not as good as Octopussy and still enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If you can accept production values ​​that are not much above the level of a TV movie. <br /> <br /> If you can look at Sean Connery with wrinkles on his forehead under an obvious gift and still see James Bond. <br /> <br /> If you can beat an inexperienced Basinger, a weaker Largo and a cheery Q. <br /> <br /> If you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score, do not be with Barry on his worst day . <br /> <br /> If you do not believe in the hyperbolic criticism that was received with the launch. <br /> <br /> If you can face a poker battle and a video game, face it and enjoy it in the same way. <br /> <br /> Yours is Never say never again and everything that it contains. <br /> <br /> And, besides, you probably enjoy it, my son!
