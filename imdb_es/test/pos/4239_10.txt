GREAT MOVIE! Chucky is by far the most fun character in a movie. Jennifer Tilly (Tiffany) makes this movie even better! Long before Chucky died, he and Tiffany were together. But ten years later, Tiffany retrieves Chucky (like a doll) and brings him back to life. It was a great movie! Scary and definitely fun (just because Chucky!) 10/10
