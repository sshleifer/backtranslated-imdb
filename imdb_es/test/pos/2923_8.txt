Film historians have talked a lot about the ancient epics that have been the interest of many directors since the beginning of cinema. The pioneers of such epics, particularly the biblical ones, were D.W Griffith with his "mother of all epics", INTOLERANCE (1916), and Cecil B DeMille with his talent for magnificent shows, costumes and splendid scenes. Who can forget his TEN COMMANDMENTS (1923, 1956) or THE SIGN OF THE CROSS (1932)? However, here comes another epic, made in the 1950s, directed by Michael Curtiz, and based on the novel by Mika Waltari, "The Egyptian." Michael Curtiz, already famous for his great classic CASABLANCA (1941) manages to adapt his film to the public of that time, to include the most important ideas and facts of the thick novel, and to recreate the lifestyle of the Egyptians who lived in the. One of the most amazing periods, in the reign of Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> The first and most important fact for me in this film is the psychological development of the main character played by Edmund Purdom. Sinuhe, having been raised in a simple family by his stepfathers, becomes a doctor. All his life, he never stops asking a question "why?" and looking for the answer. The seductive love he finds in a courtesan Nefer (Bella Darvi) leads to a financial and spiritual disaster. He has to repair the mistakes by working hard in the House of Death and beginning to build his reputation out of nothing. First, think that the only cure is revenge. However, in the long run, he realizes that "an eye for an eye" is not a solution. Finally, what is presented to you in very strange circumstances is the temptation to be a pharaoh. However, there is a time when he finds the answer to his questions that touched him throughout his life ... The story of the main character, although based on the book, is so interesting psychologically that every open-minded person should Consider this aspect in the movie. The psychological struggle of the main character is intensified by the times in which he lived, the times in which, probably for the first time in that sense, the power of the sword was confronted with the power of thought. <br /> <br /> Curtiz's movie is also maintained. A rule that all the films of his time maintained: great cast and splendid sets. The majority are British actors and actresses who give very good performances. How is it possible not to mention the pillar of the old epic, Victor Mature? This time, he is not Demetrio, Hannibal or Samson, but Horemheb, a fighter, a lover, at last a pharaoh. Jean Simmons appears in a very delicate role of Merit, a woman who loved Sinuhe all her life, but it was too late when she realized that. Peter Ustinov, probably the most famous for his beautiful performance as Nero in QUO VADIS? Three years before, he does a great job as Kaptah, Sinuhe's friend. The royalty of the film is also played by two great actors, Gene Tierney and Michael Wilding. Tierney is excellent as the cold, eager to be able to Baketamon, the sister of the pharaoh. Wilding gives a wonderful performance as "crazy" Akhnaton. When I was at the Louvre in Paris and saw Akhnaton's original face carved in stone, he looked a lot like the actor in the movie. Bella Darvi, an actress born in Poland, is quite memorable as an evil courtesan Nefer. And there is one more actress who appears only in one scene, but who is difficult to forget, Judith Evelyn as Taia, the mother of the pharaoh. This voice, these eyes! <br /> <br /> The sets are magnificent. The director recreated the most likely image of the open-air temple of Aaton, the god that the Egyptians worshiped in the reign of Amenhotep IV. I also loved the scene of Pharaoh's first entry. What a glorious image that lasts forever in memory! However, there is also one aspect that I would like to call the attention of all people interested in watching the film. Egyptian is similar to other epics in many ways, but it also stands out as a unique film. There are very few movies that make as wonderful use of different curiosities as in ancient times. There is a mention of the iron used first by the Hetites. It is also the only film about ancient Egypt that speaks openly of the magnificent healing abilities of the Egyptians. It shows in a memorable way the contrasts of the lifestyles, in particular the moment of the death of a slave who nobody cares about, followed by the announcement and, consequently, the widespread mourning after the death of the pharaoh. Finally, "The Egyptian" shows a historical fact: there were other nations, except the Jews (before Christ) where the spirit of God shone in some human hearts. However, the only difference was that he did not survive as long as in the case of the Jews because he did not have a solid foundation. The scene of Akhnaton's death gives you so many biblical and Christian values ​​that you may think you are watching a religious film. <br /> <br /> All things considered, I recommend the Michael Curtiz movie. It is a great production at multiple levels: an entertainment for epic fans, an admiration of the wonderful performances for film fans, a celebration of the soul for spiritual people. Finally, it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things that happened thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.
