One of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly touted as a 'name only' sequel. There's nothing wrong with that except this: the return of Chevy Chase as Ty Webb. This connects the viewer with this character (from the original Caddyshack in 1980) and makes the fans think or want Caddyshack II to be similar to the first one. <br /> <br /> There are rumors that Rodney Dangerfield must return. . He took a large part of the first film, so his return would have put Caddyshack 2 on top. Jackie Mason is the "new" Rodney for this film and does a decent job, even though his comic book deliveries are very different. Dan Aykroyd was great, but not enough in the movie. I should have been involved with the amount of time that Bill Murray got on the first screen. Robert Stack (Airplane!) Was good in the `new 'role of Ted Knight / Villian. (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Noonan should have returned. So many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. Bushwood should not have suffered the total renovation he did. Instead, the characters involved, instead of the club itself, should have been the main focus as they were in the first. When you see this movie, keep in mind that it is not an important sequel and you may think it is another good or bad comedy of the eighties. Fans of the first should see it, but do not be surprised when the comparisons between the original and Part II are so far apart.
