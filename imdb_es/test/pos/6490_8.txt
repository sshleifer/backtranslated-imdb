I am a big fan of the $ 5.50 DVD tray at my local Walmart. Hopefully you have one at your local branch. You can find a lot of campaign films, a lot of garbage and some surprise. This movie is one of the surprises. My friend recently bought this, and thinking that it would be another burst of cheesy Kung Fu, I was really surprised at how good it was. I watch many movies and, as a result, I can almost always tell how a movie will turn out; And if there is a plot twist, what will it be. Not this movie! The direction is brilliant, the plot is impressive, and the fight is incredibly creative. If you see this out there at a very cheap price, get it! If you see it at full price, I would still recommend it.
