Hey, it's great to not have to wait for the next Star-Trek convention to see Hick-Trek! It's a cheesy movie made by a group of tricks without a budget, but a good way to spend an hour. Most of the special effects were correct, the dialogue is a classic journey and it feels good for an imitation trip.
