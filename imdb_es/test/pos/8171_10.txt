I love a lot about this film: music, cinematography, acting, history and all the Mormon clichés. The fact that they are clichés does not mean that they are not true! This is not perfect, it's a movie after all. While the excommunications are held in well-lit rooms with beautiful desks and chairs, it was entirely appropriate to portray them as the dark and cold scene they did in this film. I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop, smoking a cigarette. I thought it was so cool. I mean, I think the angels take care of us. What is one supposed to do while waiting? Smoking is a way that some people spend time while they wait. I loved the irony because Mormons make a great deal about smoking. I saw this movie 7 times in the Salt Lake theaters, and I cried every time! It leaves me hallucinated. And I've seen it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time. I would like to take the opportunity to see it again on a big screen. I hope the Tower Theater in Salt Lake brings it back regularly at the time of the General Conference, like a cult movie (word game, but no offense).
