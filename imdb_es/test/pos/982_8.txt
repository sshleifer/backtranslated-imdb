This movie is really an entertaining, good and fun movie, for children. Kaley (played by the talented Nickelodeon's Amanda) is the companion of a cunning boy who has a hard time telling the truth. Finally, this makes it a movie script that is stolen. I will not bore you with the details. If you have children and want to see an entertaining movie if not exciting for children, I recommend it.
