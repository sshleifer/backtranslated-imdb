The psychopath (1973) A journey along the path of memory. I saw this movie many years ago on an old black and white television. The presenter of a children's program, Mr. Rabbey, comes the brutal abuse that parents inflict on their children's fanatics. Mr. Rabbey (who seems to be always on the verge of losing it) finally breaks down and decides to go hunting. Beware of bad parents because Mr. Rabbey is on the lookout! What happens next is priceless. However, trying to find this movie will be a difficult task. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie remarkable is the fact that Joe "Maniac" Spinell made a short promotion for a movie based on it. In his unfinished film, he plays Mr. Robbie, a t.v. clown (who looks like a chubby out of shape Edward James Olmos) who comes to his young fans of child abuse by going after his parents. Unfortunately, Mr. Spinell could never find the funds to complete the project. The movie was going to be titled Maniac II: "Mr. Robbie." Rabbey or Robbie, the similarities are too close for comfort. Rather violent for a P.G. Movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
