Peter Lorre was born to play Stephen Danel with phrases like: "Mr. Smith, I should not hold my wife that way." and "I told you not to keep the monkey in the house!" The poster of this movie is a creepy green and Peter Lorre reads in a way that you will never want to go to his island / penal colony. This movie is not available on DVD, although it is a classic and is rarely shown on television. What exactly is the relationship between Stephen Danel and the monkey? Why does the monkey bother you so much? We will never know. The film must be colored by someone and the extracts must become a Kinks video. The film was released again in the 1950s and only some of Peter Lorre's biographies spend some text on this film. Casablanca was around the corner. Bogart could have been on that island but surely they did not have the budget for him
