The whole world is falling prey to a lethal disease, and the rain never stops falling: however, in this nightmarish atmosphere, a man and a woman discover that they are neighbors, thanks to a hole in the floor of the man's apartment. They fall in love: at least, not all would have been lost. Although this wonderful film expresses the loneliness and weakness of the human being, there is also some room for hope in the brilliant singing scenes.
