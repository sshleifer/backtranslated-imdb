Although it's little more than a fun 11-minute musical detour (it's listed as a "Musical Tabloid") EVERY Sunday is one of the most famous and precious documents in film history, as it provides an invaluable look at the blossoming talents of two of the most talented and beloved musical actors on the screen: Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. <br /> <br /> Although they are often cited as a type screen test, produced by MGM to test the adolescent appeal of studio contractors Durbin and Garland, whose options were reportedly, the renewal of this assertion did not It is entirely accurate. When EVERY Sunday occurred in July 1936, the contract of Deanna Durbin with MGM had already expired and Universal had signed it immediately a month earlier, in June 1936. <br /> <br /> However, a provision in Durbin's The MGM contract allowed the studio to exercise an option in its services for up to sixty days, as long as he had not yet started working on a photograph in his new studio. As Durbin's debut vehicle, TRES SMART GIRLS, was not yet ready to start filming, MGM opted to exercise its option and, although officially under contract with Universal at that time, Durbin found himself back on the MGM lot filming this nice short song with Judy Garland, a teenager with hopes of singing, too. <br /> <br /> This, along with Garland's much more extensive previous professional experience / training (which included appearances in several shorts from previous films), can explain why EVERY Sunday often seems to favor. Judy Garland on Deanna Durbin, gives Garland more lines to speak and an original song ("Americana") to sing, while Durbin offers the popular classic art song "Il Bacio" by Luigi Ardiiti. Certainly, it would make a lot of sense that MGM would like to favor one of its own players hired over another from a rival studio. <br /> <br /> Ironically, although Garland's character is the most openly proactive of the two girls in this short film, it would be the screen personality "Little Miss Fixit" by Durbin, impulsive and impulsive, in Universal, which would push her to the instant global superstar as the first "Teen Idol" in the world with her debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, while Garland. The image of a passive teenager and "wistful wallflower" would see her in general in supporting roles in front of his frequent screen partner Mickey Rooney and (in ZIEGFELD GIRL) the promising Lana Turner. It was not until his fifteenth MGM film, 1942 'FOR ME AND MY GAL (which was also his first totally "adult" role) that Garland achieved the top solo: the billing of the title and the "individual attraction" status of a true superstar that Durbin had achieved Instantaneously, six years before. <br /> <br /> It is totally inaccurate, therefore, to claim that Garland was the only "superstar" attraction of the two girls, since Durbin achieved this status with the press, almost a decade. before his rival MGM. Literally in a foreclosure at the time of its signing, the on-screen evidence strongly suggests that Universal was much quicker to realize Deanna's superstar potential than MGM with Judy, and it's worth noting that almost all of the notable accomplishments that Garland managed at MGM, from superstar billing, to have protagonist vehicles specially written to show her talent and her appeal, to be invited to plant her footprints in the courtyard of Graumann's Chinese Theater, to receive an "Honorary Oscar" in recognition for her talent, Deanna Durbin received much before her talent. MGM contemporary. <br /> <br /> In any case, ALL Sundays are a delicious and absolutely unpretentious musical short film. His plot line (Durbin and Garland use their singing talents to prevent Durbin's grandfather from being forcibly removed by the town hall from conducting their Sunday concerts in the park), presages the lines of the plot of the two musicals of "Let's Put on a Show" by Garland with Mickey Rooney and Durbin 100 MEN AN D A GIRL. Unlike the latest BABES films by Garland, the short film never seriously addresses the insubstantial plot, and as a result, its 11-minute run time flies by. <br /> <br /> Of course, the real magic of ALL SUNDAYS is to observe what is already remarkable by presenting talents / presences on the screen of Durbin and Garland at the start of their legendary careers. Both girls, even at this early stage, had remarkable presences on screen and are completely natural and are not affected in their presentation as singers and actresses. Garland explodes quite off the screen with vitality while literally hitting the lyrics of the merry "Americana." While calculating the number with the appropriate gestures of the hands, Judy literally seems to be chewing the words of the song while she wrinkles her mouth and takes her eyes off her intense desire to show what she can do. <br /> <br /> In contrast, Durbin's presentation of "Il Bacio" is much more modest and subdued. Although it is entirely appropriate for its "classic" selection, Durbin's delivery of the Arditi waltz is much more of the traditional "stand and sing" variety than Garland's emotionally emotive turn. However, although "the miniature diva" Deanna does nothing to draw attention to herself, with her sincere eyes, her dazzling smile and her witty delivery, easily holds the screen with "Jazz Baby" Judy, and her delicious duets of "Americana" in the shorts. The ending makes one regret even more that producer Joe Pasternak could never realize his dream of pairing Durbin and Garland in a musical movie (because Universal refused to loan "Number One Asset" Durbin out). <br /> <br /> An invaluable document of the emerging talents of two extraordinary and absolutely unique talents. Look at this if you have the opportunity!
