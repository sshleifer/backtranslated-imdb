Since the last horrible movie of Asterix and the fact that we only get the Swiss version in theaters, here I went to see her with a little restlessness ... Without foundation, as I am happy to discover that ^ ____ ^ <br /> < The film is fun and modern, has good gags, a good animation, a fun interaction of characters, a good voice (Note: I can only speak for the Swiss German!) except for the daughter of the Viking chief Abba (Su name is great, despite the not very inspired voice actress) ... <br /> <br /> I especially liked the character Justforkix (Goudurix in French, Grautvornix in German.) It is the young man who is supposed to be put in shape ...). It is a very funny portrait of an urban and locked teenager; but it is very nice, despite the adolescent manners ... XD The interaction between Asterix and Obelix and their young managers is fantastic and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> It should not be compared to old movies, since one is quite different ... which surprisingly does not make it bad. On the contrary. When they tried to modernize the last film (twelve years ago), they blew it up completely. This film, however, showed that it can be done very well ... ^ - ^ <br /> <br /> I left the theater happy ... It's always a good sign ^ _ ~
