If you are a "son of the eighties" like me, you probably remember this 1981 Disney movie, one of the first films classified by Disney's PG and the screen debut of Michael J. Fox. I remember seeing this movie one and again on HBO when I was in high school, and recently I found a very old copy, since Disney stopped producing the film several years ago. Needless to say, this is a really fun movie to watch. Five college teams decipher clues in a night race around Los Angeles, trying to get to the finish line first. Look out for Paul Reubens' cameo. From the cheesy music to the disco scene with the fat twins, this is a quintessential movie from the 1980s that you will love.
