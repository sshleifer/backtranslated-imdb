Warning, it contains spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Italian movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The plot has a teenager interested in the occult and with supernatural powers. .Your mother is a member of a Satanist group and fears the influences she will have on the girl. Do not worry, the girl knows exactly what to do and there is no return, she belongs to Satan. <br /> <br /> During the movie strange things happen in a typical way, there is not much logic, but that's a good thing. It's amazing how entertaining these movies are ... In the final battle we see her and her mother fighting each other (naked off course) and doing some mysterious rituals, you could guess who wins ... The final images of the movies they leave you speechless and wandering, why can not there be more movies like this one? <br /> <br /> There is excellent music through the whole movie and the actors are pretty good, better than usual in this kind of movies. Especially Anne Heywood looks and acts well. He also has an unusual camera and Gles and things like that, so it's not boring at all. My rating is 10. <br /> <br /> Hopefully someone will post it on DVD.
