Goldeneye of 007 is one of the best releases of N64. <br /> <br /> Better than this game? Well ... Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Episode I-Racer and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time are much better and superior games. But I still love Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the best adaptation of a movie after the Star Wars adaptations. The story is perfect. It's like you're in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> The graphics are excellent. The movements are extremely realistic. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is the best part of this game. I loved playing the stage where James and Natalya separate from Janus' base while the Goldeneye prepares to burn it. Escaping without sounding an alarm was very difficult. Bypassing the cameras and controlling your fire are great aspects of the game. <br /> <br /> It is also the most difficult game I have played. The N64 games are usually very, very easy. Goldeneye is the only exception. I am still trying to overcome the difficult level of 00 Agent, but winning the easier levels was already a great victory. I loved it when Alec Trevelyan asked: "For England, James?" I answered: "No, for ME!" It happened just at the moment I killed him with blows. As in the movie. I love achieving all the objectives. <br /> <br /> The multiplayer game is even better. At first I was killed every second holy. Now, I know how to win. I love to force my playmates playing in License to Kill. <br /> <br /> The music and the sound are amazing. Super Mario 64 looks like an Atari next to this. The only thing I still wanted to hear was the theme song Goldeneye, which is played at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> After Zelda was released, I almost forgot that I still had this game. It's still excellent, even if it's already exceeded. I hope that other 007 games will be produced. <br /> <br /> Fantastic work, Rareware! Nintendo was very smart to launch this game on the N64 exclusively. Magnificent work of Nintendo!
