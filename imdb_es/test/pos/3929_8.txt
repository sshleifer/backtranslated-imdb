While THE HOUSE OF WAX will never be confused with Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, it does try and, ultimately, manages to be a worthy addition to the quality of the horror movie. There is enough tension and enough implied blood here to please today's young audience and there is also enough explicit blood to please some of yesterday's purists. In general, it's a fairly well-made movie that should work well on a DVD. <br /> <br /> Six children on the way to a soccer game are left stranded in a DELIVERY type environment and what follows is what looks like it may have been brought out a discarded sequel to Deilverance and the sticks of the bramble They seem to make fun of the group. Finally, the group has to separate and half of them go to the desolate city to obtain some pieces of cars. The other half of the group stays behind in the camp and this establishes the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> House of Wax has many strengths. The first is that he is blessed with a very nice cast. Paris Hilton is fine in her role, but it is far from the focal point. Chad Michael Murray, Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors and their presence in the film adds a certain pomp, some credibility and some style. I had never really heard about Chad Michael Murray, just that he was a kind of teenage pinup. But he has a presence for him. Imbuye an intangible for him that seems to translate into his performance. He is instantly sympathetic and possesses a strong character trait. I enjoyed it much more than I thought it would and when it was on the screen, the movie flowed. <br /> <br /> The question now is: "Is this movie a worthy horror movie?" And the answer to that is a resounding YES. As I mentioned earlier, a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, or even THE RING, is not in the same class, but it is relatively tense, quite graphic and there are some very inventive death scenes. This is not the WAX ​​HOUSE your parents told you about. Vincent Price is nowhere to be seen and when you start to see how your fingers cut and the hot wax that covers the comatose bodies, you realize that this movie is a bit on the edge. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a cut without cuts. X classified version of the director. I bet there is one out there somewhere that would be much more violent than this one. Be that as it may, this is a very good entry into the horror genre and is far above weak films like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and DARK WATER and some others. Definitely worth checking out. <br /> <br /> 8/10
