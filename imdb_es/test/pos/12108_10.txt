Crossing the bridge: the Sound of Istanbul received one of the most enthusiastic applause from the audience when it ended and very deservedly. I did not expect too much from a musical documentary, but the film proved to be much more than that. It was also a visual documentary of Istanbul with marked contrasts of the old and the new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. The black and white photographs of the ancient Istanbul of the famous Armenian photographer Ara Guler were exceptional. But, of course, the main theme was music, and by God, what a variety! It was in a similar way to Bueno Vistas Social Club; the love and respect of the interviewer - Alexander Hacke here replacing Ray Cooder - for the musicians exuded from the screen and they enveloped us all. The music was especially interesting. The jazz session of a group of Roma gypsies in a small western city of Turkey was amazing. I would not be surprised if the travel agents start receiving group booking requests for Kesan after the release of the movie. But most of those who loved Muzeyyen Senar were incredibly elegant in a burlesque manner and, while tipping his "Raki," he bravely declared: "My voice and I are 86 years old!" Well done, Faith Akin. I bet there are many more Turkish musicians who feel excluded: go to Volume II, please.
