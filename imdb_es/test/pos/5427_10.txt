'The Big Snit' came into my life completely by accident and has left an indelible mark on my soul. A scar of love, destruction and uselessness that will always be part of my life. This is the story of beautiful futility. We are helpless without the other. We are defenseless against bad government actions. We are defenseless in terms of the choices we all try to make when we are in love. Deaf to the murmurs and events of a world outside the window. Blind to an inevitable apocalypse. Mute of hate and the greedy opinions of a society too forgiving. This is a story of personal commitment and triumphant love that defeats the ideologies of war. Their small discussions are a sublime observation of human nature and how love comes with its pains and darkness. Everyone has some irritating aspect in their personality and this is observed by the creators in the most simplistic and fantastic way. We travel only a short distance with the two main characters, but leave us wanting to complete our own trips with a part of their simple, loving and honest philosophy. I am very happy that this 'our time' exists. Another 20 years on each side of my birth date, and I would not have seen any sense ... ... The Big Snit. William White Sheffield.
