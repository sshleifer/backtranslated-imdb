stars: Danny Devito, Billy Crystal, Anne Ramsey, Kim Griest, Kate Mulgrew, Oprah Winfrey and Rob Reiner. <br /> <br /> After college class, teacher Larry (Crystal) wants his dead ex-wife and Owen (Devito) wants his dead mother (Ramsey). When Larry says he wants his dead wife, Owen knows what he should do for him, in exchange for a favor, for Larry to kill his mother. Devito is absolutely hilarious in this as the aspiring brain-dead writer who daydreams about poisoning his mother and passes him scissors in the head. He has a childlike role that makes him look more like a confused man than a murderer. Ramesy was actually nominated for an Academy Award for this, because of her wonderful acting as the old Mrs. Lift. Along with having comedy, the movie also has a heart. A scene between Devito and Crystal apparently starts as a joke, but it goes further, it actually makes me a little sad. Danny Devito directed the film and did a good job to achieve the dark tone in his direction. For any comedy fan I recommend it. <br /> <br /> My rating: B plus. 84 minutes PG-13 for language, sexuality and violence.
