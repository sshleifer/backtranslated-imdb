Valley Girl will always have a special place in my heart: I would say that this is undoubtedly the best of the teen sex comedies of the 80s, but that is a compliment. This is a good movie, period. It is very specific in time and place; almost twenty years later, this is a wonderful snapshot, but its history is still timeless. (This is just Romeo and Juliet, minus death, after all!) Nicolas Cage is wonderful, showing all the initial promise that, as a result, he has squandered on the crapola of exaggerated action. Deborah Foreman is the revelation of this movie, and I can not believe I did not have a more important career; Someone rediscovers it QUICKLY. This is sweeter and smoother than most movies of the genre (the requirement of nudity seems to be a contractual obligation) and, although it is not innovative, it is nice to see this type of film that respects its characters and does not crucify its characters . Shallow young girls to have fun, even Foreman's best friends team, confused by the pressure of their peers, never presents themselves as villains. (In fact, her friend Stacy, forced to double with Fred, Cage's friend, has a good time despite her protests, and she manages with Fred in the back seat.) This will take you back to the early years of the 80's, if you were there, but it's pretty good today. Warning to those who are not familiar with the film: DO NOT watch one of the apparently continuous presentations of the VH1, go rent it in its unprecedented glory. Otherwise, you are missing the most powerful and specific time dialog of some movies. And one can not write about Valley Girl and not mention the fabulous soundtrack of the great melodies of the 80s, most of them with marvels of a single hit, which are not only an integral part of the sense of time and place in this movie , but they are well themed. chosen one. Watch it - amazing little movie! Fer shur!
