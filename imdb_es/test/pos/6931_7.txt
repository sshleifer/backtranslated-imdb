I was at the world premiere of this film, and I even met Todd in couples in the city (once at Olive Garden). Todd is not a bad guy, he's just a small-time filmmaker with little or no budget and big dreams. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it's good if you like zombie movies with very little plot. And a lot of blood and guts. You can see some places in Kansas City and a lot of raw meat, what could be better? :-) Find the same 2 dozen people who play different zombies (with just a change of clothes or hats). You can have a good drinking game with this movie, take a picture every time you see the same zombie with a different shirt.
