The film "Everything is Illuminated" comes from the writer and director for the first time Liev Schreiber, who adapts the first novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. The book was ambitious and extensive, its magical-realistic elements and its vivid use of language seemed impossible to represent on the screen. The movie, wisely, tries less. Although the final result is not as original as the novel, it is still a film made on a strange road trip in Eastern Europe or, as one of the characters would say, "a very rigid search". <br /> <br /> That character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian who loves American pop culture but seems unable to understand the English language well. However, his grandfather (Russian actor Boris Leskin), who runs a travel company that serves American Jews, convinces him to serve as a translator for Jonathan (Elijah Wood). Jonathan is investigating his family history, and is specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. More than one family secret is revealed during your search. <br /> <br /> The Jonathan of the movie (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a rare semiaptomaniac who steals the dentures of his own grandmother to add to his collection of "family things" . Wood's serene, broad and serious manner works very well in this role. Hutz makes an impressive debut as the carefree and carefree Alex. His malapropisms are hilarious, but he is also capable of making the character aware of himself. The dog Mikki is very funny like the insane Sammy Davis Jr., and one of the few movie dogs I've seen that is not very cute and precocious. <br /> <br /> "Everything is illuminated" eventually puts the Holocaust on a human scale, asking us to remember it not as a general event, but as millions of small specific tragedies. Reminiscent of a European film, it also reflects the effect of past events on young people today, such as Jonathan and Alex. With his original perspective, his excellent performances and some very eye-catching visual effects, "Everything is Illuminated" is a great job for beginners, and I hope that Schreiber will continue to direct films.
