This excellent movie has the best performance you'll ever see, and that alone makes it a must-see. The whole cast is excellent, but, again, it had to be to keep up with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. It did not take me long to get hooked on this movie, and apart from a court scene that is just good, this is a top-notch entertainment. This is a rare movie that really deserves all the Oscar recognition it received. See for yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed.
