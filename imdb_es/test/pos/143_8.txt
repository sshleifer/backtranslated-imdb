I am the first to recognize that Thirst of Chan-wook Park is exceptionally well done, but spending more than two hours with Tae-joo (OK-vin Kim) is enough for anyone to tolerate it for so long. Sang-hyeon (Kang-ho Song) is a priest who wishes to participate as a volunteer in experimental studies on those who wish to undergo rigorous injections in relation to a specific virus that kills in an infectious manner. Instead of dying legitimately, Hyeon becomes a vampire, always longing for the sustenance that blood provides him to fight an infectious disease that returns causing the symptoms with which he began to develop ((blows and sores, and the body vomits blood) Sunlight, as it is known in the vampire genre, causes death by torture if it is exposed to Hyeon for a period of time.Hyeon falls in love with Tae-joo, the wife of Kang-woo (Ha-kyun Shin), A sickly friend from childhood, Tae-joo was welcomed by Ms. Ra (Hae-sook Kim), considered a puppy, and practically used as a pet to be ordained, Ta-joo feels miserable in this situation and begins a torrid affair that she instigates with Hyeon, and soon manipulates him to kill Kang-woo making him believe that he is a victim of abuse.Now giving up his priesthood, Hyeon immerses himself fully in the relationship with Tae-joo, soon a participant willing to kill Kang-woo. This incident, to which Tae-woo contributed (... using a boat, in the middle of a lake, both proceeded to bury it underwater, Tae-woo prevented Kang-woo from surfacing again when trying to re-enter) will chase both, as circumstances arise with Kang-woo "disappeared" (Hyeon got rid of him, where the police would not find his body). Soon, Ms. Ra suffers a stroke (although, a finger and the ability to blink contribute enormously as the story progresses, which shows that she is more aware of what she is made to believe), and Hyeon gives Tae-joo a special birthday gift .. Vampirism. In doing so, Hyeon has created a monster. Tae-joo admits (... even though her tongue has escaped) that, in fact, Kang-woo never hurt her, and while she thirsts for blood, she soon realizes that killing for a supply does not bother her or moral neither psychologically. Tae-joo becomes such a full hand, Hyeon has to take desperate measures to stop that threat to society, including himself. <br /> <br /> I'll say that Thirst is one of the best horror movies I've seen. I have seen with respect to 2009. It is a methodical approach that takes Park and lead us down a dark road with Hyeon and Tae-joo, as they commit terrible acts without anything positive coming from their unholy union. Innocent people die because of Hyeon's love (... what was once lust transforms into an obsessive love at the end) by Tae-joo, and it will stop if he does not make a painful decision. We see inside their heads, their souls, and it's not always pretty. 2 hours with them can be quite exhausting ... but, I thank the director who has not made any effort for the tortuous behavior and the way in which the powers of vampirism can be granted to the wrong people. Hyeon, seen as a pretty nice soul in the opening, accepts the "hell" of Tae-joo so that one can see Thirst as a unique love story, but not exactly healthy. <br /> <br /> As far as violence goes, while Park has a tendency to get away from the extremely graphic details, there is enough sadism involved to make the stomach stir a little. At least, the way in which violence is carried out can leave a lasting impact. The sexual situations between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be quite heated and erotic, while they are also sordid and morally reprehensible. The film, I think, is still a fairly complex examination of the lengths that one will go to remain attached to an object of affection (lust).
