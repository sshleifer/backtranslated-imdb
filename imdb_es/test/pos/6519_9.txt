This is a family comedy, in the best sense of the term. Without complications over faith and family, Ann Blyth, with the help of everyone's favorite grandfather, Edmund Gwenn, receives divine help to elevate the O'Moyne over the possible revenge plans of Goldtooth McCarthy (John McIntire). Pure fun
