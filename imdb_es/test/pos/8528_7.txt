In 1965, producer Kevin McLory, who owns a portion of Bond's film rights, is associated with EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) to make "Thunderball", the fourth film in the 007 franchise. The star is Sean Connery , of course. <br /> <br /> In 1982, McLory wins a legal battle and can produce an "independent" Bond movie. "Never Say Never Again" (NSNA) is one of two 007 "unofficial" movies made outside of EON (the other is the 1967 comedy "Casino Royale"). NSNA is a remake of "Thunderball" and stars Bond, Sean Connery, who returns to the role after many years of absence. <br /> <br /> The film opens a few months after "Octopussy" with Roger Moore, episode 13 of the EON series. When the press calls it "The Bond War" ... Both films are a great success in 1983, even if "Octopussy" earns more money at the box office. <br /> <br /> NSNA is a luxury film made by excellent technicians, director Irvin Kershner who directed "The Empire strikes back", Douglas Slocombe -cinemagraph of "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr, who wrote "The three days of the condor", among others. ... <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent with Connery, a relatively unknown then Kim Basinger, Barbara Carrera, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Edward Fox ... <br /> <br /> Although All that the film is still inferior to the original "Thunderball". It lacks many fundamental ingredients to be a true Bond film: there is no traditional cannon sequence, there is no "James Bond theme", M and Q are not played by traditional actors ... It's a copyright reason: EON is only It is allowed to use these elements. Briefly, NSNA lacks the classic cinematic atmosphere 007. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and the women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and beautiful. But the highlight is Sean Connery! Once again he's wonderful on paper, he's older but he looks more fit and nicer here than in "Diamonds are Forever", his last performance in the role of the British super spy before NSNA.
