Bridgette Bardot, as sexy as ever, plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a French ambassador. Is that one of the best assistants of his father (the womanizer MICHEL) marry her and it turns out to be the best for both. Michel is soon flirting with his old girlfriends and to teach him a lesson, Bridgette flirts heavily with a married PRINCE CHARLES. Michel is surprised by his jealousy. There is a game of cat and mouse between Brigdette and Michel ("I'm going to have an adventure" ... "No, you will not" ...) And finally Michel realizes that he can only and swear to give up everything the rest. Ladies in your life. Bridgette and Michel comfortably settle into their happily ever after, while Prince Charles goes to his home in England. <br /> <br /> It is certainly a light piece, but it is incredibly charming. While some may criticize it as a product of their time, I found it completely enjoyable. Worthy of a rent.
