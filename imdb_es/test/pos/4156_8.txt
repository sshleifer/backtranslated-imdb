A few days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian with a criminal record attacked and tortured to death a middle-aged lady who was returning home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported on what happened. <br /> <br /> Therefore, a debate began on the too intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, all, indiscriminately. <Br /> <br /> I am only 15 years old, but I thought: what idea of ​​wealth does Italy give to these poor people? How do they consider us as the land of abundance? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer. When you have only one donkey and some goats, those propaganda postcards that show the United States as a land with rivers of milk and huge vegetables, make such an impression. <br /> <br /> NUOVOMONDO is really a must-see movie. It balances an ethereal symbolism (rivers of milk, games of looks, hard and rocky mountains, the name and character of Lucy / Luce) and a cruel realism (the mass of hopeful people on the ship, the proceedings on Ellis Island) . There is a mixed cast, ranging from the angelic Charlotte Gainsbourg to the realist Vincenzo Amato, until the bitter and crushing Aurora Quattrocchi is the mother. But was it really that difficult to enter the New World?
