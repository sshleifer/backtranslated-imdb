I'm tired of series with young people and clueless, talking about their "problems" all the time, self-centered, bored and absolutely annoying (Popular, Dawson's Creek, Beverly Hills, etc.). "Hack" is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different argument, credible people with REAL problems (thank God!) And very, very good stories. I just love it!! I hope "Hack" goes on for a long time, because it's a great television series for seniors, for a change.
