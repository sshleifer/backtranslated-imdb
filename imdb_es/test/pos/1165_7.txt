The charming Candace Bergen, like the widow Perdicaris, is kidnapped and held in ransom by the Sheik Raisuli played by the handsome Sean Connery. The incident occurs in 1904 when Theodore Roosevelt presents himself to the presidency in his own right. Brian Keith, who needs a good example to brag about the foreign policy of the United States, Roosevelt issues a surprising statement to the sultan of Morocco: "Perdicaris vivo or Raisuli dead". <br /> <br /> But in this adaptation of that incident the famous statement is the only truth about this story. The Perdicaris in question was actually a Perdicaris Ion who was an immigrant playboy and Greek dilettante. In fact, Perdicaris renounced his American citizenship years ago and returned as a Greek citizen. It does not matter, however, his situation was useful enough at that time. <br /> <br /> The damsel in distress makes a better screen material, so it's a widowed woman and her two children who are in danger here. Of course, as presented here, the incident is also used by some of our European powers to position themselves in Morocco. The intrigues go far beyond the rescue demand of a brigante. <br /> <br /> The wind and the lion is not history. But it's a nice movie and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith also fits my conception of Theodore Roosevelt and the scenes in Roosevelt's White House seem to be true to all the stories told. John Huston plays the always patient Secretary of State John Hay that Roosevelt had inherited from his predecessor William McKinley. <br /> <br /> But children do not use this movie to skip reading a story assignment about the Theodore Roosevelt era.
