This was the movie that started the story of cinematic love <br /> <br /> between the team of The Jaundiced Eye and Matthew Ferguson. His ability <br /> <br /> to represent RELATIVELY normal characters such as Birkoff in <br /> <br /> "La Femme Nikita" is countered by his ability equally <br /> <br /> in the handling of Rare bugs like "Kane" One wishes that only <br /> <br /> receive more roles, bigger roles and others, even more complex <br /> <br /> to evaluate and push the limits of their abilities. There were <br /> <br /> four or five memorable scenes in this movie, and Matthew Ferguson <br /> <br /> stole two of them from much more experienced actors. This movie <br /> <br /> itself is good, and worth seeing on its own merits, but <br /> <br /> Ferguson makes it a bit more special. Your * ouevre * can <br /> <br /> finally show how Anthony Perkins' career might have been <br /> <br /> if he had not been typecast as "Norman Bates" for a long time <br /> <br /> does. "Kane" is not as crazy as Norman, and far fewer people saw "Love and human remains that saw" Psycho ", so we can <br /> <br /> expect that Ferguson will show us some indications of what Perkins COULD <br /> <br /> have been able to achieve, if you had been allowed to do so ...
