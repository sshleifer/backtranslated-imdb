Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is the Master of cinematographic expression. At last night's screening I witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. The performances are amazing, the score fascinating and the photography fascinating. David's ability to weave the many elements of the film into a unique and amazing cinematic experience is second to none. While watching Mullholland Drive, I could not help but realize that with David Lynch in this world, we are truly blessed. The cinema has also been blessed because, in the films of David Lynch, we are shown that the vision of a man can be realized with amazing results. We realize that blockbusters are not the only way. We realize that a true cinematographic artist has an opportunity in this world and in that we are blessed.
