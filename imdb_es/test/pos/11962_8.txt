Thus begins "One Crazy Summer", the evil twin of "Better off dead ..". How can any movie be bad when David Lee Roth sings the first lines? <br /> <br /> This movie is a total explosion. Pairing John Cusack again with Curtis Armstrong, but this time adding Bobcat Goldwaith to the mix has incredible and fun results. The hyperactive Bobcat raises everyone's nerve, Curtis "Ak Ak" is the son of a deranged military man with pacifist tendencies, and Demi Moore (with natural breasts ... wow!) Like Cusack's love interest, once again, with chronic depression. <br /> <br /> The story is, well, quite simple. The laughs are there, but both Savage Steve Holland movies have a certain quality for them ... they are fun, but they are also sweet. The scene in which Curtis finds a swollen doll on the target practice beach and begins to meditate on how a girl can not sleep is silly, funny and touching. The animation used in everything is quite surreal. "The Boat" is hysterical (complete with Watsamatta U. sail and Odie Plush Doll). In general, a funny movie, although not as good as "Better dead ..."
