"Medusa: Dare to be sincere" is a scandalously funny parody that is an excellent companion to the original, "Madonna: Truth or challenge". The brilliant creation of Julie Brown strings the very entertaining documentary of Madonna (although it was not exactly daring, insightful, sincere or truthful) with fidelity to the details, even the package. I highly recommend it to Madonna fans, to Julie Brown fans or to anyone who enjoys sharp and intelligent parody.
