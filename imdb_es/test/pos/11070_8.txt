I thought that the look of Nick GÃ³mez on the sandy streets of New Jersey, where car thefts are at their highest point, was stimulating and entertaining. This is as good as movies like Boyz n the Hood or Menace II Society or Above the Rim. I thought the actors and the scenarios were adequate, it had a realistic feel and it would be very atmospheric, either on purpose or by coincidence. I really liked this movie, an underestimated gem that I found on TV and I'm glad I saw it. Go see this movie if you have an opportunity. If they do not have a DVD, they should launch one. Well done Nick Gomez. IMDb classification: 5.9. My rating: 9/10
