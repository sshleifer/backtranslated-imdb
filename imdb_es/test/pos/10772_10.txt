When it comes to movies, I do not easily distinguish between garbage, pure garbage and masterpieces. I think this movie is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to stay entertained for more than 90 minutes. This movie was slower than the combination of Mystic River and Harry Potter 3 and I could still get stuck in my seat. For me, it was the passion that Eric Bogosian put into his performance. It is extremely difficult to carry out a trick like this and get some positive effect from it. Bogosian probably achieved one of the toughest performances of a single man in modern cinema. I had no respect for Bogosian until the end of the movie. All the monologue minutes before the inexorable climax was the turning point, it was the key that turned me around. This man reached a point so low that he knew he could never recover from it. The corporate guys congratulated him for the performance. His blistered prose made even the thinnest of the cavalcade shake his head in amazement. It made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy do not matter in the world of talk radio, even in the corporate world. Stone may have been pushing a super liberal agenda, but it was the film and the production that caught my attention. Oliver Stone is a minor teacher in a bad mood. The last third of the film probably had the best lighting and cinematography I've seen in any movie. Stone ingeniously makes the DJ booth feel like a five-by-seven cell in a nineteenth-century prison. Visually speaking, it seems that Bogosian's only friend is the black foam that absorbs his vitriol routine. He speaks and does not respond. It is a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who gave him his success. Stone and Bogosian recorded an impressive film of a man who is trapped both in a prison of walls and in a prison of himself. This man is confined to his own will and will never be able to escape from him. The scene that made me realize his enigma was when he was not willing to give back to his ex-wife. He preferred his own prison instead of the outside world. Each story has a conflict and is reduced to the simplest of all conflicts: man against himself. 'Talk Radio' presents this conflict in an intelligent, passionate and artistic way. There are no hidden messages in this movie and any clever viewer must wait for the progression of the events. I just leaned back and let my mind be captured by this movie and I loved it. It is unknown, it is not seen, and it will never receive its due recognition. Let's hope it stays that way because the gems deserve to be found and then hidden again. It's a gem because I found it on the DVD discount tray at my local Wal-Mart store. For $ 5.50, it was worth the half hour that I spent digging trying to find it. I did it and got more than my money was worth. This is one of the best movies that have been made and is only worth it for ten reasons. Ten reasons give a score of ten. <br /> <br /> Here ends my tirade!
