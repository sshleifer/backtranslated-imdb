I must admit that when I first heard about the movie Apocalypse it was a concern. <br /> <br /> I mean, they have a lot to live for, do not they? The first time they did a theatrical show they won the Perrier prize and when they did the radio they won a Sony prize. When they ventured on our TV, they won a Bafta Award, a Royal Television Society Award and the Golden Rose of Montreux. <br /> <br /> When the first series aired in January 1999, it was amazing! A true breath of fresh air at British Comedy, and when the second series aired a year later, was built on that basis and sealed the cult status of the shows around the world, our web statistics show that we have received visitors from all the countries of the planet. ! The 'Local Show for Local People' showed the Gents' talent for live performances and opened the doors for gentlemen to make more live performances like 'Art' in the West End. <br /> <br /> The fan favorite has always been The Christmas Special, minus a sketching show and more a tribute to classic horror movies but still wrapped in the delicious style of League. <br /> <br /> And then, of course, there was the third "difficult" series, still hit with loyal hardcore fans, of course, but maybe a little before its time for a conventional television audience. <br /> <br /> As I said, there is a lot to accomplish. <br /> <br /> So now we have the movie and ... Well, a movie is different, is not it? It will be seen by numbers much larger than the radio or television shows and with the third series in mind, I was worried. <br /> <br /> Well, as you know, I was lucky enough to be able to see the film yesterday in a The Press Screening in London and all my doubts vanished (literally) in the first few minutes! I will not reveal the plot lines as some critics have done, nor will I tell them the key phrases (although there is really only one), but I will try to tell you what they achieved with this movie! When I left the cinema on Monday night, I could only imagine writing: 'Oh, my God, it's brilliant, it's amazing, it's the best they've done, better than the first, the second and the specials, all in one! ' Of course I owe my visitors a much better explanation than that! So, why is it brilliant? This is a movie for everyone, the casual fan, the obsessive fan, the occasional fan and even for someone who is sitting in the wrong cinema. You do not have to have seen the series to enjoy this movie; It works on many levels. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me why I'm a fan of the Knight League! It can be said that the filming was also a true work of love; The attention to detail is incredible. The sets for the television show were always detailed, but I'm going to have to watch the movie again to see the background. The story moves at a rapid pace, the action takes us from Royston Vasey to the real world where we meet the "Creators" who, of course, are the League! On the way we managed to meet the favorite characters of the program, but always within the central story, unlike the program of television sketches. <br /> <br /> I was glad that the movie was dark in some places, a little scary and a little Strange ... only appropriate for the gentlemen's league. The knights also managed to take revenge on the BBC censors, not so much on the word 'Mongoloid' as screaming from the rooftops! Some may think that the gentlemen's representation of themselves is a little forgiving, but that's the joke and with that comes my only concern, the jokes that I mention below can baffle some viewers and they can be a little too smart .. But you should not worry, there is always a poop joke waiting around the corner and talking about jokes, they are thick and fast, and in a mix of smart references, wig teasing, pranks, visual jokes and cock gags! I have not laughed out loud in a movie theater since ... well, I can not remember! Fans who have been 'with' the League from the beginning are rewarded with a lot of jokes', some who work on two levels, a general audience can laugh at a reference to a compact disc for a reason, whereas fans of the Local The show will laugh for another reason at all! The cameos are geniuses! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg form the strangest double act you've ever seen, Simon gets one of the biggest laughs in the movie just for making noise! I was a little concerned about the look of the movie in the 1690s when I first learned, but as a story inside a story, I was getting into that when ... but that would be revealing! All I need to say is that it fits beautifully and adds to the general feeling of the movie! I am not a professional film critic, so I find it difficult to express in words how much I enjoyed this film, but for now I will only say that if the supposed reference point for British comedy films in recent years was the excellent 'Shaun of The Dead 'then I'm sorry, but a new benchmark has been established by the inventive, hilarious and, at times, a little scary ... The League of Knights' Apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Jason Kenny 2005
