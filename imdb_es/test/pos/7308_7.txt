Norma had spent most of the twenties performing beautiful wits, but her first announcer played her as a chorus of "The Trial of Mary Dugan" and it came with success. From then on, they put aside their sweet and charming ingenuity and sizzled in parts that made her like sophisticated women of the world or society in search of emotions. "Let Us Be Gay" was done before, but it was released after "The Divorc√©e" and it was an unusual twist on the dramas of the upper crust that Shearer made his own. Brown, whose main goal in life is to please her husband Bob (Rod La Rocque). She rushes to take him to her golf game, but she actually goes to see her lover. When Helen, the mistress, arrives at the house for a confrontation, Kitty confronts the situation with courtesy, but behind the closed doors she is a mass of emotions and Bob goes away forever. <br /> <br /> Three years later, Mrs. Courtland Brown (Kitty) comes to stay as a guest of the eccentric Mrs. Bouccicoult ("Bouccy") (Marie Dressler). Kitty is now a knockout and "Bouccy" has a job for her. She wants Kitty to make romance with a house guest, who in turn is making love to her granddaughter Diane (the beautiful Sally Eilers). Shock!! Horror!! - The man is none other than Bob, his ex-husband! Kitty takes the meeting with sophistication and ingenious resolution: "there seems to be something strangely familiar about that man". - and nobody is wiser. <br /> <br /> The film is then established in one of those very "talkative" and boring "salons" comedies. Kitty casts a spell on all the men and Bob is desperate to start over. Women have all the important roles in this film: men are just puppets. Raymond Hackett seems to be in the film as an additional butler: "give me a cushion," "bring me a drink," "move this chair" instead of Diane's beleaguered boyfriend. Norma Shearer is, of course, the complete program, Marie Dressler adds "Bouccy" to her list of eccentric portraits and Sally Eilers is a true observer like the beautiful Diane.
