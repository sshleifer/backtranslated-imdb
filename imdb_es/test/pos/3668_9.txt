Unconditional love is surprisingly entertaining. While the plot is triggered in too many directions, which makes it too long a film, it never fails to charm and ingratiate itself. The various story lines, a warm reminiscent of SHIRLEY VALENTINE, provide ample smiles, laughter, wisdom and tenderness. Everything should not work, and sometimes without a doubt you stumble, but forgive your inconsistencies, sit down and have fun. It is a delight!
