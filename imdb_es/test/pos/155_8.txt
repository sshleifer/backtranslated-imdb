The "madness" of vampires has shown, in my opinion, that it is as valuable as such an infamous categorization. There were many subgenre films last year from a multitude of countries. I have reviewed many and I have some more to discuss. Forgive my indulgence, but since I have recognized the trend as a phenomenon (it is and, by chance, it has my favorite element of horror). I'm going to move out of North America for a while and show you hopefully meaningful movies that you did not see until now. <br /> <br /> Of the many effects of Twilight is the creation of "Boy" and "girl" of vampire movies. I hate this sexist categorization, which has the effect of polarizing a whole generation of fans into "sides". I believe that men are prone to hate the work of Stephenie Meyer (and their offspring) to some extent because they feel some betrayal of the fact that an archetype that was always theirs is now liberated. It is unlikely that women will enjoy future "neutral" photographs, as they grew with solid expectations that were applied four times. We need more directors to create vampire films that both sexes can enjoy (unequally) if the vampires are going to survive the madness and remain relevant. Cue: Sed This Korean movie was directed by Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy fame. There are two ways to dissect it. Or, it extends between gender expectations and is universally enjoyed marginally, or it is a disorder that does not decide which target audience it prefers and, therefore, no one should see it. Do not let it convince you that the movie has no inclinations. Its director is a man whose fame is action movies based on stories. His protagonist is male and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on this later). Even so, his desire for a woman he has known before and after mortal life has not been devised, and his attention has been returned. There is a masculine inclination in this image, but it is not so partial that women can not enjoy it. The same can not be said for Daybreakers or New Moon. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a novel by Emile Zola called Thérèse Raquin, which I have not read. According to Wikipedia, the novel deals with an issue that develops between a married woman and a single man. He kills her husband during a fishing trip and starts dating her. The two are unable to have sex because they imagine the body of the dead man among them. Therefore, they are driven to madness, but they worry about the sick mother of the woman. At the conclusion of the novel, they try to kill each other, discover each other's plans and commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Now, transcribe this French novel of almost 150 years of age in modern South Korea and have Thirst. Chan-Wook does not embellish history enough to elevate this to a must-see. He often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration. I think the most memorable parts are when their scruples are unraveled from the narrative. Your use of the mother-in-law as a result of your bad romance is simply perfect. See it <br /> <br /> The protagonist is originally a devout Christian who becomes a vampire after a defective blood transfusion after volunteering for a new medicine. Thus he becomes the god with whom he was once beaten. People come to him and see him as a great healer. IN AGREEMENT. That's really great and could have provided a great foundation for your relationship. However, this idea is given little time to screen the idea when it becomes a realistic figure of Christ who tries to maintain his virtue despite the fact that his lifestyle demands that he abandon it. Instead of confronting delirious people, instead, sip blood from patients in the coma hospital. <br /> <br /> Let's continue with the Christian allusion. The woman tricks the vampire man to kill her husband. Her overprotective mother-in-law suffers a stroke and, finally, warns friends of the family of her daughter-in-law's betrayal. The man kills her but resuscitates her. The two invite the old friends and the woman begins to harass the humans without mercy. The man says that it is enough and decides to drive to the beach and forces her to wait for the sun to rise with him. Both die, but he expiates his crimes (and his, but the film portrays his evil more prominently). <br /> <br /> The character of the woman is a caricature, and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior. She is an uneducated housewife, while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive. Vampirism magnifies its characteristics. She becomes a monster like the one you would expect from someone without knowledge. He becomes a demigod with spirit. His life is how atheists see themselves and their life is how religious people see those without divine intervention.
