What an original piece of work. I have always enjoyed Liev Schreiber the "actor", but now one must appreciate man on a multidimensional level. How did you get that field of sunflowers? It was computerized, it sure looked real. And how do you audition a dog knowing that you're going to get that kind of performance? Does the academy have a category for animals? I guess what I'm saying is that I really, really enjoyed this extravagant, unconventional and indie movie. From the excellent cast (one would never know that Eugene Hutz was not a professional actor) to the director of photography (some beautiful images) the music (he bought the CD when leaving the theater) and, of course, the two "D's" (address and the dog) . In general, a "10". <br /> <br /> /
