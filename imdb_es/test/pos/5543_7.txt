First, do not be fooled by the name of my family. My mother was pure Italian blood, so I really know Italian families, and I LOVE mafia movies, even fun ones like this one. <br /> <br /> For those people who have mistreated this movie (you know who you are.) you should take away the privileges of your film because you do not know what is good. This is a very funny and good style movie. The fact that almost nobody is Italian is part of the joke, from what I can see. And what red-blooded heterosexual man could complain about spending an hour and something like Michelle Pfieffer? Puh-lease! When I saw this movie, it convinced me with the opening song of Rosemary Clooney, which was the most Irish thing that can be achieved, but its pronunciation of the Italian words in "Mambo Italiano" is impeccable and sets the tone of what to follow to perfection. (Hell, I even bought the disk the next day for that). Only the appearance of every shrill thing in the apartment that I have personally seen in the homes of my relatives, although not in the same place (which I found hysterical) I sold it to me. <br /> <br /> This movie is like Goodfellas about gas laughter. I wonder why there is no Burger Worlds and what happened to the food that these guys were supposed to eat. My guess is that the crew ate it. "French fries are crispy, smoothies are creamy." My mouth is crying almost as much as thinking about the beautiful Mrs. Pfieffer. (And anyway, I never trusted clowns.) And the three best things in this movie are the painful and funny mafia of Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell as his partying husband Tony "The Tiger" and, finally, but definitely Oliver's great assault. Platt who should get more comedic roles. And notice to myself: find out where that black girl was. Oh! Why does she work so infrequently? This image is right next to the big mafia movies as it should be.
