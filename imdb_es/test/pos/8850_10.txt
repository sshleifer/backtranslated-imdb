"The Thing" by John Carpenter is undoubtedly one of the best horror films ever made. Unfortunately, as with most Carpenter films, it is also one of the most underrated movies by critics shortly after its release for a reason that is almost pathetic. It seems that at that time people were overwhelmed by the idea of ​​the "good" alien. An idea that emerged after the success of "I.T." And the very thought that a film dealing with extraterrestrials could deviate from that idea was considered a heresy. Human ignorance is really a terrifying thing, people need to judge movies so they are not what they want them to be. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a US Antarctic base. UU Discover the presence of an extraterrestrial being (referred to throughout the film only as a "thing") capable of imitating any way of life. Without knowing who the creature may or may not be, we see how each character reacts to the situation. There is no hysteria in mass or panic, just a slow and gradual descent into chaos as more and more people turn to be ... not quite human. <br /> <br /> Carpenter manages to elevate this film to something much more than its science fiction / horror average. There is no "what's behind you?" Moments of jumping here. Instead, relying on an intense atmosphere of pre-apocalyptic mistrust and despair along with some well-balanced moments of visual terror, not thanks to Rob Bottin's awesome creature effects, gives us an experience that is not comparable to many others. horror movies. <br /> Instead of just presenting facts and elements of the plot in our face, Carpenter offers us a much more gradual and delicate approach. By insinuating a sense of mystery, it gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret what has happened in certain scenes, while providing a sufficient plot for those who are not so keen on acting in the movies. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone's score works all the way. Its minimalist and depressing sound fits perfectly with the overall tone of the film. Although I've always wondered how it would have sounded if Carpenter (it is known that he composed all the OST of his films, except this one) did it? The characters, although not as developed, are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors, especially Kurt Russel, who plays the apathetic helicopter pilot "down-out" R.J. MacReady. It's worth watching how your character transforms through the movie. From his contempt "do not give him an attitude ..." at the beginning, to that of a unifier and leader of the group of men who try to fight against "the thing". But even with that said, there are no false heroic acts here, there are no moments of "laughing at death" and certainly there is no kind of comic relief, the film maintains its environment from the first scene to the last. . Speaking of which, once again, Carpenter maintains his tradition of creating a powerful ending. <br /> <br /> Quarter of a century after its release, "The Thing" does not feel old-fashioned. And with the increasingly disturbing use of computer-generated effects, it feels even stronger than before because it shows the work of life and the dedication of human beings, not computers. Combined with its opening to analyze it, it gives the viewer many more reasons to see it for a second, a third, a fourth or ... A masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.
