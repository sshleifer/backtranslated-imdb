This is a multi-faceted, insightful and bold story about people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and our) perception and realities. Although the main theme revolves around a delirious young woman, history delights with physics, medicine, religion and even politics, as it questions our perceptions of what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma beautifully conveys that the world in which Mithi lives is as real to her as ours is to us. Within that world, she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent, not the gibberish that seems to us in our world. <br /> <br /> Here are some outstanding scenes to watch while watching the movie (don't worry, these are not spoilers). I loved the way Aparna Sen wove these comments into the story. <br /> <br /> - References to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the witch doctor ("ojha" in Hindi) performing his religious rituals that he believes will scare away the "ghosts" that sit in the brain of Mithi. <br /> <br /> - The doctor who prescribes the shock treatment as a solution that is "believed" to work <br /> <br /> - Windows of perception - The scene about the revision of Anu's book. <br /> <br /> - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for "maya". <br /> <br /> - News images of George Bush telling everyone that "there is no doubt in his mind" that there is WMD in Iraq (now, that is not so much about Bush's perception, I suspect I knew The truth, like the perception of the gullible public about WMD in Iraq.) <br /> <br /> - One of the best scenes in the film is where Mithi tells Anu "Charu sent this man to to beat me "and Anu dismisses it as a matter of course. Konkona did a fantastic job, bringing out the strange mixture of confused thoughts in the brain of a schizophrenic when his world and the real world collide. <br /> <br /> Aparna Sen was bold, but not bold enough to ask a big question: Is it delirious almost all of humanity to believe in God? I could have inserted some scenes about "normal", "healthy" people who pray and sacrifice themselves for a Being that nobody has seen or heard in all human history (the ritual / exorcism scene is not enough). That would be the last question: What is normal? Who is the correct reality, the believers or the atheists? <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this film is a much more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than "A Beautiful Mind". Observe the minds not only of sick people, but also healthy ones, and do so from many different angles and enlighten our understanding of our own minds and our world. If the first one obtained 4 Oscar awards, this deserves more: at least one for history, script, direction, Konkona and Shabana Azmi. It was really a pleasure to see this movie and I'm glad I bought the DVD for my collection. <br /> <br /> This was a very well told story.
