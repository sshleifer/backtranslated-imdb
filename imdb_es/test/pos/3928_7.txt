I do not think that this film deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best "teen" horror movies I've seen; And that's saying a lot. Nothing remains without an explanation to support it, the characters and the plot break innumerable stereotypes of horror movies, and has nothing to do with some other horrible pieces that have sent us lately. (A clear example is the foolish "Saint Ange".) The first 30-40 minutes can be completely boring with the exception of the beginning, although some slight errors of light can be easily detected. However, after the arrival in the village, the horror begins, a different and twisted kind of horror. With the plot and the details, the errors are minor; The characters are the strongest point of this film, since many clich√©s are broken in it. For example, the two main male characters, Nick and Wade, are by no means the idiot types we are used to; Although Dalton could fit this stereotype better, he is not the only one who pays for this lack of conscience. Some scenes are truly horrible and satisfying, which compensate for the tense moments scattered throughout the film. And, in the end, and although everything is explained with decorum, it is easy to see that things will not be so easy for the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> The only mistakes I can see, and that do not imply continuity (IE, Carly does not find his own cut finger in the pockets of Bo's unconscious) is the lighting, which is somehow annoying during the first 30 minutes. Although, in terms of the plot and the effects, everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to Ambrosia, that little town in the middle of nowhere, so I'll give it to you. It has been argued that almost 70% of the film is illogical; "How can two people build a complete wax house?", "Where do they get all the wax?" These would not be lifting questions if people had paid more attention to the film. The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax; his mother worked making real wax figures, and they were exhibited in the museum. And the scenario in which the unfortunate character of Paris Hilton meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question; What about all the personal items (mobile phones, cars, clothes) of the dead? Using his third brother as a connection to the outside, it is quite debatable that the Sinclair twins get the money to buy the wax, similar to World War II. <br /> <br /> Then, apart from that, think that the movie deserves much more than what it gets, and no one should miss the opportunity to see it. So go see the wax house. Right now.
