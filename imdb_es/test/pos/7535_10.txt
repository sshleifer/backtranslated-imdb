I think this movie is underestimated. For me it felt like a breath of fresh air. Some people complain about the implausibility of the plot, the excessive sequences and the lack of sex (the latter is, I think, the main reason for the "implausibility." And why are not there drunken teenagers talking badly ?!); but it's not their thing, and it's good for them if they can not relate to the story. The performances are great; I would really like to see more actors in other movies. The emotions are genuine. All unrequited love is presented with a subtle subtlety. And it gives you the tingling sensation you expect to get from a good movie.
