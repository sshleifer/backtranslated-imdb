I just returned from the GLBT Film Festival at 34 AMC Loews in New York. A friend told me about this movie. The response from the audience was very positive! A lot of good solid laughs, as well as some quiet moments of realization. Top-notch in all areas. A movie that makes you think, and then makes you realize how lucky we would be if we could go back in time and live without shame or guilt. I imagine that this will approach, if it does not win, the public's favorite prize. What surprised him most was the fact that the film seems to start as a satire and then slowly intertwines in a genuine comment about the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the same group that began to satirize. There is no petty humor at the expense of a group, only a slow understanding that we would all be better off if we were to return to the soft innocence with which we all begin.
