A city in Japan is being taken by a horribly brutal abstract form: the spiral. It is becoming an issue in everything from animals to clouds for people and mentally and literally twisting them. This movie shows it happening to several groups of people. Some demonic possession is implied, but nothing is completely certain, except that the best option is to get out of the dodge. The film really progresses well from normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant and crazy snails) to the truly supernatural (undead). <br /> <br /> As a fan of the American horror movie, this was just what I needed. Maybe it was just the novelty of a film from a different culture, but it seemed to have a very original progression, a set of characters, and the premise was definitely new. The Japanese may think that the "forms of horror" (uzumaki means "spiral", they have told me) are old, but it was nice for me because I am used to the monsters / aliens / viruses / disasters / undead movies. In an American movie, you know who will die (the annoying / nasty / lascivious / racist characters) and who will live (the kids / heroine / dogs / cats / good guy). That is not true in the Japanese horror. It was not foreseeable how they would fight against evil or how it would end. Also, I had this new cloudy day, which was a cool visual effect for me. The horrible moments were really creepy, relying on a bit of blood, but mostly on overly exaggerated facial expressions (think of the ring) and bodily manipulations. This should be one of the big ones, with original ideas like the first Nightmare on Elm Street or Night of the Living Dead.
