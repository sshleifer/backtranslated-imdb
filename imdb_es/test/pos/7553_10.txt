The first time I came across Arthur Penn's "Four Friends" one night on HBO. As I had never heard of that, I expected very little, but I observed because I was interested in seeing what a creation of a Penn team and screenwriter Steve Tesich would be like. For the next two hours or so, I sat hypnotized, watching this incredible team of talents and the history they wove. A semi-autobiographical story of a young immigrant to America who grew up amid the turbulence of the 1960s, "Cuatro Amigos" follows the story of Danilo, an immigrant from Eastern Europe (the brilliant Craig Wasson), since his arrival to the United States through a Decade that changed the American panorama. Accompanying Danilo on his trip are his friends Georgia (the radiant Jodi Thelan, in a role that unfortunately, she never had the opportunity to match), Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Huddleston). "Four friends" covers too much territory to try to explain it here, but if you have not seen this movie, I urge you to find a copy (that has just been published on DVD) and look at it. You will not be disappointed. Is Tesich's writing marvelously moving? Sometimes funny, sometimes incredibly sad, but always fascinating and honest. Penn leads with a sure hand and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we follow. The cast is uniformly excellent. This film should have been a great star of Wasson, who is truly one of the most wasted talents in this country. Jodi Thelan, it's not your Hollywood sexpot with no standard brain, heats up the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with their character as easily as the characters in the movie. The subtle performances of Metzler and Huddleston could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co-stars, but they are excellent and help anchor the film. Also excellent are Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents, as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith. I have not been without a copy of "Four Friends" since the day after I first saw her on HBO many years ago. It has been and still is one of my favorite movies of all time for more than 20 years. I can not recommend it enough and I feel that, if you give it a chance, you will feel the same.
