Ghillie, a remake of the Telugu "okkadu" is, fortunately, a clarified version of the original. It presents the same blow and Dharani faithful to its cinematographic brilliance delivers it with style and style. A mark in the race of Vijay with the entrance of people like Surya and Vikram, in the fray, got the much needed improvement with this film. This could be the best movie Vijay has been on, considering the choices he has been making since then. The worker actor seems to have lost his way. What about the new talented entrants that are accepted by both the industry and the public? <br /> <br /> The hermetically adjusted script, which runs to, a neck break speed revolves around Velu, a young volunteer who aspires to leave a mark on The Kabaddi Game (a popular game among children from India). The events that followed the chance meeting with Muthupandi, her rescue of the girl in distress and how it relates to the aspirations of her friends and her friends form the fulcum and the end of the Vijay fits like a 'T' in the role and essays a tenuous and believable representation of the boy next door. <br /> <br /> Trisha has more than one Tamil heroin mantle stereotype to play with. The role is much more complex than a girl in trouble. With a limited dialogue, Trisha exploits her occasional silenced expressions and her subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. This is a classic case of a cover girl who comes of age to become a professional actress. Trisha became my personal favorite after this movie. <br /> <br /> The film ends in predictable lines, although one has to credit the Director for keeping the audience guessing many things, including Trisha's change in the decision to leave the country. Prakash Raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counterweight to Vijay's role. His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent flaws in the hero's armor form a perfect tactic to keep the audience guessing. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great movie that deserves at least a single visualization. I give you a clear 8 out of 10.
