*** Spoilers ahead *** My late childhood had two movie icons: Star Wars and this film by the Czech genius Karel Zeman. An encyclopedia by Jules Verne in which nineteenth-century illustrations come to life in an exquisite black and white photograph, combined with stop motion and conventional animation. The spirit of adventure of Verne is fully present throughout the film, as well as a very modern questioning about the moral limits of power and advanced technology. In fact, it brings atomic energy to Verne's universe in a very elliptical and elegant way. Also elliptical and elegant is the disappearance of the villain, with an explosion (probably nuclear) that sends his hat flying over the sea. The resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfying, something very rare nowadays, when many films do not seem to know how to finish by themselves. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to discover this jewel in repetitions. Local television in the late 70's: it improved my enjoyment of Verne's fiction and cinema. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for Karel Zeman, a teacher of the unappreciated imagination.
