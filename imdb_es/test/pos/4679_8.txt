- Surprisingly nice movie <br /> <br /> - A group of thieves led by Mark Wahlberg steal a gold safe in Italy and, fortunately for them, the robbery succeeds and they get away with no big problems. Before the group can celebrate, however, Steve played by Ed Norton decides he wants the gold all to himself and takes a Cout De 'Ta from the group and shoots one of the members. He and his accomplices leave thinking that the group is dead, but fortunately the group is not dead. A year later, we return to the story in which the group located Norton and decided to recover the gold and dedicate the rest of the film to devise plans to recover their gold and establish a score. <br /> <br /> - This was a surprise for me, it had all the features to be a typical summer movie for the oblivion, but it was really memorable and really fun to watch. What I like is how smart and well-thought-out the movie's plans are, and how the film feels realistic. Watching the trailer would make you think it was a pointless action movie, but in reality there are only two action scenes in the movie and they are all very well done. The last action scene is 20 min. Very long. Scene that has one of the best car chases ever made. I like how real the persecution is and how everything is done in the style of the old school without the help of CGI. Personally, I enjoyed this car chase rather than the full CGI chase in "Matrix 2". I remember seeing music videos by director F. Gary Gray and I always noticed how well they were doing and I thought he would be a great filmmaker. It turns out that he was right as always and shows it here. I can not wait to see what he does with the sequel. <br /> <br /> -The actors also do a decent job with Seth Green being my favorite of the group. The other thing that I loved was the excellent score of John Powell, since I heard his score for "Robots" this year, I've been a fan of him and I've paid a lot of attention to his music and the man is really good. He does a great job of avoiding all the typical musical clich√©s of the summer action movie and provides a very well done score. I have not seen the original on which it is based, so I can not really say how well it accumulates up to that. <br /> <br /> -So, this is a great popcorn movie that really has a brain unlike most of the summer movie junk that comes out. He has great characters, he's fun as hell and he has an incredible score from John Powell. If you like theft movies, then you will love this one. <br /> <br /> -You know that if I was in the group I would call myself handsome Mike.
