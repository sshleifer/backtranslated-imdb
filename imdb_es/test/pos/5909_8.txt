Billy Wilder created a somewhat conventional biopic about the flight of Charles Lindberg. He structures the film using flashbacks extensively to tell Lindberg's story that leads to the famous flight across the Atlantic, which is what happens in the film today. Flying in a plane hour after hour is no excitement, and Wilder will not deviate from his Lindberg theme as the common man's hero, so things are predictable. However, James Stewart is well chosen and is quite credible as Lindberg, and the many obstacles he has to overcome just to keep his plane in the air make one watch him. <br /> <br /> The movie unfolds most successfully when Wilder weaves the parts of the story in a way that creates tension, then relief and then tension again. The cinematography is pretty good, Franz Waxman's score improves the scenes, and Stewart really seems to make Lindberg come alive, makes believe that it could be Lindberg. There is a bit of religious confusion from the 1950s to the end, but in general, the direction, the performance and the high production values ​​outweigh the predictability of the story (Would anyone REALLY see this image and would NOT know that Lindberg crossed the Atlantic ?) A nice movie that has aged better than most movies of that era. Billy Wilder made films of a wide variety of types, and this is one of the best representations of his artisan.
