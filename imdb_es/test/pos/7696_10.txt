"Porgy and Bess" is an outstanding production of George Gershwin's masterpiece. It is made with good taste in muted colors. The voices are outstanding. Although the voice of Sidney Portier is doubled for his part of singing, he gives a very moving performance. There is a remarkable performance by Sammy Davis Jr. as Sportin Life. There is not yet a DVD available to watch, and this piece asks for one. All the smart moviegoers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece in the new medium. The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that competes with all the other musicals, including the outstanding ones by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Be sure to request it and your video provider. Like "Songs of the South" by Walt Disney, it may be the assumption of racial nuances that prevents the commercialization of this cinema.
