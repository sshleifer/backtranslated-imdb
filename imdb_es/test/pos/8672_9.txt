One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, accurate in its vision, and beautiful and highly imaginative in its realization. I can not say much without giving it away, and I do not recommend that you read a lot about this movie before seeing it, just look at it. <br /> <br /> But, ah, one should have ten. lines of text to have a revision listed in IMDb. Riddle. What I can do? We tell you about the movie? No I can not do it I think I enjoyed this movie precisely because I saw it without preconceptions. Please, do the same. <br /> <br /> I suppose this can be said: the acting is excellent and discreet, and what I love about foreign films is that the films are really about MOVIES, not about the movies. stars
