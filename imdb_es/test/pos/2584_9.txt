I saw this movie in the first screening available in my area, and it was pretty clear that most people did not get the movie. Even if you do not, it's a good movie with an interesting character development. It's a completely human story about some very imperfect people in a town south of Woodlands, and it really speaks to the root of the blues. If you do not know what the "Black Snake Moan" is when you leave the theater, you do not understand it. And no ... it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a great job and is absolutely convincing in her role, like Samuel L. Jackson. I think this is his best performance since his role in Pulp Fiction, and probably his best performance, including the rank of his character in BSM. The rest of the cast is solid, with some brilliant performances here and there, especially John Cothran Jr. as Reverend RL. I am a very selective film observer, and this film is classified among my favorites due to its frank appearance in the race. Sex, religion and neurosis in a rural southern city, along with his cinematographic genius, in my opinion.
