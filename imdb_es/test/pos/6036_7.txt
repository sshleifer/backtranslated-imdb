My first 'columbo'. I rather enjoyed it. Large format, and the character of Peter Falk extremely good ... wonderfully peculiar, can take his place next to Poirot, Miss Marple, and also to people like Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I can see why this series has so many followers. <br /> <br /> As a professional musician, I HAVE to say some things. In the first place, a conductor who only produces these pedestrian interpretations of the most basic examples of the repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Strauss Waltzes, Beethoven ...) will never have a house like that or a fame like that or cars like that. , much less be called a genius. And the driving the actor does is so bad as to be laughable. No orchestra would take it seriously. <br /> <br /> There are also several small things, like his essay by Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (why rehearse it when they have just done it for TV? Any orchestral musician could play it in his sleep anyway ...). Her instructions for the set are absolutely absurd, and when Columbo asks Blythe Danner what "almost fantasy" means, she says she is "Latina." It's Italian, like the vast majority of musical instructions. <br /> <br /> And finally, there are not two great musicians who NEVER have the following exchange: "Play something". "What should I play?" "Chopin." Music is her work and her passion, they know her well. Something much more specific would be requested and offered! <br /> <br /> I know. I should go out more ...
