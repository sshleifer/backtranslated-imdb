Sacchi is Bogart's best imitator in history ... dry and funny like Sam Marlowe. The music of the award-winning composer George Duning, the cinematography of the perfect venues [including the famous Ambassador Hotel] is at the height of the famous television director Robert Day [Kojak, Streets, The Picnic, The World of Suzie Wong] from San Francisco, The Avengers] guide the most endearing group of actors of known characters through a parody of each dark detective film that has been made. Look at this if you loved all the old serious movies and have a sense of humor ... this is a flash.
