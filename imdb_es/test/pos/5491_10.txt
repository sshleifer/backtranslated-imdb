I've seen a few action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best of all time! There are very few movies that I consider seeing several times and this is one of them. Everything in this movie is fine: Clint as the excellent lead actor, Rene Russo as his non-stupid partner (this is a very rare combination: sad, but true!). Of course, John Malkowich deserves much praise for his excellent villain, but we should not overlook Eastwood's initial friend, played by Dylan Mcdermott, who from my point of view fits perfectly with the role. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, but unfortunately it was never released on A CD with the original soundtrack (what a shame for the producers!). The plot makes sense and there is no loss of pace, the audience remains in constant excitement about the outcome of the duel between Eastwood and Malkowich. I give this 10 stars!
