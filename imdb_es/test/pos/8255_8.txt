I recently bought this movie on DVD at a discount store for $ 5. Although it is an unadorned DVD on the Geneon label (only the movie that starts playing immediately, without menu or special features), the image and sound quality it was excellent. The film is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan, whom I must admit he had not heard of, plays the lead character: Pinky Green. A charming young man who had spent many of his few years in prison and now wanted to go directly, but he is not allowed to do so! He portrays an American in England. David Niven plays the protagonist of evil, also with the great charm for which he is famous. Bad, but with scruples like when he refuses to deny Pinky his "blow" for work. Whack, in England, apparently is the fair part of the shot and not a bullet in the head like in the American gangster movies! The entire supporting cast does an excellent job producing a very credible movie. <br /> <br /> What is perhaps better, for me, is that the whole movie is quite pleasant and understandable (I often find myself lost in the confusions of the plot and several characters) without any special effect. Without blood. Without violence. Not even a single pursuit! Only a well written story, well acted, well directed and well photographed! If I had any complaints about the film, I would question the music. What is bluegrass music doing in a story of bank robbery that takes place in England?
