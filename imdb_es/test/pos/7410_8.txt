To provoke thought, humble representation of the human tragedies of war. A small but altruistic view of the interactions of a family with the enemy during the civil war in Kentucky. This film diminishes the "glamor" of the war; showing its effect not only on the soldier but on the whole family unit. <br /> <br /> Many of today's films show war as an opportunity to highlight the "heroes" and other glamorous characteristics of the war, but very few attempts to show the true effect that the war really takes on a community. This movie tries this through a recount of the memory of a person from those days. It is claimed that this film is a loose translation of a real event, when in reality, this film is probably an objective reality of hundreds, perhaps thousands of "real events" during the civil war. I recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie.
