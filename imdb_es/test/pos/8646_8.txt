After two short scenes that at first do not seem to be related to the rest of the film, we see a beauty of dark hair and obviously rich in the back of a limousine. Your driver stops at a strange place on Mulholland Drive, which is a two-lane road full of twists and densely forested filled with mansions overlooking Los Angeles. Just as his driver and another man in the passenger seat turn to kill her, two race cars in the opposite direction collide with the limousine. Only the dark-haired woman survives. He makes his way to Sunset Boulevard and hides in a woman's apartment on vacation. Soon after, Betty (Naomi Watts), the woman's niece on vacation, appears in the apartment and meets the dark-haired woman, who now has amnesia. Most of the first part of the movie is Betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. This is interspersed with strangely surreal threads about the producers and directors of Hollywood, with occasional incursions into a land of thugs and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> The above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed, but that's not half. The film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation. Basically, it is guaranteed that you will not understand this movie and that you will not have much confidence when you come to your own interpretation the first time. Even if you have a lot of experience with like-minded movies, such as Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004), you may not understand it on a Second Visit, either. The studio was aware of this to the extent that they made director David Lynch write "10 tracks to unlock this thriller" and put it in the back of the chapter that is included in the DVD. As Lynch has a particular disposition, these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself. It does not help when it comes to understanding in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a long time to discover which parts are supposed to be "real" and in some sections there is a complex nesting of flashbacks, with only contextual clues that they are flashbacks. <br /> <br /> But is it the movie that is worth seeing, or is it worth trying to find out? That depends on your tastes, obviously. On a superficial level, the film is certainly attractive if you're a fan of surrealism, although it will tend to seem a bit slow and excessively disconnected for some viewers. But those qualities, and many other surreal aspects of the film, are typical of Lynch. An important moment of Lynchian is that the elderly couple at the beginning smiled strangely, almost as if they were people from extraterrestrial pods trying to put a front. If you are familiar with that style and like it, here you will find much to love, although in many ways, Mulholland Drive is quite discreet for Lynch. It is also worth noting, for viewers who are primarily interested in him or who enjoy it as much as in other aspects, that Mulholland Drive has a pretty hot lesbian scene. It is not free, although I do not have problems with gratuity, but it is an important hinge in the film. <br /> <br /> Like all Lynch films, it's easy to get caught up in their unique approach to every aspect of cinema. The art and its attention to detail. Any serious film student (including "chair students" / "moviegoers") must study Mulholland Drive; many will love it. Lynch does not let anything go by without manipulating. It includes bright color schemes (like the plethora of reds and pinks) with important symbolism. It makes unusual use of the sound, such as the telephone ring that goes to the scoring section that follows it (when Betty arrives at the airport for the first time). Direct your actors to present their lines in a lot of strange ways, as their features strange pauses. He passes on his strange and surprising sense of humor, such as the name "Winkie's" and the sign "Hot Dogs - made for Pinks" that provides a clue to some of the symbolisms of color. <br /> <br /> Lynch's attention to detail in the production design provides important and subtle clues throughout the film to help unlock the meaning. It's interesting to note that Lynch even apparently demands that DVD programming be unusual - there are no chapters on the disc; You must watch the movie in real time or move forward or backward to return to specific points. <br /> <br /> If surrealism and the veil of the film appeal to you, or if you like a lot of "puzzles", then Mulholland Drive is well worth seeing for that aspect. There is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad and generalized level. I'm not going to tell the standard interpretation here: it's worth investigating, but only after you've seen the movie a couple of times and come to your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs have been written about the film and the performances; There are even websites dedicated to him. <br /> <br /> However, for my money, although I generally love Lynch and find many things about Mulholland Drive attractive, it is not a 10 for me, at least not yet (I have the feeling that my score could still be upload in later visualizations). For me, however, the "spin" aspect of the film is made much better in other works such as The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more attractive to me because of its superficial surrealist touches, but the plot does not carry them as well as some of Lynch's other films. <br /> <br /> However, Mulholland Drive is certainly recommended for the right audience. If you are serious about movies and do not mind having to think about what you see (as if those two did not necessarily coincide), you should not miss this one.
