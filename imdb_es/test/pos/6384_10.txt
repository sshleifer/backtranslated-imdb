I saw this movie in a screener and it's the best movie I've seen in a long time. I loved!!!! James Franco is very good and he and Sienna Miller make the perfect couple. I do not want to reveal what happens, but they interpret a couple of newlyweds who go on their honeymoon to Niagara Falls and very wild things happen on the way ... The movie is really funny, sad and original. I can not even say what I remembered, but go see it! I cried so much, but I really loved it and I want to see it again as soon as it comes out. My friends also cried. I hope it comes out soon, does anyone know when? I would really go see it if it were you
