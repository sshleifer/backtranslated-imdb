I saw him in a theater in 1982. I expected a stupid T & A movie. That is not what I got. <br /> <br /> It's basically three teenagers trying to have sex. We received the expected jokes and sex scenes, but, for once, they are quite fun! <br /> <br /> Yes, they are stupid, but I enjoyed them anyway. In addition, there was a surprising amount of male nudes. <br /> <br /> Then the movie, halfway through, takes a sudden dramatic turn when one of the children (played by Lawrence Monoson) falls in love with a girl. . Then the jokes stop and things get very dark. I will not reveal what happens, but I was very surprised by the sudden change in events. The film presents some very important topics and treats them in a realistic and intelligent way. And it has a truly heartbreaking ending. <br /> <br /> I give this a 10 because it is probably one of the best comedies / sex dramas for teenagers ever made. Mix fantasy and realism together and it works! What more can you ask? It also has a BIG soundtrack.
