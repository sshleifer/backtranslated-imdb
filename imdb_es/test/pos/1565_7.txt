At first glance of this movie, the angles of the camera make you think immediately that it is a low budget movie that bores you to tears or presses the stop button. Surprisingly, the story is presented and reproduced through the screen in a way that seems more related to me. I rated this movie at 7, but as most would, I felt it should be a 10, which you will understand as you watch it, because it is rare for a film to be in touch with people's feelings and how a television should show life. set. Most movies try to leave you amazed by their special effects, twists and turns, etc., this movie delivered a hand that showed a good movie backed by an Alabama style story that most would feel like a good loss of a couple of hours. I wish I had put the popcorn maker after all well done!
