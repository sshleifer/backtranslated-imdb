The film is about universal themes, without mentioning any specific country as its context: it could happen anywhere, and it has, in essence, if it does not form. Those concerned about the problems of the 1st Amendment, censorship, etc., but do not want to get bored with lectures, need art like this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire. <br /> <br /> Rickman is certainly an actor of little appreciated character; he shines in this movie, showing multiple acting talents that you must see (I have yet to see him give a bad performance, even in not so great movies). Stowe offers perhaps his best performance (and proves he has one of the most striking eyes of Hollywood), in two words: impressive, convincing. <br /> <br /> The set design fits perfectly to the situation, in function and mood. Sound editing increases to the appropriate effect. The total contrast transmitted through the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic device, and the welcome and the only respite to most of the necessary place in history. The script is strict and essential, with a dramatically attractive but realistic dialogue (that is, how it could be and should be). Perhaps the most surprising aspect to deal with is the fact that 1) this is the first time the director leaves; and 2) he is the writer. In one sentence: a tour de force, with three recommendations: see it, buy a copy, watch it repeatedly to unravel all its secrets and understand all its genius.
