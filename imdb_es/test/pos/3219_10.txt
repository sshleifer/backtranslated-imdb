I love this program! It's amazing ... I can never miss an episode, even if I've already seen it. The actors are perfect for the parties ...... I love the Gilmore girls! I've got all my friends to see it. even his parents see him now. I see it every day and I usually see it more than once a day. I wish my mother was like Lorelei. My friends say that I speak and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. It's a great show for teenagers because they actually learn by seeing it. My vocabulary has expanded upon seeing Gilmore Girls. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bled are perfect for the parts of Lorelei and Rory. I think Luke and Lorelai should get married because Chris has left Lorelei and Rory too many times. and it has broken Lorelei's heart too many times too.
