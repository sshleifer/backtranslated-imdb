And what is your gender? The backstage exposes the story; How is the theatrical life behind those Broadway curtains (and others) really? He certainly has a lot of competition: Singin 'in the Rain, both I and II (1929 and 1952), 42nd Street, Golddiggers of (Name the year). Ladies of 1934; Muffled noises (1992) from the ridiculous side and A Star is Born I and II from the 1930s and from the 50s from the tragic side: not to mention Summer Stock of 1950: the list keeps moving forward. So, what makes this movie so special? And why are there so few comments about this incredibly great movie? So few people have seen it? How amazing to see a young Frank Langella pre-Dracula and pre-Frost-Nixon for 30 years! How amazing to see the fresh and talented Tom Hulce before Amadeus! And yet another excellent Stiller! What a wonderful formation of talented people at their best for a long time! And such a script! Who was this David Shaber? So full of disillusions and realistic pathologies compared to the usual sentimentality and comedy to feel good! As demonstrated especially by the episode similar to Star-Is-Born, in which the heroine achieved Broadway, while the character of Langella has to be satisfied with another provincial tour. <br /> <br /> The subsequent hysterical and sadistic explosion of Langella against the star. The Latin teacher and his granddaughter in which he expresses his anger and frustration is just one of the many fantastic and psychologically real moments of the film. (The Latin teacher and his love affair with life behind the scenes certainly echo Marlene Dietrich and her seductive teacher in The Blue Angel of 1929). Another in the series of cold-hearted mercenary agents like Kevin McCarthy, who was preceded by Burt Lancaster in The Sweet. Smell of Success (1957) and succeeded Alan Alda in Clubland (2001) in the history of cinema. The sexual release of the character of Hulce recalls similar incidents in O'Neill's great comedy, Ah, Wilderness. <br /> <br /> And what a tribute to the disappeared operettas of yesteryear: Victor Herbert's red mill; Rose Marie and King Vagabond by Rudolf Friml; The Desert Song by Sigmund Romberg, etc. That satirical insertions of fragments of great works like Romeo and Juliet. Tributes to the theater itself as the star Langella showed. The richness and depth of this film are simply endless. And be saddled by such a title! Who could have an idea of ​​what this great movie is about such a ridiculous and insecure title? But on the other hand, what title could have been applied to a drama so magnificent that it could have lived up to its emotional content? <br /> <br /> PS: I just saw (2009) Frank Langella in his last article Acting Spectacular: Like Richard Nixon in Frost-Nixon. How this great actor after 30 years simply goes from triumph to triumph!
