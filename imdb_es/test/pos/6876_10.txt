When I know that Walter will never do another work. I was about 30 years old when I saw this sweet, endearing and blatantly romantic film. I loved it from the first scene and until the end. Art Carney was his artist. I usual fool; Glenda equaled Walter step by step in the wit, and Richard Benjamin gave the sarcastic voice of reason that he does it so well. Throughout the way many actors recognize, making their usual brilliance. There are a couple of lines in the movie that my SO and I have used over the years, but I will not say anything about them here. I'm pretty sure you'll know which one I'm talking about. Just get this movie. Make some popcorn, grab your squeeze (if he is as dumb as mine, for which I am grateful), and enjoy this outstanding romantic comedy of the 70s. You will not be disappointed. However, I have the feeling that I am preaching to the choir here because anyone who loves Walter will already have it. I'm very happy that it's on DVD now, finally.
