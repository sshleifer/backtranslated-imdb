I was very impressed with this movie, if only for the comedy. It may not be the most acute and funny humor at all times, but I found it appropriate for each scene. <br /> <br /> The flow of the film is certainly a bit confusing, sometimes almost confusing, but that is how the characters feel. Sometimes, we are seeing a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a speech decisive about relationships. This can be a little frustrating for certain viewers, but it brought me closer to the dilemmas of the characters' irregular chaos. <br /> <br /> The performance is great for everyone. I'm a big fan of Andy Richter, but I was not crazy on his part like everyone else seems to be. He did very well, but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show, both in their respective forms. Jay Mohr acts as expected, if you've seen him in other movies. I've always liked it <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very funny and offers some nice basics for some types of relationships. When it comes to questions and relationship problems, some movies try to surprise. There is nothing surprising in the conclusions offered here, but it is entertaining to see them revealed throughout the film.
