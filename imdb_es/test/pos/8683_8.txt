All I can say is that I expected a wick movie and "Blurry" surprised me positively. Very nice teen movie. All these kinds of situations are normal in school life, so all I can say is that all this reminded me of my school days and, sometimes, it's good to see this kind of movies, because they entertain us and travel to those golden years when we were young Also, guide us to think better about the way we should understand our children, because in the past we were like what we want to be in the present. Try this movie and you will be very pleased. At the same time, it will. Be assured that your time has not been wasted.
