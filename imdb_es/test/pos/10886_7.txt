This game has cartoon graphics, not much violence and really short levels. So why do people say it's so bright? Because it always catches your attention, captivates you and refuses to let you go. You will try for hours to try to find that damn flight recorder, try to figure out how to enter the room without alerting the guards, etc. The levels are short only when you know what to do; until you spend hours trying to find out where to find maps, where to find helicopters, etc. And you'll have fun while you do it! Well worth renting!
