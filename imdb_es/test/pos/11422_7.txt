This Stan Laurel comedy short is a cute little parody of the Valentino movie BLOOD AND SAND. If you've seen WEDDING AND SAND, then you'll probably appreciate this movie and you'll laugh at some of the scenes that make fun of Valentino's movie. However, if you have not seen that movie and you only see this movie, it probably will not impress you very much. Although I really liked the title cards, the word "bull" was used repeatedly in very funny ways. <Br /> <br /> Stanly plays "Vaselino", a bullfighter who seems quite silly and wins only because the bulls seem lazy and not aggressive. Even the bull at the end of the movie that supposedly killed ten men is obviously just a domesticated bull. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie in any sense of the imagination, but it's still a cute and harmless movie.
