The boy: at 39, Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy: he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes a lot of money. But everything has a cost, in this case there is no social life, there is no awareness and the fear of spending the rest of your life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way. <br /> <br /> While watching the movie, I was wondering why Disney did not pass this movie to Miramax, not because it is particularly daring or nervous, but because it is clearly an adult movie. This is compounded by the marketing campaign that is clearly aimed at children; is grouped with trailers for "Rugrats the Movie" and "Pokemon 2000" (are not they already gone?). But I mean. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the delicate treatment of the subject, instead of the typical middle-aged male crisis that involves a pathetic sap that buys a convertible Porsche and acts like an imbecile, the character of Willis commits himself Some serious introspection and takes stock of your life. His guide on this trip of self-discovery is himself at age 8 (they never explain how Rusty arrives and, frankly, I did not care). Young Rusty's innocence and unbridled optimism give him a clear advantage in guessing the truth. Summarize Russell's work as an image consultant: "You teach people to lie and pretend they are something they are not." However, for a good script to succeed, it needs the actors to give it life. No problem here. <br /> <br /> Although Willis has ignored W.C. Fields warnings about starring with children or animals with whom he has been lucky once again, combining as well with comedy as with Breslin as he did dramatically with Osment. Willis manages to balance the traits of Russell's agent of power with vulnerability and confusion, without becoming ridiculous. Breslin, on the other hand, gives death to the image of a childhood child of all, who always stood out for some reason and was chosen. We also have two extra presentations: Lily Tomlin is great as Russell's sensible assistant and Jean Smart is perfect as a charming and insightful host (I loved it in "Guinevere"). <br /> <br /> The Kid is lovely, heavy, and real. And it will attract adults of all ages.
