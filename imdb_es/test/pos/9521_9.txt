Beginning with a scene like "My name is Joe" in the races of Alcoholics Anonymous tBM in a crazy spiral of infidelity, double standards and clandestine affairs. But what do you expect from a family of lawyers? <br /> <br /> A genuinely fun movie, with some of the most extravagant characters from The Birdcage, the plot and the secondary plot are entwined with surreal scenes of decadent Parisian life. To a wedding banquet in the bathroom of Gentlemen where brides, grandmothers and their deranged people smoke drugs and make blue jokes? No, not me either!) That lead us to a final scene of almost Arcadic symbolism. <br /> <br /> Excellent.
