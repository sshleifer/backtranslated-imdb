I was impressed by this film because of the quality of the performance and the powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the role of a daring, irrational and possessive mother, who constantly gives her daughter the message that they should stay together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is doubtful, but at first she has no other choice: the bond with the mother is pathologically strong. <br /> <br /> With time, the girl sees that the mother throws herself into fantasy and does not have it. feet on the ground She sees her mother going madly for a handsome and seductive guy who loves them and leaves them. She sees that the mother does not understand it. So how can you look at your mother to guide her? <br /> <br /> The mother directs the girl to a drama test and sees the daughter representing the mother in such a way that a surprisingly painful mirror is held by the mother at night. This causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified by the impact on the mother and apologizes, but the lesson holds. <br /> <br /> There is a growth of character as the mother realizes her selfish demand on the daughter. And finally he is persuaded to let the girl go. It is a moving scene and a valuable lesson that parents, regardless of their emotional dependence, should let the child go and become their own separate person.
