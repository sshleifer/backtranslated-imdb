House of Dracula was made towards the end of Universal's horror cycle in the 1940s and I have seen it a couple of times. <br /> <br /> A mad doctor, Edelman is growing plants for a serum that heals people. Count Dracula arrives for a cure for his vampirism and then Lawrence Talbot comes to see if he can cure him so he does not become a werewolf with the full moon. The monster of Frankenstein is discovered and Edelman brings it back to life just as the villagers descend to the castle and set it on fire. Talbot, now healed and one of Edelman's assistants is safe. <br /> <br /> Like many other movies of this type, we have a hunchback assistant and a thunderstorm to keep him moving. <br /> <br /> The cast includes the horror horror Universal Lon Chaney Jr. (The Wolf Man), John Carradine (House of Frankenstein) and Glenn Strange as the monster of Frankenstein. Also starring Onslow Stevens (Them!), Lionel Atwill (The Vampire Bat) and Martha O'Driscoll. <br /> <br /> House of Dracula is a must see for all the old terror fans. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
