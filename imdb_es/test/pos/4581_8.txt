One can not help but admire Mike Judge for his hands on the "I've experienced that" approach. With "Office Space," almost anyone who works at a job could associate with the characters. "Idiocracy" has exactly the same feeling. One can easily appreciate the 505 years of subsequent experience of our heroes, because again, the director has tried to put things on a very human level. Something similar to "Sleeper" by Woody Allen, this movie is very funny. Do not miss the deleted scenes as the "Museum Of Fart" is a classic. Imaginative comedy is a rarity, and "Idiocracy" is tremendously imaginative, extremely fun and a solid 8.0 cinematic experience. - MERK
