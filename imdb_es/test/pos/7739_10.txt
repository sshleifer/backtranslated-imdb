What will Prospero be in the twentieth century, what is his life? Why would a man have to choose to live on an island with his daughter and girlfriend? Because it is too difficult to live and love in good conditions in "civilization". This man (John Cassavetes) is a giant with a broken heart, he can command the storm. He has the power, the strength but he is human. The deep love of life is the theme of this extraordinary film. The acting is incredible, all the genius of John Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands, Vittorio Gasman and Shakespeare and Paul Mazursky, of course. Do not miss it, it will be a mistake. This movie is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. And I've seen many movies.
