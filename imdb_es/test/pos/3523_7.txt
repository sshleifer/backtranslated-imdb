The mountainous forests, happy young campers, a warning from a park ranger and a lurking figure. The ingredients are there for a treat of terror, and director / co-author Jeff Lieberman does an adequate job to achieve it. It's a horror to the forest, but for the most part the execution is at the top of the game and the story (which is pretty basic in a cut-off sense) is told with some realism. Perhaps a little more exposure would not have been diverted, but Lieberman's craft compensates for the flaws of the material and the typical details with increasing tension, sullen images and a suffocating atmosphere created by Brad Fiedel's persistently ominous punctuation. Every time that very creepy whistle was heard, it had a truly disconcerting sense that was set in the beautiful backdrop. The directors of photography Dean M. and Joel King also do an amazing job. Styles abound, even with minimal reach and accumulation is slow. Sometimes, the rhythm can become a matter of stopping and leaving. It is not particularly violent, but there is still a clear average streak even if some of that happens on the screen. The last scenes of persecution and growing fear are well done, as the darkness comes to life with its assassins and adorable, and actor George Kennedy riding his white horse in a slight but wonderful twist. There are a lot of nice performances; Deborah Benson is a strong and elegant heroine. Gregg Henry, Chris Lemmon, Ralph Seymour, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin and Katie Powell complete a modest cast of credible installments. The final climax is quite twisted, but the ending is one of those guys that leaves you thinking. "Is that so?" <br /> <br /> A well-engraved slasher backwoods article, which probably plays a little too safe to really differentiate it from the norm.
