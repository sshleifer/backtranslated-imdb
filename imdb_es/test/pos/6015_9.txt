and I, for my part, think that's good. I've never been a Rosalind Russell fan, although the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and I loved knowing that she was doing this. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the production, I think it was a little less than the original movie. One of my favorite secondary characters in the original was Mazeppa with his garabatosas nails on the board. "HEY! It takes more than any talent to be a Strippah!" and although I missed it, I was glad to see that the producers had the guts not to make a paper copy. <br /> <br /> I also liked the fact that there are large portions of this movie that were filmed as if you were watching a stage, it feels like you're in the theater, not just at the movies. <br /> <br /> I think the other thing that I liked about this production was that there seemed to be a little less repetition of the song "Let me entertain you", which becomes completely annoying after the fifth time you listen to it.
