Synopsis: Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) is alone in a carriage, dropping into a desert land, in what seems the last stop of his trip. He does not know how he got there, but a welcome sign has been erected. After momentarily reflecting on his whereabouts, he is received by a man who takes him to his new life. Then he enters a different world from the one he came from. <br /> <br /> As Andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant, he feels that his environment is a bit too uniform for his taste. When he takes his first lunch, he instantly realizes that everyone in the city is walking in gray suits. On this same day, he sees a businessman killed in some fencing spines, of what appears to be an act of suicide. The strange thing is that the people of the city do not pay attention to this horrible act and walk as if it never happened. It is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitized, and their ability to distinguish between anything human or inhuman is absent. <br /> <br /> To help Andreas settle, he is invited to go out with his co-workers to a local nightclub. The club seems to be one step away from being as exciting as a night of bingo ... and while Andreas drinks his sorrows, he realizes that no matter how much he drinks, alcohol has no effect on him. While he tells these observations to a stranger in the men's room, a man in a toilet cubicle begins to utter words that have been in Andreas' mind all the time. When he realizes that this man is thinking what he is, he follows him to his house and notes where he lives for future references. The plot evolves predictably with Andreas who wants an escape. Look for the man who once followed ... hoping to take him back to being human again ... but is it too late? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: this Norwegian movie is something everyone should see, since it has the answer to the big question! What is the meaning of life? (well, close enough) The film outlines the dark realities of what has become the working man (or woman) of today. Its sole purpose is to make people realize that life is too short to be materialistic. Try to show that small clich√©s, like the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because the moment you stop listening to that sound, it is the moment when you are one step away from becoming a robot. The end of the film reiterates what happens when it is too late to escape the mundane routine to which you have become accustomed. Start adopting the saying 'if it's not broken, do not fix it', and you feel too comfortable to risk changing. <br /> <br /> Although this film should not be taken as a piece of realism ... its message is more than real. The lack of empathy transmitted in the film, and the one that Andreas sees, is a bold statement of what life can become. The director, Jens Lien, has prepared a film that, in any other direction, would have failed. This is an excellent piece of cinematographic genius, and I look forward to seeing what it does next. <br /> <br /> The main role, played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag, is perfectly interpreted. Representing the average Joe, Trond provides a good catalyst to make this image very comical. The supporting actors also do a good job, and for some reason, I think Keanu Reeves would have been perfect in this movie, since most of the support cast required that his performance be emotionless. <br /> <br /> The score For this movie was very well composed. The recurring theme was always a pleasure to listen to, and it provided a very somber but cozy feeling to the film. <br /> <br /> The release date in the UK for May 25, 2007, I will definitely go To relive this experience on the big screen. This movie has made its way into my top 10 ... now it's fast becoming my top 20! It has some shocking scenes, and it's in dark humor along ... IT MUST SHOULD !!
