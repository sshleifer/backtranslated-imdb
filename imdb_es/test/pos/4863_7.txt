There are times when you do not want those deep dramatic series. When you do not want series with heavy stories or a need to watch each episode to be able to endure. There are times when you just want to see a simple series, with lots of action and great characters. For those moments, you have Cleopatra 2525. <br /> <br /> I was one of those who really enjoyed Charlie's Angels. Critics said it was superficial and silly. But the thing is that that is the point! People who can not relax and expected a serious movie, hated it. It's exactly the same with Cleopatra 2525. It's superficial. It has silly and unrealistic characters. And that's why I like it. It's not like any other series. <br /> <br /> The first season was not very good. Cleo's character was irritating and a bit too much. The story was a little loose and you did not know much about the characters. But hey, they only had 20 minutes in each episode. <br /> <br /> In the last 5-6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the series 40 full minutes. And it was here that I started to love him. The series finally began to grow into a very qualitative series. Too bad they had to cancel the series. Because the last episodes of Cleopatra 2525 were actually very good. I will never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. Unique characters that only the creators of Xena could have created!
