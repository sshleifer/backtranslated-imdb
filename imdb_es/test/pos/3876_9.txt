Team A keeps repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800 hours) and I still see it! I do not like the A-Team ... I absolutely adore them! It's great to see Justin chase the former members of A-Team. It brings back memories of the old days, when I was young and sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but it seems that Justin is chasing the former members of Team A on his own. Of course, that's the only bad thing about this documentary. Too bad that Justin does not look for Melinda Culea ("Amy A. Allen"). But it's great to see Mr. T. back in action. Pity for him, it does not appear at the party, at the end. But that party is too short to laugh again and to see everyone in action again.
