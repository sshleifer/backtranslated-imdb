I recently rented Twister, a movie I had seen several years ago on television, and it has aged well; I found myself laughing out loud several times and, strange as these people are, in the end I worried deeply about them. This is the kind of small movie that is made for a cult audience because, rather like Howdy's gazpacho (well, I think that's what it is), it's an acquired taste: you have to be in tune with its peculiar length cool. The values ​​of production can be called charitably low cost and the rhythm and atmosphere take a while to establish, but the film has an "aspect", especially in some wonderful shots that contrast the dry flatness of the earth with the opulence of the nouveau of the cluttery nouveau. Interior of the mansion: Michael Almereyda had a good eye even then. Life with sodapop mogul Eugene Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton) and his family (two grown children, a grandson and a housekeeper) seems to be as far from life as we could be in Gormenghast. Everyone in this movie is wonderful (especially Suzy Amis and Crispin Glover as the unaddressed geniuses of brothers Maureen and Howdy), who occupy their roles so comfortably after a time that they only buy the strange premise, which somehow survived the tornado and apparently are unable to do so. Happiness, these people are lucky and yet they do not know what to do with their luck. There are some really great scenes: the sudden confrontations of Eugene first with his girlfriend Virginia (the childish television actress of gold digging, Lois Chiles), and then with her children; William S. Burroughs conducted shooting practice in the barn and told a story about a mysterious Jim; Maureen's boyfriend, Chris proving himself fighting a shed full of wasps wrapped in a tablecloth and rug and old fedora; Howdy, Violet, Maureen, and Chris, all sitting on the couch (the last three in appropriately light summer clothes, the first in a red blazer and a black leather outfit) contemplating images of the deserts on the huge television, and contemplating the future (the images were made by Bill Viola, who made the installation of background video for the last tour of Nine Inch Nails). Crispin Glover is predictably magnificent as Howdy: as always, he is still a perfect character. Howdy has done a cult to his misery and brilliance; It's like Oscar Wilde from Kansas, struggling to live up to his red velvet suit. It is fascinating. Whether you're hitting an electric guitar without shaving but at the same time, cracking a large-sized guitar while wearing a completely black cowboy outfit, demolishing a room, or even doing simple things like driving or pouring the aforementioned soup from a Blender jar, it's fascinating. If you like your work, you will like this.
