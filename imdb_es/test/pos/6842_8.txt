I found this movie recently after so much time of listening to it. It is an excellent non-pretentious film for people who love literature and film noir movies. Not "camping" but humorous. <br /> <br /> GREAT CAST! From the magnificent Carla Gugino and Emma Thompson to the German superstar Til Schweiger, this film is a feast for the eyes. Alan Rickman is very funny as the antagonist of the gang. I would love to see a spin-off movie with this character and Emma Thompson resolving cases and discussions between them all the time (like Tracy and Hepburn, etc.) <br /> <br /> Intelligent story, nice turns and scope photography (gift Do not look unless it's a scope, since the compositions are very rich. <br /> <br /> Sexy sexy, sexy and very funny. <br /> <br /> The best use of Just Like Heaven by The Cure never (must see to believe!) <br /> <br /> ********
