Bill, Jeremy Theobald, is an inspiring writer who has not published anything yet. Bill also has a strange and strange habit, he likes to follow people. <br /> <br /> Bill chooses a stranger in the dining room on the street or in the subway, and follows them as if he were his shadow. Maybe Bill does this to help him inspire himself to write the great novel he's been dreaming about or get an article from his publication in a major magazine? Maybe it's because it fills Bill's lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity become a face among the multitude of meaning and substance by paying attention to him? Or maybe he gives Bill someone to take care of, worry about and be responsible in addition to himself? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone: after following him to his home or place of work, he stops doing it. <br /> <br /> One day Bill follows Cobb, Alex Haw, to his house and, instead of following his rule to stop, he still follows Cobb. Bill will soon realize how much reason he had with that rule that he proposed to himself to follow people and, at the same time, how wrong he was to break it. <br /> <br /> Incredibly good low budget movie made by Christopher Noland in 1998 before he triumphed in Hollywood with his classic and innovative classic "Moment", two years later, which has already become one of the main cult movie. <br /> <br /> "Follow" is actually a much better movie than "Moment" because it is a conventional story and easy to follow. Compared to "Moment" that was at first confusing and then, when you realize what the movie is telling you in its history is very complicated. What makes "Follow" much better is that it is simple, but at the same time it is intelligent in its effect on those who see it. The film is much more direct and devastating, and you do not have to see it again and again to get what I was trying to tell you as it did "Moment." "Next" is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising and manipulated endings, if you watch the movie again and note the clues you will see once. <br /> <br /> Made with an incredibly small budget of $ 6,000.00, that's less than most Hollywood movies take advantage of for breaks, with an unnamed cast in black and white and a little more than one hour, 71 minutes. Hollywood, as well as the film industry outside of Hollywood, can learn a lot from Chris Noland about how someone with nothing but talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can not; Make a smart and at the same time penetrating film with almost no money and no big stars.
