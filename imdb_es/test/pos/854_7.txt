This was a surprisingly very good movie, and an interesting idea. However, it was a bit disappointing in the sense that 'Twist' was a bit too predictable and a bit too early in the movie. As I watched it, it began to be a bit strange and confusing to the point that, the only reasonable result possible was the inevitable twist of the plot, but it certainly did not ruin the flow of movies. There were excellent performances, there was never a boring and boring moment, so it is worth seeing. It kept me interested until the end, and for me there are not many movies that can do that these days. I highly recommend people to see this great little movie.
