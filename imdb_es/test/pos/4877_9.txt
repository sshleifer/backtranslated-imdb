I saw SEA OF DUST as part of a screening audience in New York several years ago. I enjoyed the movie at that time, so I was a bit confused by some of the amendments that had been made since then. Maybe it's my memory, but it seems that fragments of exposition of the version that was shown at the Rhode Island Film Festival are missing. I'm really not sure which version I prefer, but I can honestly say that I found something to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Let me start by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie. Although it has been promoted as a tribute to Hammer Films, people expecting a confrontation between Van Helsing and Dracula will be very disappointed. There is some cleavage, but no nudity (a staple of later films from the British production house). And while SEA OF DUST is full of beautiful sweet eyes (it really is filmed like a movie from the sixties), and presents Hammer star Ingrid Pitt, it's not like any of the company's images in tone or execution. This movie is very dark, very confusing and (sometimes) very funny. I do not remember that the previous version was as crazy as this, but that's not a bad thing (especially the confrontation in the Black Forest that is played as a short of the Three Stooges). And some of Ms. Pitt's statements are quite entertaining. It is as if someone had tangled and loosed it. <br /> <br /> However, the uniqueness of this film does not lie in the details provided. It is in the ideas. As an occasional spectator of the science fiction channel, I regularly take the task of the network for its variations of a note in a theme (the CGI monster kills, then it is destroyed). SEA OF DUST is so full of ideas that you start to stumble upon them after a while. <br /> <br /> But do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. In any case, I applaud these guys for making such an entrepreneurial image of low budget and for having the courage to package it with so many concepts. It's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think about movies (you know who you are). But for the rest of us, those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror movies, predictability, lack of respect for the public, this may be their ticket.
