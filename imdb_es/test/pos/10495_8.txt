This was the movie that first told me what a great actor Martin Sheen really is. Modestly states that Charlie is a better actor, Charlie can not hold a candle. <br /> <br /> I found it full of suspense and I really enjoyed the interrelation of the love story with the main plot (and I usually hate love stories). There is a big twist in the plot at the end that I found totally believable, especially in the period of the early 80's, and probably now as well. <br /> <br /> The final scene had me on the edge of my seat. This film illustrates in a round manner that betrayal is often shared by those we trust, while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect, and finally, human compassion can be found where we least expect it. <br /> <br /> irenerose
