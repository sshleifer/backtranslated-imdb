Daffy Duck has posters hanging from every inch of every available tree that announces it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it, it's really the duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he is the only hunter foolish enough to fall in love with the gag. <br /> <br /> He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny approaches him and asks how the rabbit hunt is going, Elmer admits he has not seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can handle. He comes out of hiding and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. "Shoot him now!" Daffy screams. "Shut up," says Bugs. "He does not have to shoot you now." Daffy insists that yes. <br /> <br /> After Daffy returns the peak to his head, he is doomed to more arguments infected with "pronoun problems", which have the same result. Later, Bugs dresses like a sexy woman and flirts asks Elmer for a duck dinner. Will Daffy have the last laugh? "Ha ha, very funny! Ha ha ha!" <br /> <br /> What's funny about this classic cartoon? The insect recoils in fear as Daffy screams in his face. Bugs Bunny says "Yes?" While dripping with self satisfaction. Daffy Duck stands on tiptoe to be shot. Elmer Fudd complains that "he can not wait for anyone else". Daffy sees bugs in women's clothes and makes that little noise with his tongue. Carl Stalling plays "You must have been a beautiful baby" during the act of dragging Bugs. Daffy demands "pure honesty" from Bugs. Stalling plays "Home Sweet Home" at an appropriate inappropriate time. Daffy tells Bugs that he is "indisputable". <br /> <br /> In five words: every detail of this movie. <br /> <br /> NOTE: This short is available in "Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume One," Disc 1
