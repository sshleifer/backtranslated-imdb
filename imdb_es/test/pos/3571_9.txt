'Bluff' has been showing up for a few months in theaters in Bogotá, and today I've finally seen it. I really did not know what to expect, but I was very surprised. It is a criminal comedy of the same class as Snatch, etc., and manages to balance well the elements of suspense with comedy. The style of the film was established early with cheerful music and the Argentine narrator who moves directly to the camera, for the first time, but then fits naturally. <br /> <br /> With my little less perfect Spanish I still found the plot and dialogue easy enough to follow, and much of the comedy is situational. My Colombian girlfriend was laughing a lot at the various representations of people from different regions and social classes that happened to me, but for example a well-acted representation of a pompous idiot in a position of power is funny in any language. br /> <br /> I think it's a merit of this film that has a global flavor: they often did not remind me that I was watching Colombia. However, it is important to bear in mind that many rich Bogota residents live like some of the characters in this film, and it is not a misleading description of Bogotá or Colombian society, only a selective description *, like any movie. supposedly portraying a "real" situation / culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know what part of the comedy would be lost in the subtitles, but if it's your country, definitely go check it out: it's a very clever and nice movie with great elements of black humor. And all in a 90-minute package.
