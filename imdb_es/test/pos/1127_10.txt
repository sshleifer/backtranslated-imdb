I love this program. I hate it when it reaches the end of the season because it seems it will be forever until the season starts again! I have followed this program from its pilot program to the end, from where Rusty starts college and I see Casey, his sister, where he is now dating Dana. I love this program. I can not wait until Monday night! I'm also so happy that Cappie and Casey finally got back together that it was driving me crazy! As for Evan and Rebecca, I hope they come together again, which feels like they are at the end. I just looked for him in the main part of the cast and I'm so surprised that Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) is the daughter of Kelsey Grammar! That surprises me very much and the other thing that is a big surprise is that she was born the same year as me and that she was born on the date of birth of my little brother with my year and had been watching her all the time and no clue! !
