One of the greatest successes of the independent advancement of The Decline of Western Civilization, filmmaker Penelope Spheeris, is that it may attract non-punk fans in terms of hardcore. And most importantly, it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely "market-worthy", when bands played (or, at least, tried to play in some cases) in dirty, damp clubs for a public that had both self-esteem because they had respect for the bands. For fans, like me, there are beautiful interviews with some of the quasi-legends of LA punk-scum, some dead, others still alive and working on the scene. <br /> <br /> The presentations and interviews include themes like The Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag (in the days before Henry Rollins), Catholic Discipline, Fear, Alice Band Band and more memorable (in my opinion) ) being the germs. While he knew of some of the bands and artists in the film (The Jerks and Black Flag mostly), he had only heard rumors about the lead singer (the deceased) Darby Crash, and from the images in the film it seems to be one Of the, if not the, epitomes of the punk movement. He does not take himself too seriously, he loves to drink, sometimes when he speaks it is complete nonsense, and the attitude he presents on stage is fun and in a free and stimulating way. Such an artist would probably scare Steve Miller and Jackson Browne so they would not see them. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Decline of Western Civilization does not activate all the non-punk fans who are looking for this movie (it is difficult to find it in a video), but neither should it necessarily turn them off. As a kind of anthropologist who has sneaked into the party, Spheeris shows the behavior of these people, their motives, their likes and dislikes, and the power that their characters had on and off the screen. Some of them almost come out of the normal, others do not, but they are only offensive to those who are not too open to things. On top of that, the movie is a must-see for the kind of kids who think they're punk fans just because they listen to Good Charlotte and Blink-182: if you want to get the most accurate information about the movement and the Rock genre you profess love, give the pioneers a chance.
