One of my favorite westerns and one of the best of John Ford in my opinion. There are no major stars, but Ben Johnson shines on almost everything that appears, and here he gets a rare advantage as the title character. Like him, he finds Ward Bond as the crusty old Mormon who leads his people westward. John Ford's character actor group, which includes Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provides broad support, as does the mysterious James Arness, a member of the outlawed Clegg clan who joins the train of wagons. The path of the Mormons to Utah was one of the most arduous and demanding companies that has ever been undertaken. We can not really feel that, but we do see evidence that the pioneers had to overcome on the way to the west; River crossings, long stretches of dry desert without water, encounters with Indians and similar people, all ready for a glorious song of the Sons of the Pioneers. The Mormons actually dug sections of the trail with picks and shovels, as shown in the movie. What I regret most is that it was not made in color, but I think there is a colored version. By the way, those steep rocks that appear in several scenes are called the Fisher Towers, located near Moab. Highly recommended visualization.
