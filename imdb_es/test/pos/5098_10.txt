I love this movie because every element of it is nothing short of excellent. I will quickly praise some of them. Peter O'Toole gives us one of his great performances by becoming the definitive Mr. Chips. Petula Clark, has a beautiful voice and is perfect as Katharine. The director was able to bring the story to the screen in a new and fresh way. Combine that with the fantastic and creative cinematography, editing, writing, etc., and you will have a movie that shows the excellent quality of your production. I can not praise the well-planned work of the camera, it moves us from one place to another, it brings us closer and it distances us, it gives us the best views and allows the locations to become part of the scene. Petula Clark's last song 'YOU AND I' is just 3 beautifully composed long shots, and in this 2-shot era, I can appreciate the extra care that everyone involved had to give to make those long scenes perfect. The music is great, and the songs move the story as they should. Leslie Bricusse is one of my favorite composers. Listen to these songs, how could someone not like it? This is a very romantic story between two people who are close to middle age, they get the best out of each one and last until the end of their lives. The excellent production values, acting, camera work and music make it worth watching this movie.
