Crossfire is a fantastic black cinema that is as much a product of its time as a timeless classic. This film accomplishes this by addressing the problems that have not been presented on the screen before its release in 1947, and being a high quality film that remains to this day with a good script, great looks and fantastic performances from its actors. The first American film that addresses the issue of anti-Semitism, Crossfire is based on a classic position. Set in post-World War II America, a scandal develops after the murder of a Jewish man. <br /> <br /> The story is great, its anti-hate theme wrapped in a dark thriller and crime film of various characters, and next to the angle of anti-Semitism there are also some great dialogues and themes after the Second War World. Unlike other mystery thrillers, the audience is alerted to who the author is almost immediately. However, the story of the film remains fascinating due to the struggle of all the great characters involved who are going through trying to make sense of the situation. Outside of the big general story and the themes, the entire script is simply intelligent, complete with meaningful messages and sharp exchanges between characters. <br /> <br /> The captivating story of the film unfolds wonderfully for its excellent cast. Robert Young is fantastic as Capt. Finlay, the principal investigator of the murder case. Finlay is my favorite character in the movie, he's just a great character, dry as a bone and hard as a two-for-four and without stopping at all to take the murderer to justice. Robert Mitchum is also great in the film, very much alive in his character as a soft-spoken army sergeant due to his excellent screen presence. Gloria Grahame offers a memorable performance in her small Oscar-nominated role; George Cooper also does a good job as Corporal Mitchell sick and anguished; Paul Kelly gives a mysterious image of a strange character; and Steve Brodie, Sam Levene, Jacqueline White and William Phipps also give strong supporting performances. Robert Ryan ends up being the most talked about actor in the film, with a chilling performance like Montgomery and also an Oscar nominee. <br /> <br /> Crossfire looks amazing. The director Edward Dmytryk does an extraordinary job with the execution of the film and the director of photography J. Roy Hunt does a masterful work with his image in black and white. The image of Crossfire is as dark and damp as his subjects, covered in the shade with a tone almost brilliant, but also very crude in parts. Ironically, the great appearance of the film was not the result of hard work, or even an intention. Dmytryk wanted to spend more time and money on the actors than on the lighting, so that's what he did. Less lights, less preparation (around a 6-hour work day), and it turned out to be a fantastic movie. Not only is it a well-made cinematographic work of art, Crossfire is also a great example of a cheap movie that ends up being a rich classic.
