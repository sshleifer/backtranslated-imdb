This extravagant Troma movie is actually a very good movie. It is known as its epic and better and better qualified production. His version of Shakespeare's play is extremely funny with Troma's usual dose of nudity and blood. Troma has made some very good gore movies, one of my favorites is "Street Trash" and, of course, the Toxic Avenger movies. I have a Troma movie, "Terror Firmer", which has a reputation as its most horrible and nasty movie. I enjoyed "Tromeo and Juliet" so much that I finally need to see "Terror Firmer". This is a collector's version of 2 discs with four comments and many features. "Tromeo y Julieta" is an absolute success and highly recommended.
