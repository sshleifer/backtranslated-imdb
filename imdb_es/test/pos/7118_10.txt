I do not play video games at all, but my children do. <br /> <br /> I have great satisfaction with this. I would like to see more of this type of film. "Very cool", as my youngest son would say. <br /> <br /> The interesting characters and the general plot was interesting. Like I said, I do not play video games, but I think my kids would love this. It was not full of bad words and that's a nice change. This visual concept was different and it caught my attention. Also, the sound track was pretty good. I could even try some of the games that my children play to watch because of this movie. Who knows, maybe one day I will be a player.
