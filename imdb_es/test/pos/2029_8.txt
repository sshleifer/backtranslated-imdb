What to say about a movie like Rock Star? A lot really! This is the kind of film that is almost made to order for critics to criticize. It is also a film that, as the MAJOR LOVE of Hard Rock, I enjoyed - I did not really love it - while at the same time we are very aware of its many flaws and the film, while a decent effort in some aspects lost the opportunity to do what. Escape to greatness and become a rock classic. Oh, well ... <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, and I would watch it again and again, but I know it is based exclusively on my personal tastes: Rock Star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of rock or hard rock lifestyle and want to go the way of nostalgia. It was a great moment for the metal heads. And it's good to have a film that effectively captures that time (forgotten for a long time by many fans who are not rock), as I think Rock Star has done. That is one of the strengths of the film, the images of the concert. You will feel like you are there with them and how could a hard rock fan not love that? As for the creation of the atmosphere, Rock Star gets a 10 out of 10. It also receives a 10 out of 10 for pure entertainment. If you want a movie to simply get carried away and flow freely into some of the great memories of good old days, then this is the movie for you. It is also the reason why I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> But it's not a great movie. I understand that and if my real job was to review movies professionally, I would probably have to be a little hard on this one. The problem with Rock star is the development of the character. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with the development of the character is that there is none. Any. The film has certain scenes, few and far between, but they ARE there, they do touch the greatness: WARNING SHORT SCENE SPOILERS: 3 examples- 1) when Izzy makes his stage debut (including the fall he takes) <br / > <br /> 2) The first "after show" party with Emily (Anniston and Izzy). <br /> <br /> 3) Go back a bit: at the beginning, when the original lead singer is fired (dismissed) casually. All the "business as usual" tone sets the stage for what is to come. It is played very effectively. <br /> <br /> But the problem is that nothing ever comes. There is little or no character development of anyone in this movie, people of people are simply mentioned, but never fully explored. I do not think it's the fault of the actors / actresses, especially Anniston, who tries hard, just does not give them much to work with. It's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the feeling of "formula" towards the true depth of the film. The rock star was so sugary at times (even towards the end) that it was almost ridiculous. And yet, those scenes that I mentioned WERE outstanding and very credible, unfortunately much more in the film were not. <br /> <br /> Another critic mentioned the lack of accumulation towards the end and I agree, but in reality there was a lack of accumulation about anything. WHY is Izzy going at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band does not let him write songs? Test the limits of credibility. And, frankly, the ending was corny. It did not make any sense and had no reality at all. <br /> <br /> Seeing this, it's almost like watching a movie where the creators of it said: OK, this happens here and then this happens and then this, etc., etc. In the end, it is no longer a film about a child whose dream came true, it is just another very formulated love story. And he wonders why so many details are omitted ... <br /> <br /> I hope I'm not so hard on Rock Star because I really loved it, but not for the right reasons. I would have liked to love this as a great movie about the ups and downs of rock fame. On the other hand, I loved it because of its feeling of the 80s, clothes, hair, lights, life ... Although many others loved it, I suspect that most of them are people who lived the life of a fanatic rock, like me or some who play I would have liked to see the film cross and be respected for being a good well told film, instead of a clich√©. I think one of the problems was the length. Myself, I hate long films, but this was one that really should have been longer, if a movie is really good, the length is not even felt, the story is too much for it to be as short as it was - that's a of the reasons why there does not seem to be much development of the story or of the human beings portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> So, to finish, this is a movie you can get into. - But it's not a great movie. Watch it for fun. See it for fun. Look at it to go back to that great, great space in time in which metal was not just a part of life, it was life, and for those who are not rock fans, we'll see to take a look at a life that means and it still means a lot to many of us.
