This was one of the best movies you could find as a child. I lived with The Chipmunk Adventure from 4 years to 8 years. The story of this movie was: Dave goes on a business trip to Europe and sticks to the guys with Miss Miller. While playing in the video game Around the World in 80 Days, two villains, Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister), make Chipmunks and Chipettes an adventure in which children must fly in a hot air balloon around the world. What they do not know is that the "game" is really a diamond smuggling ring. And when the villains meet them at the airport, a chase ensues! And what ends up in Klaus and Claudia outside the jail and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor are safe with Dave and Miss Miller. But now I warn you, this is a musical and pretty good at that. Most people hate musicals, but I'm not one of those people, I'm a fan of love musicals like Rocky Horror, Grease, Sound of Music, Cats Do not Dance and almost anything (except My Fair Lady ). If you see this, share with your children (if you have any)!
