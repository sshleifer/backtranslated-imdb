Hello to all Denver fans! <br /> <br /> I could not agree more with you! This show was great and cute, I saw it when I was a kid in the late 80's. Among Denver there are other favorites too, like Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. Now I am 24 years old, but it is still one of my favorite shows and my favorite cartoon of the 80s. It brings back all the memories. The melody of the song was also great, I get goosebumps every time I listen to it. It's sad that it lasted so little time, but it's still a firm favorite. It's great that he is not alone and that there are people who also liked him. This is one of the cartoon shows that I will keep for future generations. <br /> <br /> Live Denver! :)
