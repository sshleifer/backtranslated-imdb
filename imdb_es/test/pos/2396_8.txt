Without a doubt, the independent film Eddie Monroe is one of the best independent films I've seen in a long time. The highlight for me was the performance of Paul Vario. The first time I saw Paul, or "Big Paulie", as he was called in Danny Provenzano's independent film, "This Thing Of Ours". Fortunately, the filmmaker "Eddie Monroe" did the same and used the undeniable skills of Paul in a role of principle (main?). An action emerged (in the camera and the use of voice-over) that shows large-budget studio functions in the very near future. It is comforting to see an actor trained and committed to the trade, demonstrate the same to the audience. Keep up the good work Big Paulie and we'll see you in Hollywood very soon! Not bad for a kid from Canarsie, huh?
