Emanuele Crialese wrote and directed "Nuovomondo (2006)" (which is shown in the US as "The Golden Gate"). This movie is different, and I think it's better than most films about impoverished people who leave Europe and come to the United States. <br /> <br /> The film begins with scenes in a poor and rural region of Sicily. We always hear that Sicily is a rocky island, but you really will not understand the implications of that phrase until you see the first half hour of "The Golden Gate". <br /> <br /> The central section of the film is dedicated to the long journey to the USA. UU Most of the immigration movies show us ten minutes of people in the third class section getting dizzy and then showing us the Statue of Liberty. Not this movie: we have an idea of ​​life under cover, and it's not charming. (Actually, we do not see the Statue of Liberty either). <br /> <br /> Finally, the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of Ellis Island, and then the immigrants will walk along the Lower East Side of New York. Not here: the experience of Ellis Island occupies approximately one third of the images. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Amato stands out as Salvatore Mancuso, who brings his two sons and his mother to the new world. Charlotte Gainsbourg is just as good as Lucy Reed, a mysterious Englishwoman who also speaks fluent Italian. <br /> <br /> There are some strange touches in the movie, especially the soundtrack with songs by Nina Simone. There must be some symbolism there, but I could not understand it. <br /> <br /> Another critic has already pointed out that this movie will look better in a cinema than in a DVD. Still, on large or small screen, it's worth looking for.
