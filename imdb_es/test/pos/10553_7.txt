I have a problem with the film snobs who consider that Americans are semi - literate and not able to appreciate the subtlety of the most sophisticated Europeans, the Francais, the Italiens ... almost anyone of whom English is a language foreign If the humor in "My father the hero" is different from that of "Mon Pere ce heros" it is because the French sense of humor is different from that of the Americans. It's not better, it's not "smarter", it's different. If you think it's ridiculous for Hollywood to "borrow" from French cinema, consider how much French cinema borrowed from Hollywood in the first place. Where would Belmondo and Delon have been without Bogart? Truffaut without Hitchcock? Jerry Lewis - not known for his subtle and cerebral style, is idolized in France. Figure ... Monsieur Depardieu is exceptionally good as the hapless father divorced from a precocious 14-year-old daughter who is on vacation in the Bahamas. Unknowingly, he introduces him to the other people in the hotel as his mistress, so that it becomes more interesting for a child he has an interest in. It is not surprising that complications arise. There are "hommages" to "Green Card" and "Cyrano de Bergerac" entertained in a fun way and M.Depardieu accompanies him very well. He makes a good impression of Maurice Chevaler with "Thank Heaven for little girls", which is actually funny and quite moving for his audience, all of whom believe that he is the lover of a 14-year-old girl, gets up and leaves two by the way. - Two while walking away, happily unaware of what is happening. When he turns around at the end of the song to recognize the expected applause, the expression on his face is priceless. Without him, the movie would be very normal. With its huge clutter figure that dominates the screen is very fun. Without pectorals, or six packages, only a true human being of a human type. Amazing!
