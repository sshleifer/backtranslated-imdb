<br /> <br /> Emilio Est√©vez takes the wonderful work HOMEFRONT and turns it into an attractive film. <br /> <br /> THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally strong cast, all apparently deepening in their characters. The performance here is TOP NOTCH! <br /> <br /> The credit must also go to the director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between the past and the present were ultra smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and were effectively added to the tension. <br /> <br /> Eliminate all elements of Viet Nam from history, and there were still interesting characters who struggle with the good and the bad of the world. Full range of family dynamics. (A viewer can see this point more clearly considering the "discover the old photo" scene from the beginning while watching the rest of the film). <br /> <br /> As a movie, I found THE WAR AT HOME to be more direct and to the point that I WAS BORN ON JULY 4TH. A good effort - almost a 10. <br /> <br />
