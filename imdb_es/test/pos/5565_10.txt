I have to tell you that I've been a Star Trek TNG fan since I was a kid. <br /> <br /> Well, some time ago I gave a friend of mine some episodes of DS9 and I asked him <br /> <br /> "hey man, what are you watching lately because I have finished seeing all the episodes of TNG? "he said. "Well, I have these episodes of Farscape." I said, "Okay, let me try." At that time I was pretty sure I would not like it because I just saw TNG and it seemed great. "<br /> <br /> I had 3 episodes, seen those, but the program did not impress me much, at first I thought it was childish and I thought it was just another TV show, nice adventures but regular.The music was a bit different, it had special effects, and I had the vague impression that the actors did not get completely into the characters' skin. I saw another 3 episodes thinking that 3 eps were not enough to decide if I liked it or not, then the show began to understand me, I got a good knowledge of the action and I wanted to see what happened next to the poor Crichton ... the rest is history. <br /> <br /> I think I like more the freedom of the characters in the context of the action, unlike Star Trek where everyone slept when they were supposed to do and too many high-tech nonsense. <br /> <br / > The show improved with each episode, very interesting Tory Line ... What can I say? This movie is like poetry. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it!
