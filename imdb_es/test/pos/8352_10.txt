This movie is excellent! Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable! His little cry when he's scared, and the funniest parts are when: Scamp is trapped under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing "I've never had this feeling before". I totally recommend this film, which will be released in a special edition on June 20. The cover has a trail in a garbage can and Angel under the cover. <br /> <br /> I just can not explain this movie more than romantic, charming, hilarious. , And adorable. Scrap scenes are fun, all scrap dogs have something special. Very funny, I laughed, the children will LOVE. Buy when it comes out, it has new features!
