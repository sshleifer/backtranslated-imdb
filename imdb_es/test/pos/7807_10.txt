It's just ridiculous how underestimated this movie is. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It never gets delayed, it never slows down, it's a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. That along with the brilliant writing makes this an awesome movie. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, even Raveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti offer a great comedy for bad guys, but Viju Khote and Ajit-wannabe are the best with their stupid intentions of bad guys. If you want to laugh and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not regret it. Most Indian films tire me at the end, because they last 3 hours. This movie is just as long, but I would like there to be more when it's over, because it's an incredible movie.
