Kevin Tenney's "Night of the Demons" is a nice horror movie that reminds me a bit of "The Evil Dead." On Hallowen night, a group of teenagers organize a party at Hull House, an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of the city. Directed by Angela, they perform a ceremony similar to a s√©ance and accidentally awaken the evil spirits that inhabit the place. One by one, the uninvited evil force possesses the teenagers, turning them into bloodthirsty demons. "Night of the Demons" is a perfect horror. film.It is terrifying, bloody and quite atmospheric. The characters are well developed and the gore of Steve Johnson is pretty good. There is a frightful incrustation, a tongue being bitten, fingers stuck in the eye sockets, etc. The scene, where Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) sticks a tube of lipstick through her nipple is a scream. Take a look at this. Two sequels follow.
