Another classic by Raquel Welch! This image hit theaters on November 10, 1969, starring Raquel Welch as Michele, James Stacey as Joe and Luke Askew as Alan Morris. Nikki is on her way to meet her friends Michele and Jackie. On her way there, she meets her ex-husband who wants a second chance. Nikki moves away from him and goes to the table where she sees Michele and Jackie. Alan approaches her again and starts to walk away when Alan shoots her in the back. Nikki is taken to the hospital while Michele and Jackie go to the police station. Michele goes to the hospital where she meets Jackie only to discover that Nikki died. Alan then chases Jackie, who hits with a car and then tries to run over Michele. Michele gets into her car and heads to Los Angeles. When she arrives there, Lloyd calls her boss in Las Vegas to let her know that she was fine. Lloyd tells him to go to the club, which calls the losers to see Jeri about a job. However, there is a problem! The waiter has a problem with drugs and Alan knows it, so Alan and the bartender talk a little. Back in Los Angeles, Michele not only gets a job as a dancer with Jeri, but also hooks up with goalkeeper Jeri Joe. Now some thoughts on this picture! This picture was much better than Raquel's last, and it had an endless action. Luke Askew did a good job playing Nikki, ex-husband. It was your typical murder with the accompanying look. As for the performance of Raquel Welch, the only word that comes to me is fantastic. She was amazing in this movie and her beauty stood out and shone like never before. The outfit he wore on stage to dance was impressive. In fact, all the costumes I wore in this movie were impressive. Of course, it does not matter what Raquel was wearing because it looks good all or nothing. I give this movie 10 star weasels for two reasons. The first and by far is Raquel Welch, who is the main actress and deserves 10 stars. The second reason is that this movie was an emotion from start to finish.
