I think this movie actually has many nice things to say about a lot of people (Johnny Carson, Ted Koppel), and it shows that Letterman and Leno really loved each other and respected each other very much. Treat Williams as the Kung Fu Half Master, as Mike Ovitz, who looks like a Godfather, is fantastic.
