I do not know what the CKY crew is about, but everything they produce seems to be great in its simplicity and stupidity. Haggard is so incredibly silly and funny that he is an almost comical excellence. Sometimes it does not make any sense, but who cares? <br /> <br /> It made me laugh. An essential accessory for the CKY / Jackass fan!
