The husband and wife of real life Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation, which chronicles the period of Charles Darwin's life before the publication of "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, his infamous volume of evolution and natural selection . Darwin's research created an enormous rupture, a schism between the believers of his time and the scientists. It was said at that time that he was going to war against God and even that he had "killed God". <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the life of Darwin with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his extremely devoted and loving wife. A revealing scene at the beginning, when she leads the dinner table in prayer and Charles does not say "Amen," is a harbinger of what will follow and of the marked differences between the two. She is convinced that he will be eternally condemned and will bring misfortune to his family by rejecting God. <br /> <br /> Darwin is torn between his great love for his wife, his faith and his even stronger reason. There are beautiful moments of him watching animals, dissecting their behaviors and the sequences that make up their lives, explaining selection phenomena to their children, the first-born, Annie, who has a very morbid curiosity. We see him interact with the first orangutan in England, Jenny, playing with him as if he were a child, deciphering every aspect and action. <br /> <br /> Annie, the eldest daughter, later dies and Charles is harassed by his death, having been closer to her. In my opinion, this part was too long, strange and prolonged. I did not like the trippy scenes in which he seems to be losing his mind and is chased by his daughter's ghost, screaming and ranting. Although Charles believes that his wife blames him for his fatal illness, she says very poetically: "The truth is that if I knew what I know now, I would marry you tomorrow." Their bond is solid and unwavering despite the tremendous differences of belief. <br /> <br /> When Charles finishes his manuscript, he gives his wife the final copy and tells him that he can burn it if he does not agree. She stays reading until late and finally presents a package, the book ready to be sent to her editor. In the end, reason and perhaps also love, triumph, since he becomes an accomplice of his most adversary adversary. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating that Darwin has received a full Christian burial at Westminster Abbey, proof that its foundation. Of course, innovative ideas were considered controversial, but they were already recognized as vital knowledge for the advance of the human race. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely based on Darwin's family life, his joys and his problems. I liked this aspect, but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary about, "I quote Hitler's passion for ping-pong." This is true in some ways and I can not disagree with your desire to have learned more about Charles Darwin's theories of this movie than we do. It remains, however, a well-executed and impeccable period drama. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 Fabio's: 7 Total score: 14
