I'm definitely not a player, but there are a couple of people in my family and my boyfriend. So, a little reluctantly, I decided to find out what was wrong with the "fantastic things". I saw Dorkness Rising and I thought it was HILARO! It's slapstick, but it's not disrespectful to those who enjoy RPGs. In addition, and most importantly, people who have never played before can enjoy it and not feel excluded or lost when trying to understand the plot. The performance was great and the field / set shots were credible. This makes me want to see other films from this production company. I can not wait to see what the future holds for this group! Three applauses - well done!
