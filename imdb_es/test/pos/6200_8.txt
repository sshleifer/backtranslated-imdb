Sleeper Cell is what should have been 24. 24 is a caricature. (I see 24, but I feel cheated with every stupid episode, the four or five seasons so far.) Who can keep track since everyone is the same Jack gets in trouble, Jack gets into trouble and then gets back into trouble immediately, then ...) Sleeper Cell is very well done and is very superior. Unfortunately they ruined it with the end in the second season. I can think of a half dozen better endings of the head that would have worked better for the obvious goals of the writer and would not have been so naive. What a shame for writers to destroy what had been until that end, a really good series.
