I loved this show. Although I never understood why it was called Bug Juice. I must have had around 13 when it came out. I remember that they ran it during the summer holidays on Channel 4, between summer reruns of Pugwalls and Saved by the bell or something like that. I remember sitting there and wishing I were also at the summer camp, haha. All the children seemed to have so much fun, it was about "discovering who you are" and "growing up". First kisses and all those things. I remember that there was a really nice guy in him, I think that was the main reason why I woke up in the mornings that summer in particular. They should have more teen docu-soaps like this, I thought it was great!
