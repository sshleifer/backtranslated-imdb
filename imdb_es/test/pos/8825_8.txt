When watching this PPV, I had high expectations, since Smackdown is the best program in the WWE, this is a very good PPV since it is the last one before Wrestlemania. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH-HARDY BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W / MELINA IN A TAG TEAM MATCH OF 6 MEN Good way to start the match. It started a bit slow at first, but then the pace accelerated and the game became more exciting and entertaining. Benoit rolls and makes Joey Mercury tap for a victory for the Hardy Boys and himself. 6/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND GAME - GREGORY HELMS {CHAMPION} VS. SHANNON MOORE VS. FUNAKI VS. CHAVO GUERRERO VS. DAIVAIRI VS. SCOTTY 2 HOTTY VS. JAMIE NOBLE VS. JIMMY WANG YANG AT AN OPEN CRUISERWEIGHT INVITATION PARTY FOR THE WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP I'm a big fan of Cruiserweights, and I'm never disappointed to see them, especially in this game here. Chavo Guerrero defeats Frog Splash in Jimmy Wang Yang to get the victory and become the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion. 5/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD PARTY- FINLAY AND LITTLE BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN AND LITTLE BOOGEYMAN This was not really a fight fight, it was more like a comedy game, even though it was not a clear fight contest, it still entertained me with the funny pranks. Finlay nails the Little Boogeyman with the Shillaegh to get the victory. Boogeyman does not deserve to be in a PPV, and he does not deserve to be in WWE. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FOURTH MATCH- KANE VS. KING BOOKER W / SHARMELL This was a surprisingly good match, I thought it would be mediocre, but it became a real competitive wrestling contest. Congratulations to the two men, making a very entertaining match. Kane wins after a Chokeslam in King Booker. 6/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH: PAUL London and BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} VS. HIGHLIGHT & DOMINO W / CHERRY FOR THE WWE LABEL TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS It's not really a good match, Deuce and Domino need more training to fight, and London and Kendrick are the only ones who keep this game fast. London and Kendrick keep their titles, after Kendrick gets a summary of one of the players for the victory. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SEXTO MATCH - BOBBY LASHLEY {CHAMPION} VS. SIR. KENNEDY FOR THE ECW CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. Kennedy attacks Lashley from behind, before the game begins. It was a good match, but not really good. Lashley and Kennedy have a bit of chemistry, but not enough to achieve a great game. Kennedy wins by DQ, after Lashley nails him with a chair, then assaults him with the chair to the entrance area. Lashley still retains his title. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SEVENTH GAME- JOHN CENA & SHAWN MICHAELS VS. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the best team match for couples I've seen. Congratulations to all these men (yes, even Batista) for getting as close as a 5 star main event classic. All 4 of these men played their part in the match very well, as this was a great match per team. Batista turns his back on Undertaker, who breaks his back and then leaves the ring, which makes Michaels catch Sweet Chin Music, then Cena to get an F-U for the hard victory. 7/10 <br /> <br /> I do not know why everyone says that this PPV is not good enough, or it's boring, I just do not understand it. It is a great PPV that Smackdown always delivers. A great PPV in fact. <br /> <br /> In general, I will give you 8/10 and a B +
