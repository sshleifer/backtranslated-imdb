I like Tom Hanks, and he's one of the few actors that will attract me to the theater no matter what doubts I have about the film. I was worried that Mr. Hanks would return to the "light comedy", since this is the arena in which he made the transition from television to film. Do you remember "Big"? Well, "Charlie Wilson's War" is not a light comedy. It is a political satire, and an extremely well written political satire. The script is the star of this film, and the blacksmith of the word of Aaron Sorkin is one of the best that is offered this year. <br /> <br /> Mike Nicols keeps the adventure complete, and presents an upcoming movie. 90 minutes very fast (time is everything in the comedy and nothing is fun if it gets longer). The choice of Nicols in ensembles and lighting is also very reminiscent of the television of the 70s and 80s, a movement deliberately used to root the piece in a period. <br /> <br /> The return to the use of model work and stock photography in Digital special effects also improves retro look and credibility. Note for production designers in their choice of footage: I know the difference between an F-16 and a MiG, and a Bell and a Hind. But that may also have been part of the joke. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in Philadelphia. It was interesting to see and hear the audience NOT get the historical references of their own history. History tends to repeat itself because repeat offenders forgot what happened the first time. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mr. Hanks and the chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman. The Sorkin script is brought to life by these actors, and the entire production team is at the top of their game. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
