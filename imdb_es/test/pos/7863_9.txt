During the brief period between Clint Eastwood's string spaghetti westerns and his Dirty Harry films, he and director Don Siegel came together to make this unusual image. Eastwood plays a corporal of the Union Army injured during the Civil War who is admitted by a school for girls from the south until he recovers from his injuries. It has been a while since young women (most of whom appear to be teenagers) have had a man on the premises, so they are reluctant to hand him over to local rebel soldiers. The resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic, or even downright grotesque as Eastwood slowly regains his strength and begins to meditate on the establishment. <br /> <br /> The basic story almost sounds like the creation of a porn movie. We have a male male suddenly surrounded by nubile young women. Most of them are sexually attracted to him. And he is more than willing to spread the love between them. However, the material never really slides to the level of "tasteless". Eastwood, Siegel and cinematographer Bruce Surtees are such skilled filmmakers that the film always retains its dignity. <br /> <br /> John McBurney, of Eastwood, is like no other character he has played. McBurney is an amoral charlatan, deceitful and lustful. He knows that most women, even the youngest, want his body, and allow more than one of them to have an opportunity with him. McBurney often uses adulation to harass women, then uses his robust appearance to attract them. It's like a drunk player in a cocktail party, often hitting different women even in the same scene! Eventually, their lustful forms cause great agony and loss in a way that they must see for themselves. This author would not dream of revealing the specific consequences of his actions, but there is little doubt that he will have them. <br /> <br /> Eastwood offers great overall performance. It seems that he is very fond of paper until things get really ugly, then it becomes bad and ugly. Geraldine Page is a delight like the steely B * tch that runs the school. We know that she loves McBurney as much as the other girls, but since she shows us her checkered past in flashbacks, we discover that she is not all she wants. Mae Mercer as a slave belonging to the school also gives a great performance. Obviously, she knows that McBurney is a skunk from the start, and never lets her false spell lower her guard. This is a character you'll want to know more about after the movie ends. She seems to have a greater knowledge of the world than anyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Beguiled did poorly in its theatrical release. Nobody was quite sure what to think about it, and part of its content undoubtedly raised some eyebrows in 1971. For example, in an early scene we see Eastwood romantically kiss a 12-year-old girl. Are you just trying to keep it quiet when rebel soldiers approach, or are you really enjoying it? Probably both! A fantasy sequence later even shows Clint getting underway not only with Page, but with his young assistant! Truly some interesting events in this. It's good that Eastwood has become the star he made, or it could have been forgotten for a long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 stars <br /> <br /> The Dog.
