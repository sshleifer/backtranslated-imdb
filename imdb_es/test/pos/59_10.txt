I always felt that Mrs. Merkerson had never had a role that suited her abilities. Familiar with millions of people like the Lieutenant in Law and Order, she has been seen in several theatrical premieres, always in a secondary role. HBO's Lackawanna Blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine like Nanny, a successful businesswoman in a world that changes from segregation to integration. But the story is really about the colorful range of characters that she and her adopted son find in a boarding house in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. <br /> <br /> History can be established in any great Africa. - American community of the 50s and 60s, from Sweet Auburn of Atlanta to Harlem in New York. But the integration-segregation angle is just a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the people of Nanny's boarding house. The story revolves around Nanny's relationships with all kinds of people, played by some of the best actors in the company (by the way I did not say black actors, this set is an impressive variety of talents that are black, except Jimmy Smits. , of course) I recommend this movie as a fun and colorful look on a last day.
