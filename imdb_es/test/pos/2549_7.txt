I enjoyed Man Push Cart by Ramin Bahrani, and this movie is just as good. This segment of life is almost a documentary about how life lives in the limits. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do an excellent job as a brother of 12 years and a sister of 16 years. They live in a small room in a car workshop. There are no parents; They are in their own survival. Ali complements her income by stealing car parts, selling pirated DVDs and selling sweets in the subway. Izzie complements her income by working on a food truck selling herself. They are trying to make money for their own truck. <br /> <br /> One is tempted to express outrage at the fact that these two children are left alone in defense, and certainly one can be very upset that Izzie sells his body to willing truckers, but the fact is that this exists today in the richest country in the world, not in some underdeveloped lands. Save the outrage and do something.
