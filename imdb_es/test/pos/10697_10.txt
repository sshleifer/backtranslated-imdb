In my opinion, this movie is the best ninja movie ever made and, if you have not seen it, it's worth watching. I would rate this movie with 10/10.

Then he has to possess a young woman who finds him dying. Then he has to take revenge on the policemen who killed him, which means there are more murders and action. But only a ninja can destroy a ninja, so she and her boyfriend, who is also one of their targets, get the help of Yamad (Sho Kosugi) to free the ninja's spirit and destroy it.
