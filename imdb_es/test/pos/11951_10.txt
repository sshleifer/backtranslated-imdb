It seems to me that many people have never seen this movie, and the ones that normally dismiss it as trash ... actually it's pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie, I admit it. I was almost one of those people ... thank God I'm patient, otherwise I would never have found a classic like this. <br /> <br /> As ridiculous as this film is, it is also a must for anyone who is either a movie fan of the '80s, or simply has a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I know there are many people out there who will tell you that this movie is a kind of derivative of Better Off. Dead ... and what if it is? Both were excellent movies! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Savage Steve Holland is a genius. 10/10
