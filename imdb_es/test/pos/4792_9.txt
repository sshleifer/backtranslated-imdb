Nazarín, a comic story of a trampled priest, shows the economy that Luis Bunuel could achieve by being able to tell a deeply humanist fable with a minimum of fuss. As a result of his Mexican era of filmmaking, he was an invaluable talent, with little money and extremely tight schedules. Nazarin, however, surpasses many of Bunuel's previous Mexican films in terms of acting (Francisco Rabal is excellent), narrative and thematic. <br /> <br /> The subject, curiously, is something that was explored again in Viridiana. Three years later in Spain. It refers to the struggle of the individual for humanity and altruism in a society that rejects any notion of virtue. Father Nazarin, however, is represented with more sympathy than Sister Viridiana. While the latter seems to choose charity because it wishes to atone for its (perceived) sins, Nazarino's whole existence and raison d'être seem to be to help others, whether we like it (us) or not. The last scenes of the film, in which she casts doubts about her behavior and, in a split second, must choose between the life she has been leading or the conventional life expected of a priest, they are very emotional because they refer to your moral integrity. and we are never quite sure if it remains intact or not. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film and I would recommend it to anyone interested in classical cinema to find it. It is one of Bunuel's most moving films, and encapsulates many of his obsessions: frustrated desire, crazy love, religious hypocrisy, etc. From my point of view, "Nazarín" is the second after "El ángel exterminador", in terms of his Mexican films, and he is certainly near the top of Bunuel's total film production list.
