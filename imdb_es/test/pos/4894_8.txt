After three outstanding BBC television series and a Christmas special, the strange and grotesque characters (albeit perversely adorable) of the somber fictional town Royston Vasey make the leap to celluloid, along with its creators: The League of Knights. <br /> <br /> Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are the three most familiar quarters of the quartet, with the central roles shared among the trio. In an additional twist, the final member of the team, Jeremy Dyson, is played by actor Michael Sheen. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Dyson (Sheen) is conversing with his writing partners, when, horror of the horrors, he receives the visit of two of his most creepy characters. Both Tubbs (Pemberton) and Edward Tattsyrup (Shearsmith) are unhappy with the League's decision to kill the inhabitants of Vasey. "You're not real!" Dyson shouts in vain, while the local merchants of hell demand their revenge. Chaos ensues, as reality and Vasey converge with the vast array of characters that enter our world to save theirs. <br /> <br /> Confused? You will be, as in the camp, Teutonic insulting, Herr Lipp (Pemberton) will be forced to assume the daily appearance of Pemberton (Pemberton), while Pemberton (Pemberton) is kidnapped by the cannibalistic butcher Hillary Briss (Gatiss) and Geoff Tipps . (Shearsmith). <br /> <br /> With shades of even more demented Misery, Briss tries to force Pemberton to rewrite the film, continuing his life, but leaving Geoff in charge is never a good idea. The former comedian is involved in The League's latest post-Vasey adventure, The King's Evil, which enters a typically twisted 17th-century England, with cameos by Victoria Wood, Peter Kay and David Warner. Known as George of Asda (due to his select clothing line), Geoff saves the day and is treated like a hero, but by the outcome of the film, he joins old and new characters in the Royston Vasey Church to meet with its the manufacturers <br /> <br /> For the fans of the series, the film is a must. And yes, it has Papa Lazarou (although a little too fleeting). Pauline, Mickey, Barbara, pen lover, and cursed veteran Matthew Chinnery are some of the other favorites on the show, and representing the League themselves (plus Sheen as Dyson) is also a fascinating idea <br /> <br /> The League of Knights is the Radiohead of British comedy. They are ambitious, innovative (witnesses of the excellent Series Three) and are not happy to rest on their laurels. They also divide the opinion accordingly. <br /> <br /> Certainly, his macabre sense of humor is not for all palates, and while it is not written exclusively for "fanatics", an understanding of the story would benefit those who have previously seen the series. However, Apocalypse is a film in its own right and The League will undoubtedly attract a new generation of fans, as well as appease and please existing ones.
