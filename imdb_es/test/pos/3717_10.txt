Remember that this came out before the First Gulf War, which gave us the "Lessons of Darkness" by Werner Herzog. <br /> <br /> Le Dernier Combat is not "Science Fiction". It's more like the trial. I've seen it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion for Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness": "And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, because death will flee from them." <br /> <br /> That someday Unfortunately, it can be today, in Iraq. <br /> <br /> But, going back to Le Dernier Combat, make sure you watch until the last second of the movie. I would not call it a "surprise ending", but it is something that will be lost if you simply assume that the end will be no more than what you have already seen.
