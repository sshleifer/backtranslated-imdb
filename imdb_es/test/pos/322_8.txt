Yesterday night, I saw A PECK IN THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Curiously, it lasted 137 minutes, a little more than the one that appears in IMDb. <br /> <br /> At first, I found myself losing interest in this movie because the rather confusing filming style really lost me. The context of what was happening was missing and I'm glad I kept it. At first, a young couple is married and, soon after the wedding, the war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers separate. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and aboard a refugee boat that is heading to India. In a refugee center, you see the lady about to give birth, after which the titles of the film are finally revealed. <br /> <br /> The whole focus of the film changes completely: a girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras, India. You see her at home and she talks to the camera about her life and her family. None of this seems so interesting or important and you wonder what is missing, what about the lady who was about to give birth? My wife and I discussed this and finally guessed that this girl was actually the daughter of the lady in the first part of the movie. Somehow or other, she had been adopted and was talking about her life with Mom and Dad # 2, although she did NOT realize that these people were not her biological parents. <br /> <br /> Soon after, the parents revealed they became total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the film), as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her origin and say it in a way that will leave the girl emotionally fucked and confused. Despite a stupid decision and to tell her the worst, the parents compensated by accepting to help her find her biological mother. Seeing the impact that all this had on the girl and the parents (especially the adoptive mother) was impressive to see and sure that it aroused my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has been involved in a very, very long and brutal process. Civil war with Tamil militants, from time to time, for three decades. The family's decision to look for the mother in Sri Lanka was really noble, but also a little stupid at times, since they ran many risks and were almost killed again and again just jumping blindly in the middle of a war! All this was exciting and captivating, but it also left me wondering about the mental health of the adoptive parents: first you tell him that he is NOT your biological son and that now you take him to the middle of a WAR AREA! Sure, the boy really wanted to meet his biological mother, but this was really stupid to look at. If it were me, I could have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the role and cheat the child, thus avoiding being in the middle of a war! <br /> <br /> Despite my complaints, the film was Enchanting to watch and it was very rewarding. Far from being perfect, surely it is an emotional home run Also, although I expected this because I have seen several Indian films, many Westerners will be a little surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of nowhere: this is standard in most movies of India, including those made in Bollywood. (Bombay) and Tamilwood / Kollywood (Madras).
