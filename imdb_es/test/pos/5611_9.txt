One of the many speculations about Y2K was that the world would end at midnight on December 31, 1999. In 'The Book of Life', writer / director Hal Hartley discusses the possible ramifications of a new millennium Armageddon , beginning with the return of Jesus to the Earth on New Year's Eve, 99. The story examines the task of the Son of God, who must open the three remaining seals of the seven seals contained in the Book of Life (now contained on a Mac laptop), which also includes the names of the one hundred and forty-four thousand good souls that will be saved on the last day. Jesus (Martin Donovan), along with Magdalena (P.J Harvey), arrives in New York City to make the necessary preparations to carry out the will of his Father, but begins to have doubts; Should he judge the living and the dead? Do they deserve what should happen to them? It is a cup that I would rather not embrace at this particular time, which encourages Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan), who fears that the fruit of all his hard work is about to be washed at midnight, since he can only continue his work as long as there are people around who cling to their pitiful hopes and dreams. Hartley, an artistic and high-concept film, presents the story in an intelligent and stimulating way, taking care of the delicate subject to make it harmless even for the most ardent fundamentalists. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is intriguing and stimulating, as is the effect of his presence on those with whom they meet during their bodily stay in the city. It is a fascinating meditation on the spiritual side of the fragile existence of man and a contemplation of what has been prophesied in the Revelations of Saint John in the Apocalypse, the last book of the New Testament. And there is logic in Hartley's approach to the Second Coming; it maintains the aesthetics of the contemporary environment while employing altered film speeds that visually give the film an ethereal quality. Christ, discreetly, wears a suit and tie, combining effectively with the population, while Satan's attire is a bit more informal, his appearance somewhat disheveled; He has a bruise on his left eye. Donovan is well interpreted as Jesus, lending a benevolent attitude and a sense of moderate urgency to his character that is very effective. It is, of course, a unique representation of The Savior, and possibly the best since Max von Sydow wrote in "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Successfully transmits a feeling of inner peace and tranquility, of serenity, which is the essence at the very center of the character. And Ryan is participating fully in his role as the Prince of Darkness; He has a different way of speaking and a quality of resonance in his voice that makes him absolutely fascinating to watch. His eyes are dark and piercing, a feature he uses effectively with furtive looks and captivating looks. He is the type who could sell you anything in exchange for your soul before you knew what hit you. It is a memorable performance that contrasts so well with the representation of Jesus by Donovan. The cast includes Martin Pfeffercorn (Martyr), Miho Nikaido (Edie), Dave Simonds (Dave), D.J. Mendel (lawyer), James Urbaniak (true believer), Katreen Hardt (paralegal) and Anna Kohler (hotel secretary). In his own inimitable style, with 'The Book of Life', Hartley has created a perspective of the past few days that is interesting, entertaining and truly unique. He has a way of capturing life as it is outside the center, a method that works especially well with a movie like this one. Comparatively short for a feature film (duration of 63 minutes), however, it is one of Hartley's best, and is worth more than the admission price. It is a movie that will stay with you and perhaps make you think of some things that you may have hidden in a corner of your mind for later. And that's part of the attraction of this movie; It makes you realize that "later" is more likely to be now. I qualify this 9/10.
