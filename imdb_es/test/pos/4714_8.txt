I came across this movie on television. I had not heard of that before and almost changed the channel, but I was hooked quickly. <br /> <br /> The history of the struggle of the Burmese people against a military dictatorship was provoking. The level of brutality that some are willing to use to maintain power is hard to believe. I am grateful to live in a country where the government does not shoot people in the streets. <br /> <br /> The story of Laura Bowman was a good thread to hold together the history of political struggle.
