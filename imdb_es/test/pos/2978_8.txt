This movie caught me from the beginning, where you see a sweet-looking teenage girl visiting a tomb alone, then Elton John's powerful song "Friends" starts playing while she is seen walking alone through the streets of Paris, carrying a suitcase. naively unaware of the automobile robbery and prostitution that surrounded her. The whole movie is a beautiful, dreamy, romantic collection of young love scenes, holding hands, living in the countryside, wild horses running freely, fields of wild flowers, sunsets, wine toasts, evenings by the fire , fun and general Innocence, all set in the romantic music of Elton John. It's magic. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I missed seeing this movie when I was growing up. I'm sure I would have left a great impression if I had seen it then. I remember the radio advertisement for the film in 1971, which talked about how it was a special movie with music by Elton John, and with the chorus of the song "Friends" in the ad ("Friends of Makin for the world to see"). .. "), but I never heard anything else about that in those days, and I could never see it until I rented it 35 years later in a video store, by then, it had been edited, censored and all kinds of unhappy people with political agendas Angry people used all sorts of ugly words to describe the film, what can I say? The world has gone crazy ever since. <br /> <br /> The story is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to move in with her cousin in Paris after her parents die. (It was her grave she was visiting at the opening scene.) One day, while visiting the zoo alone, she meets a 15-year-old boy, attacked him and agreed to meet The next day, while traveling together, The boy accidentally drives his car to a lake in a strange solo car accident. It was his father's car, he can not bear to go home to face his father's anger, so the two teenagers begin to live together in the French countryside, with the mutual background that both hated their lives at home. They settle in an unoccupied cottage, the child takes occasional jobs to support themselves, their supposed friendship becomes romance, the girl becomes pregnant and they have a baby at home with success. Meanwhile, the boy's father has the police trying to locate his missing son. On the first anniversary of the couple's flight, the police finally locate the child's employer through an in-person consultation, and they are told that they can see the child the next morning when they come to work. The next morning, he shows the boy who leaves his country house to go to work, says goodbye to his girlfriend and his wife and happily makes the carts while the scene freezes when his girlfriend says goodbye. At least that's how the video version I saw ends. It is an unexpected but timely ending, which presumably represents the last moments of happiness before the child is taken back to his parents' house and his happy life with his wife and baby is broken. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as The story and the images are, the plot is terribly unrealistic and highly artificial. I think it is better to enjoy the film as the fantasy of a young person's dream and not to go deeper into analysis, because all logic and credibility are quickly undone when the story is examined in more depth. Why would a completely furnished and equipped country house be left unattended with the door open and not visited for a whole year? What did they plan to do when the owners returned? Why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant with him? Did not you think it was unethical to use other people's homes and food? How could they expect to obtain necessary dental care or other emergency medical care while living outside of society? How could the child have a car accident on a rural road without collision and without other cars around? Where are there places near civilization where wild horses run free? How is it possible that a teenager does not have sex as the main thing in his mind when he picks up a girl in a zoo? (The lyrics of Elton John's songs just do not fit). Why do they take off their clothes when they sleep outside at night when it is about to cool? And so. The scenes of wild horses are designed to attract girls, as is the unrealistic theme of "friendship before romance", and all scenes of washing and tickling with their predictable results, running through the fields of flowers to each other, the haze filters Scenes are shot through wild flowers in the foreground, baby ducks, and so on. It works, but it is definitely designed. <br /> <br /> Still, this is a film about youth and freedom, and that ideal has not changed since the 1970s. Today, young people are still treated as belongings or lost pets that they must be recovered by the police instead of being treated as mature human beings who have the same needs for romantic love and freedom as the adult world and the ability to be responsible when given that. freedom. That is why the message is universal. It's clear why a sequel would not work: this story is about a year-long magical rescue from the real world. Such a situation could never have extended indefinitely, assuming that it could even happen in the first place, and a story about real life would later lack the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence. I really hope that no teenager has taken the movie seriously enough to try such a silly trick. But I also hope that the teenagers who were impressed with this film in the 70s learned something from it and that since then they have tried to make this magical world a more accessible reality for others, instead of perpetuating the various hatreds and repressions of the society. Especially in their own children.
