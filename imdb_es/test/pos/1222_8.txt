Watching the preview of Armored, I thought the movie was going to be very bad or very good. Fortunately, the film was entertaining, suspenseful and realistic. There is never the perfect crime, and Armored showed why. The film is shown perfectly when people put themselves in a stressful situation and behave like animals. The last hour of the movie is very entertaining. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. Hard to believe Dillon is 50 years old. I would buy this movie. I give Armored eight out of ten. It is not a Christmas movie. Did I write ten lines already? No Anyway, there are not many action movies. Armored has a lot of emotion, which gives the viewer an option over another comedy.
