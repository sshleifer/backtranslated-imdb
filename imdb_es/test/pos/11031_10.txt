I collected movies on Super-8 and managed to get a full impression of it last week on E-bay. It seems that at least for the moment, this is the only way to see this movie in a country that has an NTSC video. I've seen it available many times on the Region 2 DVD, but never in Region 1. <br /> <br /> I just finished seeing it a few minutes ago and it surprises me. It is a powerful testimony of freedom and of finding your own place in the world. The photography and music were wonderful, and I really felt empathy for some of the characters. <br /> <br /> I liked the idea that it was probably the only one in the United States that looked "When the North Wind Blows". tonight! <br /> <br /> Long live Avakum!
