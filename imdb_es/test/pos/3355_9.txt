I saw this good movie shortly after leaving university. As I sat happily watching Alice move from being a repressed virgin to a sexual adventurer, I wondered why her sexual encounters seemed familiar to me. Then I remembered ... Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the conferences dealt with the psycho-sexual stages of development, basically the change in time over which part of the body and its concomitant stimuli receives our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and the background. His next encounter is an oral one with the dingaling of the Mad Hatter. I forgot the rest of the conference and the order of Alice's meetings, but I do remember how well they fit. It's interesting to see a skin movie with some brains behind, instead of the clich√© "I'm here to deliver your pizza, let's fuck". I do not see how Kristin DeBell's career could be. Shattered by this movie, since it was her first film. And Reagan's exhausting hypocrisies had not yet affected this land when she was released, but in a way that he and his Meese puppet did affect Ms. DeBell. When Meese was organizing her anti-pornography commission (to distract people from their own criminal activities), Meese hired the services of an anti-pornography activist named Judith Reisner. Reisner was obsessed with the images she perceived as child pornography. She saw the cover of "Alice" that Ms. DeBell made for Playboy and quickly announced that she had scientifically proven that Ms. DeBell was actually a collage of photos of several adult women and the face of a ten-year-old girl. Yeah sure....
