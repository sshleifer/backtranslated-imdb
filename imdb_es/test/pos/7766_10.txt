I try to be different in my movie watching. I can enter "Pride and Prejudice" as easily as in "Facts Disappeared". Love Jones is my favorite of all time, it is the standard by which I judge any modern urban romantic comedy. Shot very well, the photo of Nia and Darius riding on Lakeshore Drive on the motorcycle is one of the classic 3-second movie shots of all time. Of course nobody will ever remember it. When it was published, I thought it would be a new paradigm for the making of films in Modern Urban, good actors, without weapons, etc. The film industry has disappointed me to some extent, you'll have your occasional Drumline, or Roll Bounce, or "Why I Got Married" by Tyler Perry. So every time I need to see "my people" presented on the screen in a very professional and stylish way, I pop in Love Jones. There is not a better movie ever made, for many people and opinions for that. But it is my personal best brand. My favorite line of Love Jones "Honey, I just want to go up and talk!"
