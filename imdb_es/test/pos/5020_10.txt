This movie is one of my favorites of all time. I regret that IMDb is not more positive about it. I hope that does not prevent those who have not experienced it from seeing it. <br /> <br /> I've always liked this movie. I see it once a year and I always like the film and, especially, the stellar performances of the entire cast. <br /> <br /> I've always wondered if Jean Stapleton really did the final dance with Travolta ??? ? If anyone knows this piece of trivia, please leave a comment. <br /> <br /> Thanks and ENJOY!
