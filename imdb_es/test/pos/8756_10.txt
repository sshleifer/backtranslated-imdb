Traffik is a 6-hour drama very well done on drugs (circa 1987). It tells, in parallel, three stories about how opium is grown in northeastern Pakistan, how drugs are trafficked from Pakistan to Europe and, finally, how people addicted to drugs get out of control. The three stories are told realistically and with empathy. You see enough lives of the characters to understand how ordinary people can be absorbed by a life that is truly immoral. <br /> <br /> These are not cardboard cutouts, the opium producer is trying to feed his family. A dry area full of guns and other opium growers. The drug dealer is a rich, heartless German, but his wife (one of the three main characters) is an ordinary woman who has to choose between leading her "old-fashioned" life or surrendering. Finally, the main character, the government minister has the most difficult role, since he must deal with the emotional devastation caused by his own daughter. He slips into the world of drug addiction and begins to steal, suffers from bad health, emotionally attacks his parents, all so that he can continue satisfying his desire for the drug (heroin) that is destroying his life. <br /> <br /> Traffik is one of the best dramas I've seen on television. The scenes in this show will remain with you for a long, long time. Highly recommended - Colin Glassey
