I have been away from Istanbul for the past 10 years. During that time I lived constantly in London. When I saw the movie I realized how much I am Istanbuler. I am not only from Turkey, I am part of Turkey. One of my part is Istanbul, the sound of Istanbul, the people of Istanbul. <br /> <br /> Probably Faith Akin thought that she had made a great musical documentary, but I must say that it is more than that. It's about putting together a good mix of very different musics, cultures, approaches, politics and ethnicities in a delicious pot ... <br /> <br /> As we all know that Turkey is accurate, Istanbul always comes and goes between being East or Western city. As one of the band members said, Istanbul is a bicultural city. But much more an eastern city because we always try to be a western city. It shows that we have never been one. <br /> <br /> This movie will be seen from the first second. The music is excellent, the people are fascinating. Especially Aynur and Sezen Aksu. Singers, members of the band! It is a pleasure to see you all in a small theater in Wood Green.
