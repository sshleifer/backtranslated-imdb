I have to rate this movie at 10. I'm sorry, but I think it's a classic comedy. So, if you qualify for other Madonna movies ... well, what? Do you want to tell me that it was not your best movie? Did Sorvino not win an Oscar for almost the same performance ten years later? Please, this movie deserves a lot more credit than it receives. Also, I like to consider it as a sociological study A + on the lifestyles of the 80s. Remember when you could steal from Sam Goody and Cartier on the same day? Remember when women wore bushy eyebrows with pride? so I was not a "last emperor", it was still good. There are certain movies that I would be willing to watch every day. Three, in fact, that animate my day and make me smile. If you like "Who is that girl?" then I would also recommend "Party Girl" and "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion."
