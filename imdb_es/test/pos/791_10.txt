This is one that you can look at again and again and laugh as much as ever. We've been to a Keaton festival around here after buying some of his films. In this, Buster is confused with an escaped murderer and there are many scenes of persecution and follies, but also the best of Buster: his creativity. The opening scene is very funny and continues from there.
