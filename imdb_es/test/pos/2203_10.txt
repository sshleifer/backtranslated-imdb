Although video technology can be dated, this classic musical work, now on DVD, is the best version of Sondheim's most important and polished work on Broadway. If you have never seen SWEENEY TODD, you must buy this DVD. I saw this production in November 1980 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, and I fell in love with Angela Lansbury, before "Murder She Wrote". Later, I tried to find each and every one of his works, among them: MOVIES: "The Harvey Girls", "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "Manchurian Candidate"; CDs: "Mame", "Dear World" and "Gypsy"; and many more. The rest of the cast is impeccable, too. In short, this wonderful DVD gives us the definitive version of the opera of Sondheim!
