Jim Henson as Kermit, Dr.Teeth, Rowlf and Waldorf. <br /> <br /> Frank Oz as Fozzie, Piggy and Animal. <br /> <br /> Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper, Robin the Frog, Lew Zealand and Crazy Harry. <br /> <br /> Richard Hunt as Janice, Statler, Beaker and Scooter. <br /> <br /> Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Dr.Hunnydew and Zoot. <br /> <br /> Charles Durning and Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> Cameos by Steve Martin, Carol Kane, Orson Welles, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor and others. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie of the Muppet billion The others that came out, and it's also the best, by far! This is Kermit, the frog who travels to Hollywood and meets the other characters along the way. This film, in addition to being already good, has excellent songs performed by the Muppets, which include Rainbow Connection, Can You Picture That, Moving Right Along and others. This film, unlike the other Muppet films, has great sentimental value for me. It is such a beautiful movie. It is also pointed out that there are many cameos with Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and a dozen others. <br /> <br /> my rating-A more. 109 minutes G rating
