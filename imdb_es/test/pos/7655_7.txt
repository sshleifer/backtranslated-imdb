Latcho Drom, or Safe Journey, is the second film in the trilogy of the Roma by Tony Gatlif. The film is a visual representation and a historical record of Roma life in European countries and the Middle East. Although the scenes are mostly planned, rehearsed and organized, there is no conventional story and the dialogue does not explain the activities from one scene to another. Instead, the film allows the viewer to sometimes glimpse, sometimes a deeper insight into these people during different times and in different countries, from India, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain. <Br /> <br /> The importance of music in the Roma culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. It is a vital part of each event and an important means of communication. Everything they do is expressed with music. Dance is another important activity. Like Romani music, it is specialized and deeply personal, something that only they know how to do correctly. They give us a glimpse of their daily activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. Rather, it is a testimony of their culture, which focuses on the music and dance that they have created and that have made them unique. <br /> <br /> Mr. Gatlif portrays the nomadic groups in a positive way. However, we are also witnesses of the rejection, mistrust and alienation that they receive from the non-Roma population. It seems that the culture they have developed over countless generations, and inspired by different countries, will fade into oblivion because conventional society has no place for nomadic roads. <br /> <br /> The other films in the trilogy are Les Princes (1983) and Gadjo Dilo (1998).
