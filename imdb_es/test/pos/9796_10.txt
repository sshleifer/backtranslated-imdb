Where do I start? The first time I saw this movie was in 1995 and I had no idea what to expect. Actually, at that time I was looking for films in which Elijah Wood had starred and this had been highly recommended. I sat down and I saw the movie once and I did not know what to think. I saw it a second time a few days later and the floodgates opened. Never before in my life had I really cried while watching a movie, and I was whimpering, at every high and low level of the movie I was riding on, on an emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> Such an emotional chord was heard in me on many levels, the intense sadness and euphoria we see in the film, the wonder and innocence of childhood, the longing for a time that was once, but that does not exist anymore. More than anything, this movie reminded me of my childhood (except for the abuse) during a time in my life when I had rejected my childhood some years before and I had not even realized it, I had abandoned it and it had happened to Una vida totalmente devoid of it. The Radio brochure made me wake up and suddenly I realized what I had given up without even realizing it. From that day forward, I immediately began to change my life and mine, and so I did. <br /> <br /> This will sound corny, but basically I rediscovered my inner child, I started a path that has been ongoing. in the last 6 years and it has changed me so much, for the better, to embrace and live that part of myself. I've been discovering who I really am. I do not think it was simply the case of the correct movie that came at a crucial moment in my life, The Radio Flyer really did something very special, and I still consider it an incredible work in all aspects, an incredible movie. <br /> <br /> When I finish I can not stop mentioning the music. I'm a big fan of Hans Zimmer and this is one of his best works. The breadth and depth of the emotional expression that he has put into the score of this film is a big part of what makes the film what it is for me. Like the subtitles of a movie in a foreign language, your music on the rise is a lullaby for the intense emotions that this film will take you through. Find the soundtrack at all costs, it was removed with sadness a long time ago, I never expected to find it, but I did it in a surprising way, after talking with someone I met in a guest book by Hans Zimmer. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. let yourself live the emotions, do not get entangled in the trite meticulous of the end, be that child again
