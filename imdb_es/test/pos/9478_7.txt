At the beginning of the film, Johnny Cave's character from Cagney tells his gumshoes in the Bureau of Weights and Measures that in the previous year, unscrupulous store owners had cheated the American consumer with more money than the war debt national added. Then he goes out and buys a particularly greasy green grocery store to sell him a four-ounce bag of sugar (oh, the horrors!) And a skinny chicken that his butcher scale generously proclaimed to weigh six pounds. , after which the skin - or in this case the feathers - flies. Er, fly. When a scammer in a politician's clothes tries to derail an investigation into the practices of poultry farmers, our hero becomes a lone wolf fighting the weight war on behalf of housewives throughout the United States. After all, four cents accumulate here and a quarter and before we know it we have anarchy! The news of his intransigence soon reaches both the mayor and the governor's offices, and Cagney becomes a marked man. If it sounds silly, it is not; dishonest commercial practices are just a tracing tool (or as Hitchcock would say, the McGuffin) and although they are not familiar, it works just as well as any Treasury agent or anthology of G-man in which the fight takes offenders that operate outside the interests of the common good of the country. The production standards are decidedly Grade B, but it is Cagney who makes this film the delight: this was his first movie outside of Warner Brothers after seeking release in court from his unreasonable contract, and he seems comfortable and calm . Enjoying tremendously, the performance shown here is intelligent and creaks with its unique energy and confident charisma. The presence of Mae Clarke lends a definite feeling of Warner to the production in general. Support players provide solid performances and the story progresses intelligently after a rocky introduction that seems to start three or four reels in the story, but sit back and enjoy it for the Cagney showcase and participate in the time capsule of the era of the Depression. .
