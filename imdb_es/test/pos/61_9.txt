The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, who runs a boarding house and provides tireless support to a child, Ruben, the narrator of the film. Based on the experiences of writer and actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates the new inn in the state of New York and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the sixties. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is virtually non-stop music. The second half deals more completely with the different characters in the pension. Nanny's ability "to take fragments and make them complete" affects everyone within her sphere. An especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband, saying firmly: "If you ever touch that child again, let's dance!" As the actress S. Epatha Merkerson pronounced it, that line is so fierce and so full of resolution that the husband with the temperament of the hair is paralyzed. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, Merkerson delivers a dominant presence. His character unites the different lives of the borders of his home. This was a heartwarming, sincere movie with a wonderful cast. As Merkerson interpreted it, Nanny's character simply radiates love. This is a cinematic experience that I will remember for a long time.
