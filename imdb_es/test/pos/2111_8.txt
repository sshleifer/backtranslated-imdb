I had the privilege of being one of Still's photographers on the "Grand Champion" set and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I worked on the film. I have been in the photography business for 25 years and have worked in 16 films, and I can not think of a time when I enjoyed providing my craft more. It was wonderful to work with the children and the little Emma Roberts has so much energy that it is a real trip. She even grabbed one of my camera during the rehearsal of the scene and started firing. Some of his images were used for public relations. I could have made more money working for a production with a bigger budget, but I doubt I would have had so much fun and would have been with so many great actors and the great people of West Texas as it was.
