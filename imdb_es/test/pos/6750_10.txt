I think this movie was made as good as it could have been. With only 4 months and a budget of $ 52,000, I am surprised that this has not been worse. If you do not care about CG or special effects, this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie is not so well made (I'm sure it could have been, but you try to do better in just 4 months) but the story is good and the movie is quite exciting. <br /> <br /> Do not trust me when I say that this film is good, because I also find that the King Kong of 1933 is Good. <br /> <br /> I must confess that I did not see the whole movie either ... It is possible that I was ahead of time here and there ...
