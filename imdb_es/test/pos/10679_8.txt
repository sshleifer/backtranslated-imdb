This lesser known film starring Roy Thinnes (From TV's Invaders) is actually what I consider a lost gem. It was made at a time when history was more important than special effects (although the effect is quite good for its time). A scientist theorizes that there is another world in the orbit of the Earth directly behind the sun. As the sun always blocks us, we can never see it from Earth. Roy Thinnes is selected to go on a mission to get to this world. I do not want to tell the rest of the plot because it will give the rest of the movie. Let's say there are some real surprises. <br /> <br /> The film is British and has that good British flavor of the performance he had in TV series like The Avengers.
