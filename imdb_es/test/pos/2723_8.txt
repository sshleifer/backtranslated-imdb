Well, it is a great work of Aparnaji and some people like this make us believe that there are many more concepts that should be expressed so far and that the film is a great way to do it. Well, all the great actors together, therefore, have nothing to say about acting or directing, but the movie gave us a great message. He has very well predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve the whole problem accordingly. From there, from the teacher to the maid, everyone tried their own way. Then, when JOydeep was arguing with his wife, he says that "she is looking for something he will never get" and the wife responds "are not we all?". So that was a great comment that after the movie left me a big question, 'are we all sick?'
