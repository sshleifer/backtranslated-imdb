"China Syndrome" could not have been launched at a better time: twelve days after its launch, the infamous error occurred on Three Mile Island. But even if that (and / or Chernobyl) had never happened, this film remains an important look at what could happen through the mismanagement of nuclear facilities. Jack Lemmon delivers a five-star performance while the supervisor tries to expose a cover-up at his nuclear plant, with Jane Fonda playing the reporter trying to investigate and Michael Douglas playing his camera. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the current threat of a terrorist attack makes "China Syndrome" more disturbing, but anyway, it's definitely a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> I hope those people who spent years pushing nuclear energy to see this movie just so they could know that their views and ideals are completely defunct.
