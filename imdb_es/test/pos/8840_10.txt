Could not. <br /> <br /> From the cutting dialogue to the super special effects, this movie was a joy to behold. The immediate sense of the bitterness of Antarctica, the affinity for the characters that is built at the base level before the actual action heats up and the cunning end combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable movies out there . <Br /> <br /> Against a long list of films that tried to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, The Thing comes to light and laughs. Who can forget the perfectly synchronized dialogue and the spooky special effects? Special effects that are much more impressive than the computer generated images we can see today. For my part, I found that some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film was the way we were slowly introduced to each member of the team and the way in which they all had some distinctive character traits. This was not just a horror movie with no sense of blood, coming and slasher. This movie had a feeling. Emotion. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this movie enough. I have not yet seen anything in his class that is closer to coincidence, much less to the improvement, to the almost perfect performance and timing used in this astute feat of cinema.
