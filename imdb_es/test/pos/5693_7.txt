While on vacation in northern Australia, Gracie (Diana Glenn), her husband Adam (Andy Rodoreda) and her younger sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) decided to take the Blackwater Barry tour in the marsh to fish. His guide Jim (Ben Oxenbould) uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote place. When they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile who overturns his boat and immediately kills Jim. The three survivors climb a tree and, when they realize that help would never come to rescue them, they decide to try to leave their protected place. However, in the muddy water, his boat turns and the crocodile lurks the trio underwater. <br /> <br /> "Black Water" is a tense, realistic and dramatic film on a low budget and according to the warning. At first, based on a true event. The performance of the unknown Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody and Andy Rodoreda is top notch, giving credibility to this simple but terrifying story. There are many similarities between this movie and "Prey", but in different environments. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Deep Mud" ("Deep Fear")
