"Stripperella" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (played by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper in a gentlemen's club known as "The Tender Loins" and as a sexy crime fighter known as Stripperella, also known as Agent 69 who works for a government organization. Like Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil, like a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that explode or fatten, and Cheapo, a criminal who steals 99 cents and makes his two henchmen share a weapon. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame (and creator of Spider-Man). <br /> <br /> At the end of June 2003, Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) premiered Thursday night block of three animated shows. Those shows were "Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon"; The new adventures of the classic children show the characters Ren and Stimpy for adults, made by the original creator John Kricfalusi, "Gary the Rat"; about a lawyer who becomes a human-sized rat starring Kelsee Grammar of "Cheers" and "Fraiser", and "Stripperella"; the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero with the voice of Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing the first three premieres. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original program. I was a little disappointed. It was fine, but it seemed to take things a little too far; Seeing the two having gay sex together was a bit too much. Although Gary the Rat was not bad, the best of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really good, it had an amazing introductory song, it had a good talent behind it, and it was very funny! The show was so silly, I do not even know how to start explaining it! After four or five weeks (although not a little less), the animation block disappeared, which was strange because I know that it got good grades and was announced everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella leave, but several months later I discovered new episodes that aired at 1:00 a.m. I could only see one and although it was fun as hell and I was happy to see the show again after all that time, something seemed a little strange ... <br /> <br /> At first it's short Run, "Stripperella" It had a great animation. It was dark, moody, realistic and somewhat sexy too. Stripperella's dress also looked good, the character was well drawn. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of a dark and realistic appearance, originally had everything, now it was really colorful and caricature. Stripperella received the biggest changes however. Before I had normal long hair, I now had a bigger hair than Peggy Bundy's (Married with children), if possible. In addition, the eye mask actually shows its eyes now; before he was just white you saw what was great, since he was more superheroic. In addition, the upper part of his disguise was a kind of vest with a collar and his disguise was dark blue; that changed to that his disguise was of a bluish violet color and his superior disguise was really horrible in comparison. In short, the show was a cartoon and very exaggerated in advance, but in the second half it looked more cartoonish and, although it is still very funny, it also became more crazy; for example, there was a later episode about a beaver, and yes, a beaver. <br /> <br /> Anyway, instead of complaining about the changes of the half of the series, "Stripperella" only ran a season, but it was a very good show. As in the movie "Bordello of Blood" by Tales from the Crypt, it may be really corny, but it's a lot of fun. As long as you're not rude, you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. I have not seen all the episodes because I still do not have the DVD for two reasons: # 1. Paramount was released and they have a wrong policy of not including extras in almost all the television programs, even though this was the whole program ( I would have liked to see some commentators explaining the change of animation and the interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and 2. The incredible song of Kid Rock during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of him, but that introduction sang. IT WAS the theme of the show! If you are not going to pay to have extras, at least pay to have the original introduction song that you get screwed. The show also had some interesting guest stars like John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as plastic surgery that hates models. Also Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was in the program as owner of the strip club in most episodes. Stan Lee also has a cameo in an episode. <br /> <br /> The breakdown: <br /> <br /> PROS: At first I looked at it well, FUNNY AS HELL, a very funny, great show The talent of voice for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (see the program and see some of the things it does), and it was easily the best of the three animated programs mentioned above. <br /> <br /> CONS: The animated series Change of animation and the horrible DVD described above. Apart from the fact that part of the humor can be a bit silly, sometimes I have nothing really negative to say about it. <br /> <br /> IN GENERAL: Stripperella is a great pleasure guilty of mine and it is a pity that it is only a pity. ran a season It was a fun, sexy and action packed cult series that I hope to see in Adult Swim some day with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season as Family Guy. Check it even if it's on the lousy DVD. You will laugh at yourself. <br /> <br /> TV-MA qualified: Raw and sexual humor and nudity, Duration: Approximately 25 minutes per episode, Score: 9/10
