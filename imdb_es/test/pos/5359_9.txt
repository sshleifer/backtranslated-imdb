This first (and I hope not the last) feature of Wallace & Gromit lives up to expectations. There are a lot of jokes (some a little cheeky), as well as some great tributes to past science fiction movies. With the alluvium of frightening and formulated movies that are broadcast from Hollywood, it's great to see a movie as great as this one that is enjoyable for almost everyone. If there is some justice, it will be the best of the box office and, at least, it will be nominated for the best animation in the next Oscars. The animation is wonderful; The characters are very expressive and their adventures are very funny. This is one of those movies that the whole family can enjoy. Charming, intelligent, fun and well done, what is not to enjoy?
