This movie is my family's favorite Christmas movie because it is a beautiful picture of what Christmas is really about. These days living in a big city that I hate, I love watching movies about the life I always dreamed of having. The city in which this film is developed is my dream come true for the life I have always wanted and the true feeling of community that has been lost in today's society. I really do not feel the true spirit of Christmas anymore, but watching this movie helps me find that feeling again. My family recorded this TV movie a long time ago and now our copy has been spent, so I would really like to buy some DVD copies for my family and me. If someone can tell me where I can buy some copies, just post the information. Here and I will continue checking. Thank you.
