Wow ... it's been a long time since I last saw such a hilarious movie! I've never been a big fan of French films, but since I fell in love with the beauty and acting skills of Catherine Deneuve, I decided to watch all of her films ... however, I did not think this would be as fantastic as it turned out to be. How lucky I bought it even though I had some doubts! This is really a "feel good" movie with class and quality. There are some big social issues and moral dramas involved that are very close to the modern way of life today, which are very beautiful and realistic. I also really liked the dance scene in the men's room! But my favorite is Catherine Deneuve's rather shy attempt to sing ... she does it the way she is, very gracefully and modest at the same time ... very tempting! Later, I would also like to express my respect and admiration for Line Renaud, who played a fantastic role (I did not even know he was acting ... I only know him for his music). So, do not wait any longer and go see the movie ... you will be surprised in many ways.
