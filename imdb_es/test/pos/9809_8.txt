I started to see this very tense because I heard many different things about him. Somewhere I read it was a drama about child abuse and it was rated PG-13 for violence. Another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of children (and I thought it was also for the children to see). Well, now I've seen it so many times and I still do not know in what category to place it. It's extremely funny at times, but terribly sad and depressing the next moment. Due to the good relationship and the adventures, I would like to recommend this movie to all the young people I know, but I am afraid that the dark atmosphere is not suitable for children. Because of the perfect performances and the magic of the movie, I must say this anyway: Look at them, especially the children! The last thing I have to say is that I hate the writer for letting poor Bobby never see his family again after he fled El Rey (who did not even return to terrorize Mary and Mikey, who still remained). It's very good for this movie not to have a perfect happy ending with everyone happy, and I did not expect it to, but this solution left me very, very sad!
