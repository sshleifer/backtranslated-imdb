This movie was not a great movie, but it is definitely a good movie to watch with your family, especially children from 10 to 15 years old. There are good discussion topics presented in this film, like bullies, the environment and working to do things right. Jimmy Buffet's music was an advantage, and the stage was wonderful ... The young actors were excellent, and this is a movie I would expect to see on the Family Channel or on the Hallmark Channel. Except for a few words in the dialogue, a middle school could show this movie to start classroom discussions. Let's hope it shows up in Drive-ins this summer so more people can see it. Carl Hiassen's book went well, and it was fun to see him in a cameo performance.
