If you like to shoot em westerns this is a goalie. I thought the movie was fun to watch and see people I had not seen in a long time. I'm not an expert but I liked the performance. The city and the accessories, etc., seemed to adjust to the time and the type of city that would be found on the border. This is not a Western A, there are not enough people and budget. The costumes and firearms were correct for the time! I hope to see the young actors in the film again in the future. Rachel, Chance, Rebekah and Kirby were great. The members of SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) who contributed to this effort were quite good. I hope to see more.
