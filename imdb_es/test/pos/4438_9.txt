What a tribute to his father! He undertook a search to learn more about a man he knew little about, and at the end of the trip, I think Nathaniel Kahn is happy with what he learned and felt personally. The film takes 5 years and, a quarter of a century after his death, the total commitment of Louis I. Kahn in his work: a strong and constant desire to build buildings that are significant for humanity and eternal for everyone, with A vision of His life is proudly represented by his son Nathaniel in the documentary "My Architect: The Journey of a Child." <br /> <br /> The film is by no means an anthology of Louis' work. There are many books and archived materials that contain records of the projects and buildings of Louis Kahn. This documentary works like a mystery, writer and director Nathaniel Kahn was looking for the man whom he briefly knew as his father. <br /> <br /> The movie is in chapters. In "Heading West," we are at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. It is a spectacle that is worth contemplating: the integral concept of construction and environment of Kahn, optimizing light for scientists at work is amazing. From a former colleague who worked with 'Lou' 35 years ago, we learned of his meticulous attention to detail, and also of how "cunning" he could be, he certainly did not skimp on the words in his criticisms. A memorable scene is when the camera moves away and we see Nathaniel skating in the area of ​​the plaza of the Salk Institute, a small figure, like a child playing happily in the bowl of his father's hands. <br /> <br /> The "Immigrant" segment took us to meet Anne Tyng, the architect who collaborated with 'Lou' and also gave birth to a daughter, Alex. Now at age 80, the return of Tyng with Nathaniel's film crew to the Bath House project in Trenton, New Jersey, was nostalgic. In "Go to sea", we can see Barge for American Wind Symphony Orchestra, all made of steel, and meet Robert Boudreau, who was surprised by Nathaniel when he finally told him he was the son of 'Lou'. Boudreau was moved, said he had seen Nathaniel when he was six years old, with his mother (Harriet Pattison), and that he should not tell anyone that Lou had a son. It was an emotional moment of "suffocating" meeting. <br /> <br /> Like his father "The Nomad", Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem and learned about the Synagogue project that his father started but did not notice. He visited the wailing wall, and seeing that his yarmulke was still falling / being "shaken", his head gave me the feeling that he did not have to be "totally" Jewish to be his father's son. We continue to sit down with his two half sisters in the "Family Affairs" segment. We also heard him talking with his mother in Maine, and when talking to the staff from the previous office in his father's office, we got to know how his father worked intensively and practically lived there, sleeping on a carpet on the floor of the office , weekends and everything. <br /> <br /> "The End of the Journey" took us to Ahmedabad, India, to the building of the Indian Institute of Administration. Talk with the architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation. In the end, Nathaniel found a very vivid Louis Kahn, his father: his spirits live inside him. This documentary is a great tearful pull for me. His eyes were watery most of the time; It was very moving and I was impressed by the man, the architect and his son, and the women in his life, in addition to his famous works and buildings. Louis I. Kahn wanted to give his love to the "whole world", juggling work and three families (one could say that he has three women in his life to maintain his inspiration). As Shamsul Wares, the architect in the Bangladesh Capital Complex (completed 9 years after the death of 'Lou'), he pointed out in a moving way: Louis Kahn has given a lot to the people of Bangladesh, spending time in Bangladesh, understanding the culture of the place and the people. - in addition to granting them democracy through what they have achieved, and for a man so dedicated, usually, the people close to him that he often missed. It seems that the price of being big comes with inevitable personal sacrifices. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of "The Fountainhead" by King Vidor 1949 (good dramatic story in B / W with music by Max Steiner), based on the novel by Ayn Rand, with Gary Cooper as the intransigent architect who stands out for his own ideals, and Patricia Neal as the woman of parallel support in his life. <br /> <br />
