If there is beautiful horror, this movie is one of the best in this genre. It is a horror movie, which despite not being devoid of bloody scenes is based more on psychology and the masterful construction of tension to create emotions. And it's one of those beautifully filmed movies, where each scene is a world full of symbols and details, all with the scope and gender that can be called, but beautiful. <br /> <br /> It is not an easy task. story, with two sisters returning to their father's and stepmother's mansion after spending some time in a psychiatric institution. They can barely face the death of their mother and try to protect their world, defending them against the adult world. So the movie seems to be in its outermost layer. Actually, the film slowly evolves into something very different, at a slow pace, but no frame is lost to convey the feeling of exciting beauty, so I will not say much more. Look at it, it's one of the best in the Far East horror film genre that recently conquered world cinema and really shows that they did it for good reasons.
