DAY OF LAST DAYS / / <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Stereo <br /> <br /> The problem arises when a party boy from Los Angeles ( Wes Ramsey) falls in love with a handsome Mormon missionary (Steve Sandvoss). <br /> <br /> A great success on the festival circuit and a limited theatrical release, this nice film - the debut of screenwriter C. Jay Cox (SWEET HOME ALABAMA) - is an exercise in 'opposites that attract' , in which the character of Ramsey is modified forever after being difficult for the vulnerable beauty of Sandvoss, who is bound by the dictates of his religious convictions. Here, the path of true love is paved with difficulties, among which is the reaction of Sandvoss' Mormon partners to their new sexuality, which results in their excommunication from the church and the anger of their outraged parents (Mary Kay Place has a small but devastating cameo as the indignant mother of the child). But Cox's script focuses primarily on Ramsey's path to redemption, since his hedonistic lifestyle is disrupted by the Sandvoss influence, and by the responsibilities that arise as a result of his developing maturity: it is voluntary as participant of disclosure, delivering food to AIDS patients. living at home, which leads to an unexpected friendship with the former party boy Erik Palladino ("er" of television), whose illness gives Ramsey a much needed wake up call. <br /> <br /> Cox's script is filled with a juicy line and several pearls of wisdom (in Mormonism: "Does not your church like alcohol or homosexuals? Well, I will definitely not join! I can not imagine the sky without both! "), and the characters are surprisingly complex and well drawn. Ramsey has the most attractive and attractive role (he was seen for the first time doing something rude with a willing participant!), But it is Sandvoss who has become a gay icon, with his delicate interpretation of an innocent sweet character whose journey From Darkness to Light it leads to a surprising revelation about its place in the world that surrounds it. He and Ramsey are well matched, and their inevitable sex scene (brief but memorable) is followed by a compelling sequence in which Ramsey describes a childhood trauma that has defined his life to this day. <br /> <br /> Filmed in hi-video and transferred to 35mm for the theatrical display, the film's meager budget limits the scope and grandeur of Cox's ambitions, although the characters and situations are what strong enough to survive this small inconvenience. Jacqueline Bisset shines as a restorer of world wise men in the restaurant where Ramsey waits tables for a living, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("Third Rock from the Sun") steals everyone's thunder as Sandvoss' Mormon companion, in opposition to his friend's relationship with Ramsey. in principle religious ... but ONLY in principle. Although a bit forced in some places, the film suffers a romantic longing, and deserves to be applauded for its honesty and compassion. It looks better with a crowd of like-minded viewers, preferably with a loved one by your side.
