Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a problem teenager who is coming of age in a generation that was in the midst of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham does a good job portraying life in this sweet film, sometimes corny, but sincere. He gives us a look not only at the social scene, but also gives good and solid advice that are true today about morality, decisions, generational gap, teen dating (some of the statistics that appear in this movies are amazing, they sound like today's statistics). Just to see Billy in his days of youth is worth seeing. It is an incredible movie. It made me realize that human nature does not change, even though hair, fashion and language can change, humans are still struggling with the same problems they have been struggling with for thousands of years.
