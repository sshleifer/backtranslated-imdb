The End of Suburbia brings together in an orderly manner many of the concerns with the next "Peak" of the global oil supply. As the world population grows, so does the demand for oil and energy. As we extract oil and energy, we reach a "peak" in production. More oil is demanded, less oil is generated. The inevitable result is the conflict, and the important change. <br /> <br /> This movie will be annoying and alarming if you are new to the subject. You can react at first with anger and denial because the implications are very bleak. Visualization must be required. Beyond politics, beyond optimism, mathematics is undeniable. <br /> <br /> Suburbia is the focus, because our suburban living areas will be the most affected communities when the price of energy soars. While intuitive logic would tell you that large cities will be the places that should be avoided in times of crisis, the nature of the suburbs will make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us. <br /> <br /> The peak oil is no longer a topic of discussion for the survivors and crazy people. This problem will be at our door sooner than we think. This film is a lucid and coherent look.
