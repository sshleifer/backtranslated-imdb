In a critical scene, while Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) lies in the Cave of the Swimmers, she writes something read aloud by Hana (Juliette Binoche) in which she proclaims that "the light has gone out now, and I am writing " the darkness ... "A phrase of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brightness of the distant and boring English patient, with such a dramatic sweeping that keeps her firm and a force on the film that does not stop, this movie proudly celebrates the mysteries and romances of World War II, taking elements of Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia along with some Independence in the form of Tuscany. <br /> <br /> The English patient pulls the strings of the heart and it takes us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second act, and a beautiful ... beautiful final act, and it is not. Only because of the wonderful rhythm and the stage, is the performance of Ralph Fiennes, who keeps us understanding Even when Count Almásy, from the beginning, proves to be a completely unpleasant character, he usually pigeonholed as a villain, shows stained colors, but ultimately human like a ho man trapped by a desperate love he must fulfill. <br /> <br /> Many will criticize this movie for its so-called "glorification of adulterers". "But those who do not know anything." The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the beginning) are spectacular, since the patient is the man who laments that he suffers for what he did, the evil that a Once he was in it now absent, whereas the man from Before the shock is an individual like any other person He wants this woman but can not have it, Fiennes takes the human qualities from Almásy in a way that absolutely NO OTHER actor could have I could not have been a better actor for work. <br /> <br /> So, take these comments seriously, watch the movie, those who call it "boring" or "despicable" do not know anything and should be ashamed of such a one-dimensional vision of the film, a vision that they have not studied or corrected, and probably do not plan to correct.The English patient is the best of every film that has won the Oscar for the best film, and for many reasons, hidden in his poetic triumphs
