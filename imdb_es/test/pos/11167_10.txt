The ABC version of the late Pope's life: they put it a bit ahead of the CBS version and may have suffered for that, but the program itself was excellent. He moved quickly since he only had two hours (and the ads also took time) to cover the long life of this great man, but admirably Thomas Kretschmann was up to the challenge. He did an extraordinary job to convey the emotions and the struggle that John-Paul endured. Unlike the CBS biopic, he played the role from youth to old age and managed to appear "realistic" at both ends of the scale. His credibility never wavered. It has a surprising scope and depth. It's a pity that the program was not longer and more detailed, but when working within the deadline they had, I think they did an excellent job of bringing it to the small screen.
