Well, someone who enjoys traveling on the road at 120 km / h, eat McDonalds and run the air conditioning twenty-four seven, and watching Fox News without stopping, I found this documentary interesting. One thing I learned, when they were talking about North America, I assumed that this documentary was Fabrique Au Canadie. For the attack on Canada, I'll leave it to Bill O'Reilly. <br /> <br /> The consequence of oil depletion will affect everyone, especially those who live in the large countries of Australia, Canada and the United States. I am sure that Green Peace is not encouraging more gas, it means that there will be no more SUV, without realizing that people living in sub-zero temperatures could die of hunger. <br /> <br /> As someone who has studied economics, I am sure we are living in a world of finite resources. I will give the documentary support to try to present a balanced view on the depletion of oil. However, I am studying a degree in journalism, this documentary is full of loaded messages, Republicans and warmongers. That the democrats did not send troops to Vietnam? <br /> <br /> If you are going to present a documentary about economy and resources, it is better to leave the political attack aside, since it could make a possible member of the audience close completely. Concentrate on the topic of finite resources. At the end of the day, it is better to open the minds of the mainstream, since it is not a good preaching to the tiny chorus. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy watching documentaries like Fahrenheit 911 and End of Suburbia not because of their political bias, because they remind us that the world is not so safe. Of course I like to buy, and eat junk food as if there were no tomorrow, but if the world is going to end tomorrow, I would rather die rich and consume the live beep. <br /> <br /> For possible creators of documentaries that exist, just provide data to people and let viewers make their own decisions. If you are trying to group your political opinions as a balanced documentary, people will smell a rat a mile away.
