Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But in reality all the characters are incredibly fun to watch. <br /> <br /> (MINOR SPOILERS) As usual, the main character, B, is the group's sane. B has the crazy idea of ​​inventing his own university when he is rejected from all the universities to which he is running. He is known to make false identifications. therefore, an acceptance letter is not a problem. <br /> <br /> Because B's father is a tough @ $$ and is a suspect at this university he has never heard of, B has his friend Sherman design a website for the university. Sherman has been accepted into a large university and is afraid of being arrested for fraud. He is very quick with witty lines, but his fault is that he wants to be socially accepted too. <br /> <br /> Glen, Hands and Rory are the three henchmen who follow B along. Glen got a zero on his SAT exams and has no thought process. He is constantly proposing royal battles, but he is very good at making smoothies, which makes him win many hot girls, in some way. Hands was a great soccer player who did not receive the scholarship he had, and he resorts to handicrafts to cover his lack of athleticism. Rory was preparing to go to Yale from the 1st grade, and it was not accepted. She spends her time meditating. <br /> <br /> Uncle Ben was my favorite character. Imagine Lewis Black playing himself. If you have no reason to see this movie, then see it for Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. They are incredible. <br /> <br /> Monica is B's love interest. As most of these stories go, she is more popular than him and does not even notice it until the middle of the movie. However, unlike many other stories, B actually catches her and keeps her until the end. Monica is actually a good character by herself, but, of course, she is mainly there for B to love. <br /> <br /> There are more support students at the invented university who are fun to watch. The name of A.D.D. It is self-explanatory, and funny enough to end in the meditation class. Kiki is a sexy former stripper who falls madly for the chance to go to school and finally falls in love with Glen. Maurice is a former military idiot who got his G.I. Bill and he wants to study rock n 'roll in college. The final guy is only known as Freaky Student, who believes he can fly things with his mind. Those who have little faith in him wait until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the villains are the dean of an opposite university, the president of the student body of his university, the president's girlfriend and his circle of friends. . <br /> <br /> Each character is adorable. I think this movie has a good plot and it is well done, despite what many people say. Even though the general story is predictable, the characters keep you guessing and make the movie great. Go see this movie. I give 9 of 10.
