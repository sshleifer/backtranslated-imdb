"Back in the Day" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule plays Reggie Cooper, an honest but sad man who tries to deal with the death of his father. Meet his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now you have to choose: Love or crime. <br /> <br /> Ja Rule does a competent job like Reggie. At least he is trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone. He brings a lot of energy and threat in the paper. Joe Morton as a preacher is his usual excellent self, but not long ago. The same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as Reggie's father. I needed more time on the screen. I do not mean this, but Pam Grier is as horrible as Mrs. Cooper. She exceeds every scene and drops the movie. Tia Carrere and Frank Langella are in it, but they do not do anything substantial for the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end: you should see him for the skills of Ving Rhames and Joe Morton and the evil of Scripture and direction.
