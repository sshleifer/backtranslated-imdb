This telenovela film from 1959 takes us to the lives and loves of three young people in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A SOURCE a few years before. This takes place in New York, while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first leading role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and has opposite to some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has difficulty losing her boyfriend. It is hard to believe that anyone can reject this beauty for any reason, but Louis Jourdan, his heart palpitates, does just this. Something like that takes you back to Paul Neuman rejecting the beautiful Elizabth Taylor in CAT ON A HOT RED ROOF, is not it? Diane Baker, the third damsel in distress, meets and leaves with Robert Evans, before becoming producer and husband of Ali MacGraw, for whom he is known. Hope's boyfriend at home, played by newcomer Brett Halsey, promises to marry her. He also meets Stephen Boyd, a co-worker, who has interests in our Hope. The three ladies have their drama ahead. Crawford almost steals the movie. It's fun to watch her presence and her usual and strong bitch. Veteran actor Brian Aherne plays one of the bosses with a yen for pinching the back of our top ladies. He is delightfully charming. Also in the cast is Martha Hyer, wasted in an ungrateful role that was never really explored. Too bad I like this actress who never seems to have that role to distinguish her abilities. She is in love with a married man in the office played by Donald Harron, with whom I had the pleasure of working on a couple of Shakespeare plays in New York. He is also a distinguished actor who is wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, it is very funny, in tecnicolor and cinemascope, directed by Jean Negulesco.
