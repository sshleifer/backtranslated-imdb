This is another of John Travolta's "come back" films, and if he continues with characters and films like this, he will regain his position. <br /> <br /> This is so sweet ... sickly, so if you do not like romantic comedy. If you are, this is an innovative RomCom. Each performance (including that of Skippy the Dog) was beautiful, without much more than a trace of the irreverence found in "Dogma". (Although, as the movies go by, I loved the Dogma!) <br /> <br /> Travolta is not as bold in his performance as the advances would lead him to believe. He is an angel and if you consider yourself well read, then you understand that the angels were far from perfect. You will not be, therefore, insulted by this movie. Even those who are too sensitive to such things should not be insulted by this work, since Nora did everything possible to ensure that it was as abrasive as possible, given the subject. <br /> <br /> I love this, and I love it more every time I see it. It is beautiful and sweet, attractive and endearing. <br /> <br /> Rate a 7.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
