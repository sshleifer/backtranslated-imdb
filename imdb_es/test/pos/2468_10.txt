I was lucky to have found this movie. I've been taking advantage of Walmart's $ 5.50 DVDs, because I watch a lot of movies (and I rarely watch TV). I graduated from high school in 1968, so I have family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This movie really illustrates the pain I've seen in my friends when dealing with what happened to them there. I wish more people would see this movie. I think that maybe more people can understand what happened to our Vietnam veterans when we see these excellent actors representing a family damaged by that war. The story felt realistic, it's not soft, but it made me feel what they were going through. I think it helped that Martin Sheen and Emilio Est√©vez played father and son, which made their relationship more credible.
