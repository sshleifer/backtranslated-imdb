This awaited DVD memory of Rush's visit to South America in 2002 is possibly the best rock video recorded on the album. The values ​​of production of image and sound are incredible, even more, since they fought constantly against the elements to start up this production. All the clues that I would expect from the RUSH catalog are here, from Tom Sawyer to The Pass, reproduced in a glorious way for the Brazilian crowd, frankly orgiastic. the disc is the concert and the second disc contains 3 pieces of various angles: Villa Strangiato, YYZ and the impressive drum solo, plus a 30 minute documentary about the bands' visit to Brazil. All this is a triumph and all serious fans of classic rock should have a copy.
