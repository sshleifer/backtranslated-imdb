"The Honkers" is probably the best performance of Slim Pickens of all time. When we were filming, everyone who was connected to the production thought that Slim was the material of the Academy Award. Unfortunately, United Artists had a picture of James Bond released at the same time and did not pay much attention to "The Honkers". Personally, I feel that this movie was underestimated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's "Junior Bonner" came out at the same time and seemed to impress critics more than our movie. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo movie a few months before our release and that could have hurt us too. It is worth seeing the image, if only for the rodeo recording, some of the best filmed, taken by James Crabbe. The director and my co-author, Steve Ianat, died a few weeks after the film's release, interrupting a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife Sally, his daughter Gaby and their newborn son, Stefan. Please, give this movie a chance. I bet you'll say it was worth it. I thank anyone who has taken the time to read this. Stephen Lodge
