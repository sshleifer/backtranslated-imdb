The first completely synchronized sound cartoon, the Walt Disney Mickey Mouse makes its screen debut in the exceptional and entertaining short cartoon theme "Steamboat Willie". Mickey is a worker on a steamboat under the supervision of Captain Peg Leg Pete (or Pete, as it would be called later). Mickey tackles his longtime companion, Minnie Mouse, on board the train while they have fun, while Mickey tries to impress Minnie. This short was tremendously fun and positively entertaining. The animators Ubbe Iwerks, Rudolph Ising and Hugh Harman helped Walt in the creation of the short film. "Steamboat Willie" marks essentially the beginning of the Walt Disney Company's success.
