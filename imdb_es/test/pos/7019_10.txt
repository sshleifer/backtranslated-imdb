When the dirty dance was on TV in the middle of last year, I went out, so I could not see it, my mother swore that she had seen it and had it recorded somewhere. Anyway, it got to the point where she could not find her video, so for Christmas I bought her the DVD, well, she has not taken a look. He sat for a while and then one night I decided to take him upstairs to see him. I fell in love with him. This is a great movie with many lovely scenes! I love the plot and I enjoyed every moment of it! It's definitely not for everyone, but if you love a love story, you'll want to see Dirty Dancing over and over again. Dirty Dance - The way love means to be!
