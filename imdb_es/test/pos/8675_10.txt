Totally different, with a lot of underestimation and black comedy, this is a movie that few can see, but those who do will remember it. This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way. What is it about? The estrangement, I think. It probably depends on the viewer, but I discovered that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and the perfect facades. I do not know if I'm right. But this movie really affected me. Look at it. I really hope that the team behind this film makes more films, and that they continue to do it in their own style, something strange. And I forgot: the Cast here is excellent, with Trond Fausa Aurv√•g being perfect in the role of Crazy Man, who does not understand where he is, what he is doing and why. The recognition of not understanding the purpose of life (in the city) is what bothers him. Everyone else does what they are told and pretend (?) To be happy. This movie is a good and humorous commentary on life in 2006.
