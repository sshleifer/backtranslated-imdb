I found this show by accident and was surprised to discover that nobody I know had heard of it. This was by far one of the best shows I've seen in months, if not in years, and I can not wait for more episodes to come out. Sleeper Cell portrays the psychological struggle of an undercover agent within a terrorist cell that has to make difficult decisions constantly to maintain its coverage while remaining true to its real cause. This is an extremely well done show. It keeps you intrigued from the first episode to the end and, although it moves slowly, it's fast enough so that you sit on the edge. Quite realistic and human, it touches important topics and each episode presents an interesting question to reflect on. This program is not 24 or any of the police programs on television and neither does it try to be anything. It is genuine and unique. It is a show about a human being, his difficult decisions and his life of struggle where a simple mistake can cost him everything. <br /> <br /> I gave this show a 10 for a great story, good progression, excellent cinematography, excellent music and realistic characters each with a story to tell.
