This multi-level thriller kept my attention at all times. It is disturbing and informative to see how human behavior can be perverse. It is also instructive as to what past injuries can motivate present behavior. No one, except Sandra Bullock's partner, is very nice. However, they are all credible. Sandra did an excellent job. His character, Cassie, comes alive with all his pain, fear and defenses. She is a survivor and her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment. I enjoyed this movie very much. Tom Landers
