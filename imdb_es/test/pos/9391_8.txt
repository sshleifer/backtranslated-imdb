"Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is an extremely strange horror movie that really has to be seen to be believed. There is an old four-poster bed that loves to eat humans and does so at any time that can make anyone lie. There is also a long-dead artist, imprisoned behind one of his paintings, which offers a narration aloud. The first and only film by George Barry offers some truly surreal moments, like the bed that absorbs its victims in a mysterious sea of ​​yellow foam and liquid. The atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a bit of blood, unfortunately the premise is quite silly and the performance is amateur. Even as a fan of unusual cinema I enjoyed this low budget rarity. chance.8 of 10.
