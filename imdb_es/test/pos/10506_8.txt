This movie, without a doubt, will not go well with some, because most of the horror is mental. But it has something for almost everyone, including a couple of really cool abduction scenes with aliens. The film makes extensive use of the mythology of alien abduction, while also showing a little more intelligence about some facets of abduction myths than would be expected from a movie. Jillian McWhirter is excellent in what must have been an exhausting performance.
