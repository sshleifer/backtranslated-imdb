I can not rate this very well, because I can not say that I liked it. But it's the story that bothered me, not the making of the movie. The acting, the direction, the atmosphere, the music were good. It's just that after seeing a group of people doing things that you can not really relate to, the movie ends. It's educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war seen from home and the way that feelings do not have to make any sense and be strong, but that's it. <br /> <br /> The plot covers a period of a few years in which the poet Dylan Thomas is brought under the roof of an ex-girlfriend. He is married, he brings his wife and then the boy, while the ex (Knightley) marries another man. But the tension is there, Dylan is an imbecile obsessed with ego and the new husband returns home from the war with a mild case of post-traumatic stress disorder. Add some pretty temperamental characters and your hands are full. <br /> <br /> In a few words: you have to be "in the mood" to like this movie. The difficult part is to define this state of mind. I think I've never been in that. Forever. Therefore, adults are likely to see it better with an understanding of the strange complex human behavior and perhaps a curiosity about Dylan Thomas.
