The movie was surprisingly wonderful, especially considering the latest sequel. The third was dark and semi interesting, but it was not as fun or as fun as this one. It is full of comic lines about Martha Stuart, the anatomy of the doll, masturbation, and actually was done effectively during frightening and disturbing images. The film was not scary and had no suspense and I'm sure it was not the director's intention. It was fun because of the stupidity, Jennifer Tilly over the sexy performance. The puppets of the dolls were so well handled, the movement of the mouth, the lips, the tears in the eyes, the knife in the chest and the disguises. The dolls were wonderful and made the dreadful deaths more annoying considering the fact that they were made by wonderful dolls. Chucky's new look was great and Tiffany was very cute. Some scenes with Chucky hugging the human Tiffany even made my father smile. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly good, very attractive and the special effects were great. The end was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another so good is quite unlikely. It may not be as exciting as movies like Halloween H2O or Urban Legend, but it's definitely more fun.
