By finding the intriguing premise, reading the reviews and being an Angel fan, I watched this movie. It's sexy and original, and quite entertaining. David Boreanaz is Keith. He is a married man, stays at home, dad, and feels a bit inadequate in his marriage. He makes the mistake of penetrating a close circle of teenagers who are fascinated with the idea of ​​doing so with an older man. They will do anything to get into their bed, even beg, lie and blackmail, but mostly try to push their buttons. The madness that ensues makes Keith wobble, and takes friends to the limit. David Boreanaz shows some skin in this ... and looks sexy. Yes, he plays a trick of poor quality, but shows enough vulnerability and tenderness towards the silly teenagers that in the end you end up encouraging him. One more thing, when someone moans "oh yeah, oh..oh..YEAH !!", it's hard to see them as a rape victim.
