And a perfect movie to watch during the holiday season, since the winter / Christmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is great. It's strange that Warner decided to release this as a summer movie. Does not fit. <br /> <br /> But what is even stranger, when you consider the content of this movie, is that it was aimed at families. A high class family throws its mutant baby into the sewer, a socio-phobic billionaire dresses in leather like a flying rodent, a lonely secretary dresses in leather like a feline and a freak runs to the political office. And S & M and bondage are presented in a very perverted way. But Burton got away with it. His visual style in this movie is the best. <br /> <br /> This and Batman: Dead End are the only real-life incarnations of the comic book character. It is true that the animated series was the closest to the source material, but compared to Batman Forever and the unmistakable after that, Batman Returns is the best of the four. <br /> <br /> Darker and more violent than the First film, the sense of Gothic pathos reaches a new height. I was quite interested in Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (I do not even mean George Clooney!), He showed the perfect balance between the loner and the crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is great as Catwoman (much sexier and more "realistic" as a cat), she wears that leather outfit better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was as convincing as the penguin that his scenes became disturbing to watch. And Christopher Walken is brilliant as the spooky Max Shreck (if you think you recognize Chip Shrek, it's none other than a very young Leatherface / Butterfinger). <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman's score is also even better than the first time. round. His powerful and attractive themes are much better than the scum that followed in the last 2 Schumacher films. This movie is the phenomenon of Batman in his Zenith. Forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this. Let's hope that Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale can bring some integrity to the live action of Batman with his film next year. <br /> <br /> This DVD was one of the first DVDs released by Warner (almost 7 years ago!) and as a result there are NO features and the case is a snapper. Collect it cheaply as I did and expect an SE in the future.
