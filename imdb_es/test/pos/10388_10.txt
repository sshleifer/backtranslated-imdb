If you speak French or can support subtitles, you will really enjoy this movie. If, on the other hand, you only want to see the most beautiful creatures of God, this is a must. Not an ounce of silicone in sight. Zalman King eats your heart. The body of Sophie Marceau is the epitome of perfection and everything she had fantasized about. His part is even in English. Even the fact that she was naked with John Malkovich did not detract from her beauty. Sophie is a ten if there was ever one. Chiara Caselli and In√©s Sastre are 9.5s. Oh yes, it's a pretty good story. Several small vignettes are woven together in a kind of six-degree separation style.
