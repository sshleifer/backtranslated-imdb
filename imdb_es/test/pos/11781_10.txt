The hysterical Hardware War is finally available on DVD. HW has earned its niche among parody classics and not only is it a bit 20 minutes, but a staple in low-budget movie production classes, which is where a large part of the status derives from and resides of cult of the movie. With the DVD, we not only have the opportunity to review the original parody (4Q2, Cinnamon-Bun Head, Ballistic Toast, et al.) That Ernie F. did in 1978, but there is a lot of additional material that shows the ingenuity of Fosselio. . Antique Sideshow is a parody without limits that is very funny but at the same time makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed. The Director's Commentary is also hysterical, as is the Feature of the Creature that parodies making a movie in the circuit of a talk show and, in reality, relies on taking HW out on the talk show circuit, although be the public access circuit. I would love to see Ernie, Michael Wiese and his team confront other exaggerated and overbudgeted contemporary goals to parody, like almost any movie that Hollywood produces $ 100 million dollars these days, not so much the shrewd films. like Spider Man or Men In Black (they actually parody themselves!) but any number of features overrated, overvalued, overvalued and overrated. <br /> <br />
