This is speculation. This movie could have inspired Paramount Pictures to shoot the movie The Core. Both films have something in common nature. The only improvement for Inferno is a better deal. However, the cast of hell is still good. Excellent movie 8 out of 10. This is worth seeing. This movie has truth that heat waves are real. Another part of the truth is the power cuts related to heat. Where I live I have really listened to the transformers. Discomfort from the heat is possible because people looking to cool off can become noisy. There is a considerable amount of teamwork in this movie. Again this is a movie that is worth seeing. The movie has a good cast. The movie does not have slow points.
