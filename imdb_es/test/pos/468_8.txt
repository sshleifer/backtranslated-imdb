I watched the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World premiere). <br /> <br /> A disturbing and intimate portrait of Soledad, and the repercussions of letting it grow and become something darker. <br /> <br /> The performance of the two protagonists (Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage) is excellent, and makes you wish you had known these characters before they got so damaged. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the theme of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where I'm Calling From). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and reinforces the moments of the film without attracting attention. <Br /> <br /> I recommend the movie and the soundtrack.
