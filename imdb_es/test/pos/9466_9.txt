This film is full of charming situations and healthy and easy to use young people, whether they are wearing clothes or not. The strong superstructure of its plot is confirmed by the art of Shakespeare. As Joseph Papp discovered in the 1950s in Central Park, Shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present. And, therefore, the classic tales of transvestism and other antics found in such playful comedies as Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night's and As You Like It are used to good effect in this film. All the young actors and actresses do a good job in advancing the plot with their blockade, dialogue and wardrobe. And the idea of ​​a football game to bring things to a climax reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham, another lovely movie coming of age.
