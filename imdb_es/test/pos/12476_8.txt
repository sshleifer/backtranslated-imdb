Very good movie about a man and his wife who are caught by the murder and the police officer who investigates the case. It starts off wonderfully, but to a certain degree it hits a wall. We are sure that we know what happened, then a little thread of the plot that seems at first like a false track appears again and disappoints. Still, Clouzot's direction is excellent, and the acting is pretty good. Louis Jouvet, who also co-starred in Drôle de Drame by Marcel Carné, gives the best performance as the intelligent detective. I wonder if the Coen brothers were influenced by this movie when they wrote Fargo. Like that movie, the police officer does not appear until almost half, and then it becomes almost the focus of the movie. There is also a lot of funny comedy that surrounds him (although sometimes his methods seem a bit fascist).
