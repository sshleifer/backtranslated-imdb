The 13th and final RKO film Falcon begins with Tom Conway's mutual interdict as Tom Lawrence aka Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie of "No ladies!" While they prepare to go on vacation. While you're still wondering what they're going to go on vacation, since they had not had a job since the beginning of the first film in 1941 (with Sanders as Gay and Jenkins as Goldie), they run into a woman and are dragged. in a seedy industrial espionage caper. <br /> <br /> They promise to help her when they kill her uncle, by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to make industrial diamond substitutes to her business colleague in Miami. Do you all suspect here, except the cops who are behind Lawrence? and Goldie for the murder. To console herself, Goldie continues to paraphrase the travel brochures: "On the coldest day, you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice, cozy electric chair." Some nice and languorous nightclub scenes rub shoulders with bad behavior from bad guys. Favorite bit: the game worthy to hide and seek / hunt the thimble that the imperturbable and soft Lawrence has with the bad guys in the train of the sleepers. What is the most shameful scene of the entire series in the caiman fighting cabin? It was definitely launched for the kids! <br /> <br /> In general, it is not the best of the series, but another entertaining activity, with a satisfactory plot in general and many episodes, even in this, that I would like to have continued. for a few more years, as Columbia did with Boston Blackie, although RKO was producing them faster. Absolutely no sex, not a lot of violence (in fact, none at all by today's high standards), and no message makes this type of film anatomy so serious for serious people who can only watch movies as a way to art that should depend on these three pillars. <br /> <br /> Three Diet Falcon's were made later with John Calvert in the lead role, I do not care, but I never dared count them in the main series, which Tom Conway had created for himself. hour. It is also sad that after this it was all downhill for Conway, who moved to the television, to the voice-overs and even played Norman Conquest in Park Plaza 605 quite well in 1953. He also developed serious problems with his eyes and alcohol? I do not know if they were linked ?? He ended poverty and after an attack in the hospital in 1967, he was found dead in his girlfriend's bed. For us, the people who love, at least, still have their 10 entertained Falcon, plus a number of other RKO films worthy, even classic, from 1942 to 1946 with which to remember.
