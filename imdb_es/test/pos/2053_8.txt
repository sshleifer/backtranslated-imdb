A wonderful Christmas story about the moving theme of "Susie Homemaker finds her inner Amazon." No I'm serious! The amnesia of Geena Davis begins to improve when hit on the head. From this family beginning, we move in an unexpected direction. Good rhythm, good action, funny story, many explosions and chaos.
