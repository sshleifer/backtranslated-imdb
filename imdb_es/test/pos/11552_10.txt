I saw Pola X because Scott Walker composed the soundtrack and I really admire his music. Frankly, I expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent French film. I was wrong. The vision of the film managed to catch my attention quickly, beginning with the opening sequence, which shows black and white images of military aircraft throwing bombs at tombs for the sounds of music and the beautiful voice of Scott Walker's wails. The film explores Pierre's identity crisis (Guillaume Depardieu, a brilliant choice for the role) and its consequent (self) destruction. The story is divided into two parts? the first shows the carefree life of Pierre in a beautiful house in the French countryside and the second follows his personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to Paris to live in misery with his supposed half sister. Both parts contain an amazingly impressive photograph? The first, very colorful and bright, the second completely dark and almost apocalyptic, which adds to a real aesthetic party. Pola X is a fascinating and quite unique cinematic experience.
