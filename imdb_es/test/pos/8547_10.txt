I saw this movie years ago and I never forgot it. The topic is very timely. I was at TCM this morning and I wonder why this wonderful movie is not on VHS or DVD. I have searched extensively for this film, but I can not find it. I think if enough people request it, the movie will finally be put on DVD. I'm surprised that such an impressive performance by Quinn and such a powerful plot are not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must-see for teachers and students alike. This film is a great teaching tool from the past, but in many ways as contemporary as "Crash". From the comments above, I can see that this movie caused deep impressions on everyone. Again, very badly, it is not available for sale.
