First of all, let it be known that I entered this movie, not because of the music; Actually I find it disgusting. Actually, I was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture. At this point, the documentary did quite well. An unpleasant aspect were the numerous scenes in which the songs are reproduced and the exaggerated band and the belligerent crowd are shown insane. If you've seen the first scene, you've seen them all. This superfluity is compensated by the printing of lyrics for some of the songs. With these, the audience is able to connect mentally with the band. The lyrics are much more interesting than the mix of sounds that are projected from the speakers. I do not know why all the letters were not printed. Scenes without slow lyrics (ironic, given the numerous references to the speed of music) of the flow of the film. Interviews with fans and bands were also insightful, although there is a disappointment when the interviews of the last band are not as fascinating or as fun as the first two. In general, a good movie that I'm glad to have seen. I'll check the follow-ups if I ever have an opportunity. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quote: He tried to hide the fact that he could not play by rubbing peanut butter on him and breaking a glass. <br /> <br /> Broad generalization of punk: although their shame, lack of vocabulary and hygiene, and drug-induced forgetfulness are often fun, in the end it is understood that punks are just pathetic youngsters who rebel for the simple fact of rebellion as seen through the second year letters and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize (without taking into account Black Flag, which are a little less wrong than their peers).
