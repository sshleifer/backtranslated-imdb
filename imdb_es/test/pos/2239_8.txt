I was just watching the 100 movies below according to the IMDb users to see if there was anything to check that I have not yet found and I found this little gem on the screen. One of those times when you see a movie classified as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that you really like. Damn it, well, I suppose I'll be ridiculed and spit on here, but for me it was a good movie when I saw it. It has been a while, however, I remember that I used to appear on HBO late at night, I saw it two or three times and I have not really seen it since then and would love to see it now knowing that Jolie was in it. The story follows a cyborg and a boy trying to escape from the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them. I think that's basically all you have to do, release some scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie. A good action here and there, and also some blood and violence. There is also a love story in play, just like the female cyborg and the boy who trained her to fight and fall in love with each other. The dialogue sometimes gets pretty bad sometimes and it's not a first level movie, but for a B movie it's really good. I do not know if it was a theatrical premiere because it does not seem to be high enough for that, but if it is one of those, it makes it one of the best direct videos.
