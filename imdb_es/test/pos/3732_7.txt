WTF !! Do any of your books / movies end in a happy ending? The notebook was good ... but, it is enough with the depressing endings. They tell me that he writes about realistic situations that people face in real life. Understandable ... but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their entire lives to reach only a mediocre and unhappy moment in their lives, to finally find the true meaning of happiness and be able to live it for the rest of their days . . Do not we already know what really happens in real life? Can we not, for a moment (an hour and a half) live indirectly through a film that ends with a happy note, which gives us hope for our own future? <br /> <br /> Yes - wah. I know. But, really, I think we need to preface films that end like this with a warning. "Be careful: there is no happy ending".
