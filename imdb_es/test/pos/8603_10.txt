Black Rain is an excellent movie, but watch out for DVDs that currently sell for up to $ 300 each. I have the DVD, and it's terrible. Very small non-anamorphic image that must be flown to a size that kills the resolution. Acceptable sound This is a primitive DVD that absolutely * must * be republished. <br /> <br /> By the way, I also own the Laserdisc and the Black Rain VHS. VHS is a big step up from the DVD! And the laserdisc has, by far, the best image of them all: black subtitles, sharp, large image, simple but very good soundtrack. Buy the VHS and avoid the absurd prices that these scammers demand!
