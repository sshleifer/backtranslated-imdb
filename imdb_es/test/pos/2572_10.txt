I guess this is what is called Southern Gothic. <br /> <br /> It stars Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and Justin Timberlake appears on paper. Timberlake does a good job, to my surprise, I did not expect it from him. <br /> <br /> When you are lost and you can not find the way home, that is the moan of the black snake. <br /> <br /> The people in this film are definitely lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson plays a blues singer / musician whose wife has had problems with his brother and now he left him for his brother, in addition to aborting a child he hoped to have with her. <br /> <br /> The character of Christina Ricci is a woman who was sexually abused when she was young, this has turned her into a self-destructive nympho; allowing men to treat her badly. <br /> <br /> The story is at the intersection of the life of these two characters. It is a love story, but not a story of sexual love, among them, the older black man and the white young woman. <br /> <br /> It's different from most of the movies that Hollywood criticizes. <br /> <Br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
