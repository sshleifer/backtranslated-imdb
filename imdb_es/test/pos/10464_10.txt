This film embodies the soul of the modern culinary culture of "elite", although the film is 17 years old. The principle of the film is: food is more than just nutritious matter. It is also a powerful symbol and a medium for culture itself. The main characters literally get drunk with the best wine and food, are inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture, as they abandon their Puritanism and table manners that deny passion. Karen Blixens' short story makes use of the difference between northern Europe and southern Europe, to point out their intrinsically different approaches to food. As the strict and rather boring Scandinavians are infused with "Eros" from the south, the party starts. So, what are you waiting for? Go see it ... again!
