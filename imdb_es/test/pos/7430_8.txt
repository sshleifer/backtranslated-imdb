Errol Flynn had a great gift for comedy that, unfortunately, was rarely exploited. Considering the right material, this film proves that I could have been happily at home in the style of Cary Grant, soft comedies. Of his various forays into the genre, this is undoubtedly the best. Patti Brady offers excellent performance in the children's part and Eleanor Parker looks simply stunning throughout the film. An additional advantage is the wonderful Hattie McDaniel, who is sadly underutilized in this film, a welcome presence, nonetheless. Flynn carries out his comic duties with the same easy style that he carried to his braggart papers. The fact that it makes it look like it's easy does not mean it is easy. A super small family comedy, great for the Christmas period or any other time when you feel like being animated.
