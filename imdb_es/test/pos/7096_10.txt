The reason why I think this movie is fabulous is that it has many layers of emotion. By the script and the fabulous acting, you can say that there is a story behind all the feelings that there are. You understand why the characters take certain actions and why they do not do others. You can feel sympathy, joy, love and sorrow for all at once. You see humanity at its best And at its worst. You can relate to the characters because, although you have never been in their exact situations, before you see qualities and disadvantages in them that you see in yourself. To a certain extent, this movie makes you think, but in the end it is explained and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but also by the characters. I will say that I have never cried so much in my life nor have I taken so much advantage of anything. I implore you to watch this movie and take its meaning seriously. That there is only one true thing and that is ... love.
