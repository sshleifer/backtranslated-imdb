Midnight Madness is a film that, unfortunately, is very underestimated and underappreciated. With an avalanche of classic "adolescent" and university films, this was forgotten. As a child I watched this movie again and again, luckily I had it on video. This film shows a more tame, but more exciting side of the eighties. In the cynical society we live in today, with the misuse of drugs as "the best", it's good to see, from time to time, an innocent and funny movie that is Midnight Madness ... that's if you can find it . .
