This is not so much a review of A Tale Of Two Sisters as a discussion of some of the smaller details of the plot, so I advise you NOT to read this review if you have not seen the film, because doing so will absolutely ruin some surprises for you. <br /> <br /> In a way, A Tale Of Two Sisters is far from original, at least from a purely superficial point of view: part of its iconography is taken directly from Ring or Dark Water, while History itself ( especially what Brendt Sponseller calls the "rubber reality" aspect of the narrative) reminds of films like Fight Club (the main character interacts with someone created in his mind), Mulholland Drive (the character creates an alternate reality in a psychogenic escape ), as well as other minor aspects of Lost Highway, Jacob's Ladder, and basically all the movies under the sun that deal with mental illnesses, plus the films of Amenabar (The Others, Abre los Ojos), Memento (especially in relation to nature tortuous of memory), et al. Fortunately, all these similarities do not detract from the overall emotional impact of the film, and I personally think that A Tale Of Two Sisters is an extremely moving and rewarding experience. <br /> <br /> Many people have commented on the "confusing" nature of Narrative, but I personally found that the story is self-explanatory, even if it is partly represented in a non-sequential way. The narrative only becomes confusing for some because, in the middle of the last third, the story changes from a purely subjective scenario (ie, the distorted perception of Soo-Mi's reality) to an objective one, with a flashback at the end that explains the origins of Soo. -The nervous breakdown of my mother and her subsequent mental illness. The change of emphasis is bound to mislead some people, but structurally I found it somewhat reminiscent of the mentioned Mulholland Drive (although we are not dealing with the perception of the reality of a character through a dream, but with their own schizophrenic tendencies, something that, in turn, reminded me of another Lynch movie, Lost Highway). To be honest, I do not really consider A Tale Of Two Sisters as a horror movie as such, but rather as a tragic story of the breakup of a family, as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness (and I hurry to add that the fans of psychoanalytic cinema will love this movie). <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the cinematography in A Tale Of Two Sisters is amazing and, visually, this is one of the most beautiful films I've seen on this side of Wong. Kar Wai's 2046. The performances are also fantastic without exception, and I hope to see more of the four main actors in the future; Not to mention music, but East Asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be very few these days. <br /> <br /> It is very likely that some people look beyond the finer artistic points of A Tale Of Two Sisters and simply dismiss it as "another Asian horror movie", oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and its focus honest psychoanalytic. But then each one to his own. If you can ignore some of the aspects of the movie and just take it for what it is in the background, that is. An extremely tragic and heartbreaking story, so I see no reason not to recommend it.
