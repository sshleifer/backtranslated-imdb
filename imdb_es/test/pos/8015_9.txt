These were two video movies that Troama decided were horrible, so in a desperate move it became this movie. Maybe the bitterness on the Troama side helped ignite the comedy, but for some reason, this is a very funny thing with a little inspiration with "Oliver Stone" making comments during the movie. A lot of cameos, a lot of use of the song Lesbian Cannibal HoeDown add to the fun. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain, etc. etc ... <br /> <br /> One of the best recent Troama releases. Yes, it is everywhere, you know that entering, the quality of production, or the lack of it, becomes one of the many jokes. Go with him and he will have a good time. <br /> <br /> The hidden scenes, often the best things about the Troama releases are also above average on this occasion. I really think that the anger they felt for these two terrible films helped them, but not the greatness, but it led them to "fix" this movie in a better way than any of the films would have been as originally planned.
