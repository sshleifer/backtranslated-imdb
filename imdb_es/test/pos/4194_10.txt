I admit that, in the past, I had the opportunity to see this movie, and after approximately 5 to 10 minutes, I felt that many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead they gave me ... well, I did not know what I had been given to be honest. <br /> <br /> However, after finally seeing In this movie, I realized that not only was my mind closed to the brightness it represents, but I was also looking at it again and again. It's the only movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to decipher its meaning. And just when I think I've discovered something in the movie, their response is destroyed when I watch the movie again. Brightness by the way. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people who did not like this movie want to see a movie with a clear plot. They want everything explained and all the questions answered in the end. Well, I'm sorry, if that's what you want, this is not the movie for you. But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and, better yet, its sequels), I think you'll appreciate the stimulating experience that this film will give you. <br /> <br /> Think of the movie as a dream. . In our dreams, things do not make sense, the things we expect to happen, people, places and things do not speak, act or work in the same way they do in reality. Complaining about "Head" is like complaining about a dream you've had and that you felt you could not understand. The mind is a complex system, and since a movie called "Head" is just as complex, is it so difficult to relate the two? <br /> <br /> Music (and musical numbers) really stand out, especially Peter Tork's two compositions, which are still the best tracks in the film, "Can You Dig It?" and "Long title: Do I have to do this again and again?" <br /> <br /> This movie shows that The Monkees were much more than four Zanny guys in a "pre-fabulous" group (as their critics called them) on a television show, but they are actually much smarter and talented of what the world would give them credit. There are so many messages that can be derived from the film, both in regard to The Monkees and the "entertainment industry" in general, which stands as a masterpiece of cinematography that was ahead of its time. <br /> I think that if this movie had been released as an independent piece at this moment and moment, I would actually get the respect and admiration it deserves. <br /> <br /> And a final note: <br /> <br /> One could compare this with the movie of "The Magical Mystery Tour" by The Beatles, since the Beatles movie seemed to be just as strange and strange. However, in my opinion, "Head" is far above all that The Beatles put on celluloid.
