'Traffik', despite its title, is not really about drugs. In the best tradition of crossing the British television drama, 'Traffik' analyzes and moralizes about its apparent theme, which is not a mythical scourge, but a matrix or process with identifiable roots, causes and social, economic and historical effects. There is something almost scientific in the way the film takes four groups of characters from spectacularly separate global and class backgrounds: an opium poppy cultivator forced into the underworld by Pakistani poverty and a cynical government; the English, former Olympic swimmer, wife of a drug baron in the trial for human trafficking; two deranged German policemen whose determination to condemn the latter stems both from class anger and from any faith in the law; and a Tory minister whose daughter from Cambridge has become addicted. <br /> <br /> 'Traffik' has no apology in the didactic - from the first scenes of Jack Lithgow in Pakistan, which investigates the government's success in eliminating drugs before sanctioning more British aid, we are bombarded with facts about the problem. But these "facts" come from a variety of sources, disguising government representatives; leftist lawyers with vested interests (ideological and domestic) in corruption; Poor farmers who need to grow poppies to survive. <br /> <br /> The facts, which are usually reassuring markers on a map, are not enough: the more data we obtain, the less controllable the situation becomes. It is not until Jack, the moral center of the film, the man who connects all the narrative threads, actually travels to the heart of the darkness of drugs, learns to get rid of his Tory hypocrisy (deplores the use of drugs, but refuses to put money seriously) to address the problem and create the conditions, through various free market initiatives, where drug traffickers emerge. Just as the antiheroes of Warner's former gangster films were actually American capitalist models, the traffikers are the ideal advocated by Thatcher and Reagan) that at least the reality of the problem can be recognized. <br /> <br /> As I said, 'Traffik' is not really about drugs. As Jack finally recognizes, after being fired as a conservative minister, drugs are not really the problem. It is a society dismantled by a woman who said that there was no such thing (as evidenced by the nonexistent family life of Jack), systematically depriving the vast majority of people of hope and happiness, and a growing number of them turn to drugs <br /> <br /> What scares most of 'Traffik' are not the graphic and numbed representations of drug abuse (the technical detail of which ironically reflects the presentation of more 'objective verbal and' legitimate 'information), but the dystopian The vision of a Great Britain stripped of all joy, beauty or community, a desolate wasteland of abandoned homes and a soulless modernity, a society of defeatists ready for smugglers and barons of that type to exercise their trade. <br /> <br /> This is not just a contemporary British story, but it records the decline of an Empire based on trade reduced to illegal drug trafficking. Undoubtedly, it is significant that the other sites in the program are Germany and Pakistan, crucial agents in the decline of the Empire. Here, the ancient imperial amorality returns home, the victims formerly enslaved, their bodies mistreated by the power of their masters, returning to the imperial center, London, the seeds of their decline literally carried in their bodies, which embody the fears of all those They have arrived late. Gothic novels of the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> 'Traffik' is one of the great achievements of British television, and in many ways it is superior to the recent Hollywood remake. The political approach is obviously more acute: Jack's decline is much more effective than Wakefield's because he, as an agent of government policy, as well as a bad father, is a very important part of the problem, while the only one fails. Americans' real policy is complacency. In almost all cases, the characterization is stricter and much more plausible (compare Lindsay Duncan's Helen Helen, already bitten by experience and failure, and its laughably superficial counterpart). <br /> <br /> Unlike the dubious racial stream of "Traffic" (which makes Mexico dark and Other, the ultimate WASP horror is sex with a black man), the portrait of Pakistan is rich, tragically drawn, with disconcerting arguments about Protection against drugs marked by scenes of appalling violence. Throughout, the inextricable link between the public and the private is expert. Visually, the film is remarkably inventive, never being flashy or 'cinematic', especially in the last episode, where buildings and decoration seem to move as the system approaches. If 'Traffik', like his new version, feels the need for Fragments from the shore, then the prevailing sense of loss and waste is much more damning, Jack's speech desperately desperate.
