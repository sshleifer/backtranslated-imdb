I've seen Lonesome Dove, Dead Man's Walk and The Streets of Laredo, and now The Return to Lonesome Dove. If you're hungry for more after seeing Lonesome Dove, this will fill your belly. Great cast, great story. Definitely a second close to Loneome Dove. I will buy this movie to add to my collection. This is the best, or at least my favorite performance of Jon Voight. He is Captain Call. Lou Gossett Jr. interpreting Isom Pickett is not someone I got into, it's a nasty bad perspective. William Peterson also does a great job. Rick Schroder is back as Newt with an action full of anguish that reminds me of his time at NYPD Blue. My only problem with this film (and it's really picking nits) is that I got the impression that Call wanted to be "the first man to graze cattle in Montana", and it's obvious that Dunnigan had already been there for a while. A bit inconsistent, but it is easily overlooked while you get lost in the fantastic story. I especially love the apparent growth of the characters of Jasper Fant and July Johnson. I've seen this movie several times and I'm ready for another sequel.
