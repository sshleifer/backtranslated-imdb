I have not managed to completely block this movie from memory even though it's been two years since I've seen it. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, it's been a long time since I forgot the main story: The relationship between Kidman and Law, which did not impress me, but it was the torture scenes in the movie that really shocked me. I cried for about two hours straight after the rooms. <br /> <br /> I had never before thought how people, in times of war, could take advantage of something as pure as the love of a mother. We see several examples of this here, both in the scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers on the fence to keep her son hidden at home. I was surprised by these scenes and I will probably never see the film again because the scenes are now perfectly clear in my mind. However, I am glad to have seen the film simply because it has made me more aware of the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that humanity can inflict on its own. <br /> <br /> The blond albino character has been one of the best on my list of evil bad guys since I saw the movie. His horrible mockery and lack of human feelings for the people he tortured really affected me. At one point I wanted to get up at the cinema and kill it myself (see the movie that pushed me to the limit of reason, it only occurred to me later that it would only be on a big screen, that shows the power of the film and intensity at least) . <br /> <br /> I recommend the film because of its great experience, not because of the intertwined love story, but because of the way it represents war without the need for a battlefield.
