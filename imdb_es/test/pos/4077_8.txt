I was watching an NFL game, I started surfing during a break and I found it on one of the HBO-type channels. I missed the beginning, but when I started watching Deadly Voyage, the clicker was put aside and it did not even occur to me until the credits came out. You will find yourself rooting against the villains and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy along this one. If you have the opportunity, take the time to see it. Every once in a while, I think of the cable company pulling out of my movie channels, but when you run into big ones like these, you know why it's worth paying more for them. Happy holidays to everyone from Cape Cod!
