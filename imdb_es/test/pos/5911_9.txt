Stewart's age did not bother me at all in this movie, although it portrayed a much younger person. I still remember my fascination with Lindbergh's story and, when I was completely grown up by the time this biopic was made, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> Not only does he have a great Stewart performance, but he also offers a wealth of fascinating technical data, which is understandable to those with technical difficulties like me. And the appearance of the plane itself was great. <br /> <br /> I loved this description of a period before my birth and rekindles the childhood love I had for airplanes and for the idea of ​​traveling by plane.
