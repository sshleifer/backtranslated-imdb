I made the promise that if I ever published a comment that was not complimentary, then I would feel different about it, I would go back and make my change of opinion known. So far, this is the first time that happens. <br /> <br /> I'm really starting to enjoy Hack. Something has clearly changed. The stories seem to be much stronger. The plot may still be a little surreal, but the characters have developed much more depth than a surreal plot can be forgiven. I attribute this to good acting. <br /> <br /> Not all shows can come out charging a winner with the exit door. Some need time to gain speed. I'm glad I kept watching this program, and I really hope it lasts.
