Niagara, Niagara is an impressive and heartbreaking story about the two outsiders Seth and Marcy. Robin Tunney offers a fantastic performance, as Marcy suffers Tourette's syndrome and becomes increasingly ill as the film progresses. This film is not very optimistic and it is very emotional, but at the same time very romantic. It is difficult to explain, but see it and discover it yourself. Definitely worth it.
