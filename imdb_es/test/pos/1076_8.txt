A very interesting documentary, certainly much more than Sideways, a pseudo-wino drama, where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed. According to the documentary, and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography on Parker, only two men dictate the nature of wines in the world: Robert Parker of Massachusetts and Michel Rolland, an expert in the French wine industry based in Bordeaux and also known as "Flying Oenologist". The director is smart enough to insert interviews with local wine producers from different regions of France, from Sicily to Argentina, and interviews with the most important players in the industry, such as the Mondavi family, to discover aspects of the globalization of winemaking and marketing. A must for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry. Drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after watching this documentary well done.
