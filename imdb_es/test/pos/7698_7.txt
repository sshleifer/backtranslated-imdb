The plot of "Sally of the Sawdust" is the usual melodramatic material - an orphan, rags-to-riches - but the film overcomes most silences thanks to three people: <br /> <br /> This is not , of course, the masterpiece of DW Griffith, but it shows his cinematic experience in full maturity. He uses all his innovations, which are techniques that we take for granted now: close-ups, transversal cuts, a mobile camera and the ability to modify the performance of the theatrical exaggeration to the cinematographic subtlety. <br /> <br /> W. C. Fields also demonstrates his abilities, not his abrupt delivery signature, but his remarkable dexterity as a physical comedian. He makes some inventive juggling acts, too short to be fully appreciated, and some very clever pickpockets, but it seems that all the accessories that are within reach are manipulated to get a comical effect: hat, cane, car roof, dog, cash. It is a pleasure to contemplate. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's Carol Dempster. Much has been said against this actress, but her performance here is also very funny. She was 22 years old at the time, she was a teenager, and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and awkwardness that may not be entirely convincing, but it really attracts attention when she is on the screen, especially when she dances. She is not a beauty, although she is positively luminous in the only scene in which she is curled up like a sister of Talmadge, but her simplicity only adds to Sally's character, especially in the many moments when she shows a very evident affection for Fields as your guardian / "father." Few, if any, Hollywood artists could compete with Fields when it comes to comedy, but Griffith gives his best lady every opportunity to compete with his co-star, and Dempster is absolutely his.
