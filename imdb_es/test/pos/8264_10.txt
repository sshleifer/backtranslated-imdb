I was lucky enough to record this wonderful drama, both parts, when it was originally aired on Masterpiece Theater. I loved it but I lost it. Then, one day, while reviewing old tapes, he found it again. I recorded it on DVD and saw it and --- WOW! I still love him! Drivers are excellent and my only complaint is that I would have liked to have seen more Kester! What a man! And Prue. She is so strong and wonderful ... she lives in a time when her affliction and her way of dealing with it are considered unfortunate and evil. Even his own brother tells Prue in his face that he doubts a man will ever have her. * sigh * Unfortunately, my copy is not the best, with wear and tear over the years, and I would also love to have this on professional DVD if it ever happens.
