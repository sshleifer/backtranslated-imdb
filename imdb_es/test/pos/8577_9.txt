Personally, I think the movie is pretty good. It almost has a grade of 8. I liked both the ethnographic aspect and the beautiful photography. The character of Colin Firth is not the most pleasant, but he does a better than decent job with the role. The heroine, played by the beautiful Nia Long, is a family heroine who tries to do what she thinks is best for her son: marry a respected member of her expatriate community, while fighting against her attraction to the "bad" . "man - one who is not a member of his community (the" stranger "). Most of the film is about this mother's struggle: should she do what is expected of her, what she thinks is best for her son, or should I follow his heart? I do not want to give the end, let me say that it is a movie to feel good, with magnificent location shots, an exquisite African dress (it is worth watching the movie only for the bright African clothes and headdresses women's colors), and nice characters in general.The actor who plays Nia Long's son is bright and adorable.The plot is a bit formulated, but I liked the movie nevertheless.If you're a fan of Colin Firth , YOU MUST see this movie, if you like chic movies, look at it, I think I'll see it again tonight!
