I agree with what mallicka.b said. The film is represented in a way that seems to be a kind of vilification in the original content. Emotions are not transmitted properly. I guess a couple of not so good performances also contributed to their mediocrity. In my opinion, Tabu would have been a much better option for that role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a little lustful, which is not, ultimately, what the film should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of excess action in some of his scenes. I am a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) I can not help it; I'm sorry about that. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; It did not impress me at all.
