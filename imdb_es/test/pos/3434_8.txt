Skenbart takes place in the 1940s, just after the Second World War. The main character Gunnar (Gustav Hammarsten) leaves his job to have the opportunity to "make a difference" in postwar bombed Europe. He packs a book by his favorite philosopher, Ludwig Witgenstein, and embarks on a journey that will finally prove that Witgenstein's famous claim is true: there is nothing that it seems. <br /> <br /> There are two main plots and several subplots. To this film, which takes place on a train bound for Berlin. The writer / director Peter Dalle (who also plays the role of train driver) has put together an impressive cast that includes Swedish legends Lena Nyman, Gösta Ekman and Robert Gustafsson. In general, the performance is excellent. <br /> <br /> Skenbart offers a rather twisted slapstick comedy combined with a more subtle black humor (like the nun who loses her faith and begins to curse violently). It's as if Killinggänget met Peter Jackson (Braindead, Bad Taste) on Schindler's list. I laughed for most of the movie, and when I woke up the next morning, I laughed even more. A smart movie for fans of Swedish comedy.
