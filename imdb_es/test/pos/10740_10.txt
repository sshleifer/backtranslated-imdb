Although Dr. Seuess should have been credited with stealing the story line from "Horton Hatches The Egg," this was a good movie. It touched both the emotions and the intellect. Due especially to the incredible performance of Justin Henry of seven years and a script that sympathized with each character (and the situation of each), the elements that provoke reflection persist long after the tears end. In general, a superior performance of a solid cast, an excellent direction and a very powerful script. The right touches of humor help to prevent a "heavy" issue from becoming tedious or difficult to understand. Finally, this film stands the test of time and does not appear to be dated, decades after its premiere.
