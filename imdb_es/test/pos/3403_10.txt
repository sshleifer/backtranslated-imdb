I absolutely LOVED this movie when I was a kid and I still do it as an adult. To say that it is even an underestimate. My sister, my brother and I saw him one year at our grandparents' house during the Christmas holidays. They had recorded it on TV. Our parents were happy that he kept us busy for one night, but they thought we would get tired and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We are hypnotized. They could not have disarmed us if they tried. It became a beloved annual tradition. We loved everything: time, romance, battle scenes, villains, etc. <br /> <br /> Come on, who can resist to hate that psychopath Bent with his constant SIR? Classic! Also, who can resist applauding when Justin falls off the balcony? What a triumphant moment! I always had a special place in my heart for Orry and Madelaine. They were so romantic. The theme can only make me break a little. This movie is incredibly moving and I challenge anyone to follow it to the end. Worth it!!
