The first time I saw "They Died With There Boots On" was around 1970 and although many years have passed since then, this film and its printing remain. The cast was good to excellent and the protagonist was truly heroic. When I saw this movie for the first time I knew that the wiser and the only real position I had was to enjoy this movie as a bit of entertainment and some fun. Then I felt that even now I feel that the Silver Screen does not offer a true description of However, the Director Raoul Walsh should contribute to the real value represented in this film when I saw a semi documentary with other great directors like Vincent Mennelli, in which central figures talked about their achievements. with valuable comments that give a glimpse of the Hollywood mentality. This is what I considered something of interest and where all this became terribly interesting and very pleasant. However, many of these recommendations have been made. Problems with the silver screen and its ability to tell stories that part of the enjoyment has been lost and you may also find it here. Custer is ranked 34th in a graduate class of ... 34. Much has been done of Custer's final classification of the class, but of the 68 cadets who entered the Military Academy with him in 1857, half of them had already suspended or resigned on graduation day, June 24, 1861. It is suggested in the film since the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then runs into the name of George Armstrong Custer and there must be a safe exchange between the two sides and this is where the Sargeant Duty says almost in a low tone, even to suggest as if that happened. Out by accident "Your squad would follow you to hell," His attention Sergeant, reprimands Tape. If I'm not mistaken when Flynn appears on an initial battlefield, he acknowledged that Custer did not see action immediately and in fact was working as a reliable addition to not only Sheridan, but that Hancocks also forces him to end for a while with the Army. The Potomac under the command of General George McClellan. There is some truth in the audacity attributed to the heroics of the battlefield of Custers, as illustrated when in a counterattack, "young Custer spurred his horse and boldly launched himself into the stunned Confederates, like a Union soldier surrounded. of rebels, the audacity of the Custers shone, he accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers, including a rebel captain, an action that he personally captured the first Confederate battle flag taken by the Potomac Army.This remarkable act of courage marked him as a officer of great promise on the battlefield. " Robert L.Bateman-General Armchair. There is a problem here and that is The story of the story and the truth about George Armstrong Custer, the story is good Hollywood entertainment, maybe even great entertainment, but for whatever reason, all you could say was the change . For entertainment purposes. Although this might be a weapon, it would be nice to know that Tom Custer was going to lose his life in the "Little Big Horn" just a few feet from where George Custer was going to die too. They were brothers and to date, Tom Custer has an honorable distinction of being among a very small group, and perhaps only 3 others have received the Medal of Honor twice in his military career. The list of commitments that the film shows indicates that Custers was a young active officer. He was not with the Union forces either in Chancellorsville or in Fredericksburg; however, he was with them at the battle of Antietam and, at that time, General McClellan promoted him to captain, but that was not going to last as long. McClellan would soon be replaced due to the historical fact that the Army of El Potomac had the means, and the information (discovered around some cigars were General Lee's plans to divide his forces) and, however, he can act for about 17 hours. It can be speculated that the war could have ended then and so it happened, but when McClellan did not act, President Lincoln replaced him permanently and, as a result, the promotion was lost. In fact, Custers' greatest victories can reach Gettysburg, Pa. His forces that occupied an area called Cemetery Crest in the Gettysburg camp in the summer of 1863 were able to defeat a Jeb Stuart Led Cavalry of some 6,000 rebels with a strength of 2,300. I think it's worth discussing the heroic acts at Gettysburg by Custer. There is speculation in the movie that Custers' appointment was a mistake, it is better to guess again because Custer not only had men in his corner but he also established a petition to Present to the Governor of the State of Michigan which, incidentally, was relatively new in the Cause of the Union and where he was preparing to form regiments of Cavalry. Although Custer was severely reprimanded for that kind of shenanigans when he appeared in everything that was not by accident, as you would believe. In truth, Custers 'defense at Gettysburg barred Jeb Stuart from having lunch at the Unions' rear tents and vitally protected that flank. This action, by the way, happened and was programmed to coincide with Picketts Charge so that it has the highest probability of success. It was a critical victory and Custer was his best and bravest. His men followed him to hell and lived to tell about it.
