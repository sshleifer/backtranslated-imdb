I think this is a fabulous movie ... I saw her constantly since she was 4 years old until approximately when she was 8 ... However, when she saw her there were many nightmares. I got them particularly for the guy who was always like "the other world" and his friends. I am 12 years old and I still have nightmares about it to this day. I can not fall asleep now because I'm thinking about it. I love this movie, but it's so scary! However, I definitely love this movie, I have very good memories of it. Kate is very good at acting in this movie. Surprisingly, I never realized it was her! I also think that the graphics were of very high quality, contrary to what other people think
