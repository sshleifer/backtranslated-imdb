For all fans of stories of coming of age, this 3-hour adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel is pure fun. Cinematic assents to the kinetic style of Baz Luhrman, as well as to all the primitive and own pieces of the period <br /> <br /> always present in the BBC (where it is probable that he saw almost < br /> <br /> each prominent member of this cast). It's pretty obscene and more than <br /> <br /> the top in points, but that's just what the novel calls for. The cast <br /> <br /> is attractive and, in the cases of Anna Chancellor and Hugh <br /> <br /> Bonneville, perfect. In the case of Rachel Sterling, like our heroine Nan, you just have to overlook the fact that she is too pretty to be confused with a boy and run with her. . It's a fantasy, after all. <br /> <br /> Some fans of the novel may be offended by the various changes in the character <br /> <br /> (particularly that of the character of Jodhi May, Florence), but <br /> <br /> all changes work for the greatest benefit of this teleplay game and <br /> <br /> provide a high quality entertainment value in general.
