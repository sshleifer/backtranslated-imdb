Look like being Anglo-Irish. I assure you that this critic is everything but Bias. But I assure you that this is very much an Irish film, and not English, as the last comment seems to suggest. This film was written by Neil Jorden and Conor McPherson and also directed by Conor McPherson, both Irish. The cast is almost entirely Irish: it was filmed in Ireland with an Irish team. Even Michael Gambon was born in Ireland. I remember him joking about it in an interview about this movie. <br /> <br /> Evidently, Michael Cane was hired to boost the box office collections abroad. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie, I just wanted to correct a completely uninformed comment! <br /> <br /> Now, with the review, I loved Dylan Moran, I've always been a fan of him, he and Michael Cane formed a surprising double. act. It was great to see Morans as an actor, as he plays several different characters during the movie. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in comedy, as it represents a fresh, quirky and inventive twist in Irish feature film films. I laughed a lot. What more could you want?
