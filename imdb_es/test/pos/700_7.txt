This is simply a good western style. Not too complex or long. Do not deceive yourself thinking that it was done but for entertainment. Still, it's one of those westerns you can see once and end without coming back. Presents former teammates Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford, whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford's Cheyenne Rogers has been part of bank robberies (he even steals the Scott Sheriff's horse Steve Upton unknowingly, his good friend by the one that is stealing). In Red Valley, Upton is under intense scrutiny for a bank robbery that ended with several deaths. Claire Trvor plays Countess Maletta, a friend of Cheyenne who gives him and his friend "Nitro" (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams) a place to stay for the moment. Cheyenne wants to go straight, but finds it difficult when Jack Lester (Bernard Nedell) and his bad group want to steal the Red Valley bank. In reality, it is Jack who is behind the murders, but it is difficult to get away from Cheyenne's problematic past. He and Nitro will be charged with the murders they did not commit (the theft was one that Cheyenne did not commit) and it will be Upton who will have to save the day before Lester escapes with the murder. There are subplots that include the fact that Cheyenne fell in love with Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes); The irony of the story is that Alison's father, Uncle Willie, is actually conniving with banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) in a planned robbery with Lester stealing the city from the loot of the Red Valley}. Will Upton discover the treacherous plan of Uncle Willie and the banker Clanton? Can Uncle Willie go through that without his conscience always bothering him? This movie has an excellent bar fight and a dandy of a climatic firefight. Columbia could not have chosen a better genre to begin the process of coloring, since this film has some excellent mountain planes, since men chase them on horseback and so on. Do not wait to have your socks removed, but the movie is simple and good-paced.
