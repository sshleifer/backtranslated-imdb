Anderson's animation easily competes with Pixar's and goes far beyond what I've seen Disney do. While some say that the story is a little too abstract, I find it a refreshing and stimulating change of the exaggerated characters and clumsy animals that are usually found in animated shorts. It's an interplanetary version of CASTAWAY! Anyone who has left the safe harbor of their home and gone to a lonely and terrifying place will easily identify with this desolate microbe. Excellent work, Mr. Anderson! <br /> <br />
