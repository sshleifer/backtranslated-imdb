Spoilers This revision has been edited due to the word limit. <br /> <br /> `The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) <br /> <br /> The phrase that is as famous as "Here is watching you, child" or "Are you talking to me?" or 'May the Force be with you' or 'I will return', means a little more than some sentences of a single line. When it is spoken, it remains in the air with an importance and a meaning that does not go unnoticed. What could drive some viewers crazy is that they will never find an answer to horror unless they watch the film again and try to observe each frame closely. <br /> <br /> What, exactly, does this line? of dialogue means? The horror that is spoken of is the reality of war. The reality that moral men corrupt themselves so easily that they turn against their innate instincts and kill their fellow men without any sign of guilt. When Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) stands before the dying Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film, "The horror." The horror. It is the realization of Willard's corruption. He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his mission. This is not a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases, a character gains something, be it emotional, physical, mental or all three. But Willard wins and wins at the same time. He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morale. And that is a shocking ending. <br /> <br /> 'Apocalypse Now' is the homage of Francis Ford Coppola to the artistic side of cinematography. This movie is completely different from 'The Godfather'. It is hallucinogenic, visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. At first it seems realistic, and then it becomes strange, and then symbolic and, in the end, original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of the war. This is not so much a film about the Vietnam War as a film about the war inside us. <br /> <br /> At first it seems to be another war movie. Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned by an Army Lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American Colonel named Kurtz (Brando), who hides somewhere in Vietnam with a horde of troops that more or less act as his slaves. <br /> <br /> Willard carries out his mission "with extreme prejudice", going on a boat along with four soldiers, including the ship's captain, the Chief (Albert Hall), the Chef (Frederic Forest) and a very young `Larry 'Fishburne (who later appeared as Morpheus in` The Matrix'). <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> "Apocalypse Now" is in many ways a modern update of Homer's Odyssey. As our main character, Willard, continues his journey, he encounters a variety of original and strange characters, including Lieutenant-Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange fetish for surfing, and a drugged photographer (Dennis Hopper) . whose animated gestures and gestures can be compared to those of the much less Jeremy Davies in "The Million Dollar Hotel", one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Davies could not make any connection with an audience; Hopper does it. It's like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz; He is like an interpreter who comes and goes in foreign languages. In this case, he is translating Kurtz to Willard, although I'm not sure Kurtz needs a Willard translation. <br /> <br /> Many movies are lucky to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. "Apocalypse now" has many. Kilgore, that descends on a town of Vietnam that interprets the "Walk of the Valquirias" of Wagner, continues being one of the scenes more remembered of all the history of the cinema. There is a sharpness, a brutality, an ironic tone and also a sense of play. When Kilgore kneels on that beach and says:'I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like victory ', they all smile. <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you: `Apocalypse Now 'is a strange movie. It is not exactly the easiest to analyze. The end can frustrate some viewers if they do not understand Marlon Brando's meaningful speeches. But what is reduced, what really matters, is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. The horror is the realization of the war and its effects, not the war itself. Kurtz says: 'You have the right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me. Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the audience to judge. For many naive spectators, he can appear as a crazy madman whose power reached his head. But that is not what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to convey. When fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz has realized how good he was, and how badly others had it. As we walk through devastated villages, he finally realizes that we are the naive ones, who live our lives in a fool's paradise. We are totally naive to our environment and possible misfortunes until they hit. Seeing how unfortunate the Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes how easy he can be hit by something. How easily you could end up like the people around you. And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who abandoned their morale and left them at the door. Many people think that horror is one thing. Are two. For Kurtz, horror is the reality of how naive he was and the reality of the impact of war on men. And after Willard murders Kurtz, and he hears Kurtz's last words, he realizes it too. He realizes the effects of war. Seeing so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him understand the horror of what war can do to a man. And what he has done to him. The horror. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
