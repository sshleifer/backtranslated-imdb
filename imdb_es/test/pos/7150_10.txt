I was surprised that "Forgiving the Franklins" did not generate more enthusiasm at this year's Sundance Film Festival. There were times when the laughter in the screening I saw was so strong that you could barely hear the movie. The film has an excellent performance and a story that really makes one examine wider issues. You know small topics such as religion, sex and truth. A lot of comedy seems to depend on the same old situations provoked, many leave you thinking "I know they started this from a series of comedies". This film takes its own unique direction. I really believe that Jay Floyd did a fantastic job on a tight budget in this movie.
