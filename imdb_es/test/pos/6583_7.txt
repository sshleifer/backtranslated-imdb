This was a movie that I kept reading the reviews over and over again; And even though it is played at the Film Museum and not at Pathe's theaters? I decided to give this movie a try. The reasons were many? in the reviews he compared himself to Pulp Fiction, had several parallel stories in the film and, finally, had won 17 international awards in several categories. I was anxious to see this movie and, due to my rest day at Greenpeace, I decided to be happy to see this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a story based in Finland. I think it reflected the current life of people in general? Drugs, crime, sex, anger, anguish, fear and guilt. Each emotion was captured brilliantly in the movie. Are there several interwoven characters and stories but some characters come back in the second half? making a link with the initial sequences and that advances the story. <br /> <br /> Is the story about two friends? One of which is a computer geek and the other is a drug addict? Son of an abusive father. Does the child addicted to drugs negotiate a 500 euro bill? Printed by your friend ?? to buy back their music system, and in the returns there is a big change of cash to buy more drugs. The 500 euro banknote trade continues to strange events? from the store merchant to a car mechanic cum robber? to a car dealer? to a seller of vacuum cleaners ?? to a prostitute ?? to a police officer? Then to his family and children. How the beginning of a small thing? Does it create a chain reaction that leads even after 5 years of that first incident to one last depressing note? that I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> The address is excellent. The development of the character in the film is first class. The character that remains in your mind even after leaving the movie is the seller of the vacuum cleaner. All the departments of the film are handled very well. Here I would like to make a couple of critical comments. First, during the sequence of an event that led to another, I felt that the coincidences were too fast and forced. But this script script error is forgiveness when one sees the entire canvas. Secondly, the trace of a character that leads to another in some way leads back to the first two characters and again I found that it was a forced decision on the part of the writer of screen games. There was no need for the same characters to appear again when there are different causes that lead to different effects in such a large city. <br /> <br /> But after saying that? It is an excellent movie! It's a dark movie with lots of sex scenes. The characters are having the black, white and gray tones and emotions that change when facing a different situation, which the director captures brilliantly. <br /> <br /> A first level movie! It has all the ingredients to become a cult movie. I hope that only those films do not convert and reach the status of cult films and win many awards, because without crime, sex, violence, drugs, etc. Can you also make fantastic movies? Bicycle thieves and Pather Panchali are his prime examples. The only thing is that a long time ago and times are changing and I think the movies are reflecting the current times.
