This was on Showtime the other night, and I thought it was going to be another trash festival done for video, like "Earth vs. the Spider" or any of those other HBO horror shorts. Instead, I found a classic comedy / gore. It was legitimately fun, and surprisingly, the acting was pretty good. Even my wife, who hates horror in general, agreed and laughed at some parts. In addition, the FX were of high quality. <br /> <br /> In general, the film felt like a parody of Joy Ride / Jeepers Creepers, and the 2 main characters reminded me of the Shaun of the Dead couple. Definitely worth seeing, but do not take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The end.
