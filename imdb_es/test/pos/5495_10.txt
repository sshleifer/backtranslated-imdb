A great performance by Clint Eastwood and particularly by John Malkovich, in my opinion, is the best to date. Malkovich had this dive right on the ground, it's amazing. Eastwood is Agent Mike Horrigan, an old and cynical Secret Service agent who is ending his career by cheating the forgers and pursuing routine tasks. But a task that seems to be executed at first is complicated and extremely serious. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat against the President by a "madman". As fate would have it, Horrigan has not encountered a delirious madwoman but a lone and professional wolf who has a big bone to choose from with the White House. As Horrigan enters the world of "Booth," he attracts the unwanted attention of the wicked and his irrepressible admiration for him. Horrigan was the main agent of JFK and was present in Dallas, Texas, when he was killed and blames himself for what happened. Now he feels it is up to him to prevent the current Head of State from joining the list of dead Presidents. But this killer turned Horrigan around and now he's the hunted in a life-and-death cat and mouse game. Who will win? Who will die? It's a race against time to save Pres from a chameleonic enemy that can reach anyone. My favorite Secret Service movie and as good as a nail biter like anybody.
