A very surprisingly underestimated movie. very realistic. and authentic. with great dialogue. Being Italian, I can definitely relate to the situations and phrases used. I thought Joe Cortese was great. Like a crazy crazy cowboy type, and Pesci and Vincent were great too. I liked the actor Criscuolo who played the boss. It was very authentic. I think director Ralph Devito was on his way to great things, but he was cut too soon, maybe because he knew too much. I thought it was awesome. I deserved more airplay and recognition. It was a great sleeping movie. very well. It really had good authenticity. It was well done
