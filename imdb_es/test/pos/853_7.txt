The Jungle is more an adventure than a science fiction movie. The only part of science fiction are the woolly mammoths that live today. <br /> <br /> Elephants are attacking villages in a part of India and these attacks are also killing people. An expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of the expedition, an American hunter blames these elephants, are being scared by the woolly mammoths, which are supposed to be extinct. No one believes him at first, but they do it when the Mammoths appear at the end. An earthquake ends with them. <br /> <br /> La Selva was filmed in a place in India and has many beautiful landscapes and good Indian music, including some songs that make the film continue to advance very well. Mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long fangs attached. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (Cat-Women of the Moon). /> <br /> The jungle is worth seeing, just because of the scenery and the music. Very nice. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
