At the end of the movie, when she says that she had a dream to have a child and was trying to take care of him, but she forgot something else, the implication is that she has forgotten what she learned in the war. she survived, and like her own mother before her, she will not be able to transmit any vital lesson to her own son. And, therefore, the cycle of the shame of ignorance will continue ... to infinity ...
