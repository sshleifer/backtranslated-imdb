I remember that for years the BBC1 used to show this movie in a very clipped way. I located it in a video a couple of years ago and I saw it again. The film, although slow and slightly strange (the mountain men look very strange), the atmosphere was disturbingly effective. It's one of my favorite movies and I have no idea where you can find an uncut version. Currently it is deleted everywhere (except in the United States where it was accidentally placed in a horror compilation). It's a pity you can not get this movie, since it was meant to be seen. The wrong turn (the recent film produced by Stan Winston) owes much to Just Before Dawn. One of the best movies of the 80s and deserves to be seen by a wider audience.
