I had the opportunity to capture this independent film and it impressed me, despite the lack of enthusiasm in the plot. The performance was very good on the part of all involved. Amy Madigan played the role of a mother ravaged by guilt who is tired, but well intentioned and determined to compensate the condition of her youngest daughter. However, in the process, she has neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her sister with Savant syndrome and living in a world of escapism. <br /> <br /> The men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles. Christopher Lloyd, in a very discreet paper, shows us why he has so much versatility. He plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literary research, but who is dying for a meaningful relationship. He and Madigan connect very well in their scenes, but both know that nothing else can come from their friendship. His farewell without words is nothing less than brilliant, a lesson in acting for aspiring artists. <br /> <br /> And in a small role, it's fun to watch Fred Savage. <br /> <br /> You can tell why the movie was based on a play, it's probably very good on stage. On the screen, it is not particularly exciting, but still it is very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.
