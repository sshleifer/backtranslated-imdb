I just watched the DVD of this award-winning film. One Life Stand is a dramatic drama that, through its rhythm, black and white shots and atmospheric music, paints a very convincing and honest image. It is a story about the dilemma of life around power, sex and control highlighted by a few sad and lonely lives. The mother (very well acted by Maureen Carr) is tense and attracted to herself. The father only appears on the sidelines and, nevertheless, is a powerful and fundamental part of the drama. The money is hidden in boxes and shoes. <br /> <br /> The writing was excellent, and I liked the sensual close-ups of details such as nails, red lips, a candle, mirrors, etc. The way the camera was. Used made it very intimate. It is a heartbreaking story, with sexual nuances, while the drizzle of Glasgow in the dark streets adds to the despair of the sad characters. <br /> <br /> There are some very memorable images transmitted simply by a walk, or a dropped shoulder. - Like Trise walking under the bridge. And the dazed and hurt look on Trise's face at the call center, which hopes to help people use the tarot cards, while listening to a caller talk about their own abuse. <br /> <br /> At first we see John Paul, with his eyes wide open and innocent, he has photos taken when he wants to try modeling. Trise, his mother, is deceived and makes bad decisions for him, in a way that drives him away while she tries to keep him. The model of John Paul becomes an escort job and the boss of Trise offers him money, and eventually they go on a date. There are also moments of humor and subtle irony. An excellent scene is when they are having a fairly normal meal, and they begin to open a little, when the father appears with his dark presence and clouds everything. But this, and other things offer moments of hope. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I felt that the pace of the movie was too intense, but this is a small detail in another wise, challenging and memorable movie, and something a little different. It is in contrast to most American movies that are total fantasy, or the actual "world" seen through contaminated lenses. This film represents life with all its rough edges and shows unforgettable images. <br /> <br /> This is not a "light entertainment", but a drama that provokes thoughts and a real-life drama. <br /> <br /> One Life Stand is a truly immersive and emotionally honest film.
