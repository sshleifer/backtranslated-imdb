There are two things that I noticed in this movie. (This is not a spoiler, just an error in the narrative). When Cole takes Bill to his first B & E, he finds the "box." As soon as Cole finds it, he says: "The box, we all have a box." One minute later, just before downloading the content on the floor, he says: "Actually, we are very lucky, he does not see them often". <br /> <br /> Observation # 2 (Spoiler Alert!) <br /> <br /> I had to look at the thing three times, I could not solve a couple of things. Then I looked at the chronological version and saw that they had flash backs from the latter to the previous one during the time changes. So at times we were seeing three different times in about 1 minute of time on the wall. <br /> <br /> That was a good thing because I do not know how many more times I could see it before going back to Netflix. <br /> <br /> Color me obsessive.
