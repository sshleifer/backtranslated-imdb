This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy fun, entertaining, sweet and memorable, it's hard to decide where to start. <br /> <br /> From the opening number, "Rainbow Connection", the excellent work of Paul Williams. score sung with enthusiasm by Kermit D. Frog, who gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about, throughout history, this is a funny movie. Essentially, it's a road trip film, where Kermit travels across the country with the dream of looking for a "rich and famous contract" to entertain. Along the way, our green hero meets a host of other aspiring actors, comedians, singers and musicians, who happen to be muppets like Kermit himself. Is this how the Muppets really started? "Approximately how it happened," Kermit tells us. <br /> <br /> Not since "it's an angry, angry, angry, angry world" the cameo formula has been used so prolifically and successfully. Aspiring stars find many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; Some simply flicker on the screen, but others have memorable cameos. Steve Martin's fun as a rude waiter is probably the best. Edith Bergen, the puppeteer Jim Henson's nod to his inspiration, is especially moving. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen the Muppets TV show will be able to see all their favorite characters, they are all here. The puppet work is magnificent; Look especially for Kermit to ride a bicycle (how do you do dat?). Jokes and references to old movies are everywhere, but the best sentences are reserved for Kermit himself. An example: when the scammers are terrorizing Kermit and Piggy, she affectionately says to her short, green and handsome boyfriend: "I would not give up tonight together for nothing, would you?" "Uhhh, make me an offer ..." I also love the shooting at the OK Corral scene: brilliantly absurd nonsense. <br /> <br /> I have to get "Movin 'right now" now, but to summarize: a Good character movie that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age or film genre. Highly recommended
