This is one of Chaplin's first national films of the era between his glorious mutual shorts and the more mature features of United Artists. More opulent than Mutual's films, Chaplin's search to perfect his comic expression continues. Most people forget that the movie is actually a dream that Charlie has while waiting to be sent to the front. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of slapping through the Limburger cheese used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed like a tree. <br /> <br /> At this stage of this career, the great man had become so immersed in the filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves. No doubt this was not the case, but still, it offers such a convincingly realistic view of life on the front as I can remember, albeit from an ironically humorous perspective. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, familiarity with all of Chaplin's work should be a prerequisite for all moviegoers. Do not delay!
