Any film about World War II made during the Second World War by a British production company does not have, in my opinion, a companion of the last few days, respectfully. The confluence of so many things close to my heart is in At Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of the Second World War and particularly of naval warfare, I am in favor of representations of submarines and action in the North. Atlantic and especially those that include the German side of things. For those who are not familiar with the objective's priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the largest event a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly in a similar way to what we see here. The rhythm is deliberate and typical of the works of Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studies of yesteryear: frankly, I prefer their more silent and cerebral approach for their humanity and realism that is much better than any super-produced Hollywood. The film could always remind me of The 49th Parallel by Powell and Pressburger thanks to the powerful and persuasive Eric Portman, one of my favorites. John Mills receives a second billing and a smaller font in the titles, so it's clearly meant to be Portman's movie, but the whole cast shines. As for the title sequence, am I the only one who is completely delighted with the lovely Gainsborough Production Gainsborough Girl?
