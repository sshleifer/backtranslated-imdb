Turner and his friends are approaching HBO for the first place among producers of movies made for television. This is a pleasant and contemplative type thriller. William Macy is stellar, as always, and Adam Arkin offers one of his best performances. A little more animated than the classic Hitchcock, but not as in the face as the typical movies of its kind, A Slight Case of Murder makes it easier for you to enter and never abandons you. (Note: I saw a preview copy, which means I did not have to wait in commercials.) Those interruptions can affect the tempo, but they know that this will be available in video at some point.
