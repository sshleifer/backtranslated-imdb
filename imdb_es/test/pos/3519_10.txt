Right before Dawn is one of those really good slashers who send chills down your spine every time you look at her! This film has a great suspense, a great performance, a very well done camera work (good job, Mr. Lieberman!), Which makes it an extremely well-made pitcher! Although it is low in blood for the 80s, it still has the effect on you once it ends. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) seemed so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! In general, I give this classic lost 10 stars of 10 stars! If you are looking for a gore-fest, do not look here. but, if you want to send chills, look at this one. There are 6 deaths and one of them you do not see, but it leaves you in the mind to think "how was it killed?" The stranded theme reminded me of those of 1977, Have Have Eyes, who followed the same concept, but in the desert with cannibals. But, still fans, give this forgotten jewel, I promise you will be calm!
