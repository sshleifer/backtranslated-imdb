"Nazarín" directed by Luis Bunuel presents an extraordinary vision of religion in Mexico. As written by the director and Julio Alejandro, his remarkable collaborator, this was a film that placed Mexican cinema on the international map after receiving the Grand Prize at Cannes that year. It's a disturbing movie because Mr. Bunuel delves into what's wrong with the church. <br /> <br /> Nazarin, according to all calculations, is a saint. This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a sordid boarding house in a city. He does not have enough for himself, but he does not mind separating with a coin when a beggar appears by his window asking for help. At the same time, he takes to his small room a prostitute who has been wounded in a fight with another woman. Go on, the woman returns her kindness by burning the room and the whole building! Nazarin is seen going to the field asking for food. Andara and Beatriz, two prostitutes from his old town follow him. The life of Nazarin is parallel to that of Jesus. In fact, this holy figure pleads for humility. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr. Bunuel had no religion in mind when he and Mr. Alejandro were in charge of creating this film. It is ironic that Spain received it after this film was released because they saw that it showed Christian qualities, when in fact it is an acrobic satire about the Catholic Church and its ministers. <br /> <br /> Francisco Rabal, Spanish actor, makes a wonderful nazarín. This was one of his best roles. Mr. Rabal worked extensively in his native country, but also in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo, like Andara, is also excellent. Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution with her interpretation of Beatriz. <br /> <br /> A great movie by one of the film's main filmmakers: Luis Bunuel.
