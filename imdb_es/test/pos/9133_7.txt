Having finally reached this "masterpiece", it seems to me that, in his day, he must have seemed terribly intelligent. It is French, artistic, underestimated to the point of agony and, ultimately, the rhythm. But seen from the perspective of 37 years in the future, it is also a bit empty, pretentious and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Others have summarized the story, but I do not think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw in the heart of this movie: the main characters, Corey and Vogel, do not really deserve what they get. They play correctly within their code, they never harm anyone who has not asked for it and they show great courage and initiative. In addition, Corey, in particular, is the victim of his former "gangster" friend, who stole his girl and who tries to kill him several times, apparently only because he (Corey) dared to "borrow" a few thousands of francs. These are men who really should have a rest! Instead, things go much worse for them than they really need, within the logic of history. <br /> <br /> One could argue that this is the point: that the real villains are never caught; to collaborate with the police when necessary, sell your friends and always come out on top. But that is not shown either. Corey's old gangster friend is not flirting with the police. Nor does he show himself rejoicing with his victory. In fact, after materializing several times when he needs it, he can not be seen in the conclusion, leaving a dramatic tension (his enmity with Corey) completely unresolved. <br /> <br /> However, I would say that this film is worth seeing for its beautiful photography, its slow and deliberate rhythm, its excellent dead-end performances, its elaborate robbery sequence and its encapsulation of the style of artistic film of the late sixties.
