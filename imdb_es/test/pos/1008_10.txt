This was one of the few Norwegian films that I really expected. It started as a few ads with a heterogeneous group in football matches. Then they made a movie with that. The potential clients are not professionals (and you can see that) but they still do a very good job and the movie left me impressed. <br /> <br /> Norway is known for making fucking movies (no offense), but I had a good feeling about this. Even if I'm not interested in football, I wanted to see it. The story is much better than expected and the laughter continues to accumulate. There are lots of cameos of celebrities and Norwegian players. The characters are well represented and you feel for them. IF YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE A NORWEGIAN MOVIE. LET THIS BE !!!!
