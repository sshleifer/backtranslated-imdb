I thought I had witnessed every wrinkle that the gangster crime / movie had to offer, but the Garrett-Marcin-Hammett combination produced real emotions and surprises here, thanks to the ingenious direction of Mamoulian, the atmospheric photograph of Lee Garmes. In addition to a remarkably crisp film editing and impeccable special effects. The brilliant performance also helps. Coop offers one of his most convincing performances as the reluctant smuggling and become intrepid (the kind of character progression he had to repeat in other roles like Sergeant York). Miss Sidney (in the center of the photo) in her first important role is also a revelation. The directors receive great support from Paul Lukas, Wynne Gibson and Stanley Fields as the heavyweights, and even Hard-as-nails detective Robert Homans. Obviously, the film has been made with a large budget that is displayed brilliantly in its realistic and crowded scenarios.
