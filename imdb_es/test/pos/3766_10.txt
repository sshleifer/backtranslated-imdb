Coming from the generation of "drug addicts", I thought that this movie was hilarious. He definitely put Jekyll & Hyde up to date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the time. I would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and would love to see it. They do not like drugs, but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it, I can only remember some things. I would have to say that the funniest part was when Dr. Jekyll fell asleep at his lab table and inhaled the straw, while he snored, and then he inhaled the powder drug he had invented. The funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie.
