Well, where do I start ... <br /> <br /> As one of the other reviewers said, you know that you will meet a real whim when you see the first shot: minutes and minutes of the time of the film devoted to A boy standing on a travelator. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat the excellent summary of Rubin's story. However, what I would like to say is that this movie caught me more than any other movie I can remember. I sat with my mouth open, and on the edge of my seat all the way. The work of the camera, the soundtrack and the * fantastic * performances (especially Tony Servillo's) take you to the screen and do not let you look away. <br /> <br /> It's Italian, so, of course, everyone looks fantastic. but in no way is it simply an exercise in fresh style. This is a movie with a lot to say about luck, loss and love. <br /> <br /> Go see it.
