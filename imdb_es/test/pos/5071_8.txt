CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) sees his first interrogation in a secret location when Anwar (Metwally) is accused of having contact with a well-known terrorist bomb maker. The wife of Anwar (Witherspoon) is desperate for the whereabouts of her husband. <br /> <br /> Do not you hate when the title of a movie sends you to a dictionary? I must have an old edition since this interpretation is not a piece of music. No, it is the government's way of legally taking a resident or citizen somewhere to interrogate him and possibly using some torture to obtain the desired information. <br /> <br /> As I watched this movie I was reminded of a similar story on the TV show Crossing Jordan (now off the air), and I hope we'll see even more of these stories. It is unavoidable. The events of 911 are the catalysts. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult subject to see because we do not like to see people tortured and our government does not tell the truth about things. We like the idea that no matter what happens or happens, we can go somewhere in search of answers, but when that door is closed for us, we are really lost and hopeless like Anwar's wife. <br /> <br /> Everyone's performances were first class and we may see more of Igai Naor (I have no idea how to pronounce it) because he looks and can act like Telly Savalas. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes
