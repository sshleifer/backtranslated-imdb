The plot is an exhibition of the underbelly of American politics. While the subject seems common, what "makes" the film is the unconventional way in which the story is told. <br /> <br /> The characters are played with conviction. You feel the innocence of lead, and your innocence is lost. The politician is the prince of double conversation, a true serpent. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is impressive. Affirms the nuances of acting and dialogue. The same goes for music. <br /> <br /> The story uses a parabola style with vingettes where the message is full of double meaning. A very clever strategy by the writer / director. The tension in the story is carried to the last scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie was like a good mystery book. Something was "up and running"; you knew it was bad; you did not know exactly what it could be, you had your suspicions; and when the evil was revealed, you let your breath escape, you had not noticed that you were holding back. Saddened, shaking his head. <br /> <br /> A well written and well told story. 3 greetings to a young writer / director.
