Because unfortunately I could not find them anywhere, I have not been able to try any of the other entries in the series, although I certainly would not mind, and trust me, I have watched. For anyone who does not know, this is a point-and-click adventure title. That means that the mouse is what you use to interact with everything you can do in this, although there is a particular case in this where it is incorrect. I will not spoil it here, for those who have not tried it yet. However, regardless of the little experience you have with computers, you can sit down and try this. There are not even many fragments of this where you need to be quick or have quick reflexes. Hell, you can adjust the speed of the text (if you have subtitles in it) and, therefore, to speak in it, and it is not very uncomfortable or forced when it is slow. Accessing your inventory is easy, as well as combining or using elements. When you click and hold the button to anything that may affect, there are three options for what to use with it (be it a person, a specific part of the environment or an object): Hand (push, lift, open, etc.) eyes (examine, look through, etc.) and mouth (eat, talk, etc.). All this adds up to a cozy and friendly environment, where you can tackle the numerous puzzles (the number of them is varied, depending on which of the two difficulty settings you try) at your own pace, and explore and enjoy the dozens of individual characters and creatively made and areas in this to the content of your heart. The duration of this will be determined by the time you spend doing that (you will not hear any guilt on my part, it's worth it) and your ability to discover the solutions. There are some points in this where you can decide if you want the hardest way to complete that or not. This can be enjoyed by anyone, from any age. There is no material that is not acceptable for children. This is one of the products that help demonstrate that this fact does not have to mean that it is intolerable for older audiences. Animation is a quality work, soft, everything moves as it should, and honestly, the third dimension is not lost much when trying this. The storytelling is well done, and you never know clearly what is happening. There are numerous well-directed cut scenes, kept in the same 2D world, mostly colorful and bright than the rest, with a well-made camera movement. "Cartoons" is an appropriate word to describe this, and not just the visual style. It can be applied to all this. The whole world of this is very similar, but not exactly the same as ours, with a mixture of past and present, inhabited by people and full of things that we can recognize or understand at least in parts, but the absurd. It makes them funny. That should be one of the greatest strengths of this, right there: it's very funny. Much of that comes from the spoken lines (what is said and how it is), and those who seek the efforts of the British focusing on the verbal, the likes of 'Allo' Allo or the BlackAdder franchise will want to review this imbecile. However, there are several different types of jokes, which include, among others, the following: satire, cunning, obscurity, parodies, irony, comedy (not exactly my favorite aspect of this) and more. There is self-awareness, with the protagonist who addresses you, personally and, for example, explaining why he will not do what he has just asked. There are references to pop culture over a couple of decades. Almost everything works, almost no gags, and if you're not in stitches during this, the best thing would be that it simply is not compatible with your sense of humor ... a situation that justifies no judgment, and if you suspect it could be the case, and you want to find out, I suggest the demo version, where, for free, you can see if you care about the game brand and / or laughter. The plot is well written (almost all this is, really), it develops well and keeps its interest well. The audio is excellent, crisp and well done. The sound effects are punctual. The music is well composed without exceptions. The voice acting is impeccable, with a celebrity or two. Armato is fantastic as Guybrush Threepwood (you must love that name), whom you control. Boen is amazing as LeChuck, the dead zombie villain (and still threatening). The designs are immensely well made, highly imaginative and everything fits. Despite the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirate actions, you can get involved in some. Directing a boat, approaching the others and joining blades in a very unique and wonderfully thoughtful way. The reproduction capacity is mainly based on the options, during the dialogue, etc. This is linear, with a bit of freedom in terms of order, so the buccaneer who sits with this, at least the second time, does not matter as much. A number of possibilities as to being challenged by this goes, unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime. Oh, nothing is perfect. Anyone who wants to delve into a fascinating and well-crafted fictional universe, and break it countless times should get a real kick out of this. The good guy, not the ones who hurt and potentially leave bruises. Do not forget, kids, do not * do not * eat books ... you're just asking for a paper cut. I would bet that those who, like others, will also appreciate this. And they are not the only ones who can get into this. I recommend this, in addition to the members of the group mentioned above, to any fan of this VG genre, as well as anyone to whom this review appeals. 8/10
