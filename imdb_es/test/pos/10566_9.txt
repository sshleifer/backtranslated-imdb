BBC 3-hour adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel ... "Fingersmith". Life is hard without money, especially in Dickensian London. Dark facts lead to contemptible dilemmas. Is love really just a luxury for the rich and free? Elaine Cassidy as "Maud Lilly" and Sally Hawkins as "Sue Trinder" give fantastic performances as the leading women who ask this question ... FROM EACH OTHER ... while Rupert Evans shines as the "Gentleman" deliciously bad ... with Great support from "Mrs Sucksby" by Imelda Staunton, "Mr Ibbs" by David Troughton and "Uncle" by Charles Dance. The plot rotates and turns, and I was not sure I could be guided to care about the characters capable of hurting and using others in this way ... but somehow ... I do care ... and that's because of the quality of the performances ... love feels like love ... hatred feels like hate ... betrayal ... confusion ... well, I hope you have the idea and I hope you get the DVD and enjoy it. (Elaine Cassidy is great at this ... beautiful indeed ... I have to declare that I'm in her fan club ... Hi Elaine :)
