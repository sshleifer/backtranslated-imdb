'Boogie Nights' uses its protagonist, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for the accumulated celebrities of a decade in the shameful past of the United States, which included an unexpected increase in pornography, which resulted in an abundance of corrupt youngsters . His main character takes traits from a wide variety of genuine actors, getting involved in many illegal issues that Hollywood celebrities have dabbled in, and very often exploited by the press. It looks like the kind of story that could appear in an E! True Hollywood Story special. Drugs, sex and violence - The American dream. But what goes up must come down, and the bigger it is, the harder it falls. <br /> <br /> Dirk Diggler's dreams are huge, as is another valuable asset in his body. The real name of Dirk is Eddie Adams, a Californian who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives a great talent to every individual on the planet, and his gift is quite unusual. After having a relationship with his mother, Eddie leaves home and meets the sordid Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), an adult film director who offers him work. Eddie eventually becomes an important porn star, representing the main "actor" in most of Horner's films. With a new success, Eddie is told he needs to invent a new alias for himself, and that is how Dirk Diggler was born. <br /> <br /> The own Eddie / Dirk is based mainly on the infamous porn star John Holmes, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with 'Wonderland', starring Val Kilmer. 'Boogie Nights' is unquestionably the best of the two, which shows that pornography films can be made without displeasing their target audience: the usual viewers. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 1977, an era of the artistic. Pornography: the filmmakers really believed that they could compensate for the low points of the X-rated features by adding deep stories and a fascinating atmosphere. In a way, the director of the film, Paul Thomas Anderson, implements a very artistic approach to the project, resulting in a free and artistic film about a period in the history of the United States in which Smut was in fact free and artistic. Anderson's style is so profound and so different, that we soon feel we are reliving the era firsthand. There is not a moment when we are not convinced of the time range treated in the film. <br /> <br /> Not everything was happy on the set of 'Boogie Nights'. Before filming, Anderson approached Reynolds repeatedly, and asked him many times separately to play the role of Horner. Finally, Reynolds agreed, but claimed that the movie was horrible and the worst role of his career, publicly ignoring it, before being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and suddenly shut up. A year earlier, Anderson had suffered title disputes over Sydney / Hard Eight. He preferred the last title for his film, and New Line Cinema thought that the first was more commercial. Basically, he lost the battle, and Anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time by inserting the words "boogie nights" into his movie through the mouth of a character. <br /> <br /> The casting of the film is one of his characters. The best aspects Paul Thomas Anderson's regular customers are here, as well as a first-class cast of first-timers. To name some of the best known stars: John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham and Julianne Moore. But the entire movie is essentially limited to Mark Wahlberg, like Eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. Wahlberg, formerly known for his career as a singer and his disappointing activities in Hollywood, has all the traits necessary to portray such a character. This is your best role to date. <br /> <br /> Anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take complete control of every scene. When Jack Horner meets Eddie for the first time, Anderson astutely uses stars as a backdrop, a sign of what is to come and a hidden symbolism as sharp as it can be. The opening scene is three minutes, a long follow-up shot that follows Jack and Amber to a nightclub, where most of the characters appear for the first time. It reminds me of the discussions about tracking shots in Robert Altman's "The Player"; It works brilliantly on Boogie Nights, and is the first indication that Anderson knows what he's doing behind the camera. His style is vertiginous in the line of Martin Scorsese, where the shots move quickly, but never seem rushed. By the way, Anderson makes reference to two classic shots of Scorsese: the closing speech of De Niro in the mirror of 'Raging Bull' and the scene of the disco tracking 'GoodFellas'. Anderson is a young growing director who is remarkably mature in history and direction, despite his age. While his first feature film, 'Hard Eight', was remarkably sane and moving, 'Boogie Nights' is even more so. <br /> <br /> 'Boogie Nights' began as a love endeavor on behalf of Paul Thomas Anderson. After filming the extraordinary Hard Eight in 1996, Anderson's film is so pragmatic that it seems almost genuine. Boogie Nights invigorates us with its free content, which sometimes borders on the limit of pornography, only it is much more sophisticated than that garbage. It is a dazzling and wonderful masterpiece of today that is as explicitly explicit as savage and elegant. It could be said that Anderson's best film and one of the largest and most important projects of the last decade.
