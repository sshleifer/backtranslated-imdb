Many of us who are dedicated to the "art" of the film, will ignore and forget that movies are also a business. Most of the time, they are too expensive to produce to be anything else. In light of this, it often seems to me a miracle that the big ones do it from time to time. From time to time, the filmmakers will go over budget to produce a film that the businessmen responsible for financing the company will be severely financially harmed and, of course, they will be very angry about this. I would like to know exactly how it happens that this has often led to both the major studios and some of the main critics to "shoot" for the image when it is finally published. Terrible expectations are generated and, often, what people expect to see clouds their perception of what they are seeing. <br /> <br /> You can see this phenomenon in action in the imperfect, but magnificent replenishment of the '62 0f "Mutiny on the Bounty", and you can definitely see it in the reaction to "Heaven's Gate". Cimino took too much time and it cost too much money to United Artists to make this picture. The company was fatally wounded by their excesses and, no doubt, powerful people came out to see their reputation forever ruined when this bizarre mammoth epic was finally released. There are always many spectators who do not like long and heavy images. The narration in this film is not achieved with a great economy or a good rhythm. Like Stanley Kubrick, Cimino often decides not to explain the particular statement he is making with a certain scene. Rather, he draws it in such a way that the viewer feels as if he is living the moment, giving him time for his imagination to participate deeply in what is being presented. Many people do not react so favorably to this approach. They want the story to move quickly and clearly, and get impatient and easily confused with this type of movie. Undoubtedly, these factors contributed to the failure of the box office of "Heaven's Gate". <br /> <br /> By nature, a movie editor, I am deeply frustrated by two problems with this movie. Here and there, a scene is clearly too long and could easily have been trimmed without damaging its effectiveness. Then we come to the huge battle scenes at the end of the image. As far as these are concerned, the clarity of the narrative is damaged. If you liked the movie until the moment it occurs, it is likely that your understanding of what is supposed to be happening is not clear and this is really a frustration. Not having seen all the raw images, I can not say if they would have needed real re-shots, or if some critical elements of the plot could have been clarified with a careful reissue of some moments. Given the time and money that was invested in this image, more attention and reflection should have been given to this problem. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, some occasional weak acts, some dialogues that do not sound true. , but these are really minor concerns. The reason why I am so concerned about the problems mentioned above is that, like so many these days, I also feel that in all "Heaven's Gate" is so splendid to contemplate and that it deals so magnificently with the main historical, political and sociological just before a masterpiece. Despite its shortcomings, it's so dramatic and visually powerful that it's way above most of the other Hollywood movies I've seen. I would like to remix the sound a lot. I would like to redirect and re-edit the scene where Ella is killed, but the greatness of this image is such that these considerations really become trivial when compared to the value of total production. I must add that it should always be seen on a giant screen to achieve the glorious effect it is capable of offering.
