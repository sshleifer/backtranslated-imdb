Too bad someone did not have the intelligence to launch this movie to theaters. I had never heard of her when she appeared on the wire. After the first impression that this is not like any other movie you've seen since Bringing Up Baby, you should let it drag you and run with it. Not until it is over, do you realize that it covers topics that are not only subtle but also significant. Alienation, denial, fulfillment of wishes, to begin with. Cathy Bates owns this movie, it has never been better. The entire cast has the feeling of the plot and knows what it is doing without having to do free hamming, except where requested, as with the fragments of Julie Andrews or the videos of Jonathan Pryce's camp. If you are not open-minded you will not get it. (See the strange revision of Mark Adnum, which devotes to the adulation of Stephanie Beacham, her career and her brother's OBE for presenting vegetable oil or something to the natives of the island). Taking that as a sign, I could also spend time praising Master Gulinello's star as an intern for the television station or the shower scene of Jack Noseworthy. Then, put aside all the previous concepts of the film comedy and have a good time. I loved.
