IN AGREEMENT. In general, this three-part documentary will update most of the people interested in the world of physics and in the last 300 years of discovery of our universe. If you have read the brilliant book by Stephen Hawkings "A Brief History of Time" and you have understood it, you can benefit from the visual description of certain concepts ... which I did to a certain extent. Greene is bearable, but obviously for the sake of the masses, he tends to explain things in a slightly condescending way. This, of course, is deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this series. <br /> <br /> The invited scientists were good. (not Hawking, but I suppose he has his own DVD) I kept waiting for it to appear, but they rotate through them by almost 3 parts ... (very American weighted here, with some Britons and an antipodean) I bought the disc edition Nova 2 (NTSC) and there were some inclusions that really detracted from the overall experience. <br /> <br /> 1. The "this is brought to you by ..." at the beginning of EVERY part was a necessary evil for the first part, but seeing it 2 more times before it ended was very normal. <br /> <br /> 2. I guess you can not help, but there is a bit of overlap at the beginning of 2 and 3 that made me reach the FFW button several times. <br /> <br /> 3. This set of discs was directly from TV ... (ie, ads, what happened in the last program for those who lost it and "goto pbs.org for more ... ") that appears throughout the presentation. (unlike the BBC material that is unparalleled for the presentation ... Planets, The Blue Planet, etc.) My 7/10 is based only on the content. The little things were there but I got over them. If this had been done with that classic presenter with a British accent (you know), in my opinion it would be a perfect record set. <br /> <br /> If you've seen this and want more ... then I highly recommend the Hawkings book "A Brief History of Time" ... I wish it were also a movie. <br /> <br /> Happy viewing.
