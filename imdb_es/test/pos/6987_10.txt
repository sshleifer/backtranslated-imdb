I watched "Into Pitch Black" on television. And so I had to see this. I must say that it impressed me a lot. <br /> <br /> Not only David Twohy's style has improved since he wrote "Critters 2", this movie caught my attention Vin Diesel. Sure, he was there in "Into Pitch Black", but here he was fierce, terrifying and intense. I have not seen a charisma like that since Schwarzenegger in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple, but it's the characters that make this movie interesting. Then there was what happens with the female protagonist. Unexpected. The dark humor helps the film move forward, the effects are not great, but when Riddick fights the alien ... all my complaints sounded. <br /> <br /> Diesel has not done much since then. This movie would matter to me, but I'm looking forward to the sequel.
