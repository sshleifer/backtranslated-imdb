Another decent offering from the pen of Vince Gilligan. <br /> <br /> Bryan Cranston, a "Malcolm in the middle", before the ceremony, plays Patrick Crump, a deranged guy who eventually kidnaps Mulder at gunpoint and takes him west at high speeds. . It has something to do with its severe buzzing in the head (and its possible deadly combustion, his wife has just experienced it), and the pressure only seems to ease as it heads towards the left coast. Only Mulder could relate to the difficult situation of this guy, and actually link up with his captor before the whole night's tour is complete. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Scully seems to have solved the case with a possible remedy for Mr. Crump and will meet them in the ocean. Check to see if our Dynamic Duo can connect to the Pacific and somehow rectify Crump's big problem.
