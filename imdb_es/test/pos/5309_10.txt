this is what confuses me about the criticism and his opinion. I usually take into account what critics say about a movie, most of the time before watching a movie. <br /> <br /> However, I saw this, without knowing anything about it. Mainly by the cast. Kevin Spacey and Don Cheadle are two of the most acclaimed actors and, in my opinion, live best. and Ryan Gosling is also on a quick trip there. his reality and the humanity that exudes in most of his representations, makes the public really believe in the character and what is happening to him. He really is my favorite actor of my generation. I have always found jena malone quite nice, since then donnie darko, and if she decides to continue doing similar roles, then I do not complain. <br /> <br /> returning to my point. This movie really touched me. I believed it. The performance was first class. as one would expect. the film actually left the audience with the final goal of a good movie; Reflection and reflection that occurs after the final credits roll. I think I should see it again to decipher how this movie was critically maimed. I know your comments should be taken with a pinch of salt. At least now I know.
