I went back to this movie in the middle of the night and almost missed it. Only because there was nothing else in which I decided to see it. In the end, I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> An interesting story, good characters, an intelligent script and a brilliant direction make this a good movie to sit and watch. In fact, this was the first time I heard of this movie, but I would have liked to have paid money to see this at the movies. <br /> <br /> My IMDB rating: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br />
