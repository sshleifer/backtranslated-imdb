Honestly, I really do not understand why there has been so much controversy about this show. Embrace the elements of the original, while expanding on them. The narration has been updated and, while some of the episodes seem to be a bit "Quick", that's good. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is perfect on paper. Easily as good as Tom Baker. <br /> <br /> Rose is one of the best companions, on par with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela. <br /> <br /> I like the concept that time stamps have been destroyed - No more politicking with the Doctor acting as president emeritus. And add something to the character so that it is the only one left. <br /> <br /> SFXs are outstanding, especially compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Take it from me (and there was a huge Dr. Who geek: I took notes while watching the show from Dr Number 1 to Dr Number 8. I took the horrible film out of the canyon personally This is the best program of science fiction on television at this time, possibly always. Watch it and buy the DVD.
