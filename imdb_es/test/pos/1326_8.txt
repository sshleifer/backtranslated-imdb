I just want to point out (in addition to pleading that the series be published on DVD) that a program does not have to be realistic to be entertaining. These days, with all the blood and blood in the news and in crime dramas, reality shows, etc., it's good to get lost in a good and cheesy show with entertaining characters. PWOG fits perfectly. Was it Emmy material? No, but it was amazing anyway. <br /> <br /> I also have to vote for the second cast: they were more charismatic than the cast of the first season. I would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious vibe than the second, but it was definitely more absorbed by the last release. Even though the series has been off the air for years, I will never stop waiting for it to be published.
