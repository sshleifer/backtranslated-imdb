Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments when Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1. <br /> <br /> At first, he goes to training camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in the row. . That's a really funny scene since the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight! <br /> <br /> The next thing you know is that it's in France in a ditch. The hilarious scenes here include a hungry Charlie eating cheese from a mousetrap and reading a letter from his house over someone's shoulder. <br /> <br /> When Charlie goes to sleep, he finds that his bunker is flooded and his roommate is snoring. This is such a fun part! I really can not describe it, I only see the movie. When Charlie wakes up, his legs feel numb, so he tries to "wake them up". He rolled me on the floor when it turned out that his second leg still feels numb ... while Charlie actually rubs the foot of his roommate! <br /> <br /> The movie turns a little somber, while Charlie shoots a couple of Germans from his trench (although it's done in a very funny way) and he, personifying himself as a tree to approach the enemy, saving a friend of his from a death squad. <br /> <br /> The last part is that you are getting it. A French woman in trouble hiding in her house. Then he has to save it and, in doing so, he also captures the German kaiser. For that, he pretends to be a German kolonel or something like that. I love it when Charlie is asked something in German and it's like nein nein nein. The soldier looks at him in a funny way, so Charlie changes his mind: ha ha ha! The Kaiser is captured and Charlie is the hero ... but then he wakes up again in training camp, it was just a sweet dream! <br /> <br /> Charlie made one of those 'dream sequences' before (The Bank comes to mind) but who cares, this movie was so funny that it made me laugh all the time. Chaplin also has something to say with this film (since his later work became more of a social commentary for several mishaps in the world) and is best explained in the last sentence of the film: "Peace on Earth, goodwill for all of humanity. " '<br /> <br /> In short: a Charlie classic, very funny, timeless. 9/10.
