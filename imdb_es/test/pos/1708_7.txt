As the talk shows progress, Larry King Live is not bad, and since he occasionally receives good guests, it is a program that is turned on from time to time, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president or other important guests sit in front of him, it's not too bad. At other times, it tends to welcome guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal that does not bring any intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and television stars. During the trial of OJ Simpson, it seemed that all the other guests in his program were related to the case. But is this really journalism? Or the National Enquirer in the tube? Sometimes, it seems a bit like junk television, Jerry Springer in an interview with phone calls instead of a live audience. <br /> <br /> On the other side, the King show is definitely much better than Bill O'Reilly, whose show is nothing more than a political platform for the Rush Limbaugh variety. That said, Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but, unfortunately, he is not one of the best. King does not always come off as he fully understands when intellectual material is presented, especially if it is done by a scholar or a historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. It always seems that at the moment that King can not deal with the problem in question, it is when he turns to phone calls, perhaps hoping that someone in the country has a better question than him. You can interview someone like David Gergen, but you may not have read any of his books. Something like the movie producer who never bothers to read the script. <br /> <br /> When you're an entertainment celebrity, there's no problem. You can detach yourself as if you were well informed, since the material is not that important anyway. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly a rocket science. And I realize that you have usually seen the last movie of the star. Watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book. However, if it's like John Dean or Bob Woodward, King is a bit like he has not finished his homework. So go to the phones. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a really deep interview, Terry Gross of NPR is probably the best interviewer in the United States. She reads and / or researches everything written by or about her guests in advance and has a working knowledge of those areas. I do not see King doing that. Of course, he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than Terry Gross, who can say more about the American audience than King. In short, Larry is better than Bill, but not as good as Terry.
