Yul Brynner is Commander Surov, a Russian officer who sings, dances and vodka, stationed near the border between Austria and Hungary during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 in The Journey of Anatole Litvak. Although the film has not yet been released on video or DVD, it remains one of Brynner's most compelling performances. Due to political unrest, a group of travelers can not fly from Budapest, but are put on a bus to Vienna. Before they can reach the border, however, their passports are taken and they are stopped for interrogation by the Russians led by Commander Surov. <br /> <br /> The commander has reason to suspect that there is a Hungarian freedom fighter among the Group being smuggled out of the country. In fact, Lady Ashmore is hiding a mysterious passenger, Paul Fleming (Jason Robards, Jr.) who claims to be an American but does not fool anyone. She is helping Fleming mainly to pay off a debt she owed due to the problems caused by her previous association. Among the other passengers there is a British journalist played by Robert Morley, an American family played by E.G. Marshall, his wife Anne Jackson and their two children, one of which is the small screen debut of Ron Howard. <br /> <br /> Major Surov has a romantic interest in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr), and a romance of He develops a kind of between them. However, it offers nothing but disdain and a rigid upper lip, although we suspect that under his heart still beats. Cold War intrigue and powerful acting carry the story, but the romance is never entirely convincing. It remains, however, one of my favorite films of Yul Brynner and deserves to be seen only for its passionate interpretation.
