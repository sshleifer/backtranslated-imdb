I especially enjoyed Delly's review of this film and I agree that Howard is not the only "damaged" character. Howard is relentlessly "primed" by the script, but there is no evidence that his previous employer is really dead or, if he is, that he killed her. Howard does not know and neither do we. With terror and confusion at the sight of the woman lying there, she runs away. However, it never really hurts Helen Gordon, no matter how enraged she is. In fact, she reacts with horror at Helen's faint and the fact that she is holding a pair of scissors ... then she resumes her cleaning and greets the recovered Helen with the almost pathetic "I'm very tired now, I think I'll go home " Frankly, I do not think he's a psychopath. A sick puppy, certainly, but not a psychopath. <br /> <br /> The problem with Howard is that he does not have a true male identity. He wanted to serve his country, but his mental condition denies him a place in the army. He is singularly uprooted and isolated: no wife, no girl, no home (again, at least as far as we know). And, he does the work of a woman - "The floors are my specialty". Helen's niece ruthlessly stripped of this pride in her thoroughness, caustically exclaiming that she would want a man with a real job. Also, although he feels strongly attracted to Helen, he can not or does not want to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass. He is remarkably impotent: he can not fight, he can not work, he can not make love. <br /> <br /> However, Helen is justifiably terrified. She tries to connect with him but, realizing that she does not respond normally (that is, outside the comfort zone provided by her rose-colored memories of her husband Ned), she unknowingly presses all of Howard's buttons when lying to him. his attempt to escape. <br /> <br /> Both characters, trapped in the house, trapped by fear, neurosis, anger and memory, deserve sympathy. I know that the sudden end has disappointed some critics, but I felt that it fit well, since it offered a kind of liberation to the characters. Helen is liberated, I think, from the past. When Howard tries on her husband's military coat, Helen's reaction of disgust stands out. Undoubtedly, he feels that the "sacred" of Ned's possessions has been violated, but hopefully his need to keep everything "intact" has been lost in the reality of his own struggle against danger. Maybe she can move on. <br /> <br /> Howard is also liberated, from his endless cycle of anger, pain and violence. If it happens to treatment or jail is debatable, but I hope it is the first. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Ryan and Lupino. I prefer "On Dangerous Ground", but this is also pretty good.
