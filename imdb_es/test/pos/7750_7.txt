Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is based on a bit of the Japanese anime formula of school drama. The formula is something like this: <br /> <br /> 1. The main character comes from a world outside of normal society and has superpowers. <br /> <br /> 2. There is a very beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> 3. A normal character is the one who shares the main role in the story. <br /> <br /> 4. Unusual things happen in a usual social setting. <br /> <br /> 5. Sometimes the story is about the main character and the normal character that connects to the existence or destruction of the world. <br /> <br /> 6. Absolutely no effort is expended by anyone to gain all the magical powers. They just have it. <br /> <br /> 7. Usually, people who are outside this group of nits do not know their superpowers and continue with their daily lives. <br /> <br /> So there you have it. Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi is created in this sense and became the formula of success for comics and anime in Japan. Although it follows a patsy formula, the series is beautifully designed and the episodes are always located in an interesting place in the normal social configuration that always transforms into unusual circumstances surrounding Haruhi Suzumiya. Each player in the story brings an unusual view of everyday life that we do not normally know. The philosophical turn of his ideas is what makes this series more entertaining. The images are first class, and they are done very well. <br /> <br /> The crazy ideas that Haruhi always seems to have along with complicated story settings can cause you headaches from time to time. It is further complicated by the fact that the episodes are played out of sequence, which further increases the confusion. When I saw the episodes in the chronological sequence, some of the plots finally made sense. I recommend you do the same. It is much more entertaining to watch the series in this way. Google <br /> <br /> List_of_The_Melancholy_of_Haruhi_Suzumiya_episodes <br /> <br /> for the correct sequence of all episodes. And oh, you can notice the headache while you see this as I did. Let me know if you had it too.
