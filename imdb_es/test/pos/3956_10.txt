I had the opportunity to see Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it immensely. I thought it was one of the most captivating movies I had seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new faces and great actors behind them in fantastic places filmed in an unexpected and brilliant way. The three heroes share a chemistry on the screen that runs throughout the film, which makes it so exciting. They are set in exceptional landscapes seen by such an original eye (the work of the DOP is simply great) that makes you feel as if you were discovering them for the first time. The desert environment is flooded everywhere and even the scenes filmed in the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisaco seem to be a natural extension of it. History guides you without problems through all these beautiful scenarios to take you to a bittersweet ending, being the perfect climax for this perfect trip. The construction of the film itself is a masterpiece. The expert use of innovative resources (such as still images that link Danny's memories in the film) will be compared to such rare and nice handmade works. Blind Spot manages to capture the essence of the desert taking you to a universal common ground where any of us can feel discoverer and native.
