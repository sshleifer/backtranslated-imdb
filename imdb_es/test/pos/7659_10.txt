Beautifully filmed, the mind expands the exploration of gypsy culture in the context of its music. Travel across a continent, experiencing the amazing musical styles of various groups of gypsies. It's a little misleading to say that this movie is not narrated. It is narrated with mastery by the music itself, the increasing melodies and subtitled lyrics tell a much better story than a narrator would have. Watch this movie.
