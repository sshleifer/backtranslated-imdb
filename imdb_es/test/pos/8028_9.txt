This film is about Carlos "El Chacal" (Quinn), an international terrorist who, according to the description of CIA agent Henry Fields (Sutherland), seems to mutilate women and children to perfection. At least, that's what he says to blame the US naval officer. UU., Annibal Ramírez (Quinn again), to assume the task of posing as Carlos and put him as a traitor before the eyes of the KGB. Ramírez is apparently physically identical to Carlos but mentally is his antithesis. He is born of order and Carlos is born of chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie is not all shooting action, and that's a good thing. In his first half, Ramírez trains to act and think like Carlos, and that's where the film gets its distinction from other action films of the latest generation. An Israeli agent (Kingsley) joins Fields in Ramirez's training, and together they seem to assume the roles of fathers in the birth of Ramírez's new character. Ramírez is taught not to like the things that Carlos dislikes, to act in the fraction of a second as Carlos would, and even to make love like Carlos (courtesy of a former girlfriend of Carlos). Naturally, everything that is taught will be put to good use in the second part of the movie. It's a little artificial, but Quinn offers a fascinating performance as an aspiring Carlos. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I liked about this movie was that it did not use the exaggerated plot in the evil twin movies, you know. , the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the family of the good twin. The family of Ramírez enters the scene, but instead, they highlight how his new character destroys his family life. <br /> <br /> The good humor of laughter is injected into this film, often with the biting duo of Sutherland and Kingsley. An exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke that involves the name of Ramírez (Annibal, Annabelle, do you understand?). The constant insistence of the duo about how powerful, clever and intelligent Carlos is was also exaggerated. In my opinion, during the final showdown, the reward was not able to match the accumulation. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was nice. I'm not a big fan of action movies, but this movie was more intelligent and absorbing than the average action movie and it kept my attention on everything. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
