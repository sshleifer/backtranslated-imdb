I love this movie. All about it. I almost felt like looking at myself and my friends on the screen. The way this film was filmed was a pure, very original and creative masterpiece. I interacted with these characters and I even had the same thoughts as some. I am really happy to have found this movie. If only there were more geniuses like Justin out there!
