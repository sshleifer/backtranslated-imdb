Stanwyck in his best villain version, Robinson, his equal, as ruthless earth barons in this fairly common western. <br /> <br /> Some scenes of good action, intense use of location, color and Cinemascope. But why the obvious use of archive images in the stampede scene? <br /> <br /> Ford is reliable as always and Foster is strong as Robinson's daughter, but it's the bad guy's movie. And it's not just Stanwyck and Robinson: Brian Keith becomes a surprisingly brazen villain as Stanwyck's lover, and Richard Jaeckel is unforgettable as an insensitive killer. <br /> <br /> See it for the value of the camp.
