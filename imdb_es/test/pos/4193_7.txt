The Beatles had just made 'Magical Mystery Tour'. There was a general feeling that performance, peace and drugs came together naturally. In Los Angeles, there was a film subculture that knew something was happening. Nicholson was in several of these gangs. <br /> <br /> Before I decided to become an actor, before 'Easy Rider', before 'Pink Flamingos', before 'Day for Night', there were several experiments with what to do about this. One important is the 'Zaragoza Manuscript'. This is another. <br /> <br /> Jack writes. Play with the circular narrative, the self-reference, the cinematographic reference, the self-esteem of the performance, the pain of the creation, all in the outskirts of Safe Kiddiepop. You must see this, if only to know something about Jack. <br /> <br /> Certain actors act by digging into themselves. It is a common technique. Some dig deep, but after a while, they become bored because they are incredibly shallow people. Not only are there enough things to maintain a career. Think of DeNiro and Hackman. <br /> <br /> Others are quite interesting people, who seem to become more interesting over time. When they dig in the barrel, they put things back because of the pain of the excavation. Think of Sean Penn and Jack. At the bottom of Jack's barrel, at the end of the spinning thread, since the basis of each character is this experimental and risky writer / filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Who cares if it's a bad movie? It's bad because he took risks. Watch as the director cleans a tear from Annette's cheek. It's an affectionate joke about all of Brando, something I heard Marlon laugh at. That is one of the richest moments in the history of Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br /> There is another reason to see this. Music in cinema has a strong root in dance. The revolution in cinema is often based on music. In this way, entire cultures are dragged. <br /> <br /> A giant unknown in the invention of how billions of people now dance is Toni Basil. She was as influential in pop choreography as the Beatles in music. She was already well in her career when she was asked to work on this. But this is one of his first screen appearances. You can see her work throughout and herself in the great segment "Daddy's Girl", about one of the best songs of Nilsson. (Followed by Frank Zappa's cameo). McCartney would refer to this scene in his special years of TeeVee later. <br /> <br /> A third reason to watch is early (about 6 1/2 minutes) in the film: a character called 'Lady Pleasure' kisses each monkey in a long continuous shot and then leaves. He is credited as I. J. Jefferson but is actually Mimi Manchu, Nicholson's mistress at the time and LSD partner. Red hair, psychedelic behavior. Charming. That scene says it all to me, about how Jack feels about children. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of Ted - 3 of 3: Worth seeing.
