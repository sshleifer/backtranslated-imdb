We all enjoy the movie. It is a very charming family movie with many funny cameos. It was fun to see the Austin musicians, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the film, as well as the turns of the famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially nice in the movie, however, all children are good. The landscape of West Texas is great, as is the soundtrack full of Texas artists. The last half seemed a bit distant, however, my son was interested in the whole movie, which is not so often with him. Something in the story was captivating for the children. After showing calves when I was a kid, I really liked the ending. Definitely, that's not the way it really works unless you have heifers.
