The man with a golden arm was one of the three great films of the same era that dealt with drug addiction. The other two were Monkey on my back and A hat full of rain. But I think that of the three, this is the best. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Otto Preminger had filmed the thing in real Chicago, instead of those obvious studio settings, the movie could have been even better. Who knows, maybe Preminger could not get enough money to pay for the location. It's the only flaw I find in the movie. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is a heroin addict card trader who was arrested for covering his boss Robert Strauss when the game was raided. He took the cure while he was in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer. But many people are conspiring against him. <br /> <br /> First Bob Strauss, who wants him to negotiate again, especially because there are a couple of heavyweight players in the city. It uses some malicious methods to recover the Sinatra services. Secondly, Darren McGavin is the local dope dealer who wants Sinatra to be good and get hooked as a customer again. And, finally, Eleanor Parker, his clinging wife who is working on a scam game to beat everyone, just to keep him close. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra received a Best Actor nomination for this film, but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty. Sinatra could have won for this one if he had not won from From Here to Eternity in the category of supporting actor a few years ago and that Marty was a film so acclaimed in that year. His scenes going through the retreat enclosed in Kim Novak's apartment will leave you in shock. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker does not get enough credit for her role. She is really something like the crazy intriguing wife who wants Sinatra to be tied to her no matter the cost. If it had not been nominated that same year by interrupted Melody, it could have been nominated for this. 1955 marked the highest point of his career. <br /> <br /> Darren McGavin received his first real notice as the street peddler of drugs. Its performance is guaranteed to make your skin crawl. <br /> <br /> Elmer Bernstein contributed an excellent jazz score to accentuate the sordid general of the bleak Chicago neighborhood in which the characters live. It is not a place you want to mention. Your family.
