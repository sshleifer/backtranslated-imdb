I just want to comment to the woman above, that the movie credits Beethoven with begging. In the initial credits they show it. Thank you. I think this is an incredible movie. They chose the right music for the mood of the film, the animation is wonderful and they chose the voices of the characters very well. Teach children never to give up and always have hope. Princess Annika does not give up and shows the children that they can do the same. The film also has humor for all ages, parents and children, to laugh. The colors of this movie are great, and kids can really feel good while they watch it. I saw this movie for the first time, now I am a big fan and I am sure that your son will be too. Walmart sells tons of Barbie and the magic of Pegasus, so your child can still enjoy the movie even when he is not watching. Thank you!
