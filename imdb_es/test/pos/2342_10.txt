I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and I was impressed. This black and white digital film, made with a micro budget, is largely a European film and has great success despite the limitations of DV. The film works because it is in the indie tradition: it deals with complex subjects, but it moves and is relieved with touches of sober humor. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other realistic films from the United Kingdom, where ordinary workers are portrayed as desperate victims or comic stereotypes. The performances are strong, particularly Maureen Carr as the mother, Trise. I understand that the movie has recently been released on DVD and I would definitely recommend it. The rating on this site is misleading, which is why I gave it a high score because the filmmaker, May Miles Thomas obviously put his heart and soul into this and deserves more than 2.8 for his incredible achievement.
