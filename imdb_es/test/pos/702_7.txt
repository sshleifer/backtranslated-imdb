Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once friends outside the law, but now Scott is a sheriff and the young Ford is still renting his gun. They hire him to get a job at the bank, but he delays getting to the city and those who hired him get someone else. That leads to all kinds of complications, a lot for a movie that does not last even 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Randy and Glenn have girls here. Claire Trevor plays her usual good-time girl with a heart of gold. And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan who falls in love with Ford in a big way without realizing who he is or why he came to the city where Scott is the sheriff. <br /> <br /> It's B western, but unusual for Time and for Columbia Pictures it was given the full Technicolor treatment. The Desperados marked the first Glenn Ford film in Technicolor, a process reserved only for some of the most expensive films of the largest studios. Harry Cohn certainly was not one of those who had to pay for it. And definitely not during wartime. <br /> <br /> The plot gets a little more complicated when Ford and Scott are tested for friendship versus convenience / duty. The plot also involves some high-class hypocritical skunks in the city of Randy, who are the real outlaws when it comes to the movie. Adorable explosive lunkhead of a mate. The climax includes a stampede of cattle and a shooting in the city hall and is one of the best that has been made in a western movie. <br /> <br /> The fans of the four protagonists and the westerns in general will enjoy this one.
