I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece. I recommend buying this movie on DVD because it is a movie that you would want to watch more often than once. And believe me, you will still find significant little details after seeing them several times. <br /> <br /> The characters, except perhaps the grandmother, are very balanced, they are not black and white. Although you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists, there is also empathy for the other characters. <br /> <br /> I think the IMDb rating for the movie is too low, probably because of its controversy politically. content.
