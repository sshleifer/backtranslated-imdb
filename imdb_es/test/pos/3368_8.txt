I was not sure what to expect from THE BOX. I'm a big fan of Darko, but I also saw the mess that became Southland Tales, whether it was a failed studio, who knows. With the box I was pleasantly surprised. It was a throwback to the classic science fiction paranoia movies that point to much larger tortuous events, but focus on an intimate base of characters. <br /> <br /> The slow construction and chilling tension were very effective for the tone and theme of the whole movie. Any change in such a pace would have led to the typical Hollywood or "MTV" style, which simply would not have served the purpose of this story correctly. Everything, from the extraneous extras that look / act to the minimum point, to the minimum explanation of exactly what was happening, added a whole series of concerns centered on the underlying fear and the diminishing of hope for our greed, although it is say, main characters. This was something well thought out and put in place by Richard Kelly, from the first act to the end. The story of Richard Matheson, on which it was based, NOT on the Twilight Zone ep, which was another version of the story, was one of morality and greed that were still the core elements of THE BOX. With only 8 pgs in length, expanding it to a function with substance would not have been an easy task, but it was done with style, originality and leaves the viewer with persistent thoughts about the film. Many have and will compare this with DARKO in case it is so deep or not, but I discovered that it is a completely different movie, thematically and emotionally. His tone is completely different, as are the messages and intentions of this film. Where Darko left us questions internally, THE BOX leaves the viewer with more external questions, involving the world around us. For example, knowing the human nature, would the BOX test end? Decent action, the big spooky images and the imminent atmosphere add to the slow and relaxing pace. It is not for everyone, but for those who come from where it comes, it is a delight.
