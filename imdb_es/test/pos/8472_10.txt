Ray is one of those movies that makes you pause. You really think about what you heard or think about what you read about this man and he does not even come close. During the first time I saw Ray, I forgot I was watching a movie. I felt like a glimpse looking at this man's life through a window. This movie is so compelling that it drags you and involves all your emotions that you go through an emotional roller coaster and when it ends, you do not want to do it again so soon because it has that kind of emotional blow that other movies are missing Jamie Foxx deserved his Oscar and with reason, so its performance is spectacular and should be considered as the standard for anyone who wants to make a biography photo soon. This movie is as good as its theme, both deserve the classic and legendary titles.
