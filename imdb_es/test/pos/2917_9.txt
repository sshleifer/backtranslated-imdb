After having read all the comments in this movie, I am still surprised by Fox's reluctance to release a restored full-screen version on DVD. Yes, the story may be a bit imprecise and certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the second Fox movie made at Real Cinemascope and the production values ​​alone deserve a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in the second grade and it provoked my lifelong interest in all Egyptian things, which culminated in my visit to Egypt 4 years ago. Amazing the power of cinema in a child's imagination, huh? In high school I read the book and promised myself that one day I would make that dream trip. Now, it is true that this movie was made in the style of the "old school", which means that the Egyptians were portrayed by Britons with pink skin and blue eyes. However, has anyone seen the current HBO series "ROME"? Everything old is old again. One can not imagine why in this day and age we are still selecting the actors who huddle as Mayfair aristocrats in the Roman trawl. No actor in Rome could pass for an old Italian. That said, the AMARNA period in Egypt remains one of the most fascinating events in human history. This movie is immensely attractive (to borrow a word from NEFER) for its historical information (BEER, CEREBRAL SURGERY, IRON!) And its magnificent photography and score. I have a terrible DVD version of Taiwan that I look at again and again and pray that someday a true restored widescreen version will be available. For anyone interested in this topic, I recommend the historical novel "One God against the gods", by the author of Advise and Consent. If any of you moviegoers knows how to contact Fox to urge them, please let me know!
