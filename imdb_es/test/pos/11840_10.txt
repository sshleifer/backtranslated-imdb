I think this show is amazing! I love it, and I love Fabian (not in a romantic way) but if I were there, I would totally support Fabian as Haley did, and the other girls, yes! I mean, if they're rums, why do not you want to fight them? Fabian is the only one who has the guts to confront people and say what they think, not just stay and suck! FABIAN 100% !!!!! I also love Haley, because she is like a normal girl who does not want to be with cows, bugs and grass everywhere, and sleep in a warm bed with servants, I mean, if you have the opportunity and the money, why not? You do that!!! And Fabian too, Fabian brought pizza and as 2 or 3 people said thank you, I mean he spent money !!
