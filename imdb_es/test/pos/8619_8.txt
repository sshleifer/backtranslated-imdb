Another fabulous film by Catherine Breillat, this time about the difficulties of filming a sex scene in a movie. Using comedy ?? A new genre for Breillat? we get a behind-the-scenes view of the cinema, but in a documentary style. The character who plays the director in the film is based on Breillat, the sexual scene in question is taken from his previous film, A Ma Soeur, as the leading teenage actress. But the film, like all Breillat's work, is not just entertainment. It is peppered with philosophical observations about the nature of sexuality and also demonstrates a devotion to "purity" (as opposed to pornography) that is a cornerstone of Breillat's work and a devotion to real emotion. We see that the character of the director harangue the young actress and main actress to get the best out of them, hypnotizing them in the parts they need to play, taking out a part of themselves that the director can see in them but can not see in themselves until reaching the heights of action that she demands of them. She makes meaningful films, not exciting ones, but she shows the work that is needed to produce this, and this gives us an idea of ​​the film making process (decidedly French) and of masculine psychology. female sexuality
