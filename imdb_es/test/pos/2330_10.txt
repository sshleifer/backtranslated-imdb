LCDR Tom Dodge, despite having a reputation among divers as renegade and rebel (* note to the reader: Maverick does not mean "Tom Cruise." Maverick means "non-conformist".), It is actually an intelligence operative for the Vice Admiral of His underwater fleet. The vice admiral is worried about our old friends, the Russians who organize garage sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Libya, North Korea or Iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and launch a nuclear warhead in the port of Norfolk or Mayport, Florida. And this was 6-7 years before September 11. <br /> <br /> The Admiral assigns Dodge to take command of a World War II diesel submarine and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and the USS ORLANDO, one of the best in the attack line fast sub. Dodge takes command and never lashes the bad news. I mean his adorable group of strange submariners in warriors. Despite having been "welcome aboard" tattooed on his penis, he is a competent and fair commander, does not choose favorites and delegates authority responsibly. The United States Navy could not have devised a better recruitment propaganda than this jewel underappreciated by the creator of the "Police Academy".
