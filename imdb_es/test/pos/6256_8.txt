Well, this was not the best horror movie I've ever seen. However, even though it's a lower budget, it's a pretty decent movie. The monsters are unique and credible. Demons, they even give a bit of fear in the scenes in which they show that they wreak havoc on this poor family. Although, when you finally get to see the monsters completely, you really think "WTF !? The only part that really bothered me is when * sniff * killed the kitten! Not the kitten, noooooo, why? Seriously, if you are looking for extreme violence and gore, this is not the movie for you.Go to rent The Hills Have Eyes or something like that.If you have small children, I would not recommend seeing this with them; I would probably give them nightmares about trolls in your room.
