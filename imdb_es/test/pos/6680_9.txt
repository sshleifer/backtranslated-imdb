at least for me. and quite unexpected - as a subject. a movie that makes you question your beliefs, your life, your focus on everything. That helps you to see the world in which we live through a lens, or a multitude of lenses ... a moving, surprising and disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> and benefit from one of Kevin Spacey's best performances. Seconded very well by Jeff Bridges. There is not a false note in this tango. It is a perfect dance. perfect 'until the end. <br /> <br /> What does the end reveal? well ... all you want ... <br /> <br /> a movie you want to see again. maybe not immediately. Maybe after a few days. months years. but it is something to go to, or return.
