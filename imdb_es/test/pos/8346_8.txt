Lady and the Tramp II is animated in a very colorful way, and the songs, especially that of Junkyard Dogs, are quite good. However, the family seems even too idyllic, and I can not help but understand that Scamp is unhappy when everything is forbidden. However, I also sympathize with Angel, who has never had a loving family until he meets Jim dear and dear. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is clear that the original Dame and the Tramp are better than this sequel.
