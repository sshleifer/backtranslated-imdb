A good flight and revenge to the old, with a touch and a touch of gravitas to inject a bit of black social history into its plot. Directed by Mario Van Peebles, who does it well, the gang of misfits fleeing the great monks of Billy Zane's army (apparently unstoppable) acquitted themselves well, their adventures are plausible but fun and exciting. There are some whimsical scenes of flashback that make up the character of the hero and the background story, a good ending to the shooting while our heroes defend the city of the greedy white landowners, and even Stephen Baldwin is not bad in this pleasant and quite powerful western.
