I thought that this movie was amazing. I loved it, although my brothers did not. The special effects were exceptional, and this movie is about my favorite sport; Golf. The only thing that disappointed this incredible movie is that it is difficult to see it twice or more in a row. This film absolutely leads everything else I've seen. It was everything I would expect from a movie. Simply I loved it. Also, it was quite nice for the kids. This movie helped me realize that when you set your mind, anything is possible. I would give it a 10/10 pure! It was better than The Legend of Baggar Vants, and the two Pirates of the Caribbean movies combined. Absolutely incredible. I loved.
