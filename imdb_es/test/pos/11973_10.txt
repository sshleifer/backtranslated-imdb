Watchers is a fun movie if you do not take it very seriously, the novel written by Dean R. Koontz is obviously much better, but the film itself is entertaining in its own way. The film has many changes for the novel Watchers, the only difference is the main character of Travis. In the book, he was an adult and a retired soldier from Delta Force, while in the film he is a teenager. Observers have good points, the movie has some bloody scenes in parts. I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was great to see him in this movie, he always makes a great performance in all his films. The OXCOM costume looks a bit corny, but the camera never shows the creature until the end of the movie. The dog Einstien was impressive since he was well trained. <br /> <br /> The film sees two genetic experiments that escape from a laboratory, a dog and a monster. Both experiments are linked telepathically, since the two animals are part of a military project where the dog would infiltrate an enemy base, then the creature would attack them and eliminate them. The dog finds a teenager named Travis who takes him home and discovers that he is intelligent, so he calls the dog Einstein. Meanwhile, OXCOM is roaming around killing people and taking their eyes out. Two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this. The incident gets out of hand. Soon, Travis learns that he is not sure because the OXCOM is attracted to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in his way, so Travis and his mother will rescue his girlfriend who is arrested in the hospital by the two agents. Then they hide in the forest, while the agents of the Government and OXCOM are not left behind. <br /> <br /> Watchers is not a great adaptation of Dean R. Koontz's novel, but it is a horror movie of the 80s, many fans of It is possible that the book does not want to see this, since it is not faithful to the book, but fans of the horror films of the 80s may want to read it.
