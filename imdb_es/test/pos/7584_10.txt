Horses on Mars is an animated and attractive short film that sometimes presents a comic aspect of the evolution process through the eyes of those who have not yet evolved. The story is personal, sometimes sentimental, and is backed by a strong animation and digital narration that involves the viewer in this science fiction story. I was lucky enough to see this short film in widescreen format at the Sundance Film Festival in 2002, and I must assume that when it is transferred to the small screen, it will lose part of its ability to attract the reader to the no less intelligent story and the impressive graphics.
