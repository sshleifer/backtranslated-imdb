In this tale of a strongly wounded Christian family that has three of its four members "born again" after a car accident caused by a cake, what really stands out is how is most of the land, where there is so much potential to review the above, and how really inspired most of the performance is. Where most of the moments in the film, particularly their frank and "innocent" discussions about sexuality after three of the four family members took away the guilt and shame, is hilarious, it's also exhilarating and the characters are stay with you <Br /> <br /> How often, for example, does a character in a comedy turn from being almost caricatured to being full-body emotional in the course of a scene? How often do we see a cast that can deviate from the middle of the sentence to show a bit of humanity beneath the character's skin? Even many of the "bad guys" in this movie have moments of heartbreaking honesty, although much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and horrifying. There is truth and history behind the most questionable acts in this movie, which is a difficult task in satire. <br /> <br /> How refreshing it is to see a dark comedy that can dare to be humanistic. How nice to see actors so fully committed to the character that they can dare to let them be ridiculous and sublime. <br /> <br /> And as a gay person, I do not think I've been so excited about a heterosexual. Sexual scene as it was in the first sexual encounter between the parents of this family after their accident. <br /> <br /> Bravo. Bravo. One of my favorites at Outfest this year.
