A dark and painful look at the dangers of drug addiction, Sinatra is wonderful in this movie. The mere sight of his frantic twisting, screaming and destructive rage near the end of the movie is enough to make anyone think twice before trying heroin; Maybe they should show this to children in health class instead of the senseless nonsense that we are forced to endure year after year. he himself after being in prison, trying to get rid of his drug habit and his work of dealing cards in illegal gambling operations, who is knocked down, thrown away by the evils of human nature. He is being taken advantage of by his employers, the drug dealers and even his enigmatic, cunning but stupid wife. <br /> <br /> Even if you did not like the movie itself, it's worth seeing it just for the soundtrack. Everything is heavy, swinging jazz with large sections of drums and brass. This, with its groovy, though slightly sinister, sound, helps create the mood, along with the smiling, meandering drug and card dealers, who always seem to hang around like vultures around Frankie Machine. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone, especially if you like black movies, zoot suits, fedoras or jazz.
