This is a movie full of action that makes me feel very calm and relaxed every time I see her. The film (without reaching its conclusion) shows that, in the face of extreme odds, it is still possible to prevail. <br /> <br /> This movie is very refreshing and is likely to be banned at any time. Get a copy before the thought police burn every copy you can find. They do not want you to have hope for the future, or to think you have an opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if the Political Correction does not suppress it, this would be an excellent film to launch. on DVD This release could contain interviews with the writer and the director, and related articles. I'm sure he would sell some copies, and I would be one of the first to buy it. <br /> <br /> - Mincka
