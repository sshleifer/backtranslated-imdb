Made in exchange for a twenty-dollar exchange budget, this cheap thirteen-minute drink blithely parodies the legendary sci-fi blockbuster '77 'by George Lucas in the most infectiously foolish way imaginable. Writer / director Ernie Fosselius offers a winning and often unsurpassed combination of ridiculous sound effects, ineptly staged action scenes, raw special effects (far from) (you'll just love the scratched lasers in the movie, the paper asteroids aluminum and household items). household appliances ... I mean spaceships twirled around obvious wires), dubbed badly in dialogue, acting unashamedly of Hammy, and Richard Wagner's touching piece of classical music "Ride of the Valkyries." The characters are presented in broad and appropriate strokes; My favorites are the hairy wimp Fluke Starbucker, the venerable Jedi Knight Auggie "Ben" Doggie, and the odious villain Darph Nader (who spits nothing but incomprehensible incoherence). In addition, 4-Q-3 is clearly based on the Tin Man from "The Wizard of Oz", while Artie Deco is definitely a cheap vacuum. The real masterpiece of this film is to cast the legendary voice supreme actor Paul Frees as the narrator; The delightfully rich and feathery histrionic tones of Frees add immensely to the silly joy but at the same time cutting sideways (lines of choice: "You will laugh! You will cry! We will say goodbye to three dollars!"). A total scream.
