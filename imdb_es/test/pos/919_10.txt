I use IMDB a lot. Mainly reading other people's comments about movies I've seen or not. I thought it was time to write some words about this movie that changed my life and the way I see myself in a movie. I think I've seen it at least a dozen times since the fall of 94, when I saw it in the theater for the first time. <br /> <br /> I feel that Kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time. And I think this is your best. It was the last. I was very sad the day I knew he had died, because we sure missed the opportunity to get something else from him. <br /> <br /> RED is the best interpretation of Kieslowski + incredibile by Trintignant & Jacob + Sobocinski cinematography. If you have not seen it, look it up! If so, simply go back to it! <br /> <br /> Red: just a masterpiece. Please, forgive my poor English!
