*** SPOILERS *** This movie shows the brutal bloodbath caused by the retirement of Johnny Carson to determine who would succeed him. The imitations of David Letterman and Jay Leno are performed satisfactorily by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, although the performances were not excellent. Reni Santoni is the best performance of the "executives" (plays John Agoglia of NBC), and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Baliban) is the second. I was surprised at the way Littlefield enthusiastically discussed the discarding of Johnny Carson. This was Johnny Carson! This scene reflects the ruthless world of what you've done for yourself lately. Kathy Bates presented the best interpretation of the film as Jay's agent, Helen Kushnick. Another commentator claimed that Leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the movie. I respectfully do not agree. The relationship with Kushnick bordered on something akin to domestic violence. She orders it and, when he revolts against her in the end, tries to play the sympathy card (mentioning her dead husband and son); however, when Jay ends their relationship, she becomes violent again, shouting "Do not leave me, you bastard of two faces!" Before breaking a photo on the floor. In general, the movie is hilarious and I would like it to be shown more often.
