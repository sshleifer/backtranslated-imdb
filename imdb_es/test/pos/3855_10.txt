This is one of my favorite Disney movies. It has everything you could expect in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where Aristocat Duchess and his three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the evil steward of the Lady, Edgar, discovers that she plans to leave all her fortune to the cats. He realizes that if he has the chance to claim fortune, the cats will be out of the way. An excellent masterpiece, often forgotten in the 1970s, a time when the Disney studio made few animations, including songs like the title number "The Aristocats" and "Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat" , will enchant the spectators. Young and old with its enduring jazziness.
