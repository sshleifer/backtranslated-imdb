Contrary to the comment published below, The Big Trail (1930) was not filmed in a three-camera process "like the later Cinerama." That was the end of Napoleon (1927), a completely different movie! The Big Trail was filmed simultaneously in 35mm and 70mm versions (Grandeur), and both versions are shown on Fox Movie Channel from time to time, making it easy to compare one with the other. The Grandeur version (transmitted in letterbox @ approximately its original ratio of 2-1) is more cinematically impressive with its wide-angle panoramas, but suffers the same problem that haunted the early CinemaScopes, a lack of close-ups forced by director Raoul Walsh due to focusing problems Scenes that involve individuals instead of crowds or long shots are much more effective in the standard version because the camera can get closer to the players and thus achieve a greater sense of participation for the viewer. When viewing the two versions simultaneously, one has an accurate idea of ​​what shots Walsh chose to shoot up close, in the standard version, but could not, in the Grandeur version. There are also a couple of sequences that involve El Brendel: a shell game with Ian Keith, and some business with his wife and an imbecile, which are in the Grandeur version, but are missing in the standard version. <br /> <br /> For the album The Big Trail is the only one of the three Fox Grandeur films that has survived in its original widescreen format. (The other two are Fox Movietone Follies from 1929, completely lost, and Happy Days, which survives only in standard format). Other studios also experimented with large films at the moment, but the only other one that is still known to exist in both formats is The Bat Whispers, filmed in 65 mm and 35 mm, and released by United Artists. Other large films were Billy the Kid by MGM (1930) and The Great Meadow (1931), Danger Lights by RKO (1930) and The Lash by WB (1930), all of which can be seen in their standard format versions in Turner Classic Movies. Kismet (1930), by WB, was also filmed in wide and standard format, but seems to have disappeared completely; it is rumored that he is lost. <br /> <br /> Why did the film fail in 1930? The theaters wobbled (it was a play on words) due to the impact of the stock market crash of October 1929 and the spiraling costs of installing sound equipment, so they were adverse to assume the additional cost of installing new additional projection equipment and new wider screens to fit only a handful of movies, photographed in a variety of different systems that were not always compatible with each other. It would not be until 1953 when Fox, now Twentieth Century-Fox, would try again, and this time he would, with the introduction of the wide-screen CinemaScope.
