I am slowly reviewing as many Hong Kong action movies as I could and found this gem, mainly due to Ching Wan Lau, who is one of my favorite actors. <br /> <br /> It's a great action movie but not as OTT as the title might suggest. It moves at a great pace and is really nice. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this movie was the soundtrack. It seems that Rob Dougan, the guy who made the song 'Clubbed To Death' that was popular in 'The Matrix', raised the soundtrack of Big Bullet and compiled it into one of the songs from his album 'Furious Angels'; The melody in question is called 'I do not drive anymore' and it is also the opening melody of the TV series 'Law and Order' and the opening track in the DVD menu 'Matrix Reloaded'. That really surprised me, because of the pure coincidence!
