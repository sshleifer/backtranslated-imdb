Gary Cooper is a great guy. He has always liked his sensible characters. As some others have commented, there are some oddities in the script, like a Marshall of the USA. UU He got his job and can not even hit a barn with a gun. A rancher with about thirty hands, but it seems he can not stop his cattle from escaping. <br /> <br /> But there are many quick and direct thoughts that you shoot at Cooper to keep him entertained. <br /> <This movie was made in 1950. People in their 20s and 30s have trouble understanding that these films were created for entertainment, not for the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Expect Oscar's material to do this injustice. It's about the good ones finding a way to gather the bad guys. <br /> <br /> So rent, borrow or buy this movie, prepare some corn and enjoy Coop once more.
