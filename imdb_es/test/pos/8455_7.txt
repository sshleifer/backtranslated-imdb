All the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come. You have the star cast: Michael Douglas in an uncharacteristic role of "free spirit" who practically started his film career, Fonda playing his typical outspoken woman doing his part for the liberation of women, and Jack Lemmon is so sure as always to show us a man with A crisis of confidence. Give them a hot topic about the fact that big companies are duplicates, and that's encouraging for a kickoff, but having life imitating art as soon as a marketing man's dream is. <br /> <br /> The script is impressively tense, clever but luckily I keep the jargon to a minimum, and there is a genuine sense of sustained tension brought by the director as our three protagonists run to beat the clock. If you like 'whistling' dramas, then this is not as good as "The Insider", but everything is more than nervous enough.
