A good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others. It's a horse racing movie, and it's a movie of "the little man has his chance" and it's a "how far would you go?" movie. Walter Mattau demonstrates once again his adaptability as an actor. He fits perfectly like Lloyd Bourdelle, a vagabond from Louisiana Cajun. This film offers you a rare image of the horse drag racing of Lousiana Cajun. He has a young quarter horse who is a superior career prospect. "He had nothing but a service station and a good horse." The Bourdelles take the opportunity to succeed by taking the Shadow horse to Ruidoso, New Mexico, to prepare to run in the Futurity All-American. But how far will Lloyd go to gain fame and fortune? Also memorable from this movie are scenes of Lloyd spitting tobacco juice and waiting for his truck to start.
