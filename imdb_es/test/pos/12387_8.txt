I suppose this movie is not your typical thriller in Spanish, since it is based on a true story that took place abroad. The film is based on the real story of the Frenchman Jean-Claude Romand, and the real case is much more bloody and terrifying than the film. In the real story of Mr. Romand, the family did not escape, after years of lies, he decided to end it all by killing his wife, his two children, his parents and his dog, and although he tried to commit suicide, it seems that he did not. Try very hard how he survived. I saw the movie with people next to me talking about how it could never happen in real life that all these lies were not detected, I laughed because I had read the book about Mr. Romand and I knew it happened. I like Jos√© Coronado in this movie, he offered us a good performance, like the rest of the team.
