It seems to have been made as a vehicle for W.C. Fields and Carol Dempster and they dominate him. Fields already has his well developed film character. Carol Dempster seems to dance through the film and her performance reminds me of Mary Pickford, who also worked a long time under the direction of D.W. Griffith. Typically from Griffith's latest films technically. <br /> <br /> Later, like Poppy (the original title) with Fields in the same role.
