Alexander Lou, star of the classics like 'The Super Ninja' and 'Mafia vs Ninja' titles here in this entertaining festival of martial arts. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the evil Abbott White (who claims to be humble and frankly white eyebrows of somewhat frightening looks) enlisting the help of a ninja clan to overthrow the Shaolin Temple. <br /> <br /> This goal is achieved and, in addition, eliminates most of its members, although it goes without saying that one or two survives and predictably continue to avenge a possible revenge against the evil Abbott. <br /> <br /> .... Ok, so the plot is not exactly what is pushing the envelope in terms of creativity, but anyone can see a movie with a title like 'Wu Tang vs Ninja' aka 'The Ninja Hunter' really cares about a factor as inconsequential as an argument? Of course, no! - What matters in these films and chewing gum are the fights. Here you have the value of your money! There is a lot of choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason. <br /> <br /> If you like martial arts movies, this is a must see!
