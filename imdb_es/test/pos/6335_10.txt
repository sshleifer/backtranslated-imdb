The creepy demons "The Gentlemen" capture the voice of the population of Sunnydale, to steal human hearts without screaming. Giles finds that according to a legend, if a lady screams, the creatures will be destroyed, but Buffy and her friends, including Riley, have to fight the monsters without words. <br /> <br /> "Silencio" is certainly the Best Episode of the Fourth Season of Buffy until this moment. Having a lot of humor and funny situations, I liked it a lot. Spike is very funny, the romance between Xander and Anya is great, but I loved the "intense" dialogue between Buffy and Riley. The Gothic scenario of the final battle against "The Gentlemen" recalls the atmosphere of "Dark City". My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "SilÃªncio" ("Silence")
