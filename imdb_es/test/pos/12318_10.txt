John Huston finished his extraordinary career with one of the most perfect and sensitive films I've ever seen. For his farewell, he decided to adapt the beautiful story of James Joyce, "The Dead", and not only made one of the most faithful adaptations of literature to film, but also created a film that more than 20 years later still far exceeds . of contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie a few years ago, when I was studying at the University, I watched with amazement the screen, marveling at every aspect of the film: acting, screen writing, direction. , costumes, settings, music, cinematography. Thinking about that now, I still can not do anything for what I criticize. Huston just knew how to tell a good story. <br /> <br /> A good part of the credit should also go to Tony Huston. I knew that I should not interfere with a text that is not only perfection itself, but is already visual enough for the cinema. Father and son let the story breathe and delight in the long and fascinating conversations between characters and in significant silences. <br /> <br /> Donal McCann also deserves credit for his performance as Gabriel Conroy. I had never seen it in movies, nor have I seen it before, but it gave one of the most moving performances I've seen. <br /> <br /> In short, The Dead is an excellent cinematic experience, of a legendary director who never stopped being excellent.
