This is an intelligent story about relationships and an exhibition of three main categories of players in the relationship game: playboys (Max), manipulative women (Alice) and fools who may be really in love (Lisa, Muriel and Lucien). <Br /> <br /> Max and Alice are very unpleasant and perhaps despicable characters, but they always have control in the game and leave their companions in the dark. But as the end of the debate, as veteran players like Max and Alice, would be delighted to get rid of them at any time they see fit, as if it had been announced that the game was over and each one of them would not mind that get. with your own life and play another game with other anonymous people when another opportunity presents itself. Lisa, Muriel and Lucien could be the ones who wanted to invest something real in a relationship, but they could not realize that they were the baits in the game and the last losers (in regard to what was shown to us) .. Who knows if they are also advanced players of some kind in their worlds that are not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> This is a very fast, delicate and seductive story with a tempting execution of the cast. It also deserves a deeper thought: how much is real in a relationship game?
