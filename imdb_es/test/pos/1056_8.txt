Although it is a Christmas movie, "Christmas in Connecticut" could have been made at any time of the year, since it is the story of a soldier who goes through what it is to be an idyllic moment with a Martha Stewart guy. That's what he thinks. Actually, the lady in question, played by Barbara Stanwyck, has a column from a popular magazine about life on a farm with her husband and her baby. He has no farm, no husband, no baby, nor the many recipes he publishes. They belong to the owner of the nearby restaurant. When her publisher, Sydney Greenstreet, insists that she entertains Private Dennis Morgan, asks for her boyfriend's help in using her farm, and transports herself and the restaurateur there. There's even a baby ... well, actually, there's more than one. Chaos ensues, and the farce becomes increasingly difficult to play, especially when Stanwyck falls in love with Morgan. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, and even if you are very depressed, "Christmas in Connecticut" I can get you out of this. Barbara Stanwyck is wonderful since the career woman became a housewife. Despite not being as flashy as Crawford or Davis, he was able to do what any role required: it could be cheap, elegant, warm, unpleasant, cold and / or sexy, and makes it look easy. In addition to that, she is always attractive and attractive. Dennis Morgan is a handsome and charming soldier; As an additional bonus, you can use your Irish tenor. The promised Reginald Gardner is everyone's business, and it can be said that it is not right for Stanwyck. S.Z. Sakall, like the fake uncle / real chef, is very funny, especially when he says that Stanwyck can turn a pancake before an audience. <br /> <br /> I can imagine the impact this lovely movie had on the end of World War II. It must have been a true beacon for the best times to come.
