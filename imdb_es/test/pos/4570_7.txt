He captured this recently after noticing the name of James Earl Jones in the title. It was better than I expected. Of course, it's quite old, it was made in the early and mid-70s, but it's actually a decent drama. It runs in about 90 minutes or so and features good performances by James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll. The plot is conventional in general, but told from the perspective of a single black woman who has 6 children and tries to deal with all the problems that persist. This makes it an interesting sight ... also in the fact that the script was not too sentimental or too dramatized, it's almost like looking at a part of the past. All styles of the 70 are in abundance. However, the ending is a bit weird ... it probably would have been better without the theatricality.
