I just returned to see some episodes of this series on very bad VHS tapes in which I recorded the series. However, I'm glad I did it. <br /> <br /> Ramona is based on Beverly Cleary's children's books and follows the adventures of the eight-year title (Sarah Polley). He has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble like many eight year olds. The ten episodes are pretty good. "Mystery Meal" scares me like a vegan, but it's funny to see parents trying to get their kids to eat the cow tongue! And any episode that mentions Godzilla Versus The Smog Monster twice can not be that bad. I like "Ramona's Bad Day" even more. Although it is discouraging to see Ramona go through a difficult day, she imagines taking revenge on her uncle, friend Howie (a pre-Psi Factor Barclay Hope) of her friend Howie, who always makes fun of her. "The perfect day" is also good. <br /> <br /> Lori Chodos plays Beezus, Ramona's sister. I swear I've seen it in something else, but IMDb does not include anything other than this program. Unfortunately, this series is not on DVD. Why every shitty show is done these days on DVD, except for something that I would really like to buy? An injustice if there ever was one!
