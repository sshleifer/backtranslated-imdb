ASCENDING to power in 1933, Hitler and his "National German Socialist Workers Party", which of course we all know as the Nazis, strengthened their control over the country more and more as time passed. At the beginning of their trampling trampling of the German people, they called each and every one of the artists, journalists and filmmakers to their Nazi headquarters so that they could be informed of what the newly declared "Third Reich" (also known as "Empire") ) is expected of them. <br /> <br /> WHEN the principal director of the era of impressionism and silent expressionism of German cinema, Mr. Fritz Lang, was summoned to meet with Herr Goebels; He listened carefully and said nothing. Immediately after leaving the office of the Minister of Propaganda, Herr Lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to Paris. Without returning to his residence, Fritz Lang did not return to Germany (at least not until many years later), remained in France, and finally emigrated to the United States of America. <br /> <br /> MR LANG Worked immediately on United States, creating a variety of nice, solid films with a higher level of literacy for many years .. Included in this great number of titles is the lucky topic of today, UNION OCCIDENTAL (20th Century-Fox, 1941). TYPICALLY, a film about the Old West and Pioneer Days needed both quality and quantity of actors, WESTERN UNION qualified in both requirements, it offers us a great variety of protagonist talents, as well as a supporting cast that makes each Minute and each scene are a delight for our senses. <br /> <br /> Heading the playlist are Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore Other featured characters are John Carradine a vampire or another scary guy, but a doctor), Geor ge "Slim" Summerville (veteran actor, veteran of Silent Film and graduate of Keystone Comedies of Mack Sennett), Chill Wills (always reliable cast member and former singer of "The Avalon Boys ") and the burly guy Barton MacLane. Added to this mix, we have names like Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kermit Maynard (brother of Ken Maynard). <br /> <br /> PROMINENT in the presented American Indians are: Chief Big Tree, Chief Thundercloud and Mr. Jay Silverheels. It is also noted that a great representative of the aboriginal peoples of North America is that great singularly impressive and memorable example of Red Man, the native of Louisiana, Iron Eyes Cody (born Espera DeCorti of Sicilian immigrant parents). <br /> <The filming of the outdoor fine scenes was done in a location in Arizona and Utah and was performed in the highest Technigolour grade available. (There is no Monument Valley, but then, that is the Province of Mr. John Ford). In some ways, this movie is a much more amazing achievement than we can think; for this he took a kind of history from the pulp magazine, adapted it to the tastes and idioms of pre-war America in the late thirties and early forties. All this was done by a director born in Germany who had only been in Hollywood and America for the shortest possible time. <br /> <br /> In its final analysis, WESTERN UNION, although it may not be the most historical accurate example of the Western genre; We just do not care. Write down all the necessary categories for a great night at the movies! So who cares about the little details like "precision"? <br /> <br /> We give Mr. Lang and 20th Century-Fox a rating of ****! <br /> <br /> NOTE: * We just saw a special on the WTTW PBS station, here in Chicago that was all about all the film actors, directors and other craftsmen that the Nazis to power made them take refuge in the United States and Hollywood. (It seems that Movie Folks and Scientists were the biggest export for Germany at this particular moment, being that the scientists who built the atomic bomb, as well as the future people of NASA, came from Europe at this time). <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
