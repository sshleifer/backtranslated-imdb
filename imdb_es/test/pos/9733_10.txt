First of all, I hate science fiction things, and although sometimes this movie has some science fiction, that's fine, because at least it focused on Andre Toulon. In the last 3, Andre seemed to have been mentioned, but the Stories never really focused on him, which made me angry. What also angers me is the amount of 0 you have in the voting table. Give people a rest. If you saw this movie and you liked it, vote for it. Please. What I loved about this movie is that it went back to where it all began. When Andre learned the secret of life for the first time. I would recommend renting this if you have seen a Puppet Master movie and liked it. But do not rent it if it's the first time you see one from the PM collection, mainly because you may think that all Puppet Masters are as "boring" as this one.
