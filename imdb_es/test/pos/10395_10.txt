I was surprised by this movie. Afterwards, I did not even want to watch any movie for a long time, any other movie would be so unsatisfying in comparison. <br /> <br /> For many, it may be Antonion's worst, very slow, without an attractive conventional story, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions, and the worst of the Wenders: confusing and confusing transcendentalism. It is composed of short and distinct episodes linked by the current of consciousness of the typical winding hero of Wenders, so it does not produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema. <br /> <br /> But for the fans, the worst is the best and the best. The line of the disconnected story is to draw a single poetic image that extends throughout the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks the heart of things. <br /> <br />
