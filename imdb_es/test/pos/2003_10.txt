(Possible spoilers included, but nothing critical revealed). <br /> <br /> I just watched this classic low-budget video film and was eliminated by the energy level present on the screen. All the actors take pride, especially John Daniels, they must see another of his films. This film not only presents excellent performances, but also manages sequences with style, as when the Baron throws someone out the window and we see fragments of glass falling in a pool that emerges from the impact of the fallen man, I love the slow mode. Motion photography was used in the cinema of the 70s, dreamer and hypnotic. Black guys, cold and witty, draw great lines of lines, while the muddy and dirty lumps of white garbage reach unpleasant extremes. I love it, my 10/10 rating. If this is on DVD, tell me about a purchase.
