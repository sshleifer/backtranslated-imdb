Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are not for people who were born before 1980 or after 1989. Most of those people would not appreciate the great things that are the cartoons of the 80s. The fact that Rainbow Brite has become a Film is a guilty pleasure for many of us who remember seeing the television show as a child. Of course, a lot of the dialogue is pretty funny and silly, and the plot does not exist at all, but it's a very good movie.
