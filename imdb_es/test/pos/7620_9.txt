I really liked that movie. It is not as good as "50 First Dates", but it is definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of friends. Yes, the plot was "cute" and maybe even incredible, but what is so bad about a movie feeling good. Drew as Josie and her romance with the teacher is very sweet and the baseball wannabee brother adds to the good feeling of the movie. With all the trash there is, what's wrong with a good movie that the whole family can enjoy? Without being ashamed while watching with your children! Drew is an amazing actress who really seems to be unappreciated for the most part. This is definitely one of your best roles!
