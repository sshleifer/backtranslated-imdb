Universal Studies. The name evokes so many memories for the fans of the horror of beautiful matte paintings ... er ... landscapes, fields shrouded in fog, full moons, howling wolves, taverns and mobs with torches. However, it is quite strange to look back on those films, how little time lasted when the real classics took place. The 30s had their masterpieces, but mostly they were from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest at present. The '40s produced more fun matinee movies without thinking that high-level art, and most fans agree that the classic era of gothic horror films ended in 1945 with' House of Dracula ' , surrounded with the comedies of Abbott & Costello, and was officially killed in the 50s and the arrival of the Atomic Age. <br /> <br /> So it's strange that maybe one of the best goths in Universal was created in the 50s! That just makes the movie a rarity, since the costume dramas were coming out EVERYWHERE. It may not be comparable to the classics of all time, like the movies by James Whale and 'The Wolfman', but damn that they condense all the funny elements of those films into delicious delight! Get ready for nothing but pure entertainment! Since several social customs had changed, the film also gives to a violence that would not have been allowed in previous times; there is no blood, but we see the characters shot and stabbed directly, and there is even a burning torch in the face! <br /> <br /> The movie may not really be a horror movie, but it sure has the atmosphere, the look and feel of one! It begins in the dark of the night with howling winds (and wolves) when two men seal the graves of two apparently dead young lovers, BUT WAIT! One of them is not dead, but he can not move! He is trapped, but he speaks silently in his own mind, unable to communicate! What is your story? This is how you start a horror movie ... <br /> <br /> The English businessman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene, giving one of his best performances) is presented under the alias of Richard Beckett to investigate the disappearance of two friends of yours who disappeared in the castle of the Austrian uncle Conde Von Bruno (Did you see this Sacha Baron Cohen?). It seems that many years ago, Von Bruno posed as a god to the natives of Africa to steal ivory, was exposed by Burton's men and the natives disfigured him. Now he is anxious to get revenge. <br /> <br /> The film has all the clichés, a trip to the castle in the style of Jonathan Harker, an inn full of villager villagers, traps of death and a huge servant (Lon Chaney Jr.). The scenes in the torture chamber are genuinely suspenseful, including a panel on the floor that activates a door to the dungeon (which makes it a clever getaway scene later), a hunting expedition with an imported panther (! And then there is the fake Romeo and Juliet death that leads to the prologue of the film ... <br /> <br /> The plot is a cliché and the world view is black and white, but it's still incredibly entertaining , with the director Nathan Juran making each scene pile up in the atmosphere and look fresh and new There are also several holes in the plot Why does Ronald try to leave the castle so early And he never solves the mystery of what happened to them his friends, although it's obvious, but he does not know when he gives up, and he seemed very sure before. Strange. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great, despite being a tough player, Richard Greene makes Burton one of the protagonists more agr adables I've seen in a horror movie. Rita Corday is excellent as the count's "peasant wife" who becomes Burton's love interest, may have the stereotype of "falling in love with just one look" at the problem of all the heroines of the era of this era, but her Portrait of a woman suffered in the past a loveless marriage with a sadistic monster is very convincing, she also shows a suspicion and with few heroines from the movie of this era, even seeing a forced attempt by Burton to calm her down (and touch her necklace) , although it is simply analyzing it). as it has an important clue) as an attempted rape, however, she never seems unpleasant in her paranoia, the public sympathizes with her. Although he does not make Von Bruno look truly foreign and from another world (after all, he's a villain in a horror movie), Stephen McNally offers a truly spooky performance as the sadistic nobleman. When he reveals his burnt eye, and laughs maniacally, it's really scary. Lon Chaney Jr. is also great as his mute henchman, Gargon. <br /> <br /> However, the best performance is boris Karloff as the mysterious doctor Dr. Meissen. At first he has little time in front of the screen, but steals all the scenes in which he is. It is a scary, sad, mysterious and, ultimately, heroic performance. While reading maliciously while applying leeches to one of Bruno's henchmen, spy on our hero and speak in that famous voice of 'You know I'm not good' that only Karloff could do, you wonder if he is a hero or a villain. , always hidden around. And although it functions as the main agent of our hero's flight, it still shows human weaknesses like greed and fear for his own life, even poisoning a man in cold blood for Burton's benefit before Burton accepts it. His plan to help our hero and heroine escape also puts them directly in the grasp of Von Bruno as he arranges an astonishingly sadistic (though incredibly flawed) death for them that should have inspired similar scenes in Corman's Poe series. It may not have much time on screen, but this is easily one of the best performances of Boris. <br /> <br /> While the ending may seem abrupt and anti-climatic for some, half the fun is getting there, and there's a lot of excitement to be had. Relax and relive the days when the heroes were heroes and the villains were villains. It is not a masterpiece, but it is escapist fun at its best.
