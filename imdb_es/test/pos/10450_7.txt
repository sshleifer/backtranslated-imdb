I have always liked this movie and I am glad that it is finally available on DVD so that more viewers can see what I have been saying to them all these years. The story is about a high school virgin named Gary (Lawrence Monoson) who works at a pizzeria as a delivery boy and meets with his friends David (Joe Rubbo) and Rick (Steve Antin). Gary realizes that Karen (Diane Franklin) is the new girl in school and one morning he takes her and, for that moment, she is totally in love. That night at a party, he sees Rick with Karen and now he's jealous of his best friend, but he does not tell anyone his true feelings. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Rick asks Gary if he can borrow from his grandmothers' vacant house, but Gary invents a excuse so Rick can not have Karen alone. But one night Rick brags that Gary caught her on the football field and Gary got mad. A few days later, in the school library, Gary sees Rick and Karen arguing and he asks Karen what is wrong. She tells him that she is pregnant and that Rick has left her. Gary helps her by taking her home to her grandmothers and paying for her abortion. Finally, Gary tells Karen what he really feels for her and she seems receptive to his feelings, but later, at his birthday party, he walks in with Karen and Rick together again. Gary leaves without the girl! This film ends with a much more realistic version of what life really is like. No matter how kind you are, you do not necessarily get the girl. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by Boaz Davidson, who would be a fairly competent action film director and did two things well with this. movie. First, he made sure there were plenty of free nudes to make this commercial for the young men who usually go to these movies. Secondly, the movie ended with the young Gary without Karen and I think the men in the audience can relate to being fucked, no matter how hard you try to win a girl's heart. Yes, this movie is silly and exploitative, but it's fun and sexy. Actress Louisa Moritz almost steals the movie as the sexy Carmela. Moritz was always a popular "B" level actress and you might remember her in "Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest". Like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", it has a very good soundtrack and the songs that are played reflect what is happening in the story. But at the heart of this movie there are two very good performances by Monoson and Franklin. Franklin needs nudity, but he continues to transmit the pain of a girl who is abandoned at a crucial moment. She has always been a good actress and her natural charm is very evident in this film. But this is still the story of Monoson and you can not help but feel for this guy. When the movie ends, it is your performance that remains with you. It's a solid acting job that makes this more than a teen sex comedy. Even with the stupid scenarios of teenagers trying to have sex, this film still manages to achieve what it wants. The underestimated comedy hits the bullseye.
