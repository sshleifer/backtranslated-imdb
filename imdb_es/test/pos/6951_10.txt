I was very surprised when I found this movie on cable television a couple of years ago. History is a wonderful example of how our land keeps changing and the struggle to grasp and use it according to needs. Conflicting desires of the "people" and the government. The actors were fantastic in their performances and I absolutely fell in love with Tantoo Cardinal, she is so credible and was a character in this movie, as was Rip Torn. The story was also a love story about the earth, the past and between the 2 main characters. I have tried to buy this movie and I have not been able to locate it, but I would love to have it.
