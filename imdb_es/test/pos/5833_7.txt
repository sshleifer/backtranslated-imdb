Hello To read the full plot around "OZ", look in IMDb here to find it. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING THE SPOILERS WITHIN THIS REVIEW! ** Oz is the series that not only has moved me, but also shows a little bit. Of the American prison system, but I have to say (judging by the program of discovery channels in jail) it is not really realistic. <br /> <br /> Although I have to say, there is no shyness, rapes, blows (stabbing) happens allot Still, it's television, so for people who think this is a realistic mistake. <br /> <br /> There is a good degree of violence in him, and some exaggerated scenes here and there (plot on plot on plot) That can be quite boring. But remember that the series is almost ancient for now. So times change, so I think you should judge this on the timeline, since it came out. <br /> <br /> As the season went on until season 5, it was pretty good. Until one of the contras wins a $ 2 million lottery ticket, because he spoke to God, it seemed "okay, this is getting to the point where I do not want to see this series anymore." I still continued! And now I just watched episode 3 of season 6. This is when Cereal is rubbed in the brain and then his "mom" keeps him, while he's drooling. Then you see O Reilly crying and seeing his brother like that (RL BROTHERS too) Now, by far, that's the best scene in the whole "OZ" series, that was real for me! I still do not read this wrong, I'm trying to crash it and burn it. It's a really good series! And even now it's worth seeing a 2010! I give it a 7 for the story that weakens with the season. But it's still a golden glove.
