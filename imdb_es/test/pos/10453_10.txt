Spoilers in this review! Despite some highly unlikely scenes, including children in PE who measure their penises in a contest and the few obligatory vignettes of teenagers trying to have sex, this film captures the painful essence of high school in the way that few movies teenagers ever done. It accomplishes this by not only showing the trio of friends, Gary, Dave, Rick, as smoking, drinking, always in view of the teens, but also focusing on the nature of the friendship itself, as these three friends have tested their loyalties. This film is a snapshot of the moment childhood ends. For the shy and romantic Gary, when he sees the lovely Karen for the first time, he falls instantly in love. The excitement of awakening in Gary is found on the screen, and he shows his love for her by welcoming her when his lover leaves her. This love for Karen signals the end of Gary's innocence, as the ties with his two best friends will be tested and broken in the course of history. The man of trust, Rick, is the person in high school that we all secretly wish we were: handsome, great, and always have the incredibly beautiful girls in a swoon. Rick turns out to be a cad, but you must bear in mind that his character is only 17 years old. He panics and makes a bad decision. From Rick's perspective, the story also tries to find the only girl of his dreams, a bad break and eventually reconcile. The look on Rick's face when Gary enters and sees Karen kissing Rick, shows that he finally understands that his best friend and love her the same woman. As in real life, you do not withdraw because your friend has an unrequited love. This is the tragedy of the movie. Rick is not a villain, and constantly through the movie he reminds Gary and Dave that they are his best friends. The poignant quality of Gary's performance, however, is the heart of the story. Lawrence Monoson is a beautiful loser. He does everything right, his heart is in the right place and love for Karen consumes him. However, Karen, in the end, is not moved by Gary's devotion and kindness. Karen represents all the people in the world who receive without giving anything in return, who exist in the emptiness of their own ego and never stop to realize the emotional damage and trauma they inflict on others. This film is brutal in its statements about love and friendship, but that is what makes it unique among teen films. It stops being a comedy and turns into a romantically irremediable film, although condemned to a tragic conclusion. Anyone who has found the girl of his dreams and has not won it, will understand. The harrowing crushes of high school are as real as the emotional tensions of adulthood, and this movie will remind you of it in broad strokes. Gary's latest investment, as he moves away with the inscribed medallion, is a moment as moving as any other in the cinema. One feels, after seeing this, that it really is made of two films. The first part is a stupid teen sex film, and once the story begins, it's a drama that affects a lot. A great movie It should also be noted that the soundtrack was paramount in his selection of many emerging stars, including The Police, The Cars, Devo, Oingo Boingo, The Plimsouls, The Waitresses, Gleaming Spiers and Phil Seymour.
