I love the fictional format that Chris Guest and his team have developed over the years. In fact, I like this and "Waiting for Guffman" is better than "Spinal Tap", which was the first of the group (made by Rob Reiner but starring Guest and several of his regular mockumentary). This humor is not for everyone. It is quite subtle and not too physical, so some people may not relate. However, as a lover of dogs (and a fan of dog shows), I loved this movie. There are so many funny lines in it! My daughter and I quoted them often. I find it incredible that these people can ad librar so much fun material for each film. What a fun group they should be. I highly recommend it to people who prefer their mood on the cerebral side.
