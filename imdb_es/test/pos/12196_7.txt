Despite some acceptable adaptations of the main themes of the books, THE QUEEN OF THE DAMN / THE VAMPIRE LESTAT did not remain faithful to the complicated storytelling of Anne Rices. The deep layers that form all the characters were shattered only on their surface, if not in a completely different identity. The chronological order of the main events in the film seemed distorted and uneven. <br /> <br /> However, there were some things that the film did to deserve my rating of 7. One was that the film strongly captured the effect. that Lestat (among other vampires) had for the public, especially the young girls. The film also did a pretty good job focusing on the importance of the heritage and the history that vampires prided themselves on. The scenes of sensuality were also satisfactory from the atmospheric point of view. <br /> <br /> The performance in QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was moderate, if disappointing Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have a surprising chemistry, although it only shows when the performance is at its best (not very often). The characters are nothing compared to those established in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. He also lacks the emotional intelligence of THE ALL HOLY FIESTA, which is a shame because Rice's Book of the Damned had that, and more. <br /> <br /> This movie does not give everything it seems to be. . The effects are boring and very disappointing. The extravagance necessary in many scenes is not given, and the dialogue is exhausting. The settings for many scenes are not as I imagined them in the book, and I think many of them were not even taken from the story. There are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and the middle of the film, but it is wrapped quite well, which gives the viewer a complete story (if he had not read the book). <br /> <br /> Somehings I think the film needed to include a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein), instead of the mix of rock music; although I did not have any problem with some of the songs. Another thing that would have made the movie better is to establish the direction better. The scenario was boring and unclear, which is important in a story that moves quite frequently. <br /> <br /> In general, REINA DEL MALDITO was an unequally disappointing but somewhat satisfying adaptation of the important novel. With a few simple changes, it may have been a very successful film work. I would recommend this film to people who have seen INTERVIEW or who have read the books, so that they can form their own opinion about adaptation.
