It is very difficult to find new information about JFK Jr. and this good movie had very little information, but it was a pleasure to see it. The casting was very good and the script, although something akin to a documentary, was also good. My only complaint was that it was not enough. Maybe a two-part movie could have told us more about his "pre-George" days and his relationships with his mother, his sister and other relatives. Some of the material in the book, "American Son" by Richard Blow, would have greatly improved the film. WTBS should be applauded for producing such an entertaining film.
