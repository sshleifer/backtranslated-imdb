Am I the only person who believes that this American version is much better than the English film of 1934? The English version has no suspense, seems old and has a very low budget, and has an exceptional performance (with the exception of Peter Lorre). The 1956 version, in addition to having the best production values, shows James Stewart as the perfect "innocent" American abroad, and gives Doris Day his best role. Of particular interest is music: the music of the American film is almost classical; compare the "Albert Hall sequences" of both, and you will agree that Bernard Herrmann's music is much more exciting than the original version (although it is basically the same music!). The only flaw in the 1956 movie is the ridiculous encounter in The Taxidermy Shop. I would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the English version is better.
