A group of mostly unpleasant and extremely unpleasant teenagers go to a remote and spooky remote funeral home, located near a cemetery, to attend a Halloween party of everything that is being organized by the strange occultist obsessed by Mimi Kinkade and his vacuous girl. hungry bimbette of friend linnea quigley. The imbeciles, fools, profane, beer drinkers, happy with sex hold a session as a joke (very bad idea, because it is said that the old and desolate dive is pursued by demonic spirits). Of course, that ill-advised session awakens the decidedly grumpy and hostile evil spirits, who kill and possess most children in a dreadful way, turning them into ugly, fang-like, claw-faced, boiling-face ghouls that cause the frightful chaos throughout the world. duration of a particularly long, dark and harrowing night of pure terror. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is essentially your tenth vigorous graphic and relentless "Evil Dead" lightning riddled with wall-to-wall hits full of closed, no easy exit for the claustrophobic only self-confined, outrageous pieces of splash Excessive, an incessantly strong hum'n'shiver synth score, a total feeling of somber nightmare charged with humor and vibrant in-mania cinematography cinematography (the expected hyperactive and hurried-induced handheld camera work, soft tracking shots and sinuous, madly titled camera angles, even the camera on a dolly doing a 180 degree figure with sleek sliding). Fortunately, Kevin S. Tenney's sleek, confident and elegant management keeps the extremely subtle process and speed at an accelerated pace; In addition, Tenny gives the film an attractive polished look and effectively creates a certain carnival-like funerary atmosphere for Ooga-Booga's spooky and enthusiastically grotesque carnival. <br /> <br /> However, the wonderfully bloody and imaginative makeup effects of Steve Johnson are the real star of the show. Bloodthirsty standouts include a fat and disgusting disgusting Hal Havins (who played a similarly obese and obese role ** in the immortal "Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama" at about the same time) after he bit his tongue, Quigley gave him a push. Lipstick tube in one of her breasts (yow!) and taking out the eyes of a boy while she is making love to him (double yow!), a couple of libidinous teenagers get angry while doing exactly what they think in a coffin (the girl has her neck broke while the guy cut her arm), Kinkade set fire to his hands and, in the most unpleasant scene of the movie, an evil old man cut his throat inside out after eating a piece of apple tied with razor blades. The trashy'n'thrashy rock score also smokes. And then there's Kinkade's incredibly wild, sexy and uninhibited demon dance, a sparkling number accompanied by a flickering strobe light and amazing jumps that Kinkade choreographed herself. Okay, then, in general, this does not amount to anything more than a complete lack of meaning and meaningless, though nicely assembled and pleasantly vulgar piece of blithely cheerful horror movie, but if you're in the mood for entertaining brain brains under terror scandal horror this cheerful and youthful scum does the trick well.
