The only problem with Married to the Mob is that it's not funny. It dresses exactly like a romantic comedy, but almost nothing of what happens is fun. But if you can see it as a movie where nothing funny happens, then you will have a really good time. It's a dazzling mafia movie, too, according to the title. Extremely ostentatious. But the director, Jonathan Demme, is one of the few prevailing cult directors who fully and completely embraced the 1980s in his decade-long work, rather than understandably pretending it was still the 1970s. <br /> < br /> The opening credits are combined Animation of the eighties, Italian-Americanism and staging soapy one on top of the other at a time. From there, despite the 1980s, it feels good. The lighting of Demme's frequent director of photography, Tak Fujimoto and the jukebox's soundtrack, is full of varied pops and alternative jams that are striking and are in fact controlled and nuanced as part of the atmosphere. Demme is good at instant colorful characterizations in her visual, and sometimes seemingly impetuous, composition of a fun mix of styles, a plot that could have gone either way, where an FBI agent, played by a very insipid Matthew Modine, try to infiltrate. A mafia family, sees an opportunity when a firearm, played with the charm of Michelle Pfeiffer, tries to leave the criminal lifestyle after her husband the activist man, just in what you would expect in a performance of Alec Baldwin, be surprised. . <br /> <br /> The way it works works for a while, because Demme seems to have a firm hand on the wheel. He knows the importance of showing us the very subjective and relatable scenes of life at home with Pfeiffer, as well as his worries and longings as a mother with moral conflicts, although his relationship with his son Joey is taken for granted. What mafioso son is listening to the party mom when dad's boss, who played with Dean Stockwell's characteristic ease and by far the outstanding stealing of the cast scene, is giving him such amazing gifts? However, in general, Demme's soapy stylings are easily seen as a new version of a funny crime and suspense story. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, we find that we have been going the wrong way, because inevitably, Modine and Pfeiffer have to fall in love. That is not intrinsically bad, and everything here and there actually feels bearable, but as a romantic secondary plot, it is not handled in an interesting way, or rather, almost at all because it is approached through several diverse clich√©s, which comply with the initial expectation of a decade of 1980. Movie date, and for that audience, I think it has the fair impact. But for someone who has genuinely interested in history and the aesthetic approach, it is a disappointment towards the state of boredom. <br /> <br /> It's a decent movie with big steps at certain points, but like a date movie or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the 80s, maybe they saw many dated movies in the 80s, the Entertainment value is not as likely to fluctuate, except for such deficit in real laughs. There may be some teasing, and that is very broad, but I would not leave the comedy hall with the high hopes with which I had initially entered. Be that as it may, there are additional joys in the small roles of the great actors that have already begun to fade, such as Nancy Travis, Joan Cusack and Oliver Platt.
