Now that I've seen it, it was NOT what I expected, at least not until the end. I read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from Amazon and I was glad I did. Having been introduced to Park's work through Oldboy for the first time, I was curious about the way he treated the genre and I was quite pleased with the clever way he executed it. I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because, while Oldboy and some of his other works have a very nice and deliberate camera work, he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that he had not seen in other vampire movies. For example, the scene in which Father Hyeon is realizing that the "beast" grows inside him when he gives his shoes to the Tae-ju always barefoot and can SEE the blood pumping through the skin of Tae-ju and his eyes widen in the thirst for blood. for it. That was a good effect. I was also glad that Park did not get the CG out of the movie and in fact it's very little CG. I left Bakjwi because I was totally prepared to think that something was going to happen and that they would take me for a walk in the true style of the parks. Also, I liked that Park played with a bit of symbolism and reversal, while we generally do not understand this is the Asian cinema. During the beginning of the film, we see that the plot develops slowly and the characters are known and you feel like an invisible observer of what is happening. Park treats you a bit like the future of Ghost of Christmas that comes to show you, though a little bored, what life is like outside your world. Ah, but then we began to feel a bit of kinship with the fallen Father and his growing lust for Tae-ju and the conflict with duty as a priest. We almost started to encourage them even until Park does not bring us back to reality so well and we really see that in the end Bakjwi is a film about the moral dilemma, good and evil. It will not ruin it if I tell you to see Bakjwi from the mindset of a priest and I think you'll get away from that with what Park wants you to come out with. Do not wait for Oldboy and stylization, because that's not what you'll get here. A very interesting take on the genre in fact. Those who missed the MANY literary elements and religious allusions saw some other film, not Bakjwi. After Bakjwi, look at Let The Right One IN, it's not what you expect either.
