This is the last of this year's horror films. "House of Wax" is one of the most terrifying movies I've seen in my life. This version really puts to shame Vincent Price's version of the film. I only know some of the young actors in the movie. The always problematic Paris Hilton; The pain in which you know what seems to be more seductive than ever. At least, she did not try to copy his infamy. Well, if she likes to make horror, it's better than Vanna White from "Wheel of Fortune." She beat Vanna HANDS DOWN! And the scene where "House of Wax" was made was not a joke. The house was made of wax, and the victims were able to get out of there before being waxed like their friends. Those two twins Bo and Vincent (the deformed twins) were manic from the start. The parents raised them well, except for Vincent. And I think they were deformed equally. How is it possible that the one in the other pick-up is creepy, but not as bad as the other two? That is another story in the book. I guess he had to follow his heart, and not the other twins who turned Ambrose into a tourist "trap" for unsuspecting victims. This movie is like "The Phantom of the Opera" meets "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". And this movie is one of the most terrifying of 2005! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
