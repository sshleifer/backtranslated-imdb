Okay, there are always people who seem to do not like movies because they are good, but they prefer movies as depressing or boring as they can be, or if they are from a foreign country. . Apart from that, One Crazy Summer is the perfect example of what a great American teen comedy should be. The jokes are a good mix of slapstick (to the Bobcat Goldthwait), surreal (Bobcat under the direction of Steve Holland), and dry (John Cusack, one of the most morose dry and funny actors in American cinema), and there is no there are characters in this movie that do not offer at least one funny line (ok, except Demi Moore). <br /> <br /> Yes, it's immature, yes, it's a game of balls, yes, Bobcat is disguised as Godzilla and Trashes a scale model of a seafood restaurant. It's also fun as hell. Look at it.
