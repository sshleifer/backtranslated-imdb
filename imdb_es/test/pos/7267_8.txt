.. is the princess the bride is ... well Trainspotting. But wait, really, it's a good combination! This was definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time ... it has the kind of witty dialogue that I associate with The Princess Bride or Cemetery man, along with the disgusting scenes of violence in a horror movie ... the feeling Heroic Princess Bride combined with (this is strange) the lack of any really good kind of Trainspotting. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it was as GOOD as the Princess Bride, but it was in The Sand, and it rocked. Part of the dialogue transcends the pleasant to the bright, the plot is interesting, while the characters, although slightly anachronistic, are anachronistic not because of their intrinsic nature (there were gay people in the eighteenth century, contrary to the observations of a previous critic) , but only in a little of the language they used. However, the anachronisms made it fun, and NOT cheesy and easy to discard. <br /> <br /> If you have ever read any of Gleen Cook's Simon R. Green or Garrett series, you know EXACTLY what this movie is about. Check it out. It's great.
