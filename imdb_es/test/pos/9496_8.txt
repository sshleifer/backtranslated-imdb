I thought that this movie was really good. It ends by showing viewers at the end that Leila should have kept what she had. Leila was fed up with her husband Jim, who was more worried about the work than she was. He was so involved in his work that he forgot his anniversary. He was also very careless. She could not take it anymore and left to see if he would miss her. The movie shows that the stranger even tries to make up for the night she made a mistake. He goes to her and tries to bring her home. She ends up finding another man named Schuyler. It seemed the man she always wanted to clean and the note. In the end, she gets comfortable when she looks at Schuylers shoes and the way he dropped his cigar ashes on the floor in the same way that Jim did the same. Jim ends up making a lot of money and cleaning himself. Leila thinks in the end that she should have kept her husband because that is all he really wanted and he changed.
