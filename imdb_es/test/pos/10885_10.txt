Since I played it for the first time in 1998, GoldenEye has been one of my favorite videogames. In fact, I recently bought an N64 just to be able to have it and play it more often. The game is practically perfect: single player mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in Bond's shoes, with varied mission objectives, compelling weapons and high-level design. Although the artificial intelligence of the enemies is quite basic by today's standards, that only adds to the appeal of GoldenEye. The method to get tricks (complete levels within a strict time limit) was also innovative when the title was released, and even now I have not deciphered some of them yet! <br /> <br /> The game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players, and although this is not as advanced as the Combat Simulator in the sequel to the game "Perfect Dark", it is still incredibly satisfying to attack to your opponents to play with a barrage of fire RC-P90! ;-)
