Yes, this is one of the greats of the black action genre. Confusing mix of racist comedy and racist violence (which sometimes reaches a disquieting tone, even for a genre fan), this movie is not your Shaft in the park. Wonderful fragments of the Rudy Ray Moore comedy that do not seem funny, at least not for a white boy like me, but great in their context. Much better than its dissimilar sequel, "The human tornado"
