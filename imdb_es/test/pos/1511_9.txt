"Cat In The Brain" is a series of extremely violent sequences united by a plot that looks more like a general vision, which describes the most notorious years of the Lucio Fulci cinema. The film could also be seen as a kind of dark comedy, which effectively falsifies the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes beyond that, he presents himself as the star, the central figure in the film that shows the audience who is the man behind all the cinematographic blood. "Cat in the brain" is not about presenting a clear story and following it. Instead, he mocks some of the clich√©s that have been surrounding the horror genre for years. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci is a horror director who struggles to keep his humanity intact. Years of violent filming have finally begun to catch up with him. Start slowly, the steaks and meat in general begin to displease him, his colleagues assure Fulci that all he needs is a little rest. But that does not help and soon the grotesque ideas for his films begin to overwhelm his daily thoughts. In an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously maddening mental state, Lucio begins to go to the local psychiatrist. Unfortunately, that does more harm than good and Fulci is involved in an even greater disaster, since the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath, who imitates the murders of Fulci's movies in real life. <br /> <br /> The film retains everything The trademarks of the Italian splattered cinema, good or bad, are all here. Therefore, any comments about the performance or the technical aspects and budget constraints are quite irrelevant in terms of the quality of the film. It is a visual experience, without doubts. Fulci throws an incredible amount of violence that easily surpasses almost everything he has done. Amputated by members of chain saws, cannibalism, murders of children, decapitation, these are just some of the many grotesque acts that have been seen in "Cat In The Brain". Some of them are obviously recycled from some of the director's less-profile films, but they do not stand out from the context, and they actually feel at home here. As I pointed out before, the film exists much better as a satire of the genre than as a serious piece. The way in which part of the violence is presented helps to establish that idea. Such sequences, shortly after the climax, are rejected by reality in the film, as it is revealed that they are actually scenes within a film that Fulci's character is directing. This type of "film on film" presentation somewhat decreases the impact of the blood. But in no way does it make it easy to watch a movie. Oh no, this is far beyond and beyond the blood levels found in the horror of the mainstream, and the gorehounds will no doubt be pleased with that fact. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci was a very polarized figure. People either hate their work or love it. "Cat in the Brain" will not convince any of Fulci's detractors otherwise, but it's an interesting part of his filmography. One that fans should really review.
