"Japan takes the best of everyone and makes it theirs," while that may be true, it applies to all but one thing, that being, ... Major League Baseball ... but do not worry. , "Mr Baseball" is there to try to change all that. But who will change who, is the part of the movie that really makes it rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines in his comic roles. The plot can be true to life, however, the secondary plot is active. The Japanese are gentle and respectful people with very different ways and traditions from the Western Society. All these elements and obstacles combine to make a really fun and funny movie. Definitely worth the watch!
