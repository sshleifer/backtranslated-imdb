* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I do not care what others say, this movie is very funny. This is the sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a killer snowman. The snowman is created when a serial murderer convicted person is about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber, but the truck crashes into a truck carrying chemicals handling DNA that make human DNA Adhere to the earth or, in this case, to the snow. The first film was simply boring and, finally, the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze. <br /> <br /> Or so they thought. <br /> <br /> This movie happens about a year after the second. . Some scientists resuscitate Jack Frost by mixing antifreeze with chemicals. There is never an explanation given as to why they do this, they just do it. Meanwhile, the sherrif who arrested Frost in the first goes to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all. It has talking carrots that can stand, ice cubes that explode when you put them in your mouth and killer snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They even say "Dada!" as babies, I'll have to give credit to the creators of this. Snowballs are some of the most beautiful little things ever dreamed of. I wish I could get one as a pet. Frost finally freezes the island, as if a killer snowman had the ability to influence the main weather patterns. <br /> <br /> Then there are the actors. There are Manners, the FBI agent of the first movie, except that here he has an eye patch. YARR MATEYS, SHIVER ME TIMBERS, I AM AN FBI AGENT! YARRR! And then there's the stereotyped British adventurer and the stereotyped black Jamaican with dreadlocks. And finally, Captain Fun. The most fruitful man on the face of the planet, without exception. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, but it's very funny. I laughed to the fullest and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> *** ****
