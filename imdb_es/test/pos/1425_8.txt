This movie was never intended as a big budget movie, but it was a cute little image that almost everyone could enjoy. It probably will not change your life, but it's certainly charming and attractive. <br /> <br /> Clifton Webb plays a puppy (which is certainly not new) that has a television set. However, his qualifications are failing and he is worried about the cancellation. So he decides that maybe he is too out of touch with the children, since he and his wife have nothing of their own. Then, he offers himself as a scoutmaster and regrets doing this almost immediately! Remember, he is a fuss and he does not especially like children. To make matters worse, one of the children really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy. No matter how indifferently he acts towards the child, the child just wants to spend time with him! The boy is cute and almost steals the show alone! <br /> <br /> What happens next and the twists and turns of the movie are something you just have to discover for yourself. Understand that this is a light film, cute and yet not cloying that you will probably enjoy.
