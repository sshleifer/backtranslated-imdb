Bravestarr was released in 1987 by the extinct American animation company, Filmation, in the back of He-man: Masters of the universe and She-Ra: Princess of Power, in 1983 and 87 'respectively. The plot of the cartoon was about a Native American cowboy named Marshall Bravestarr, who possesses the strength of the bear, the ears of the wolf, the speed of the puma and the eyes of a hawk, and his faithful companion, a talking horse called Thirty and Thirty. . , who carried with him a properly titled weapon, 'Sarah Jane' and with the help of Deputy Fuzz and Judge JB serve to protect New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his band of outlaws. <br /> <br /> Established futuristic Texas, this was and still is today, one of the few caricatures set in a particular city, in the United States, therefore in the South, thousands of light years in the future. Considering that this was done in the 80s, the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the appearance of the Wild West, but from a perspective based on science fiction. Bravestarr not only evoked morality and good verses, but also taught children lessons about life, but also highlighted issues of culture and community and that we should not take things and life for granted. And despite the fact that it was a cartoon of action adventures, many of the story lines, themes and issues they addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them. In addition, Marshall Bravestarr was one of the first major cartoon characters of a minority (ethnic) origin that had an impact on television. <br /> <br /> The sound effects were amazing, the music was excellent, the theme Song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful. The characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught children the moral and importance of what is right and what is wrong. Unfortunately, something that can not be said about today's cartoons. <br /> <br /> While He-man's success eclipsed Bravestarr, it remains a favorite of many fans of the 80s cartoons. Suffice it to say that I prefer Bravestarr over He-man because of the diversity of the story lines, the characters and the depth of situations and the problems faced by the characters was more than I would say realistic and identifiable in contrast. For some reason, they resonated more with people because, for example, in 'The Pledge', where a child dies from a drug overdose, the fact that there is no happy ending was important, in the sense that when children They see that episode. Well, in fact, anyone who sees that episode will realize for himself the devastating consequences of drug use and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs. <br /> <br /> Bold, courageous and sometimes stimulating. Bravestarr is definitely that, bold, courageous and stimulating. A classic of the cult cartoons for many years, he dared to take some risks, but in the end he had a good and true reward. It will be remembered by many fans of cartoons as one of the most interesting and best cartoons of the 80s, and rightly so <br /> <br /> 8 and a half of every ten
