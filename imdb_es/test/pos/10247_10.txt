Some people may call "Cooley High" the same type of "American Graffiti", but I would not. To begin with, in "AG", all were white, while in "CH" they were all black. In addition, it has a Motown soundtrack. Specifically, the film focuses on several African-American working-class students in 1964 Chicago and their antics. The film is mainly about family life and relationships. In their apartments, we see that there is never a dad around. But these young people always know how to live life to the fullest. <br /> <br /> One thing that really distinguishes this film from most other portraits of black people is that the teenagers in this film are portrayed as being very responsible, worried about missing school. Two really fun scenes are the gorilla scene and the only white in the movie. But in general, the main star is the soundtrack. It's really one of the best soundtracks in the history of movies (we even have them on vinyl here at home). A classic in the true sense of the word.
