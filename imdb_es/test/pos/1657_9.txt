What gas in a movie! "Film Noir" has always been one of my favorite genres, but this one stands out from the rest. Only "The Big Sleep", "Out of the Past", "Murder My Sweet" and "The Killers" can approach this caper classic. I know that these four American films that I mentioned are not caper per se movies, but detective stories with complicated stories, that still exude a "noirean", a rough quality on them, similar to "Rififi". <br /> <br /> What is different here is the way in which Jules Dassin sets in motion the whole atmosphere of the film, not only in the harsh realism of the directors, but also in the use of the streets of Paris as a subliminal character and co-conspirator in himself. ! The film centers around "le Stephanois", a dark, moody and complicated ex-convict who is dragged to one last shot of the strong reward. Although he is a hard man without a smile, one still feels in him a longing for some kind of redemption when he frees himself from the demons of his past (he saved little Toni!). Dassin chose the right man (Jean Servais) for that role. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the rest of the development of the story fits into place as we travel through the famous scene of the "silent" caper until the end. disappearance of the main "perpetrators". Only his women survive, except Ida, Mario's honey. They seemed to understand better the underlying uselessness of everything!
