Ok, I'm a big fan of Traci, so his participation in the movie automatically ranks him in the 8.5+ rating. But besides that she was in it, I thought it was a good movie, especially for being an HBO movie. But I'm afraid that if you take Traci out of the movie, it would be fine. But a person can not do that, is in it and is a wonderful actress. She keeps improving and improving.
