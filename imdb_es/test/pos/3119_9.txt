Most of the children who grew up in the 40s or 50s were Western fans, but this was one of those that had escaped me until I saw it on the Men's Movies Channel today. I loved the story of the film, the cinematography and the excellent cast of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. in the lead roles along with the always reliable Ward Bond. Apparently, this film was the inspiration for the television series 'Wagon Train', which presented Bond once again as the head of wagon trains heading west. Johnson steals the film with his riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts like Ben does in this movie. Other notables include the lovely Joanne Dru as Denver and one of the first non-oral roles of James Arness, who later became famous for his role as Marshal Matt Dillon in 'Gunsmoke'. If you like movies of this genre, you can not stop liking them.
