I know what you're saying: "Oh man, Pinochio is not scary!" But this movie goes way beyond a maniac pinochio. Behind tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is strangely tied to her Pinnochio doll who seems to talk to her. The only strange thing is that no one else can hear the doll, except her. In the end it is a shocking revelation that, as I did, will impact you. Look at it. Give it a try.
