Only the cast tells you that this will be a category above the usual Italian western. Veteran actors Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy partnered with Alex Cord, who at the time seemed to be on the verge of stardom. The result is a film that is both extravagant and downward, and yet will satisfy those who seek more of a western than just a set of weapons. Especially interesting here is the character played by Alex Cord. One expects the "hero" in these westerns to be taciturn and introspective, but "Clay McCord" is an extreme example and, surprisingly, often shines in a passive, even weak position. Much is known about the fact that he fears falling prey to the epileptic attacks that immobilized his father, and in these moments of helplessness he is at the mercy of those who wish to harm him or those who wish to help him. To emphasize your passivity, Clay McCord, do not you like that name? - He often looks naked to the waist as if it were little more than an attractive toy that is displayed. There is even a strong masochistic streak in his nature, more than evidence when used as a punching bag by his enemies and then suspended by his wrists and left hanging on the middle of a street. Not only does he not usually protect himself, but McCord is equally ineffective in protecting those around him. Almost everyone who helps him is killed. <br /> <br /> While "A minute to pray, a second to die" is far from being a complete success, it has a tone and depth that differentiate it and make it stay in memory. It is also a good showcase for Alex Cord, whose career tended to diminish after this point after some promising years in the mid-sixties. He must have been about 36 years old when he filmed this, in his best physical moment, and the scene of him hanging from his wrists, bare-chested and sweating, is a memorable piece of cinematic "meatloaf."
