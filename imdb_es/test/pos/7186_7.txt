The French are not known for being great movie producers. <br /> <br /> Although her Amelie gets high scores at the Oscars. Asterix et Obelix is ​​a film very different from what I'm used to the French. It is a great movie especially for children. The only thing that convinced me was that it was spoken in French and in subtitling. Normally with the films spoken in English (here in the Netherlands) I do not have to read the subtitles. But with the French language you just have to read to understand. The story itself is great with Obelix, who does not remind himself of being fat, but there are also nice details, mainly in names like Brucewillix and Malcomix. You all know the history of comics and this movie shows most of the slides by book slides. Everything is in it, from the nose Sfinx braking until the red beards pirates lose three more boats. I would say a great movie for the weekend with the children.
