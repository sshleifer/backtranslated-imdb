It's a shame that when you get a restricted rating, perhaps the audience that you consider most useful to this movie probably will not see it. <br /> <br /> Imaginary heroes follow the life of a teenager after the suicide of his brothers. It is not, of course, the most original story in the world, however, he spends a lot of time humanizing his parents, the "imaginary heroes" who failed in the eyes of their children. <br /> <br /> For teenagers, who tend to take responsibility for their failures in their parents, but refuse to accept any real responsibility for themselves, the film sends a powerful message, that in the end we all have our own problems with which we have to deal, and for all of us to make our own paths. <br /> <br /> But, unlike other films that tend to urge the independence of young people, it solves the problems between parents and children and becomes a stronger unit for it. The fact that the eldest son committed suicide is unfortunate, but it is not overlooked later in the film, and the responsibility of all parties for the tragedy is explained in detail. <br /> <br /> Although the subject has been discussed previously, it has not been explained previously. It has been covered in this way: the film attracts very few hits. Now, the reason why this gave him a grade of R is confusing: it is unlikely that he will reach an adolescent in this era without being realistic, but still realism restricts that audience. <br /> <br /> It was my junior. In high school this movie has been shown, two suicides may have been avoided. In this case, the censors seem to have exercised an extremely poor judgment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
