When I started watching I thought I was watching a pro-Koresh amateur documentary. However, I had never seen 3/4 of the images they used. They interviewed people who said that the FBI / ATF instigated all these things, which sounded so crazy, but then they continued with the video and the testimony of the FBI. I was impressed The documentary continued with the Senate investigation after the fire, and after watching the interview and the video, you will be surprised how the Senate and the Attorney General turn their backs on the Davidians basically to cover up the aggression of the FBI / ATF. If you start to see this you must finish it. Otherwise you'll think it's propaganda of something like that.
