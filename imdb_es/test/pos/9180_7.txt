When you watch romantic comedies, you know what to expect; We have seen enough of them for many, many years to know how they are going. There is a formula, one that almost always generates films that become popular among the audience of the genre ... not always in relation to its real quality. How to play with that and create something more interesting? This movie has a suggestion ... and it works relatively well. Instead of simply following a clue, we follow it cleverly by helping unfortunate men, those who lack the attractive facade that would allow them to reveal the good invisible qualities they possess to the women they are in love with. The plot follows Smith as he works on his self-proclaimed hardest case; Kevin James. Along with his help from James, we also follow Mendes, who is fed up with the men who lie to get what they want (a particular scene that inspires great respect for the character of Smith is that he meets an imbecile and puts him instead). After seeing Smith helping the disaster that is James, we see him with Mendes ... and, despite his talent to help others, he is wrong ... wrong ... with her. Making a wonderful point about love, and how falling in love affects us. For a romantic comedy, this largely avoids the pitfalls of the same (sometimes bordering on feeling like a parody of the genre), although the last scenes have the sweetness and emotions of this type of film. Whether or not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review. The pace is pretty good, it never really slows down, and it rarely moves too fast. The acting is great, as far as almost everyone goes. The characters are very well developed, and they come out as real people. Humor does not always work ... there are occasional jokes that are less than fortunately executed, and one or two jokes that seem forced. However, for the most part, the movie was fun. I recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is or has been in love. Those who do not believe in love will have difficulties with the last scenes. 7/10
