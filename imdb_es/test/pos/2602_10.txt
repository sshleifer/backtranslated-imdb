This is my favorite cartoon of all time Looney Tunes. It is a common plot: Daffy Duck tries to convince Elmer Fudd that it really is the season of rabbits and shoots the Bugs. But you can never be more cunning than the rabbit! In addition to the usual cartoon comedy, this cartoon is backed by an excellent word game that will keep you moving on the floor.
