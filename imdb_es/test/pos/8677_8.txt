Imagine a world in which everyone treats anyone with kindness, false words are never uttered, office disputes are non-existent and your boss invites the office public regularly to self-cooking dinners where you can discuss the latest styles of interior design. Everything is clean, pleasant, good, just nice. In other words: you are in hell. After being left in the middle of nowhere, in the mid-thirties Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) starts a new job as a bookkeeper in a small, clean city. From the beginning, it feels strange in this impersonal world of superficial goodness, surrounded by a pleasant but lifeless interior architecture, and also by colleagues. Food knows nothing, drinks do not make you drunk, there are no children anywhere; After the initial steps of adaptation, Andreas looks for ways to escape from the new world. He no longer knows where he comes from, but he still remembers the rich flavors, the true feelings, anything beyond the uncompromising life he leads now. THE BOTHOMEOME MAN echoes the ideas of Huxley and Kafka, but here cruelty is the omnipresence of cleanliness without compromise. Unlike PLEASANTVILLE, this is not about narrow-minded intolerance, but rather a fable of our urban civilization of the world free of adaptation. For the most part he recalls an ingenious CLUB OF FIGHT scene, in which Edward Norton runs through a simulated IKEA catalog. Spiced with macabre humor, this Scandinavian laconic tale convinces at all levels: history, characters and relevance. A true jewel of screen. 8/10
