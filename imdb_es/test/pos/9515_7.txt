Another film of the "end of the world" that calls for comparison with the abysmal "Day after tomorrow." Following the same type of structure as DAT but with a clearly Japanese style. How are you? That depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the little human touches are what makes this movie attractive for most of its 2 + hours. Also the frequent cards of titles explaining something of the science. The effects are probably the best I've seen in a Japanese movie and they compare very well with anything outside of Hollywood. Many of the scenes of disasters are really horrible, although the human carnage is usually off the screen. And that is one of the drawbacks. While the terror of thousands of deaths on screen as in the recent "War of the Worlds" may have been too overwhelming, it does not give us the feeling that the chaos of an entire nation is crumbling in the ocean Some scenes touch the chaos , but for the most part this part of the story is hardly mentioned, however, this film works on many levels and is much more realistic than DAT, which is until the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately The story is based on a clich√© plot device and another plot device that would be at home in the Japanese film Earth in the 1960s "Gorath." After reasonably good science and for the most part realistic about disaster, this it's a bit disappointing ... The film's sudden stop for a pop love song does not help either (unless you like the song), which made the "exciting" ending a little bit for me. <br /> < br /> The general Management is good and the artistic design is excellent. The acting is also good. Recommended.
