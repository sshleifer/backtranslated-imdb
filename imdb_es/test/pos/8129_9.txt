Bedrooms and Hallways was one of the funniest films of the Melbourne Film Festival in 1999. From the UK, it is a crowd of roommates and their various relationship dilemmas. Much of the humor focuses on the self-help group of a new group of men, in which they transmit various implements as the "rock of truth". They also go on a weekend of 'hunter-gatherers' with hilarious results. Trust me, you will laugh.
