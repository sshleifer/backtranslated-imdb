A great suspense thriller, the acting is first class and the plot keeps you guessing. This well-performed and directed film is based on a true story and worthwhile, while Joe Penny is very well chosen and Ann Gillian is convincing as the sister worried and terrified. Joe shows again that his ability to act is incredible and the ending well done. Worth seeing. I hope they will repeat it soon on any channel, I will definitely record it. For fans of Penny and Gillian it's worth your time. Rent it if you can better still try to buy it I'm going to. Perfect suspense movie from the early nineties. Watch this movie <br /> <br /> It's great.
