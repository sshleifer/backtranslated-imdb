With some amazing and wonderful characters, a new mythology, magnificently designed and executed scenarios, Nightbreed is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the lack of a well-known lead actor led the film to find darkness. <Br /> <br /> Perhaps also the homosexuality of the director led to the film being unintentionally censored by the white audience that condemns the film. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is a treasure trove of the genre of monster / superhero movies. <br /> <br /> A sequel that features Highlander-style flashbacks at different times in history would be interesting. <br /> <br /> Another idea would be the basis of the new Midian. Maybe somewhere in Texas or in the swamps of Louisiana with crocodiles and a strange traveling circus.
