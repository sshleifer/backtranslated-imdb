If you have not seen Vijay in "Ghillli", "Gilly" or "Ghillie". go see him Wow. It is devastatingly hilarious. I do not know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was talking seriously or not. There are a lot of hot guys in this, look for someone to call Velu "Maacha". The one with the bright braids, devastatingly hot. Your teeth are also shiny. Rocks vijay. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It is very deep. Look at it, you will not regret it. There are some great laughs in this. If you do not speak Tamil, learn it. Then you will get all the internal jokes. It is one for the whole family, except perhaps violent fragments should be omitted. I've seen this movie about eleven times ... and counting. <br /> <br /> Wow!
