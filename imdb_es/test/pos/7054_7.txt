I liked this movie for the most part, but I have to say that if there was someone else besides Bill Murray in the lead role, it would not have been so good. It brings an energy to the paper that takes this film one step further than it would have been otherwise. Mainly I enjoyed the jokes that were made with the only counselor and there are also other funny things in this movie, like the hot dog eating contest. This film would also set the stage for summer camp movies with competition at the end. Almost all the movies in the camps have this or the plot of ungovernable or problematic children, or a combination of both. This series would also have a strange change of tone, since this and two are family-friendly films, while the third and fourth are more oriented to adults, more like the old teen sex comedies of the time. He did the opposite of the films of the Police Academy that went from R to PG-13 to PG. This series goes otherwise to R. Still, this first and only good is worth some laughs due in large part to Bill Murray.
