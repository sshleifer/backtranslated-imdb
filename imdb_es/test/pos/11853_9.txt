The best romantic comedy I've seen in years. It's not the kind of blot on the best of Hollywood by Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler, and much less mellow than Hugh Grant's epic. Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr are perfect cast and both offer professional performance without problems, such as the engaged couple who decide to spend a little time sowing their sexual oats before marriage. Instead of playing strictly for laughter, writers and directors invented a good combination of human feelings and comedic action. Nicholson is great as the uncomfortable seductress and Mohr does a great job when the man enters the game reluctantly, but soon finds himself enjoying too much of his adventures. We see enough of the supporting characters to complete the plot without distracting us from the main story. Andy Richter (sincere friend) and Helen Slater (single mother distressed) are particularly good. There is enough meaning and emotional complexity to do this much more than a standard farce of boys and girls. In fact, with a little more rhythm and a bit more cut, this movie would be one of the ten best comedies.
