This movie is "the" stupid comedy of the year, and possibly the best of Mike Judge from "Office Space". If you are a Mike Judge fan, or you enjoy shows like Futurama, then you are doing yourself a serious injury by skipping this limited and little known version. Although the DVD touts very few "additional features", this movie is certainly fun enough to compensate for its "lack of value". <br /> <br /> This film is about an army grunt called Joe Bowers (played by Luke Wilson), part of a secret Army experiment designed to preserve army personnel in peacetime so they can thaw. in times of war to fight for our country. However, things take an interesting turn since the general in charge of the operation is arrested in a prostitution network and the experiment is almost forgotten. Bowers and his partner Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) are awake in the year 2505, where throughout the course of natural selection, the population of the United States has become increasingly stupid. Now Joe and Rita have to find their way to a time machine to go back to 2005 with the help of Frito (played by Dax Shepard). <br /> <br /> What I really enjoyed about this movie was Mike Judge's comical satire in the course of US history over the past 50 years, and how humanity advances in the 500 years that followed. This is most evident from the publicity in the film, which has become a staple of American culture. With programs such as South Park in traditional media, it is easy to see how conclusions can be drawn that in the future, blasphemy has become a marketing tool. This is portrayed humorously in the film with subtle things like "Fudd-Ruckers" changing its name to "Butt-F ### ers", and a poster that shows the ad "If you do not smoke Tarryltons ... F ## # You!". Nor can I stop laughing at the role of Carls Jr. in this future, with his slogan "F ### you ... I'm eat", and his automatic kiosks advertise his "Extra Big-A ## Tacos". (With more molecules)! This movie contained everything for which I go to the cinema. Excellent, sharp, witty comedy, as well as a fascinating plot make this DVD one for ages. Be careful, however. If you are not a Mike Judge fan, you were not interested in "Beavis and Butthead" or you have no sense of humor, then this movie is probably not a good option for you. Otherwise, I would say that this is probably the funniest movie of 2506 ... I mean 2006.
