I obtained this film with my "Jane Austen Collection" of the BBC (5 DVDs of old adaptations of the BBC) and I did not like it at the beginning. It is completely different from the others and lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities I enjoy in all of Austen's other films: common sense and joy. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sewed her fingers together was especially annoying. <br /> <br /> I still do not like to see the finger-stitching scene, but I love listening to Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sewed, "My only acquaintance ... tore my robe off " This movie is now my current Austen favorite. I've seen it 7 or 8 times so far. The performance, in my opinion, is incredible. The way I realize that I act well is when I look up at what I'm doing (sewing, though not my fingers together, with luck, or boondoggling or whatever) to see the character pronounce his lines. It is the turn of expression, the sharing of posture, which makes words come to life; That's what makes good acting, as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Well, I see almost all the parts of "Northanger Abbey" because almost all actors play their roles with such charisma. Peter Firth is amazing as Mr. Tilney, the perfect combination of Fop Bathian and real and masculine hero. He is not sure until the end whether he is behind Catherine's money or not. I love his touch of accent (Welsh?). Mr. and Mrs. Richards are charming: the combination of their behaviors, especially the loud voice of Mr. Richards, which contradicts their wit and wisdom, makes them so real. General Tilney, as the hard-hearted father who is possibly a murderer, is also fascinating. And Captain Tilney, the smiling rake who is enjoying himself so clearly ... and the sister and the brother of the coin whose names I do not remember at this moment, both are so perfect, at the same time, intelligent and clever. <br /> <br /> The other reason why I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all of Jane Austen's adaptations. I know that this was one of Austen's weaknesses (well, as far as I'm concerned): although all of her novels are love stories, it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. And if they are not really in love, what is the point? All the other adaptations I've seen (apart from Olivier / Garson) have pretty cold kisses at the end, if they kiss. I do not like sex in movies, but in the end it is necessary to have a sincere kiss. And the finishing kiss at Northanger is amazing. <br /> <br /> The exaggerated approach to costumes, music and lighting works very well as far as I'm concerned. And the script is extremely intelligent: the way we are educated about Gothic romance, life in Bath, normal education in Cathy's country, etc., is very well done, as is often the case with BBC productions. Also, I like the part when the small black page makes the car wheels. And I think the Marchionesse was a completely appropriate and very intelligent exhibition device. Some people have objected to this version being the opposite of what Jane Austen had intended to do at Northanger Abbey. The fun of Gothic romance, do not promote it. But I do not think that she had the intention to finish with "Mysteries of Udolpho", etc. She was just pointing out that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney chides Catherine in her mother's room. In addition, General Tilney was a villain, though prosaic. That point was meant to be done, surely.
