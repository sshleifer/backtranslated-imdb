I love the absurd and biting humor of Buñuel's surrealist films (such as "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" and "The Exterminating Angel," to name two). Other previous works (such as "The Forgotten Ones," about juvenile delinquents from slums in Mexico) are more serious and offer a solid social message. <br /> <br /> However, I think it's "Nazarin" that shoots more successful for the heart of the viewer. While it is true that it is full of irony, however, it reveals an aspect of Buñuel that seems to be intrigued by the beauty and solemnity of the spiritual quest. Here, while the director (typically) throws innumerable blows to the Catholic Church, he also seems to show, surprisingly, a sense of admiration for genuine Christian thought and his practice of selfless love. <br /> <br /> "What" Luis Buñuel shamelessly praising a Jesus-like figure "I always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue ... that is, until I saw" Nazarin. "My appreciation is that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following the example of Christ in a society infested with evil, ignorance and sin, but also presents the hero, Father Nazario, as a beacon of light in the middle of a sea of Without a doubt, at the end of the film, I was admiring him and not him. <br /> <br /> Some would say that Father Nazario's doubts about his faith point to the loss of his holy values (Oh, if he can not do good in this world, who can do it?) But I would say that this "defect", his frustration, precisely makes his character even more heroic, because it shows how human he is and how challenging His inner struggle must be, and who says that the priest could not leave? to "dark night" and regain your confidence? Perhaps only a difficult part of your spiritual journey has been presented to us. The elegant and open ending (in which he desperately accepts the fruit offered by a stranger) allows us to imagine the final outcome of the story. <br /> <br /> I recognize in Buñuel the aggressive and self-professed atheist. Endowed with brilliant wit and social conscience; but after having seen "Nazarín", I also perceived from him a certain warmth, a depth and a maturity that are not so evident in his other work. <br /> <br /> For the sake of contrast, I highly recommend seeing your work afterwards. Short film "Simón del desierto" (also made in Mexico, several years later). It is a similar theme, the abandonment of the ego in the face of temptation, only that it is done with a hysterically funny and totally irreverent style.
