The good thing about Thirst, the latest film from Chanwook Park, is that it's anti-Twilight. Some of you may take that as an inconvenience, but in reality it is a great advantage. Park takes seriously the method of vampirism, and also the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both characters: Sang-hyeon is a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that unknowingly turns him into a sickly but truly blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with his mother and his "idiot" brother. , the latter is killed by Sang-like in a very strong melodrama. There is nothing terribly tearful or insipid with the story and characters at any time, and the implications of religion from the beginning (Sang, for example, is seen as a healer since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even when he simply can not be that and he knows it, in addition to those about good versus evil, push him cinematically into another plane. <br /> <br /> That Thirst also rises to Park's amazing artistic standard. shown with Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and the undervalued I'm a Cyborg, but that's fine, it should be taken for granted Thirst is a movie with a juicy narrative and extravagant suburban characters, and is shot and edited with an eye for a state of mind which is partly satirical, partly romantic / erotic, partly dramatic and, finally, fantastic, and does not always treat vampires as a simple configuration of a horror movie (albeit a movie) To horror, Park has more than his share of scary scenes). It's more like the movie Near Dark, which never mentioned the word vampire, but let you know what it was, and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid attention track, and that the disease itself and its effect on the The existence of a person may be more frightening. that murders or bloodshed. Once you see a vampire jump high or heal their wounds, you've seen them all. <br /> <br /> Thirst also has a wicked sense of humor, like Oldboy, only here with a bite (pun intended) intended to emphasize strange physical states of being. You can find an example of this with the priest's predilection to suck the blood of people in a coma by taking their blood tube and sucking it on the floor. Or the way Tae-Joo clings to a piece of humanity keeping her mother alive, even when she's had something like a stroke and can only blink and touch a finger as a way to react to blood suckers I've brought pain and horror to your house. But these moments are like the icing on the cake to make it a complete experience. What makes Thirst last in the mind is how the elements, the drama and the existential pains, a sense of surrealist Catholicism and Bunuel (I especially loved the dynamic between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm) to suck the blood but really wants to be a vampire too, and the erotic: the scenes in which the priest finally surrenders to Tae-Joo are incredible in their rhythm and duration of shots and in the real thing that comes back. a pornographic way, but in the sense of release and escape of these characters, which does not last long in the scope of the story. <br /> <br /> If it's not as good as Oldboy, it's not something to the Not all the films directed by Chanwook Park will reach the stature of his masterpiece (and, at least, he will always be known as the man who directed that film.) But Thrist is an excellent addition to his work, and to the serious series of vampire movies in genre 1. The making of the film is clear and exciting and even dangerous (and in what white room of "natural light" live the characters!), The humor is dark and hilarious, the acting is intense and in a bad mood, especially the subtle strokes of Song Kang. ho and the extravagant evil and the surprising vulnerability of Kim OK-vin, and the end, when it finally arrives, is one of those truly superb vampire movie endings that you will talk about for years, in a good way. In a battle between Thirst and Twilight, Thirst takes the knockout in the first round. Between leaving the right in or near the dark, it is more difficult to call. 9.5 / 10
