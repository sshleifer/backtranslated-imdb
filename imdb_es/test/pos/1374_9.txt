I got this the other day from the creators on DVD. I saw this advertised in a free magazine while the family stopped at a hotel, I had never heard anything about it. After reading it, it was filmed on Balmedie beach and I had to buy it. I used to take kids to the dunes of the movie all the time while living in Aberdeen. <br /> <br /> First of all, I'm not a big fan of science fiction (not counting Star Wars). I really just wanted to see what they had done with the location of this movie, it surprised me. This did not turn out to be a standard science fiction, rather like a mixture of science fiction and survival horror. <br /> <br /> I had a good story, it was different, it had great special effects for the budget that was produced with Â£ 8000. Acting was better than average for a low budget movie. The way they have edited the entire coastline to make it feel like the dry desert planet they are in is nice. <br /> <br /> The weapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were great as a predator in invisible mode. . <br /> <br /> In general, I will buy future releases from these guys, maybe an upcoming horror (Hint Hint). The extras on the DVD were very informative about the background of the producers, I would like to see some of them short included as extras in the next release of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Excellent work.
