Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The Machine). By rereading this little book over and over again, I could never stop fascinating more and more with the imagination of the writer and the richness of Brazilian culture. <br /> <br /> When I heard about the movie, I was very afraid that someone would spoil one of my favorite books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the film is such a wonderful and delicate work of art. <br /> <br /> I can not remember any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to beauty. of the text. Also, I can not remember a performance as powerful as that of Gustavo Falcão. <br /> <br /> You can see and feel how colossal your love for Karina is. You can see that he will move mountains and will do anything for this love. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, look at it through the eyes of the child that lives inside you, make yourself charming!
