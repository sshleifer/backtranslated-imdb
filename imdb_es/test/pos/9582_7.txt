Long before Terri Schiavo presented the theme of living as a "vegetable" in public view, "One Day in the Death of Joe Egg" approached him. Alan Bates plays Bri, a school teacher whose daughter is almost fully attended. He and his wife Sheila (Janet Suzman) try all kinds of black humor to try to get on with their lives, but they can not escape the facts. In a moment, they even consider euthanasia. The question that surrounds them and their friends is: what will happen to this situation? <br /> <br /> With this film, Alan Bates continued his run of really good films, preceded by "Zorba the Greek", "The King of Hearts" and "The Fixer". We can safely say that we will miss it sadly.
