Probably one of his lesser-known films has the same lack of exposure as Salvador, since it is actually one of his best. <br /> <br /> Written and starring Eric Bogosian, Talk Radio tells the story of a critic. the telephone radio receiver that annoys the wrong kind of listener. The film is important, and has a lot to say about the issues of freedom of expression and how free it should be, and it can easily be said that life began as a play. Know what you are getting into before you sit down to see it and it will be fine. <br /> <br /> There is not much in the acting, since Bogosian steals the film, he wrote. given the license to rant, I could not take my eyes off him and that was part of the fascination that many of the listeners had; the people who hated him would not go off in case something was lost. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but a very good drama and, in general, a very good movie.
