Well, I'm a big fan of Italian horror and I love the films of directors like Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, just to name the most famous. "La villa delle anime maledette" is one of the most unknown films of this genre, filmed when this type of cinema began its crisis that still continues, and the director Carlo Ausino seems totally new to my ears (although he directed six films). This is the price that Italian directors have to pay for not working in Rome ...). But the movie is not so bad. And it is not absolutely correct to talk about "garbage". OK, the plot is not so original; It reminds me of things like the Amytville series (the year is the same as Damiano Damiani's "Amityville Possession") or "Shock", Mario Bava's latest work. But you must think that this is the film of a cinematographer (like Mario Bava's films); so the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story or the characters; Environment very well created by the use of light and by the movement of the camera. The rest is in the background. I think the movie works; Not so good, but it works; Surely it's better than many Hollywood productions like "The Haunting", which have a bigger budget, but no bigger ideas ...
