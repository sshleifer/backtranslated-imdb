This film is essentially for those who have had little or no introduction to hip-hop, specifically turntables, as was the case with the director before this movie began. It was great to have him focused on the bay more than expected, because NY always gets all the credit, but from the bay, the worship of Q-Bert is a bit out of control. This film did not present anything new to me, but it did change my opinion when I entered it, I was not sure to give the tables the distinction of being an instrument of good faith. This film should convince anyone that it is up to the viola and the clavichord.
