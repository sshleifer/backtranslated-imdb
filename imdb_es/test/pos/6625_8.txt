Oh, it's an excellent job, to be sure. In fact, several of the best movie scenes, or at least Bergman's movies, are in this film. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow are as good as you would expect. Do these two give bad results? Sven Nykvist offers a masterful but unconventional cinematography. The script is pretty good, especially in individual scenes. Sometimes the film is delayed and the rhythm is uneven, although probably intentionally. <br /> <br /> So, what is the problem? Well, the movie is too grim for its own sake. Other Bergman films are equally grim, but nowhere are they so hard. Eventually, I simply gave up and started to get a little irritated. It often affected me a lot during the movie, but, in the end, I felt not involved. It's a great movie, but I doubt that I will ever see it again, nor do I suggest it to my friends. Or, if I suggest it, I am sure to warn you of what is to come. 8/10.
