I'm glad to have read the Sarah Waters novel first, since I had my own images of the characters in my head at that time. Those chosen for this production, however, were not at all disappointing; In fact, after I got used to Rachael Stirling as Nan, I think Nina Gold did an excellent job in the casting department. (Can Keeley Hawes be more delicious?!) <br /> <br /> The BBC has done it again: this is a wonderful production of a very good book, and they have done it with style. If you can get it (VHS, DVD), be sure to get the 181 minute version (the uncensored version). It is a wonderful trip, although sometimes a little complicated, that you will not regret taking.
