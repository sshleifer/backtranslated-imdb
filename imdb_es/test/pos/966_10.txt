After seeing Big Fat Liar, I think Jason learned a lot more. When he told the truth that Marty had stolen his story, he was like the child that cried wolf. The people listened to him, but they did not believe him. Nobody did anything to help him. Also, not only do Marty's films stink, so does his advice. The truth is not overrated. I am very happy that he has been exposed for what he really is. Everyone learned that he stole that child, including his parents. Not only did he steal that kid and lie about it, he gave them another person's job and tried to call him their own, which is plagiarism. Do not you know it's illegal to plagiarize someone's idea? Another reason why he was fired. He is not trustworthy. He is a liar, a cheat, a thief, a thief and a plagiarist. Do you have that Marty? You are a plagiarist. Also, you have everything you deserve.
