I thought that this movie was good, I loved the plot, I loved the shooting scenes, except some, they were not necessary and I also enjoyed the character of Ma, she was a rider that I liked. I have to say that in this gangster movie the actors were selected well because sometimes some actors just do not fit into the role. However, although I hate to say it, but I hate the ending, I felt that I should have gone in a different direction. It would also have been better with a little more detail, it's based on a true story, but many of the facts were omitted, but other than that, it was good. If you like the movies of the mobsters of the past, you will enjoy this movie.
