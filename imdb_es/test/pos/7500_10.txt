36. THE HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) A series of emergencies have seized the Manhattan Hospital. Patients are dying from left to right due to crowded conditions and ineptitude staff. When a resident doctor is caught in the death count, the coroner, Dr. Bock (George C. Scott) is called to investigate. After having worked as a doctor for many years, and going through a middle-aged crisis, Dr. Bock finds it difficult. He decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), a beautiful young hippie. Whose deep ideas about life help the depressed Bock. <br /> <br /> Criticism: The Black Comedy features a 'force tour' performance by veteran actor George C. Scott. It is good to play serious characters and high strings whose strict morality is severely tested. The first half of the film is developed as a melodrama, which gives a good account of hospital life, and the confusion that they sometimes are. But then, as things seem ready for a dramatic climax, it becomes slapstick comedy. If Paddy Chayefsky's script had maintained its dramatic feel, I wonder if Scott would have come out with another Oscar as Best Actor (he had previously won it, "in absence", the year before). His scene of breakdown (suicide) is one of the most realistic in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> APPOINTMENT: Dr. Bock: "... last night I sat in my hotel room checking the debris of my life and the contemplation of suicide." I said, "No, Bock, do not do it. . You are a doctor, a healer, you are a necessary person, your life is meaningful. "Then ... I discover that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses ... how am I going to keep my feeling of meaning before this?
