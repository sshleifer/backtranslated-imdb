Any movie that features Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman and Amy Sedaris in the cast should be worth it, and comic actor Jeff Garlin takes advantage of the great talent he recruited for his directorial debut in 2007, a comedy about being overweight. The man who feels out of place with the world around him. Known as Larry David's manager, Jeff in "Curb Your Enthusiasm," Garlin plays James, a 39-year-old Chicago actor who still struggles and still lives with his widowed mother. His self-esteem is so low that he can not meet women, but it is the comic way he sees his unique state that makes his dilemma immersive. If the story sounds a bit familiar, that's because the film is partly a tribute to Ernest Borgnine's 1955 classic, "Marty," about a lone Bronx butcher who lives with his meddling mother. In fact, Garlin uses "Marty" as the work that James is desperate to do, since he is so empathetic with the character's situation. <br /> <br /> Naturally, there is a love story of this kind in this new version of the millennium, and Silverman plays Beth, a voracious sexually voracious ice cream server who takes him shopping for underwear. Their best scene together is at their favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different corridors. Hunt plays a lone elementary school teacher who shares a passion with James for jazz musician Ben Webster. They accidentally meet at a record store and then again on a career day at their school, where he exposes his sexual neuroses in a classroom of first graders, including Penelope, the pertil daughter of his best friend Luca (played by the image of Dakota Fanning little sister Elle). Sedaris plays a school counselor who talks to James after his inappropriate monologue, in a cameo that looks like Jerri Blank. David Pasquesi plays Luca, a manager of a retirement home, and his scenes with Garlin have an easy relationship that makes their friendship easy to believe. Almost stealing the film is the character actress Mina Kolb, who plays James' pixilated mother with her courage and heart. <br /> <br /> There are also unexpected cameos from teenage idol Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon (do not ask, but the setup is fun), as well as the parts played well by director Paul Mazursky (as the snaky director of a show type chamber franca, "Smear Job"), Tim Kazurinsky (as the unprepared victim of that show) and Dan Castellaneta (as the owner of the hard love convenience store). With his sad attacks of insecurity and self-loathing, Garlin's comedic sensitivity resembles that of Albert Brooks, and informal dialogue reminds me of "Modern Romance" and "Defending Your Life." The only persistent problem I had with the movie is the rhythm, since some scenes were longer than necessary. The problem is most evident in the first half when Garlin is trying to establish the correct rhythm, and the lack of real conflict adds to the slowness. However, what it does well is to capture that lingering sense of desperation that one feels when it is revealed that life is not what it is supposed to be, that a significant being can be out of reach and that a steady diet of junk food eat in a The hood of the car is the only sure thing when it comes to gratification.
