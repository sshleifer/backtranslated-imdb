Christian Duguay directed this small and exciting spy thriller early in his career. It plays on television quite often, although unfortunately some terrible scenes of violence and sex have been cut. I was finally able to see the theatrical version on a $ 3 tape from the local video store. The naval officer Aidan Quinn is recruited to pose as the notorious Carlos the Jackal, and he looks a little stuck in the paper. Donald Sutherland Ben Kingsley plays the superiors of Quinn, with Sutherland a true fan and Kingsley as the most sensible. The first half of this fun movie shows Quinn trained and indoctrinated. The second half has him out in the field, making love to the Jackal's wife and shooting him with various enemies. The idea is to make the Jackal look like a coat for the Russians and let them take care of the most famous killer in the world. Things do not go exactly as planned. Sometimes, I almost expected the cast to burst out laughing at some of the kitschy dialogues, but they all interpret it very directly. In the end, this is a great little thriller that deserves your attention. The old mistress of the Jackal teaches Quinn, very appropriate and very married, to mistreat her, lick her blood and then ruin it, just for the price of admission.
