Like almost everyone, I am familiar with the music of Ray Charles. Who has not heard "Georgia ON My Mind" and "The Mess-Around" and some of the other wonderful songs that appear in this movie. But about the life of Ray Charles, I was sadly ignorant until I saw this. I must say that Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles to life brilliantly. His performance was powerful, even gestures and voice inflections. The film also offered an unlimited account of some of the trials and tribulations that Charles faced throughout his life, and with some demons from the past who persecuted him into adulthood. Perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie was the heroin abstinence scene, which was terribly realistic. The film portrays Charles's growing awareness and involvement in the civil rights movement, which culminated in his refusal to play before a segregated audience in Georgia, which led to a ban on his performance in the state. His addiction to drugs and extramarital affairs are also well documented. The film revolves around a plea from his mother when he was a child: do not let anyone or anything turn you into a cripple. "The point is that the drugs did that, and to honor their mother's memory, she had to beat them." There's not much here about her later life and career after breaking her heroin habit, but until then, this is something really powerful.
