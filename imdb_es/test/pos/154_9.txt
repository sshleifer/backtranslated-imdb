There is no wordplay. I'm not going to ruin anything about the story, but it's safe to assume that you already know what kind of character the main actor represents. And, of course, being a priest and being "naughty" exaggerates all that. Also, this is the most erotic movie of Park Chan Wook so far. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Wook's previous works / films, you know he's very visual (in a good way) and shows up again here. As he moves away from the theme of revenge from his previous films on the surface, he still has quite a bit of heat hidden underneath. And when that boils, many bad things begin to happen. But through all that darkness, there are also moments of light (fun). A very stylistic and provocative film, that lives out of the ordinary and does a very good job ...
