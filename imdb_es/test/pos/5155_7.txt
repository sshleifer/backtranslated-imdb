Does the big bell in a bar sound intermittently for the latest orders and the inevitable race to stand in line at the counter? Do we want what we need only when it is too late? Or is the irony of Cassandra's opening scene a more resonant reflection of our perceptions of individual existence? There is an endless fascination about where writer and director Roy Andersson wants to take us in his fourth feature film, "You, The Living." With one or more of fifty semi-related vignettes linked by an inclination for tragicomic hyperreality, its melancholic interpretations and symbolic instances of life that unite us all in this great great cosmic seismic struggle. The simple simplicity of these vignettes acts to dramatize the tenuity and the immense beauty of being part of the symbiotic relationships that we have among us. Andersson could reduce the complexity of the human condition through severe and quick cynicism more than it should, but it also reminds us of the inherent and reassuring glory of waking up each morning to a new tomorrow when we are all aware of our own identity. Forms of stopped development.
