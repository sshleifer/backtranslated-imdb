I enjoyed this movie that deals completely with an average family, so it seems. Ben Travis, (Jeff Daniels) plays the role of a father who is only interested in a son who is excellent at swimming and wins many trophies, however, he hates it very much and even his father. Ben has very little to say to his other son, Tim, (Emile Hirsh) and even his daughter, Penny, (Michelle Williams) who is lucky to be in college. The mother, Sandy, (Sigourney Weaver) tries to keep the family together and even she is completely ignored by her husband as well. A very tragic event occurs in the family that changes the personality of everyone, young and old begin to use drugs, smoke marijuana and drink all the time at parties. There is even a homosexual scene and at the same time there is room for comedy and, of course, there is a very dark secret that Sandy Travis finally tells his son Tim.
