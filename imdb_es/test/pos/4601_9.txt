This movie was a pleasant surprise. I had anticipated it for a long time, and I was afraid of not being able to fulfill my expectations. <br /> <br /> He exceeded them. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. . <br /> <br /> Hilarious from beginning to end (stay until after the final credits!), it is absolutely amazing how a movie about silly and annoying characters can be so smart, witty and attractive. <br /> <br /> With its obvious matte paintings, the future Earth of the film recalls the series Planet of the Apes and other science fiction films of that era. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie is essentially the Planet of the Apes. , but with people who are the mental equivalent of monkeys. <br /> <br /> It moves at a fairly fast pace, and Luke Wilson takes the film quite well, with a character that resembles the one he played in "Bottle Rocket." (There's even a not-so-subtle nod to "Bottle." Rocket "in an early scene). <br /> <br /> Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former "painter" who was also frozen. <Br /> <br /> Despite all its strengths, "Idiocracy" has the distinctive feel of a movie that was taken from the director / editor before it could be tuned. <br /> <br /> I can not for the life Of me, I understand why such a fun movie would only be seen in a few cinemas without advanced projections, without advances, without any publicity. <br /> <br /> It's as if the study decided they were not going to spend more or just walked away. <br /> <br /> Or maybe they thought that the movie had the characteristics of a cult classic, and the only way it could become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail? <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a shame, because Mike Judge and this particular movie deserve better. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie will have real legs on DVD, and the word of La Boca will drive it to the success it deserves. <br /> <br /> Maybe the Fox executives saw themselves in the characters, they got confused and thought it was a documentary.
