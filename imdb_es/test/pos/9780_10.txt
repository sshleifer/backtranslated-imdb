Having captured a great-grandfather and sent him to Changi during World War II, I hesitated to see this when it was screened for the first time on television. My great-grandfather kept a diary while he was in captivity and when he died there, his companions bought it and I was lucky enough to read it and feel that at least I have an idea of ​​what Changi really was like, firsthand. This is a fantastic account of what happened to those poor guys who were sent to Changi prison and shows the hardships and cruelty they witnessed to protect their country. It's a great story of Australian camaraderie, commitment and spirit, that will never give up on attitude. It's worth seeing if you like the history of Australia or anything that has to do with World War II. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this mini and I give it 10 out of 10.
