'Acrobatty Bunny' by Robert McKimson is one of the director's best shorts. Although the circus-based setup can evoke horrible memories of McKimson's fearsome 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny' is not as boring as that parody. Facing Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion, 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and fun from the start, not to mention extremely attractive. There is a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the lion's jaws. In a brilliant Disney parody, he shouts "Pinocchio" down the lion's throat. This bright opening is a sign of things to come. For starters, there are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage, followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of 'Laugh Clown Laugh' that, as a child, he used to personify regularly. All this culminates in a brief acrobatic sequence that gives its name to the caricature. I have never liked the circus as a cartoon stage and, generally, it is a boring and predictable joke game, but 'Acrobatty Bunny' comes out of the mold and the result is an excitingly funny short that is among the best of McKimson.
