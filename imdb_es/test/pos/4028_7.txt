This movie is an impressive remake of the original by the same title. The movie was great, despite the fact, I hate the new ones! The whole cast was incredible. It has a great cast and an awesome plot! The main plot is that a man is poisoned and has to solve his own murder, right ?! Dennis Quaid is the man who is "DOA" (in other words, Dead On Arrival). Find help with your friends, but all are. Now a suspect! The character of Dennis has several hours to discover who poisoned him. The movie is quite fast and full of action. You can see two other big stars in Meg Ryan (City of Angels, Courage Under Fire) and Daniel Stern (Home Alone, Very Bad Things, Slaps) in supporting roles in this amazing and great remake of a classic movie!
