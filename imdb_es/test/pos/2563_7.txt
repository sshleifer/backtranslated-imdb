The trailer for this film focused so much on the network (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the film, which is about a developing, albeit rather simple, relationship between Lazarus and Rae when they try to recover. their pains passed each other. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the premise of a chained nympho, it is not surprising that there is a lot of implied sex involved. However, in its essence, Black Snake Moan is a basic story of redemption and the healing power of helping another person. Although maybe it's just me, but I think that poor Lazaro should have focused his story on more. He is a wounded man after his wife abandons him, but we never fully see how to help Rae solve his past pains as well as heal him. It is simply implied that yes, in essence, he is the magician who helps the young Rae to overcome her curse, through a large ol chain and some blues. <br /> <br /> I like the story, but I wish It was a little more uniform and did not have to depend on the sensational. The secondary characters were pretty decent, although simple and I liked music. The acting was good enough, although I can not be sure if the character of Rae is completely credible. But that could be my naivety. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the movie, but it did not appeal to me. Maybe I'm too critical, but the story seems too convenient to be completely credible and, while everything looks very good, I could never really buy it. The chain thing was a little too far-fetched for me. Still, this can provide some entertainment for those looking for dramatic redemption stories with a photo of the blues. 7/10
