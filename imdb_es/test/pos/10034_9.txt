It is true that "They Died With They Boots On" offers a highly fictional account of the life and career of George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn), but remarkable, especially with respect to the Battle of Little Big Horn. Because it is not a fact that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the American cavalry soldier and the native American boss Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) in a favorable light. I almost feel tempted to say that "Little Big Man" in his unqualified stance against Custer seems unbalanced by comparison. Also, one should not be fooled by the title of the image? This is not just a movie about the Battle of the Big Horn, it's a movie that shows the unreliable West Point cadet, the famous Civil War hero, the Indian wrestler and, last but not least, the husband. /> <br /> The film begins with Custer's time at the West Point military academy, where his recalcitration and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits. During a punitive military exercise, he meets his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, like Custer, is a native of Monroe, Michigan. Custer tries to woo her, but the outbreak of the Civil War drives him away. Custer's legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes, the largest of which is dedicated to his engagement to the legendary southern cavalry general Jeb Stuart during the Battle of Gettysburg. While on leave, he travels to Monroe and courts Elizabeth, who promises her hand in marriage. Immediately after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon get married. <br /> <br /> Once the Civil War is over, Custer is degraded, does not receive a real command and has to go through a very slow promotion process. The small and professional American army. When he begins to drink, his wife intervenes on his behalf with former police chief Winfield Scott. Custer receives the command of the 7th Cavalry of the United States, which trains to be an elite unit. Neither Custer nor Crazy Horse are willing to fight, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through Indian lands in clear violation of previous treaties. Custer explicitly recognizes the justice of the cause of Crazy Horse, but is thrown into battle to fulfill his duty as a soldier, exposing the conspiracy of wealthy interests in a letter he wrote on the eve of the battle. <br /> <br /> "They died with their boots on," although with little historical accuracy, it's about as good as the war films and western films of the 1940s: both Custer and Crazy Horse they are played by main actors, neither the Indians nor the Southern Confederation are denigrated, and the courtship The scenes with the beautiful Livvy de Havilland are simply charming. The only drawback, and that is why I can not give this image a total of 10, is the underlying current of racism in the representation of African-American servants; Elizabeth's maid, Callie, is stereotyped black mom, overweight, good-natured and superstitious. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting that the film criticizes neither Custer nor Crazy Horse, but the greed of the railroad. companies that press Washington politicians with semi-criminal methods to break the guarantees they had given to Native Americans. Only a couple of years later, the suggestion that US businessmen could even think of doing something remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a clue that the filmmakers were Communist sympathizers. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that "They Died With They Boots On" omits the fact that Custer's overly aggressive tactics often border on the reckless, greatly exaggerate the importance of his commitment to Stuart , and they do not mention the lack of recognition before the Battle of Little Big Horn. However, Custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular feats to point out in the Battles of Brandy Station, Gettysburg, Trevilian Station and others, although his exploits were not as decisive for the Civil War as "They Die with his boots on, "he suggests. <br /> <br /> In any case, "Die with your boots on" is a well-made war movie with Western elements, three featured artists (Flynn, Quinn and De Havilland), and offers a positive view of the natives Americans, as well as a negative with respect to big money, which would not be seen in major Hollywood productions in the coming decades. It would deserve a 10 if it were not for the racist ministrelization of African-Americans.
