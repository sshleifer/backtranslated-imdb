Talk Radio is, of course, probably not the best known of Stone's films, but do not let that discourage you, this movie is ready to be discovered, I challenge anyone to not be tempted by it. Along with Eric Bogosian's best performance of the 80s cinema, for me (along with JFK) this is still Stone's best moment. Stone does not seem to comment much about it these days and did not comment on a director on DVD like all his other films. Stone has nothing to be ashamed of, most directors would kill for shooting in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The claustrophobia of the study is intense and the opinions of Champlain are still very important arguments for today. The speech "legalize all drugs" is powerful and you may agree with it. In my opinion, the film is about freedom of expression and about how sometimes people do not like to listen to things that they do not agree with. The speeches and conversations with the listeners are very convincing, even disturbing, a chill ran down my spine when a mad man calls Champlain and says he has to rape again because the city drives him crazy is totally shocking. The tension is sometimes unbearable in a scene in which the heavy metalhead Kent becomes deranged, of course, Champlain does no favors by ridiculing him. Champlain (or should I say Bogosian) is intrepid in film and performance, totally fascinating, a shame that @ Bogosians another great role was the villain in Under Siege 2 (My God!) A scene that @ did not sound true when The Barry's boss, Dan (Alec Baldwin), manages to calm him down. Barry does not seem to be the kind of person who keeps quiet and does what he's told. It seemed a bit artificial and cliche. The scenes outside the studio are criticized for being too formulated, it is true because Stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and allow the viewer to see the beginnings of Champlains, but it does not work at all. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliantly cinematic film with extreme approaches, deep focus, extremely fast cuts, a fantastic 360 set that is used for the impressive final monologue. I must see the cinema, it's strange because it was ignored at the time, but now it's getting the attention it deserves again. A classic th @ must be studied by generations of film students. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for the inventive use of "Bad To The Bone" before T2, brilliant cast of cast that includes John C Mcginley (Dr Cox of Scrubs) as Stu, Leslie Hope (24 ) as Champlains girlfriend, John Pankow and Alec Baldwin as the costumes and Micheal Wincott, who plays three roles (a very underestimated actor), the tension between the listeners and Champlain, which is very moving in the times and of course congratulations to the stars Bogosian and Stone for a fantastic piece of cinema Enjoy!
