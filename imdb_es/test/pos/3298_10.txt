He had the pleasure of watching this film at the Big Bear Film Festival, where he won the Audience Award. And I have to say it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very fun short film! The script is well written and keeps climbing things. It also has a great current of suspense that runs through it. You do not know what will happen next when the main character tries to understand that his new neighbor may not be the most ideal person to live in front of him. The jokes are quick and unexpected. The plot makes us guess. The dialogue feels very real. I thought the direction was first class and director Travis Davis shows great potential to succeed in the world of studio comedies. It is not a compliment considering that he is also the main actor of the film, so he had to fulfill a triple task in this, writing, directing and starring. If you have the opportunity to see this movie in iTunes, it's worth downloading it. It will make you laugh out loud a couple of times. And that's more than most shorts offer these days.
