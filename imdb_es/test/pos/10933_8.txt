8 points for facing what in reality perhaps more than what it was then. American Indians probably stole more than killed. Who really knows? A nice, slow and slow search means that it has a rhythm and ... interesting and unique. Fortunately, it is not another meaningless nonsense. I thought that this would stink at the beginning, I ended up wrapped ... good treasure ... good job! I hope that nobody dissects this movie. When the full movie unfolds, you have many unique twists, impossible to determine which one will be next. The characters are human and have honor or not ... passion or not ... forgiveness or not. I ended up loving the white horse, the Indian, Sheen even the wretched desert. All good.
