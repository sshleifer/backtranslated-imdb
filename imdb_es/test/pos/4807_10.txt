Having seen 'only' about 200 Hong Kong movies in my time, I must say that this movie is among my best favorites. The plot is not only attractive (and somewhat surprising, that these days is rare for any movie), but the chemistry between the two main actors is excellent. First class casting! And while often even the most serious films of HK tend to insert a bit of humor between all the drama and action, often ruining a little the mood, here the jokes remain subtle and woven into the plot, even improving the relationships of the characters. The music is also very well made, and the two main themes are very beautiful. With the release of the HK Special Edition, they have even cleaned the image (the first version was grainy) and the subtitles, even if the quality of the translation is still lacking (there is nothing new there). In short, if you have to watch a HK movie that is not directed by John Woo or if you have Chow Yun Fat in it, this should be at least on your short list! A truly fascinating and entertaining watch!
