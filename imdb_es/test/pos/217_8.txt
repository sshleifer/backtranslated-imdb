When I was young, I was a big fan of the Naked Gun movies, but recently I saw the Police Sqaud program! and I think it's great! Leslie Nielson is amazing, Alan North is great, and who the hell is Rex Hamilton? But anyway, it's a ridiculous show. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of this program when they do the freezing scene during the final credits. I think my favorite is when Norberg (not O.J.) enters during the scene and tries to fit in with the frozen picture. Classic! <br /> <br /> The only problem for me is that the cigarette gag is very old (when Drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks: "Cigarette?" And the person answers: "Yes. I know. ") I think they used it too many times for whatever it is. <br /> <br /> Good performance, good gags, great show! <br /> <br /> 7/10
