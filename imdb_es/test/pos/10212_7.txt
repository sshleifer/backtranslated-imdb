"Western Union" is something like a forgotten Western classic! Perhaps the reason for this is the fact of its lack of availability on DVD in the United States. However, all is not lost, as it now appeared in Region 2 in England. This, being a blessing in some way, is not only incongruous but also totally ironic when one considers that a film describing the founding and establishment of an organization as uniquely American as The Western Union Telegraph Company does not have a Region 1 release Beg the belief! It just does not make sense! <br /> <br /> Produced by Fox in 1941, "Western Union" was directed by Fritz Lang. This was only the second time that the great German director undertook to direct a western! He did an excellent job the previous year with Fox's "Return of Frank James" and would have just one more exit to the west in 1952 with the splendid "Notorious Ranch". Lang was not Ford or Hawks, but with "Western Union" he became a fine solid western that holds up very well. Beautifully photographed at the beginning of three bands in Technicolor by Edward Cronjager, it had a good cast led by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. Virginia Gilmore takes the female leadership, who really has little to do in the photo. An actress who never did anything of his career. Your presence here is merely cosmetic. <br /> <br /> It's funny that Robert Young has the best bills on Scott! Clearly, it's Scott's image from the beginning, when we first see him in the movie's amazing opening scene, pursued by a gang across the plains. Young does not have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western. He looks just plain foolish to face Barton McLane in a gunfight! An actor who never really distinguished himself - except perhaps with "Crossfire" (1947) - Young appeared in a series of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties that culminated in his greatest success when for seven years he was the "Marcus Welby MD" of television in the seventies. He died in 1998 at the age of 91 years. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" relates the cable connection of Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by Western Union chief Dean Jagger to protect the line of the Sioux marauders and also to confront McLane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious purposes. Robert Young is the young engineer from east back who joins the company and competes with Scott for the affections of Miss Gilmore. Slim Summerville and John Carradine have little role as the company's doctor. <br /> <br /> In general, although it is a good western, although in Region 2, but with an excellent quality that will delight the fans. My only cradle is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those boring graphics. UGH! <br /> <br /> Note: Interestingly, the associate producer of "Western Union" was Harry Joe Brown, who later with Randolph Scott would create an association that would produce some of Scott's best westerns in the 1950s.
