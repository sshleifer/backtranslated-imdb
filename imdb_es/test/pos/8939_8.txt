It has been a long time since a black comedy so original and funny. If "Eating Raoul" is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and find "Betty Betty" right away. The theme of death as funny has been tried before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in "Mortuary Academy"). While that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy, "Undertaking Betty" is much more stable, with a better cast. Who could imagine that the business of the company could be a fertile ground for an original comedy, edifying and sincere? It surprised me and you will be too. I highly recommend seeing "Emprender Betty" - MERK
