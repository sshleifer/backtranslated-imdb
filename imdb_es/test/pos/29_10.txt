<br /> <br /> What else can you ask for? A great script based on one of the best works of the second half of the 20th century, two excellent emotional performances by Courtney and Finney, a realistic view of War Time London, a great cast of cast. This film takes you on an emotional roller coaster through humor, sadness, loss and fulfillment. If you are in the theater it is even more effective. This is a true 10 on the rating scale!
