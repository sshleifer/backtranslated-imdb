This movie is a classic movie from the 70s that, for some reason, has been sadly overlooked. Basically, Connection meets Bullit. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider plays the head of an elite group of detectives, known as "Seven Ups". <br /> <br /> One of his men was discovered during a covert operation and is killed. <br /> <br /> Scheider and his team must find their killers. They get involved in a battle with the mafia. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie has to be the car chase, obviously included to take advantage of Bullit's success. However, the pursuit of this car eclipses Bullitt because of its length, speed and sheer emotion. It is an impressive roller coaster that ends unexpectedly and spectacularly. Do not miss this little gem !!
