The Naruto the Anime television series has generated 2 film films so far, and a third will arrive this summer. <br /> <br /> The first, which was launched in the summer of 2004, was a fun adventure. With the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, one must be a chicken blind, deaf and with legs to deny the faults of that film. While the first was definitely nice, there were many things that could be improved. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all these aspects and excels. <br /> <br /> The action in the first place was incredibly cinematic. The lighting, the atmosphere and the style were three times more effective than in the first film. In the first, they gave us basic action, animated and choreographed animation, but nothing attracted attention, however, the cinematography of this film was exceptional, the use of shadows and lighting combined to make the action more intense and very effective The strength of the fight. <br /> <br /> The animation was very good. Rivaliz√≥ with Disney, however, since this is a film about television characters, there was nothing exceptional in the design or detail of the characters, however, the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic. I think they even used twice the amount of cels for every second because there was absolutely nothing nervous about the animation, it was incredibly fluid. <br /> <br /> The music ... I think that's where this movie fails. . The original composer / orchestra conductor for the television program was used for the film, and I really do not think he did a good job. The music mostly reminded me of many pieces used in old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the synthesizers used for the film could not transmit the melody very well. However, they did not fail at all in the film, adding as a good accompaniment to the action. But, except for a few pieces of violin / string towards the end and some choral works, the music did not exceed any limit or act as something special. <br /> <br /> The story was fun. It was a pretty typical story for Naruto and it was very similar to the first movies, except that, again, he took everything that had been wrong with the story of the first film and improved them. The characters were much more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me going throughout the movie. I kept making you think that the movie would end at any time, but then it would go on, but instead of being dragged, the action and the characters made everything feel fresh and exciting. <br /> <br /> In general, This movie is good, but as good as it is, it is definitely one for fans. I enjoyed the movie, but that's because ... I'm a fan! But I can see that, just like with Final Fantasy's Advent Children, it does not stand out like a movie, but it just acts like a fantastic fan service for a good hour and a half. Although I believe that this film acts as a good introduction to the series for current non-observers, it will not give a full effect to anyone other than those who are stuck to the Naruto screens. However, despite all this, it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of annoying fillings.
