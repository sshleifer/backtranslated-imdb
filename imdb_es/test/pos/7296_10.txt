<br /> <br /> When I unusually rented A Thousand Acres, I thought an entertaining King Lear story was waiting for me and, of course, Michelle Pfeiffer was in it, so what could go wrong? <br /> <br /> However, very quickly, I realized that this story was about a thousand things more than just Acres. I started crying and I could not stop until long after the film was over. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn, for bringing us such a beautifully subtle and compassionate film! Thank you, thank you for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and kindness! <br /> <br /> I recognized Sister Angry; The fugitive sister and the sister in denial. I recognized the Abusive Husband and why he was there and then the Father, oh, oh Father ... everything played magnificently. I also recognized myself and this film was revealing, a relief, an opportunity to face my OWN truth and finally do something about it. I really hope that A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others. <br /> <br /> Since I did not understand why the cover said that the film was about sisters fighting for the land, they were not fighting with each other. Another one at all, I saw it a second time. Then I could see that if you had not lived a similar story, you could easily overlook the overwhelming current of fear and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all. That is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors, for example. <br /> <br /> But there is another reason why this movie is so perfect! <br /> <br /> I do not. Give the ass to a rat (sorry for my French) on how far the story of King Lear is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say: this movie has changed my life. <br /> <br /> Keep up with the work, you can and can MAKE a difference. <br /> <br />
