Every Saturday morning at 11 a.m. I saw Superstars. All the biggest events happened in this show at that time. The challenge, which aired on Sundays in the morning, was also decent, but all the important things happened in this program. The fighters would do all their interviews with Mean Gene on a platform next to the live crowd or speak on their own on the screen in front of a fund that promoted them. The games were usually squash, but sometimes there were two cardinals in the main event. There were also talk shows that, in general, led to violence, which caused a dispute. These segments ranged from Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Funeral Parlor and The Barber Shop. I do not remember any title that has changed hands in this program. That usually happened in paying for visits and in the main Saturday Nights event.
