Frankly I like to see James Caan. Wonderful actor With such simplicity you know exactly what he is thinking. A true professional. <br /> <br /> I have seen the program from the beginning and it has seemed different to me. That's something unique in Hollywood. A new idea It is not a third version of a current program. <Br /> <br /> I also find the show fun and exciting. I like the rhythm, you never get bored, I especially like the mystery of each episode, the way it develops. I am a big fan of the mysteries and I have read many of the great mysteries, but I think the stories in the program are well written and the result is rarely obvious. It's also extremely interesting for me, probably because I'm not a player, it's the different points against the "players": I was fascinated by the amount of plans that people have devised to steal Las Vegas. Music: I like music at the top of the show. Absolutely perfect for the show ... Sets the tone and atmosphere. Simply wonderful. And of course, there is James Caan.
