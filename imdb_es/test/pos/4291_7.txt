Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together, what a luxury! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding up the secondary roles to the set of lies and intrigues. However, at the bottom of all this, each character maintains a line of decency: the moral conscience is maintained despite the obvious contradictions. "Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life." How true are these words. Anne Manning of Watson is at the center of this intrigue: it is the central consciousness that the other three clung to. She is decency without flinching. <br /> <br /> The circumstances of the lies are specific to each one: one to defend one's professional name; one to brake due to pressure from the family / couple; one simply does not want to face the consequence; Ironically, one can not believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are all precarious situations. There's the intrigue, fascinating to see how each one addresses truth and lies. Contradictions, by the way. Despite the apparent dishonor, decency and the heart remain strong. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the subject involved and how each of the characters behaves is delivered masterfully in a simple and clear manner. It is not sensational or complex like another film "Where the Truth Lies" 2005. Credits due to the writing of Fellowes and the nuanced performances of Watson and Wilkinson. There is warmth in some way that comes through seemingly audacious or frustratingly hidden lies. Underneath everything, human frailty not excluded, had good intentions. And following the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two Manning seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. <br /> <br /> I could say that there is no obvious action drama or exciting scenes in "Separate Lies", however, the intrigue is there and will get your attention. The deserving production efforts include the cinematography of Tony Pierce-Roberts (a veteran of the Merchant-Ivory films) and the music of Stanislas Syrewicz, with a tone and tone reminiscent of the composer Zbignew Priesner (by the filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski Trois Couleurs , especially: Bleu 1993.) This is a British movie that you may not want to miss. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson (Anne, the wife): debut of Breaking the Waves 1996; Hilary and Jackie 1998; The Luzhin Defense 2000; Gosford Park 2001; Punch-Drunk Love, Red Dragon, Equilibrium in 2002. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson (James, the husband): The Full Monty 1997; The Governess, Rush Hour (as villain) in 1998; In the Bedroom 2001, Normal (HBO cable movie) 2003, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004, recently as Father Moore in: The Exorcism of Emily Rose 2005 with Laura Linney. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett (Bill): He's just charming in "The Wedding of My Best Friend" in 1997 with Julia Roberts and wonderful in "An Ideal Husband" 1999 d: Oliver Parker, a work of Oscar Wilde.
