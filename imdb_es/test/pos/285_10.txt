My classmates and I used to meet in a house to see this on Friday night before going to the pub. It was the only program that made us lose the opening time. It's one of the best comedies I've seen, if not the best. David Jason was brilliant and he compared it many times with Buster Keaton with his ingenious acrobatics that were carried out so credibly. I would like to be able to get the series on DVD to see it again. He had an incredible ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions. It's a successful "Trip and fall guy" and I remember seeing a trailer that once showed people how to do it professionally. Certainly he is the one who teaches people this art. He only showed flashes of it in other programs he did. Pshaw, this show shows how talented he is. I'm lost as to why David Jason vetoed another series that was made, since for me it was one of the best things he's done and I've been a fan of him since he did this series. It is said that he did not like it because it showed the rawness of his early career. In my opinion, that could have been the right decision when he took it, but now his career has progressed so far, I think this would be a good time for him to do another series that shows that he looks back on his "secret life" Full of errors you do not see.
