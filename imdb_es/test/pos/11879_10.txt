I just do not see what's wrong with this movie. I really liked that movie! I thought that this movie was the best movie of the series. Although part 3 is the best in the series, I still gave this movie 10 out of 10 because it's great. I do not see what everyone hates this movie. Who would not want to see just a little critter action. I wished Brad Brown would show up on this one because he could have improved it a bit. Those who like a bit of drama because ... wait, I will not tell you, you'll just have to see it. This movie also contains some popular actors that are ... (I will not tell you because I hate that people give spoilers, so I do not want to be one of those people). Well, I guess that's all I have to say about this movie.
