The best sand theft movie. Elements of Bogie, Welles & Sinatra will leave you sweating and satisfied. In comparison, it really alters the proverbial car of the apple when watching recent films, such as "Oceans Eleven (remake)", reviewed with such respect, especially in Europe. Movies like Rififi must be shown, spoken and kept alive to remind younger (pathetic) critics of the true classic Noir. <br /> <br /> The criteria should be praised in its impeccable and classy transfer.
