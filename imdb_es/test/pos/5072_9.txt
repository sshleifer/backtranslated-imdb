Some movies are designed to entertain you, others to make you laugh, cry or cheer, others, like this, try to provoke, make you think and make you angry. I got angry during this movie, not with the movie, but with the fact that it was true that the United States, the free one, is tortured by the illogical vision that it is doing it for the greater good. The scenes of torture in this film were heartbreaking, the indifference of the people was shattered, the film was convincing in its argument and showed how bad it is to torture people. Of course, now that makes me a "liberal and bleeding" label pushed to people by other people who close their minds to the facts that this happens and should not. People who do not realize that, as the film said, for every tortured person, there are ten or a hundred people who get up to perform acts of revenge. You get a growing cycle of violence. This movie did not make me hate the United States, although I can see how I could do it, but it made me hate the way the United States has reacted in its post-September 11 world. There is a significant quote in the film, just after we learned that 19 people died and seventy-five were injured in the bomb scene, the appointment is "an American is dead", which makes the difference. You can not kill an American, the United States can kill thousands, but you can not kill a single American, or they will do what is necessary, including torture to deliver justice. This is the American way apparently. Call me liberal, call me naive (although I think people who think torture is good is naive) call me cheated, call me whatever you want, but this movie is a shining example of what is wrong in the United States and the West today. I want this film to be shown to all the students in the school, at least. This movie will stay with me for a long time, a part of me would like to forget it, because I wish that this kind of thing had never happened, but I know that, the other part of me would never forget it, because we need to Remember these shameful events to prevent happen again. Whatever happens, this movie will be with me for a long time and I will tell everyone I know to see it, not to entertain, but to be provoked, because sometimes we all have to be provoked.
