Well, I've seen this movie for more than 25 years and it's still almost as interesting as when I saw it for the first time. It is definitely one of the most exclusive films ever made. <br /> <br /> I still think that Martin Sheen was also "upset" in the billing. He dominates the film, but receives a lower turnover than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this movie of 2 hours and 17 minutes (theatrical version). How unfair is that? <br /> <br /> Sheen is fantastic here, especially his narrative, which spreads everywhere. It's one of the best stories, if not the best, I've heard in a movie. His voice is simply disturbing as he recounts his thoughts on this incredible nightmarish adventure. I never stop appreciating his work in this movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing that impresses me about the movie over the years is the number of memorable scenes, some I've never forgotten, like ... .. <br /> <br /> Sheen losing him in his hotel room in the first scene of the movie; Robert Duvall and the surf scenes totally out of place and then the attack with the dramatic classical music of Wagner at full volume from the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest was frightened when he saw a tiger near the jungle; the strange scenes on the long boat ride on the river; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then the strange character of Brando. Go on and on with strange scenes. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that I enjoyed everything. No, there are some very unpleasant scenes, like one in which an ox is cut in half (I can not see it anymore), an innocent family is killed in a small boat by the young and drugged member of Sheen, and The crew is a Little too silly sometimes. Then, there is a lot of blasphemy, guided by too many words. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there are many good things and many bad things in this movie for almost anyone who sees this. One thing is for sure: it's a movie you'll remember!
