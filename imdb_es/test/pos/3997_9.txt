I'm not sure why the other comment about this movie was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am an Asian art student with a particular love for the art, culture and history of Korea. I thought that this movie was a very controversial and interesting character for life. Jang Seung-up is one of the most famous Korean artists (perhaps the most famous) and is still revered as a master. Given the tumult of the era in which he painted and his own conflictive nature, it is surprising that he has produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill. This film pays homage to his talent while directly analyzing his erratic and somewhat self-destructive personality. The photography in MY opinion was beautiful, many of the outdoor panoramic shots looked like paintings of Korean landscapes (which I found in a charming concept instead of "too artistic") and I think that Choi Min-sik played Jang Seun-up with the necessary intensity and unpredictability. I highly recommend this movie to art lovers and movie lovers alike.
