A few years ago I saw for the first time this remake of the classic of the sixties with the Mini Coopers and I remember that I liked it a lot. Now, about two years later, he showed up on television and I just wanted to know if I would like it as much as when I saw him at the movies. Well, the answer is yes. <br /> <br /> The film is about a team of thieves who will do a final job in Venice, Italy. The plan is impeccable and the execution perfect. They escape and will not have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is a problem that they did not take into account: someone within their own ranks does not like to split the loot, but wants to keep everything to itself, even when that means they will have to kill the rest of the crew. . But all but one survive and are in search of revenge. A year later, this time in Los Angeles, the members of the surviving team create an intelligent and tortuous plan to recover the gold and take revenge on the traitor ... <br /> <br /> The story itself is, of course It is not very original, since this is a new version of the original movie of 1969, but it has many things to offer to make you forget about it. This is a typical theft / action movie, but it is certainly one of the best of its kind. The action is very beautiful, the landscapes and Venice are really attractive, the story is good and the special effects are impressive. Even the acting is very good, something that is not often seen in an action movie. I must admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7.5 / 10.
