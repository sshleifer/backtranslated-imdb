Beware My Lovely originated in a work written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked to write about frightened women. His first and best effort was the script of The Spiral Staircase. He also did a suspense thriller by Loretta Young, Cause For Alarm, a couple of years earlier. The play that Dinelli originally wrote was titled The Man and had 92 Broadway appearances during the 1950 season. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway and was starring Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. <br /> <br /> The roles that Gish and Boone played are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For whatever reason, RKO thought to eliminate the age difference. Dinelli himself rewrote his game for the screen, so I wonder what he thinks about it. Certainly, the problem of fragility was completely eliminated from history. <br /> <br /> That was not the only thing that was eliminated. All people wear period clothing from the First World War, however, there is no reference to the moment in which this story unfolds. I thought it was strange and later, when the telephone company technician arrived at Ida Lupino's residence, I noticed that his truck was a crop from the same period. <br /> <br /> The film takes place almost entirely at Ida Lupino's house, where he hired an itinerant stranger in Robert Ryan as a maintenance staff. The movie is a great lesson for not hiring strangers without reference. It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who holds Lupino in his home for about a day. <br /> <br /> Both leaders do good jobs even with the changes made. Movies like Beware My Lovely are the things that a small studio like RKO did better. If this were done in MGM or Paramount, the bright embellishments would have overwhelmed a solid story.
