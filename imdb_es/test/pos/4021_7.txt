Of the two Slaughter films, this is the best and, although it is not a list of Schindlers in complexity, it is very funny. All men are good or bad and women are just hostesses and emotionally needy, for example, Slaughters Girl. It's also very fun and The Pro has to be the funniest movie pimp of all time, you can not have enough hats, purple suits, gold chains and Jive Patois forever. Best of all, he has the Harem around him and says: "ARE YOU UNNASTAN?" Everything about him is bigger than life and is reminiscent of Morris Day in Purple Rain. Jim Brown also shows that he is a private cock for all the girls and again he kicks his white ass in all directions. The car scene is very unrealistic, since they survive unharmed, but hey, this is the cinema. Definitely the best blax flick and beat Shaft (1971). Even the first movie is pretty good.
