Not since "Harold and Maude" has been so successfully used suicide as a theme for a love story. The performance, by a first class cast is excellent. With a well-structured script, things move at a pleasant pace. There are moments of black comedy, but I would classify "My Suicidal Sweetheart" as a unique romantic comedy, with a touch of black humor. The relationship between two lovers psychologically challenged, is both touching and attractive. The movie really makes you question, what is a normal relationship? I highly recommend "My Suicidal Sweetheart". Look for it on DVD under the title "Crazy for Love". You will not be disappointed. - MERK
