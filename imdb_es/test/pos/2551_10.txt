Chop Shop, the second feature of Ramin Bahrani, is a rare breed. It is an American film that tells a story that is not usually found in American cinema, the story of a minority that lives in poverty. It is a work of simple beauty. Filmed in a place in Queens, New York, in the shadows of Shea Stadium, Chop Shop is neorealism to the core. With a cast of non-actors, it has more in common with the classic bicycle thieves of Vittorio De Sica than anything else made in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all the music and the sounds are dialectic. Seeing it is like watching a great foreign film, it takes us to another world because it is very rare to see it. However, this other world is not after the Second World War in Rome or Istanbul or New Delhi, it is the contemporary city of New York. <br /> <br /> Bahrani tells the story of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as Ale. He is a 12-year-old Latin American boy with no parents or family unit to take care of him. He lives in a small room upstairs in the auto shop where he also works. Share the same bed with his teenage sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales). Neither of them has passed the second grade. Ale, although young, is tough and mature. Act as the head of the small family. He hooks up his sister with a job, and he does everything he can to make money when he is not working in the article store. Sell ​​pirated DVDs on the streets and sweets in the subway. He looks for car spare parts and sells them to the many car shops that line the street where he lives. <br /> <br /> Alejandro is disoriented when he discovers that his sister works as a prostitute during work nights. He himself becomes progressively disinterested in complying with the law. Start stealing, first the parts of the car and then the wallets. Like Antonio, the desperate protagonist of Bicycle Thieves, we can not blame Ale for becoming a thief. It is merely survival. Ale and Isamar save with the hope of buying a food vending van for $ 4,500. They see the van as their way out, and there's a lot of optimism. However, as is often the case in neo-realism, we know that this will only lead to disappointment. <br /> <br /> The fascinating performance of Polanco is what gives legitimacy to Chop Shop's realism. Here is a 12-year-old character who needs to be credibly independent and vulnerable. Whether you're directing the cars to the store, selling Snickers movies and bars or playing with your sister in your sparse room, it's authentic. A land of opportunities. Ale's lifestyle is what many in white middle class America consider "third world." They act recognizing poverty and deprivation in foreign lands while they drink their coffee and read the New York Times on Sunday morning, but they blind him in their own streets. Once you see Chop Shop, you will think differently about children who sell sweets in the subway. <br /> <br /> more comments at www.mediasickness.com
