I would love for the cast and crew to sit down and make an audio commentary on this movie! All the different places that went to film this movie! I should foresee some very good anecdotes! Fans of this movie would love to know: <br /> <br /> What kind of permission did they have to go to film in certain places? <br /> <br /> Was there a memorable episode? <br /> <br /> Were there any scenes that were deleted? <br /> <br /> What challenges did the cast and crew face? <br /> <br /> Did any actor have doubles? <br /> <br /> What was it like working with other cast members? <br /> <br /> Was there any of the ad libbed scenes? <br /> <br /> What are the cast members and the team up to now? <br /> <br /> What locations still exist and which do not exist or are they now a different business? <br /> <br /> It's one thing to read the trivia about this movie on this site and other websites. But there is simply no comparison with taking it straight out of the horse's mouth! <br /> <br /> Come on, guys! Meet and make a comment! Never shy away from a challenge! Go for the pleasure!
