Metschurat). Then, the Belgian Isabelle (Cécile de France) and the brother of Wendy, William (Kevin Bishop), join the group, and Xavier learns Spanish and finds friendship and love in his experience of living abroad. "L 'Auberge Espagnole" is one of those movies that the viewer gets sad when it ends. The story is a lovely and funny story of friendship and love, in a globalized world and in a unified Europe. This lovely movie made me feel good and happy, although I've never lived in a student republic. The newcomer William causes the most fun situations throughout history, with his big mouth and short brain. Also, it's great to see a new approach to the students who live together, different from those silly American fraternities and their stereotypes, common in American movies. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Spanish Shelter" (Spanish Auberge)
