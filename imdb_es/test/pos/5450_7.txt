This is an intelligent and entertaining film about the fight in the back room that chose a successor of Johnny Carson in the Tonight Show. However, the final thesis of the film, that David Letterman's top comedic talent was overlooked due to its controversial nature, and the show diminished by the enthronement of a Jay Leno inferior in the television comedy show leader is simply false, since anyone who has seen both Leno and Letterman act can see for themselves. The hard and simple truth is exactly as stated by an NBC executive in the movie "Jay Leno is the funniest man in the United States." And David Letterman is not. Once you realize this, then many of the machinations in the movie become irrelevant. Ultimately, the whole movie is little more than sour grapes from Letterman fans, who simply can not accept that the best comic has been chosen by people whose goal is to know this kind of thing. The final proof is that, despite Letterman's initial advantage, possibly due to the exaggeration that arose from the battle for the succession of Tonight Show, Leno's show has proven to be the most popular, so, at least in My opinion refutes Letterman's claims of being unfair. Stolen from his legitimate inheritance.
