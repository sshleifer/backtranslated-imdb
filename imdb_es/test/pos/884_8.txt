Although I saw this film in Korea, in Korean, and therefore I did not understand the language, the images say more than enough. For what I can do about this, this is the story: two excellent sword fighters become friends in their service as king's guard. One of them is opposed to the ways of the king and begins to kill important men. The other has to hunt him down. This movie is visually great. The sword fight is great. And the movie has an exciting ending. I only hope that this film is commercialized for the assistants to the western cinema. And be released on DVD, of course.
