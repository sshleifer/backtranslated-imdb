I never thought I would say this about a biopic, but there is an abundance of almost excessive characterization (especially in regard to the emotions of Kenji Miyazawa) and very little about the literal events in his life. In the end, I'm not sure. if he dies (he's supposed to do it), or if his sister finally dies (he's supposed to do it), or if the director spent too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it) , wrote Miyazawa. a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railway). However, this glimpse into the mind of a writer who "drew poetry and fairy tales from his imagination" is very intelligent, creative, entertaining and emotionally powerful. <br /> <br /> All this despite the fact that everyone is encouraged. as animals (as in many of Miyazawa's stories). <br /> <br /> Some of the images are really amazing, especially considering that it was a television movie. Seriously, some of them (like the sequence with birds crawling in the blue light) rival parts of Fantasia. However, I still can not stand the computer animation when mixed with the cel animation. CGI trains are terribly obvious, even more so than the Anastasia train. <br /> <br /> 8/10
