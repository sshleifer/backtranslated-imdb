Do you know that sometimes you have to have it? This is how this movie is with me. I'm almost ashamed to admit that I like it, it's so ridiculous in parts, but I find myself reaching it when I'm depressed and I just need a good laugh ... and trust me, I'm just not a "Goofy movie" kinda guy. <br /> <br /> You can read the synopsis, so I do not have to get bored with that, just rest assured, if you like Kelsey Grammer, you probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> One more thing, be sure to see the final credits. It is not necessary to read them, simply watch them and catch the performance of "In the Navy" by Village People ... and friends.
