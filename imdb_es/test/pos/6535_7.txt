Aaron Carter plays the pop star (J.D. McQueen) in this movie (surprise surprise). This is a typical movie in which the protagonist (Jane) is very much in love with JD McQueen, the pop star (and many other girls), but she is the lucky one who spends the days with JD and establishes a relationship with him. It's more like a fantasy. J.D. You have to go to a public school to maintain your math grade in order to make your summer tour. The problem is that J.D. It's not good at math. Find the smartest person in school (Jane) to teach him. Jane, as a tutor and falls in love with J.D. J.D. in return, he also falls in love with J.D., but J.D. He ruins it and has to fix everything in order to win the girl and do the summer tour. The movie is definitely worth seeing. Aaron will be a great actor !!!
