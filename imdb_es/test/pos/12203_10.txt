A new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Lake Bell is wonderful ... it's too bad that his other "Miss Match" program has been canceled. I'm glad you've returned to "Surface". I can not wait for the return of "Surface". This show is really something unique to watch. With a mysterious underwater world that is similar to Jurassic Park, this show makes you wonder what will be next. Nim is adorable, even if it is going to turn into something bigger and much more sinister. There are so many generic programs out there that seem to repeat the same old themes. When something like "Surface" appears, you just have to say "THANK YOU!".
