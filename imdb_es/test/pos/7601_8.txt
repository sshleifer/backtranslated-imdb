Drew Barrymore has a second chance in high school, a covert task as a newspaper reporter. In flashbacks, we see that the first time was, to put it mildly, a great disaster. David Arquette is funny in a modest role as Drew's brother, who also signs up to help the sister. Many subplots endanger, but never exceed the simple charm of the film. Drew continues to make her niche as an innocent-sexy light sexy comedian.
