I have seen and enjoyed all the Chameleon films and I must say that they continue to improve with each one of them. Bobbie Phillips is fantastic and my granddaughter wants to be like her. I'm glad you brought a "Brother" character to Bobbie (Kam), so we can expect to see more exciting shows. Bobbie is beautiful, sexy and sweet, and independent at the same time, and everything any woman could want to be!
