Inexplicably, I saw this film for the first time just a couple of days ago and I understood from the beginning what all this fuss is about. This movie captured my attention from beginning to end and it ran through the gamut of emotions (and could have helped me discover some that I never knew). <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman shines like Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a man who has to juggle at least three different challenges in life: a lost husband, advertising executive addicted to work and a loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less central in the movie simply because Joanna was absent for a good part, but when she was on the screen she gave Hoffman a run for her money. The real highlight, however, (in my opinion) had to be young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim in a marital breakup, and Justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role, since he deals with the conflicting emotions around his mother and his adjustment to life with dad, only to have the confusion about why he should do it. I have to leave his father when his mother left him. The young Justin did not seem to lose the rhythm in this difficult role. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an excellent film worthy of an Oscar, whose only weak point was what I thought was a real disappointment. The decision to go for the happy and happy ending, which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle that Ted and Joanna had gone through. But there is not much more to complain about here. <br /> <br /> 9/10
