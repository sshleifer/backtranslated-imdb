I love Fingersmith by Sarah Waters, and I was worried about the TV adaptation, since I had been disappointed by the version of Tipping the Velvet on the BBC (which, although beautiful to watch, Keeley Hawes could not sing, and Rachael Stirling could not perform) . Fingersmith is a novel very well drawn with impressive twists and turns and I wondered if this could be done justice in just 3 hours. <br /> <br /> I should not have worried. The adaptation was excellent, very little trimmed, and it developed at a dizzying rate (although I was wondering if I had not read the book, would I miss anything?). It looked like a classic BBC costume drama and I had to remind myself that this is a contemporary book. <br /> <br /> The performance was stellar. Sally Hawkins acted as Sue Trinder and Elaine Cassidy, a slow burner, which at the end of the story was incandescent like Maud Lilley. The love, the passion, the realization of the acts of betrayal that both would have to perform, were written on their faces. It was a joy to see it. <br /> <br /> I hope Rachael Stirling was watching him: that's how you play a Sarah Waters character!
