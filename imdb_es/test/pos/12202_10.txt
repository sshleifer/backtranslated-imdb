I thought that this was a very good television series and I would like to see it continue. It really got interesting there at the end and I really want to see where it's going. Sometimes we are quick to kill a series without giving it a chance. I think this one needs an opportunity to continue, and I will definitely be waiting for it. The ocean is one of the places that man knows so little and I think it is a mystery in itself. What awaits us under the waters of the world. It is even said that the man may have left or slipped out of the waters many millennia ago. Is this a new evolution that is coming? Are we going to advance in the food chain or fight for our position?
