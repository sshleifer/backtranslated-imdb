I finally received my DVD today, I saw it and I am pleased to announce that this is the original theatrical version of the movie. As you may have read in previous reviews of "Rich and Famous," the TV version of the movie that somehow came to VHS sometime in the late 1990s, but now WB corrected the error and released it on a DVD complete with the plane's bathroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C ** t! It's all there and it looks better than ever! A crisp and clear digital transfer, widescreen and special features that include an original theatrical trailer and a 1981 classic called "On Location with Rich and Famous" with interviews with the cast and director. If you like this movie like me, you will not be disappointed to buy this DVD. Am I glad to finally have this on DVD? Well worth the wait! Thanks Warner Bros!
