Great adaptation of Christie's novel. Surprising attention to the authentic details of the time (many films from the mid-70s and early 80s that try to make the 1920s and early 30s seem too much from the mid-70s and early 80s for my taste, for what I expected the worst here and I was glad It was proved wrong) The suits and sets are very well made. I really liked this production ?? Largely due to Francesca Annis' lovely interpretation of a bright and carefree young "Frankie" and James Warwick's charming Bobbie. The couple would continue to represent Christie's Tommy & Tuppence, which is fun since some contemporary book critics compared Frankie and Bobby to their previous Tommy & Tuppence characters. Were the secondary characters equally well made? Mrs. Rivington (played by the future Miss Joan H.) and "Badger" are perfectly interpreted as the post WWI, "Bertie Wooster type".
