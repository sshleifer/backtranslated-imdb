Although a "woman's story", I found this still quite interesting. It's unusual since he has three real-life sisters playing sisters in the movie! I mean Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. <br /> <br /> The reason why national critics loved this movie was the presence of John Garfield, a rebellious child. In their twisted minds dominated by liberals, the totally American characters are disgusting, but the types of poor attitude and bad attitude that Garfield played here are people with whom they can identify. Despite that, this movie still has a general feeling of kindness, which is why I liked it. Some of the characters may have done stupid things, but they have good hearts. What heart was bigger than "Ann's" (Priscilla Lane) here? I agree with the comment critic of IMDb users who says that this is the Priscilla movie as much as the beloved (not me) Garfield. <br /> <br /> With a director of Michael Curtiz's caliber, the film is better than it could have been under someone else. Curtiz made sure that no scene, soapy or otherwise, lasted too long. <br /> <br /> In addition to sisters Lane and Garfield, we have Claude Rains (who adds much-needed humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (girls' main love interest), Gale Page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh and Mae Robson. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this movie must have been a success because there were not many side effects, nor of them approaching it in content and box office success.
