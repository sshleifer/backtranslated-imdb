This movie must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece, with a bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different places in Sweden. The recently renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of a former finance minister is absolutely the best of the four, strange stories about love or career. I would love to see the four as a movie in themselves, as they can be much more extensive. <br /> <br /> Also the only break in the middle is something that I had never seen before. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the series (if they are doing one) or the DVD extension. Apparently, they had cut a lot to fit only 3.5 hours.
