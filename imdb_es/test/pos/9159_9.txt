NBC was publishing many good products when this series came out, but none of them was receiving viewers. At least according to its executives, who wisely canceled good shows like Star Trek & My World & Welcome To It due to low ratings. NBC advertisers got a bargain because of NBC's ignorance. <br /> <br /> This program stands out as the only time that James Garner was not enough to get spectators. It's just like this program had an excellent cast of support from Stuart Margolin (later Angel in the Rockford archives), to Neva Patterson and Margot Kidder. <br /> <br /> It was set in a western city of 1900. Garner was playing a sheriff who did not want to use violence to fulfill his duties. It was a small town, but it was excellent. It was not long after this that Jim Rockford brought Garner to success, but for my money, this program was good enough, it just was not at the right time, in the right place, or at the right time. <br /> <br /> The show was so good that most of the people who worked on it also got a job at Rockford.
