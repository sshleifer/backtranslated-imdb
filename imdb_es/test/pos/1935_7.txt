This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's previous films and she sure has an unconventional theme. She is making money dancing with men in a dance hall. She really does not like work, but it's a life. His boyfriend looks like a good boy, but he is also persecuted by the rich Ricardo Cortez. Well, after getting married, it turns out that his "good boy" is a weasel and a womanizer and that Cortez turns out to be a great man. By the end of the movie, Barbara has simply had enough, as any SANE woman would walk out of this horrible marriage. <br /> <br /> In the 1920s and early 1930s, Hollywood did almost everything it wanted and some of its films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today, such as nudity, adultery and the bad language. While TEN CENTS A DANCE is not a flagrant example of this morality, it does have a theme that would never have been allowed after the Harvest Code was created and enforced after 1934. Somehow, the Code was excellent, after all Parents did not have to worry about what their children saw in the movies (like nudity in BEN HUR, 1925). However, it also tended to disinfect some of the films too much, and there is no way that this particular film has been made and approved because it tends to glorify the divorce, a serious no-no and subsequently 1934. This is really a shame, since I do not think TEN CENTS A DANCE was totally bad to talk about this, especially because the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a fanatical thief. Even so, allowing the film to end with his divorce and marrying a man who got divorced twice could not have done it. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is interesting and stimulating. In addition, it had a good pace and adapted to its relatively short execution time. Look at this one <br /> <br /> FYI - Unfortunately, Ricardo Cortez was not really Hispanic, but he changed his name due to possible prejudice because he was Jewish. He was an excellent leader of his time, but today he is almost forgotten.
