I have always loved old movies, but this is one of my ten favorites: it has all the charm, the uniqueness of 1940 and the good old-fashioned romance. It's fun! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes kitchen articles and domestic life for a famous magazine ... under the premise that she is a married homemaker. Even the president of the magazine is under this deception. Enter a handsome GI, (played by the talented Dennis Morgan) who has just rescued from a raft along with his friend. Her simple desire is to stay in the cozy inn of which she writes so eloquently and relax with her famous homemade meals. Now she has to frantically find a way to save her work and her reputation ... to this we must add that her fianc√© is in a hurry to tie the knot does not help. The humor is excellent and the chemistry between the main characters is very funny. Add the character-actor nicknamed "Cuddles" (which fits this name completely) and it becomes even more adorable. This has become my must-see film in which I snuggle up with a cup of cocoa every Christmas season. A wonderful and enjoyable movie to enjoy at Christmas or at any time!
