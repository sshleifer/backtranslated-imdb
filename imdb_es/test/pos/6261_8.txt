This is a beautiful, funny, live movie. It's even better than "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which is parallel but does not replicate. The story completes a full circle and had the theater radiant as the credits rolled. One hundred years after this story takes place, we are so intrigued by the flickering images in a dark theater.
