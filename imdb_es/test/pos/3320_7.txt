Claire Booth "The Women" by Luce shows relationships with men through the point of view of a woman in a play (and in the 1939 movie that also has Joan Crawford as a bitch: a character who could have been Amanda Farrow 20 years earlier), which has no male characters Here we see the male characters and what group they are. They use women as toys and throw them away, letting women suffer. Ironically, women in "Women", perhaps because they are all we see, are shown in a less than favorable light, alternately silly and intriguing, with the only "good" (Norma Shearer), which grows "claws" for the end. In "Best of all" we see the men of the cads that they are, while the women are largely innocent and vulnerable. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about women who jump out of things. Diane Baker jumps out of a car, (perhaps in the most absurd scene in film history, which is not in the book). Suzy Parker falls from a fire escape. The women in the film are jumping to the workplace, looking for success and love at the same time. Women would jump to the future and leave this type of telenovela in the next decade. But they would return to him in the 80s and 90s through the novels of people like Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz, (although their coarser jobs are not as good as this). <br /> <br /> The best thing about This movie is the way it looks. I love the cinemascope movies of the 50s and 60s. They look much better than the home movies with pixel challenged that we've been doing since then, especially in the mailbox version we see on television, and the DVD, with the image so clear that I could enter it. The appearance of the group of young beauties in him is also memorable. This movie probably has more beautiful women than any other. He has a supermodel, (Suzy Parker), a beauty queen, (Myrna Hansen, who was not Miss America 1954 as Rona Jaffe says in the DVD commentary, but Miss USA 1953, according to the IMDb: but what) and a Playboy Playmate, (June Blair, since January 1957). My vote is for Suzy, one of the amazing beauties of all time. His performance here is not as horrible as people pretend: they are simply reacting, as people did then, to the vision of a supermodel (the first, really), trying to act. Nobody seemed to care how well he did it. Her role, that of an apparently mundane woman who happens to be the most vulnerable, is the most complex of the group and she does it very well. <br /> <br /> The most moving part of the movie is now the age of the female leads in the moment. Hope Lange was 27 years old when they filmed this in the spring of 1959. Diane Baker was 20. Suzy Parker was 26. Hope, who seemed to be Grace Kelly's heiress, never made it really big and ended up being Mrs. Muir on television and According to the IMDb, I ended up living in a home with "boxes for coffee tables" because he spent his money on causes he believed in before he died at age 72 in 2003. This film must have seemed like a very distant and irrelevant memory by then. . . Baker, always a welcome face on the television of the 60s, (especially for Richard Kimble), and still active as actress and acting coach, just turned 67. Parker found "the best of everything" with Bradford Dillman for 40 years before dying at age 70. The same year that Lange did. But here they are, young, beautiful and ambitious for success and love, just like their characters.
