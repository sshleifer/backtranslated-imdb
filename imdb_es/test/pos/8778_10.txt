I consider Saboteur as the first "American" movie of Hitchcock, because the story takes place completely in the United States. <br /> <br /> There are bright scenes in this movie. The scene of the Statue of Liberty, Barry Kane jumping into the water from the bridge, the scene Waterfall is amazing. It's not Hitchcock's fault that he did not get the actors he wanted. Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper for the lead roles in foreign correspondent and saboteur. But Gary Cooper was not interested in doing a thriller. Another reason why Hitchcock did not get big stars was because he was not one of the principal directors. Although Rebecca was a great success, most of the success of the film went to producer David O. Selznick. For example, David O. Selznick won the Oscar for best film for Rebecca. And Hitchcock did not get an Oscar for best director for Rebecca. Hitchcock began receiving attention after the Foreign Correspondent (1940). But Universal gave him a low budget for Saboteur (1942). Hitchcock tried to get Joel McCrea for this movie, because he was willing to work with Hitchcock again on a low salary. He enjoyed working with Hitchcock in a foreign correspondent (1940). But he was not available. So the role went to Robert Cummings. Hitchcock called Robert Cummings "a competent interpreter." I thought he did the best he could. He was a lesser-known actor who was willing to play a role when many large actors refused to play the main male role. <br /> <br /> As for the main female role, Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwyck for the lead role. . They were not interested either. So Universal decided to give the paper to Priscilla Lane. I read in a book that this was one of his favorite movies. <br /> <br /> I also liked the scene at Blind Man's house. That's my favorite scene. If we listen more closely to the dialogue in the scenes that take place in Uncle Philip's house, we will see how intense it is. Uncle Philip (blind man) was studying the character of Barry Kane the moment he entered his house. The moment Barry entered his house, he heard Barry's wives. Through the conversation, he realized that Barry Kane is not a criminal at all. We also see his hearing through these scenes. For example, Barry hears the sound of a car that says "Is a car coming?" Uncle Philip says "2 cars, I think". Uncle Philip was right. We see 2 cars in the next scene. Priscilla Lane did a good job playing her role. She was not a big star. But I thought that his performance was very good. Another bright scene in Uncle Philip's house is the scene where he asks Priscilla Lane (Patricia Martin): "Are you scared, Pat? Is that what makes you so cruel?" I thought Otto Krueger played the villain brilliantly. Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey for the villain. But he refused. Harry Carey is famous for his role as Mr. President in "Mr. Smith goes to Washington." I want to mention more about this movie. But I think my publication is too long. <br /> <br /> Each Hitchcock movie is special in its own way. I'm sure Hitchcock fans will like this movie. I rate 10 out of 10
