The movie Angels of the Universe is a pure masterpiece and proves once again that you can make a brilliant movie with a low budget, for example, American Beauty and Blair Witch Project. Director Fridrik Thór Fridriksson gives the novel Englar alheimsins a new life on the white screen. The film is a breakthrough in the making of Icelandic films because it is the largest and largest film that has been made in Iceland. <br /> <br /> The music in the film, played by Sigurrós, is very symbolic for the film. It is absolutely brilliant. I recommend to all who may think that they go and see this movie as soon as possible, they will not be disappointed. I would bet in this movie to win the prize for the best foreign cinema next year. around the world!
