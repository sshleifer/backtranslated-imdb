With documentary films, the question of realism always arises. How much of the film is real and how much does the filmmaker manipulate? In LITTLE DIETER NEEDS TO FLY, Herzog is too absorbed in telling the story of a man who tells his own story to address even the question of realism versus formalism. From the beginning, Herzog's role as a narrator is obvious. Luckily, he is a master storyteller. LITTLE DIETER is the finest and most attractive documentary I've seen in my life. The story of Dieter is exciting, and Herzog's efforts in recreation, by putting Dieter on the test of reliving his story in the spot while filming, are very effective. The story told by Dieter is real, but Herzog is always present, drawing absurd comments from realism. This film is a must for any documentary film student and / or Werner Herzog.
