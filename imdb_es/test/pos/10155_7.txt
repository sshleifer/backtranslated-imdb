This is not among my favorite Hitchcock movies, although I must admit that it is still quite good. Among the things I really liked was the presence of Jimmy Stewart (who always improves even the most mediocre material) and the incredibly scary looking killer (who looks like a skeleton with only a thin layer of skin stretched over him). Although it cost the studio a lot of money, I did not particularly care about Doris Day in the movie, she seemed to cry a lot and sing "Que Sera" as a fullback. Yes, I know that she was supposed to sing that way, but this always made me hate this song. Sorry. <br /> <br /> The other complaint, though minor, that I had about the movie was that it was a bit "too polished" and "Hollywood-esque". The original version (also made by Hitchcock) seemed much more sordid and sordid, and this was added to the atmosphere of fear.
