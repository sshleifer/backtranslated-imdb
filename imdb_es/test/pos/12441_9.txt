This film, without a doubt, is the clearest example of British humor that the Germans can not understand. One-liners run rampant in a film that generates one of the best series of films in the history of British cinema (St.Trinians). The history of bureaucratic incompetence in post-war trials allows Frank Launder to direct the maximum talent of all actors. It is probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her partner, in Alastair Sim, for a strong characterization (although she continues to win). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis deserve mentions in the masterpiece of Dighton's English label and rigid upper lip under pressure. <br /> <br /> No Rutherford / Sim / Grenfell fan would be without this in their collection. Absolutely brilliant Why 9/10? Only 83 minutes long.
