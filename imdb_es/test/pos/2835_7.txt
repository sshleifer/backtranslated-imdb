This is a photographically illuminated western and unusually well written by the veteran creator of "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is your main help in this regard. Its strong plot can be said in a few sentences. A cavalry officer, foreman Richard Lance, captured an Indian enemy leader after a massacre at a fort. He insists on taking the man to trial, to be sent to Tucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner to trial and the patrol is destroyed. This means that the leader has escaped, and Lance must now lead a second patrol, and he chooses the men that the strongest can save, a company of problems, to defend the advanced fort that had been destroyed and save the command of other. attack to stop the bottleneck in that sector. Like Lance, the young Gregory Peck is pretty strong. Another in the big cast of this film that really shows life in a cavalry outpost that looks like an army establishment of heterogeneous types and fighters, includes War Bond as a drinking sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie as troublemakers, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney Jr. as a psychological troublemaker and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as official partners with Nana Bryant as the Colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton, like the love interest, manages to play a difficult role; Michael Ansara is the captured war chief, and Jeff Corey plays the explorer of the Fort. There are really two big scenes in this very well done in the west: the long section in the fort before the last patrol is sent, and that long patrol in the condemned Ft. Challenging himself. Once in that fort, Peck arrives to give a great speech in which, at the request of the men he has lined up to receive orders, he tells each one why he took them. reading their defects one by one; Then they are told why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place. They catch the Indian instead of going himself, and prove they are wrong for the rest of the movie by winning their lonely battle through intelligence and courage. The music of Franz Waxman is good, the production qualities are admirable; the argument about what would happen if Lance takes the war chief is true; Apart from this insoluble error of the central character, this is the great western. It has been one of my favorites for fifty years.
