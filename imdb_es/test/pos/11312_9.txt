This movie was a riot, mocks "Madonna - Truth Or Dare" in all the right places. I love Madonna and I love Julie Brown. How could I ask for more? Julie's parody of "Vogue," titled "Vague" was hysterical ... "Kelly LeBrock thinks it's cool, that she only has cold boogers on a paper plate." "Brooke Shields, Dawber, Pam Spam personality" !! I could have died! And just wait to see what you can do with a watermelon!
