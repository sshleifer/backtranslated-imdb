If you have not seen this late 80's movie about the Washington Bureau of a Network News station, I highly recommend it. It is a sad comment about the direction of news in this country, but tells the story wittily. The characters are well developed and the performance of Albert Brooks is fabulous. He delivers all his lines with entertaining discreet comedy. I'm not a fan of Albert Brooks at all, so it was a pleasant surprise. I have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and he informed me that this is close to reality, so congratulations to the writer and director for doing his research. <br /> <br /> Funny movie with a lot of vision in the world of network news. It is not as dark as another movie that I also recommend in the same genre 'Network'.
