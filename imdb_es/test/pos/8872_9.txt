I thought the interaction between Crystal and DeVito was great. The movie is quite out of place, but there are some unforgettable lines. Ramsey as "Momma" is vulgar and exaggerated, but also very fun and effective. The character HAS to be pretty horrible because, why would someone else think about killing his mother? Now, Crystal's wife: she is a "bitch" to whom everyone would like to get her due, so her role, although minor, is also effective, because she has to justify Crystal's ridiculous case of "blocking the Writer". While there are dark moments, the film is not depressing and, despite the murderous impulses felt by the protagonists, they also have redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the funniest movies I can remember, one that I do not mind watching several times.
