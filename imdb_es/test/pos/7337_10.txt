This movie was beautiful and touching. It touched a place deep inside me and I'm not sure why. I am a happily married woman and I have never had lesbian tendencies, but this movie almost turned her into something I crave. The choreography, the plot, the dialogue ... the film was a work of art. <br /> <br /> The synopsis without spoilers is that a gymnast woman is not satisfied with her life and seeks ... something, anything. He is with a man who does not want a baby, but he does. He is not mean to her, but neither does he treat her like a woman should be treated ... I guess he does not really appreciate her. All these years he has kept fit and decides to return to the gym. Meet another woman during her acrobatic training and develop an intimate and beautiful relationship. Throughout the film, she has another friend with whom she trained in her youth, and they have remained close friends. <br /> <br /> The relationship that develops is ... I do not know the word, but very Understanding, comfortable, intimate but sexy ... something that could only exist between two women. The kind of relationship that could really give meaning back to your life. Someone that makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, even confused. <br /> <br /> The relationship with your close friend is beautiful in an equally different way. They have a close and intimate relationship. Her friend showed me what a real friend really is. Someone who is understanding, easy to carry, REAL, fun to be with, someone who is there for you no matter what. Someone to support you, and you can huddle and tell your deepest secrets. Someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets. <br /> <br /> The story is simple in the fact that it was not overdone, but nothing was done at all. Leave many sensual images to capture your moments. The dance and the choreography were impressive. I could see it again and again. The way in which the artist captured the feelings and emotions of the main character was. The dance and the images were very dazzling and fascinating to watch. What a wonderful, wonderful story! I fell in love with this movie. If you have the opportunity, rent this and look at it!
