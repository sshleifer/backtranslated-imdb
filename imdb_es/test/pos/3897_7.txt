As in "Columbo," we see that fatality occurs from the beginning. What follows is a growing network of lies, sex, blackmail and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even a bit of a fumbler, not unlike "Columbo." It is William H. Macy, as the critic of the film suspects that he is wearing the film. Constantly turning and spinning, the plot sends Macyty deeper and deeper into the arsenal of his "perfect crime." The fans of William H. Macy will enjoy "A Slight Case Of Murder", as well as those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities. Add a well-synchronized comedy, and this is very similar to a good episode of "Columbo". Highly recommended - MERK
