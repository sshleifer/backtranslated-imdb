A bright and sensitive film with interwoven weft lines. As a general warning, the movie becomes quite dark in half. As sudden as it is, this is a change that seems appropriate to the themes of the film, particularly the comparison of the Ishkanani with the disgustingly rich, and (as Finn says at the end) how each person forms the tribe, and how the tribe Whole is reflected in each person. <br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin (Finn Earl) is spectacular in this movie. He's probably better known as Chekov of Star Trek or Kyle Reese in Terminator Salvation, but he's been in a lot of movies you've probably never heard of (Alpha Dog, which is another brilliant performance by Yelchin, House of D, Hearts in Atlantis, to name a few ...) The point is that this guy really takes this movie and makes it his. Other excellent performances by Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland are what take this film to a higher level, from excellent to excellent.
