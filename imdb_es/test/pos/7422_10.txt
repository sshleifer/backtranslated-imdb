terry and june in my mind, it is an all-time classic, along with the ranks bless this house with the late Sid James and the late Diana Coupland, but sadly Terry Scott will be missed, although he died in 1994. I have all the DVD to the press and I hope to get all 9, it would also be good to see "happy after ever" released on DVD <br /> <br /> June Whitfield is still going strong and Terry Scott will always live in my memory <br /> < br /> terry scott rip today there are not many comedies I can think of that will remain on the list of legends and yes, the middle part of the middle class gets into some people's wicks, but I do not care, I think it would be Great to see some celebration of the life of Terry Scott
