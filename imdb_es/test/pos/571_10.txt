I do not need to say much about how good this documentary is, it's really an incredible piece of true narrative. The story is quite simple: a young adult Caucasian is murdered by a young black man in Florida, and the child who is arrested is abused and tried only with the public defender and his family on his side. It is very exciting, and the public defender is a pleasure to see it in all its human forms; you can not avoid the triumph of justice, and the end fulfills more than one would expect from a real story. <Br /> <br /> It's a pity that more people have not seen this documentary, but I hope you find a way to see it. For those interested in race relations in the United States, and the actual functioning of the law enforcement and legal process, it is worth your time and effort to find this documentary. I give it a 10.
