Ok, I'm Italian but there are not as many Italian films as this one. I think the plot is very good for 3/4 of the movie, but the ending is too simple, too predictable. But it is the only small mistake. The Consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and a great soundtrack. I would very much like the lighting work on it. The best of all is a great, great actor. You know, if your name was Al Pacino now everyone would have been talking about this performance. But he's just a great Italian theater actor named Toni Servillo. Yes, someone tells me that this movie and this kind of acting is too slow, it's so boring, so many silences, but I think this is fantastic, it's the correct way to describe the love story between a very talented young woman, the Granddaughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnani, Olivia and the mysterious old Toni. One of my favorite Italian films.
