I have been a fan of the Larry King show for a while, I think he does an excellent job in general and I do not think he faints, as many people seem to believe. He is a subtle scorpion, he gets excited when he needs it, just as he did the night before with Paris Hilton, during his first post-prison television interview. <br /> <br /> What happens with this whole case, what really surprised me is that Hilton apparently still has no idea why Judge Sauer gave her what she believes was too hard a sentence ( and, what is more, he actually DID meet it). In all the time she was in jail, supposedly only 23 hours a day in her cell, never, in her mind, she rewound the events that led her to receive the sentence Judge Sauer considered appropriate to impose. He never realized that he could have caused a big warning signal when (1) he appeared late in the court for the original hearing and (2) proceeded to inform him, when he asked him if he did not know that his license had been suspended, did not receive the documents by mail, that "I have people who read those kinds of things for me"? <br /> <br /> During all the time he was in his cell, he never realized that this action (being late) and that statement, and most importantly, the attitude, the total indifference to the court The system and the law in general and her particular driving privileges that she showed, could have made Judge Sauer (sorry for the play on words) sour her. <br /> <br /> Last night, in the King program, after paying attention to how his traumatic experience has changed forever, how he has "learned" his lesson, he answered his question: "Do you think you have a deal? Crude? "with a resounding yes. And during the course of the conversation (if you can call it that), she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her. King asked, gently, more than once, if she does not feel that she creates the situations in her life in which she "finds" herself, to which she practically stared at him. Basically, she has the conscious belief that she has been a victim of this situation; She does not understand how she caused it, that day in court, for her arrogant attitude towards the judge. I feel that this is very sad, tragic, even considering Hilton's huge "role model" for some people, and makes everything she said last night about her so-called state of rehabilitation in the areas of complete and utter disorientation, the contradiction. and hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> During the course of the interview, Hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the Bible. At the end of the interview, King obtained important points by asking him what his favorite Bible passage was. He answered gropingly, perplexed, at his pathetic notes (not completely superficial visions, which he had read in the air as if he were Nelson Mandella or something like that) and finally growled: "I do not have a favorite passage." <br /> <br /> Judge Sauer, in my book, is a hero, and after last night, so is Larry King, for subtly exposing Hilton for what he really is.
