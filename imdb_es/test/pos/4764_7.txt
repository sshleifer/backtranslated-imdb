I do not like much "cops" movies, but this is supposedly a classic. When I found it cheap, I bought it and put it on a shelf, only to finally see it yesterday, and I LIKED IT! Now, you can have New York City, but as a setting for a movie like this, in the winter months, it's perfect. Roy Scheider is a member of a working group of the elite police called The Seven Ups, which are 5 guys who fight against covert crime. In an opening scene, they retrieve a shoebox full of money from an antique store by distracting thieves with a "bull in a china shop" routine. But that's just the beginning. It seems that there are two types, posing as policemen, who are kidnapping types of gangsters and holding them for ransom. Richard Lynch is one of those sordid handbags, and it's as creepy as ever. When one of the Seven Ups, posing as a limousine driver at a funeral, is blown up, hit and put in the trunk of a car, which then leads to one of the most exciting car chases I've ever seen. viewed . However, it's surprising how light traffic in New York City is for the chase scenes, but still this is quite surprising, since Scheider follows the two hijackers through what I guess is the Bronx and then to a toll highway and then, eventually, Scheider's car stops. in one of the most shocking endings of a chase scene I have witnessed. Anyway, since the policeman ends up dying, Scheider and his men are under suspicion because the police commissioner knows very little about his activities and wonders if THEY are about to kidnap mobsters, so, of course, this kind of thinking should be cut. in the cocoon and Scheider it is implacable to get to the bottom of things. In general, a decent police action / drama is not my thing, but I liked this one. Look for Joe Spinell (Maniac) in a small paper. 7 out of 10
