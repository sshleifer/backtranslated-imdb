Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon give to each other like a symphony in this anecdote of the story of a young woman who is condemned to life as the daughter of one of the craziest women you will ever meet. Sarandon has this ability, call her talent if you want, to play some of the most extravagant characters and bring her humanity to the forefront of any movie she makes. As the mother of this obviously bright and silent girl beyond her years, the young Sarandon alternates between being the mother and being the girl with the ease of a ballet dancer. The most important thing is that he does it with force and flash without trampling all Portman's portrait of the daughter. The question is always asked when we deconstruct the plot of the film, who changes? This movie is certainly about the daughter, but if you look closely at the dreams and sacrifices that makes mom understand you change according to her daughter. I am willing to bet that this also makes us change everyone in the audience. The seal of good drama.
