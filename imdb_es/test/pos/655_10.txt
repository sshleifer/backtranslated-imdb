This movie was bombed at the box office and in the voting here, but I loved it. A measure of the value of a movie is the amount you can still remember after 25 years. I will not bore you with a list, but there are dozens of deeply comedic scenes, also a good story and a great casting. The inept thieves are hilarious. See it and judge if it ever reaches traditional Chinese medicine.
