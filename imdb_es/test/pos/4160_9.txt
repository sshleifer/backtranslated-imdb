This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be expected with respect to Italian cinema. It was something like 30 to 40 years that Italian cinema did not create a work of art of this size. This is an absolutely contemporary film that can also be considered at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, without needing to mention any names. And, finally, this is also a great production by Italian standards of the time. In this film there is a rare balance of different elements, all understandable and pleasant in different levels of fruition. Real poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. Without rhetoric, without simple surrealist shortcuts, without typical images of Tornatore, typical of tourism, without excess of action, without self-referentiality of directors. There is also a great use of two heartbreaking songs by Nina Simone, whose music, I think has never been used properly for a score. So, if this will not be a true revitalization for the Italian cinema, it is an extraordinary evolution for Emanuele Crialese after his 'Respiro', another beautiful definitive film. You should not miss 'Nuovomondo', it's that kind of 'medicine movie' useful to enjoy the creation of movies, watch movies, useful to enjoy and understand life. Francesco goats
