This film changed the art of making movies, telling a complex story in a new and powerful way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, interspersing a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolor smoke. The film uses music not as a score placed later, but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers, radios, etc. Coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration, takes scenes and characters and puts them in completely different environments. That is a difficult and courageous thing to do. Then take a superstar, Brando, pay him a fortune and film him so you can barely see his face. The pure guts that such movement requires are amazing and work beautifully. This movie belongs to the top ten.
