What a wonderful movie, full of eccentric and unique characters that are performed wonderfully by a great cast. The director also did a great job keeping the story together, getting those wonderful performances (by not playing with them) and using the music (and what wonderful music it is) for a great effect. S. Epatha in the main role is great. I had always heard how great the theater actress is, and although I enjoyed her in Law and Order, this really shows what she can do with a complex and complete role. Macy Gray is great, Mos Def, as always, wonderful. Lou Gossett, great. Jimmy Smits, excellent, and does not try to concentrate because he is a star. A true piece of acting ensemble. <br /> <br /> Rent it, enjoy it, move and keep it. Something special.
