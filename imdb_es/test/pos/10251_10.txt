The film was very good when it came out, I attended Cooley High and Cooley center grade, around 1968 it was also my queen and I grew up and lived in the Cabrini Greens area, I knew many people in the movie, it was nice to see friends in the movie that also lived in the area, and had the opportunity to be a star that may have been a unique experience in life for them, I had good times growing up on the north side and difficult times where I can relate to the movie Cooley High It is no longer standing, but a person like me and others still remember the fun we had when attending Cooley High, there is a lot of history in this area on the north side to tell.
