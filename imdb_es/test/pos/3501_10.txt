What happens with Ali G is that he takes the mica of himself and his character. <br /> <br /> Humor is a 'I like or love' brand of a totally politically incorrect, irreverent and modest type. <br /> <br /> I personally love this movie, and so it has everyone I've met who has seen it. You can see it several times and collect new gags each time. Humor is both auditory and visual, and time is impeccable. The humor is probably very English, and specifically London, so it is possible that viewers who are not in English do not have some humor. Think of yourself as a teenager and you'll love it, especially if you liked Kevin and Perry Go Large!
