When I saw Gone with the Wind, I thought there could be no better actors than Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable to play Scarlett and Rhett, but then I saw the movie Scarlet. I fell in love with this dramatic story. I love Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler, it's fantastic. This is a movie that I could watch a thousand times and I still would not get bored.
