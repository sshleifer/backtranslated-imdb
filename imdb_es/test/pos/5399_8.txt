Imaginary Heroes, the extraordinary work of Dan Harris, 24 years old, has the label "People are never what they seem to be". Perhaps this is wisely chosen as a marketing ploy; However, I rented this movie in spite of the tag line, instead of because of it. And I'm glad I did. I found the movement an insightful examination of the tragedy. Personally, it seemed like a movie about how to cope with dreams: particularly those that get lost. In the case of a child, the "loss" requires a thorough examination of what he had and did not have in his life. However, the central tragedy of the film, while raising attractive questions for itself, acts primarily as the backdrop in which the different coping styles are highlighted. I think the film explores an important question: how do we face our dreams, particularly when heroes become imaginary?
