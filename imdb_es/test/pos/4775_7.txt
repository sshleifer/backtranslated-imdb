'Steamboat Willie (1928)' is often misrepresented as the first Mickey Mouse movie, although that title actually goes to 'Plane Crazy (1928)'. The source that feeds this common error is probably an episode of "The Simpsons", which locates the origin of Itchy the Mouse in a 1928 short film called 'Steamboat Itchy', obviously a parody of this caricature. Interestingly, 'Steamboat Willie' was in itself a parody, falsifying Buster Keaton's latest release, 'Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928)', although the connection extends little beyond the title and general configuration of the story. In this Walt Disney short, Mickey Mouse takes charge of a river steamboat, to the chagrin of Captain Pete, the cat, who nevertheless throws it aside. But Mickey must not be overcome in evil. Far from the pleasant and healthy Mickey enjoyed by the most recent generations, this little mouse only cares about the number one, inflicting pain and disgust on a series of farm animals in order to provide music for their own fun. <br /> <br /> First there is the laughing parrot, who takes care of a bucket and a big potato on his head. Then a goat is dragged by the tail to provide music ("Turkey in the Straw") of a guitar that has swallowed. A cat is twirled around its tail, a goose strangled around its throat, and a sucker maliciously kicked. For a children's cartoon, 'Steamboat Willie', directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, certainly has a bit of petty humor, although I also noticed similar (though not entirely) elements in some later Disney films, such as' Gulliver Mickey (1934). ). Let's not forget Minnie Mouse, of course, that she undergoes a treatment for which she could sue today for sexual harassment! The jokes can be crude and the animation maybe even more, but this cartoon offers a lot of laughter, and it's easy to see why this little rodent became one of the most beloved characters in film history. If you are a fan of Mickey Mouse, or Disney in general, this is a steamboat that you can not miss.
