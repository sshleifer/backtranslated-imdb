I saw (unfortunately) the version dubbed in Encore. <br /> <br /> The student Paula Henning (Franka Potente who was also in the favorite cult "Run Lola Run") stars as a serious medical student who enters a prestigious school in Germany. But soon he discovers that some students disappear and the bodies in which they work in the anatomy lab are incredibly fresh ... <br /> <br /> I got stuck when I saw the version dubbed in Encore. It hurt a lot (the words that did not match the lips became annoying very quickly) but I still liked what I saw. The performance was good, it was photographed beautifully, it was not SO disgusting and I never got bored. Even more refreshing was a nice heroine who counterattacks when the bad guys go after her. The (light) nudity was, in a refreshing, masculine twist! An earlier poster mentions that Benno Furmann (who is excellent) showed his ass but I do not remember having seen him. In any case, this is a well done, scary and excellent thriller. Of all that I have read, the original German version is the best (I do not doubt it for a second), but the folded version is visible. I give this one a 7.
