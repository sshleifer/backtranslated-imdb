When I saw this movie, the first thing that caught my attention was the performance of Kelly Overton, a young actress (and star and star to come) that I saw for the first time that left me speechless. It's amazing on the screen and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the future holds ... <br /> <br /> The movie itself was good in that it let Kelly Overton do his things and take away to wiever for a walk ... not much new though I had the feeling that I had seen it all before ... but a good experience :) I would recommend this movie ... even if it was just to see Kelly Overton ... this theater actor takes the screen by storm ... I give this movie a vote of 7 ... 5 for the acting and 2 for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> And on one last note ... sorry for my bad English ... if this is silly for You: Please ignore me ...
