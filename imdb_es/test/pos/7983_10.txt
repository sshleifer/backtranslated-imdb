Batman Returns is more gothic and grim than its predecessor, and I like it a lot. In addition, the landscape is darker, and the whole atmosphere is sad along with the spooky music composed by the talented Danny Elfman. <br /> <br /> However, I did not like the idea of ​​making the Penguin, a monster, unlike comics, where it is human. Even if he looks like a monster, he shows well that he has a human dignity, and I felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his last parents. But still, he was a dangerous villain, and he had to be stopped. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton did a "tour de force" with his return as the Dark Knight, and this time is as powerful as in The Original Batman. It's not hard to understand why Batman is called in public sometimes ... <br /> <br /> Also, Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and well-adjusted in her role, and gave a faithful performance as the villain / fighter of the crime. dressed like a cat. Actually, the actors did a masterful work with Batman Returns, which turned it into a successful movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked Batman, watch his incredible sequel, as it is very valuable to all the hard core of Dark Knight lovers. <br /> <br /> Steve Baillargeon
