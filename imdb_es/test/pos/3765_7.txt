It took me a while to find this movie because they do not have it on DVD yet (and my VCR is not worth connecting again). I guess all references to drug use is too much for some people. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is delayed. It is a slap in the vein of "Airplane". I must say that when I saw it on Showtime or Spotlight while growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed humor more than now. But it's definitely worth seeing just to see what they (ie, the filmmakers) could escape before the hypocrites "Just Say No" unleashed their propaganda. sing ... "We are all in drugs" hahaha. It's a silly movie and it's worth the $ 10 that I paid from Ebay to get it on DVD. Do not even think about comparing it with the original one. That is simply stupid. What are you high?
