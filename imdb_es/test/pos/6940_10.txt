The first time I saw this docudrama in the UK was in the 1980s, and I found myself intrigued and then amazed at how those good intentions could go so wrong. The previous commentators (who are Australian) have explained the details of the plot that are developing better than I could do, but I would like to comment on what may be behind the "sovereign power of the United Kingdom" of the General Governors. . All modern laws, as I understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root to exist in the first place and become a law. That being the case, and if the Conner / Khemlani disaster had possibly been created (how many entrepreneurs / millionaires had been served by Khemlani, presumably without complaining), then the Labor government could have been the victim of 'entrapment', which surely he should have been investigated by the Governor General until he could see that the budget stalemate was a genuine result of Whitlam's irresponsibility, and NOT the elaborate trap, sponsored by "person or unknown person"! If this is the case, Kerr did not have to refer to the law because the fiscal circumstances prevail above all, then the "real power" limits the unreason; The implications in any Commonwealth country is that the 'fiscal' rules literally, and that any person or organization has Carte Blanche to break any other rule, physical or mental, provided they have ultimate control over the purse strings.
