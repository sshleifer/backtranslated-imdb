'Toy Soldiers' is the story of five maladjusted children (including Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton and Kieth Coogan) who try to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the US government imprisons the father of the leader. Lou Gosset Jr. plays the headmaster of the school, a stubborn man who tries to instill a sense of discipline in his students. <br /> <br /> 'Toy Soldiers' is a fun and pretty cool action, and certainly better. From hostage films in crisis at school. I think most of the appeal comes from the cast of teenagers, but also, terrorists do not become completely useless while in some movies, they never seem to be the intimidating group they should be. Trapped in the boarding school, and threatened with being killed if the army or police interfere, this is a formidable challenge for these groups of men who plan to save the school. Actually, they are also very smart about it. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that it was a pretty good movie. He keeps a steady rhythm and does not get ridiculously sentimental or anything like that. Astin and Gosset Jr. give good performances. <br /> <br /> I also agree that this is an underestimated action movie.
