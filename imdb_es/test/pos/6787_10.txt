Woohoo! What a beautiful, warm, rural film! The story centers on My Taylor (Mickey Rooney), a young vagabond, whose journey takes him to a quiet coastal rural town. There he stays with the Brown family. Velvet (Liz Taylor), her youngest daughter, to whom My kindly befriends, loves horses and wins one at auction. This horse is a beautiful garnet stallion; referred by its previous owner as a 'murderous pirate', but Velvet gives Foot a new name. Not much later, Velvet suggests entering him in the Grand National race, Mi and his family are against the idea, but will soon agree and Velvet and Mi started training him for Britain's most famous horse race ? This movie is a beautiful example of how British films are. I remember seeing it for the first time when I was eight years old and on my summer vacation. Did my parents record it on television and heat it up instantly? I saw him almost every day instead of the large collection of Disney movies he had. <br /> <br /> I think it was one of the first Liz Taylor movies and a good one! Is your character naive but sweet? his performance is extremely convincing, especially when he portrays his love for horses. It is also a good opportunity to see Angela Lansbury in one of her first roles; who co-stars as Velvet's older sister, who spends most of the time in the movie getting hit with a guy in town! I must say that she was a beautiful lady when she was younger. Pretty blond hair and pink face. Although it does not have an important part in the film, it has several scenes, so do not disappoint your fans! Parents reading this, should I emphasize? If you can get a copy of this please do it! If they are children, do they love animals? I suggest you show it to her! You may find some boring scenes, but you see Velvet riding the horse many times throughout the film and would entertain the children in a more challenging way! A charming and nostalgic movie. I could go now and put it on!
