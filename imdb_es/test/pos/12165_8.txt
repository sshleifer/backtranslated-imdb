After 10 presentations in 20 years, I also think that this was the best effort of Crazy Gang in the film, with more cohesion in the plot than his next best, "Alf's Button Afloat". In fact, they were a crazy trio of double acts that were thrown together on stage, sometimes in front of royalty, until Chesney Allen retired in the 1940s through "bad health". He survived them all for years. Apparently, they were just as crazy out of "work," joking regularly. <br /> <br /> The group of the Six Wonderland Wonder goes to the movie "I'm going to get it to tell me" (Alaska) dig in search of the gold that was being found there. It seemed like a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because they had been there. When they arrived at Red Gulch, they found that their information was out of date in just 40 years. They thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper that they had read had a strange taste. But by then it does not matter, since everyone has fallen in love with Snow White and they want to help their grandfather to find his loss of lost gold. Baddie Bill "M" McGrew wants it though. <br /> <br /> The number of verbal and visual word games is amazing, but most of them will probably only make sense (?) For British and expats interested in watching British comedies of b & w's 30 years. Almost all gags and routines work, including the Gold If pattern between Bud & Chesney and the pastiche "Whistle While You Work", including the Mountie insertions "Always Getting Our Man". A wonderful little movie, in a quite tired but absolutely recommended condition.
