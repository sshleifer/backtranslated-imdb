I could not have come from a different country or from a different time. This movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced by the Italian cinema of the late sixties. So, pseudo serious and sexually free. Sumptuous settings and dream music make this a visual and auditory pleasure. In addition, we get the lovely Dagmar Lassander, surely with its most elegant appearance. The comings and goings in progress make it a wild trip and if the antics in the middle of the Mimosa towards the end seem too long, it is just another quite charming feature of the time. Probably you were expected to deliver those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and, of course, this announces a turnaround in the procedures. It could have been better if Philippe Leroy did not look so strange with his frayed red hair and his twisted facial expression. However, she does well and has many moments of silence in which Dagmar is enjoying and has to show a mixture of love and hate. It is not an ordinary narrative film in any way, but for those who like something different, this is certainly that.
