The adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll story is much better than you might expect. Here, Alice is a virginal librarian who falls through the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own image. Done at the time when adult films were creative efforts with plots rather than just a series of sex scenes, this is a small movie that looks more like the low budget movies of its time. Despite what you may think, this movie has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. It is a naughty story for adults. If you're wondering whether my recommendation is good or not, consider that the movie was practically available only in its non-hardcore version for most of the last three decades, simply because the film remains firm on the subject. , which is how I saw the film for the first time on cable television. The relatively recent release of a home video on DVD restored sex (in horribly grainy inserted clips) that makes it clear that the elimination of shots was the best option. If you're an open-minded adult with a taste for something spicy, I recommend this little movie as good fun.
