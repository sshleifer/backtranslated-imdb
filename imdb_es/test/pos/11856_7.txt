Sophisticated sexual comedies are always difficult to achieve. Watch the films of Blake Edwards, who is possibly the master of the genre, and find as many faults as successes. Because, if a movie of this nature never works, you can never resort to the toilet humor of a teen sex comedy [ie, "American Pie"], or warm up the audience with the sentimentality of a romantic comedy [ie, Toda the career of Julia Roberts]. He can only maintain an impulse until the end, and hope that the audience can appreciate the almost necessary irony of his resolution. <br /> <br /> Written by the team consisting of husband / wife Wally Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, "Seeing other people" opens with the engaged couple Ed and Alice [Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson] just seconds away from the back of the car in front of you. As the frame freezes, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. From here on, we welcome that the story that will be developed will have a point of view of both sexes. <br /> <br /> Two months before their vows, Ed and Alice already look and act like an elderly couple. . In an early scene in the bathroom, only their actions show us how comfortable they are with each other and how long they have been together. Then, when the line to propel the plot is pronounced forward, as is to be expected from the less probable of the two, it is as if the same relationship required a change, even if that means its own destruction. <br /> <br /> Once all the basic rules are established [Ed can not sleep with his mother or, for that matter, Salma Hayek], the two are heading in separate directions in the hope of finding a sex without meaning to strengthen your relationship. At first, everything seems to go according to plan, since your daily appointments only help ignite the passion between them. But as expected, as the deepest emotions of repentance and jealousy begin to emerge, they soon find themselves more and more separated and on the verge of breaking up. All these actions lead to a resolution that you may like or not, depending on your own degree of cynicism. <br /> <br /> For a comedy like this, you need a solid cast with supporting characters as strong as you carry them. And director Wolodarsky does not disappoint. Here he has chosen two of my favorite actresses as sisters, Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham, and allows them to play with their strengths. For Nicholson, who has always reminded me of a young Shirley MacLaine, she gives Alice an air of naivety and vulnerability even when her actions seem less than that. And as for Graham, an actress who has proven she can outperform a complete set of the Howard Hawks, steals every scene in which she encounters a cutting-edge "non-BS" character. <br /> <br /> As for the guys, Jay Mohr is useful here as Josh Charles. Byron Cranston, from "Malcolm in the Middle", has to be applauded for adopting a British accent and letting everything go well. But the real pleasure here is Andy Richter and his subplot with the single mom, Helen Slater. Although their scenes almost seem to belong to another movie, they are by far the most entertaining, and their distribution of informal works steals the show. <br /> <br /> For an independent production, "Seeing Other People" has a more personal and introspective aspect. feeling - something that would be noticeably absent from a great Hollywood movie of this kind. Not to mention that this movie also has some really fun moments, unlike most Hollywood comedies in general. <br /> <br /> Ranking [in a 5 star system]: 3 1/2 stars
