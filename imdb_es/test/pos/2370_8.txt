This is a movie that should be taken in context. It should not be seen unless you've seen the first two movies, but the kind of people who watch this movie will probably own the box, or at least meet someone who sees it. And you should not go waiting for Blade Runner; the budget of the films does not go that far, and it's a much more crazy trip. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the film is a science fiction set in the future Yokohama (filmed in Hong Kong as is obvious) about a society where it is illegal to procreate. Sho Aikawa takes on a similar role as Dead or Alive 2 and Riki Takeuchi is a detective for the birth control police. Takashi Miike is not someone who gives all his reasons on a tray, but it can be assumed that the law on procreation (imposed by the pill on people) is there because of overpopulation, increased lifespan, etc. Interestingly, the dialogue in the film is mainly Cantonese, while Sho and Riki (who play their roles, as always, brilliantly) speak Japanese, and some speak English. People have criticized the English for being wooden, but I found no problems with that. In addition, another person found that the themes of homosexuality throughout the film were offensive; He said that Takashi Miike was anti-homosexual. It may very well be (and not all artists have to be left), but I can not see this movie as an insult to homosexuals. It simply returns the philosophies of ancient Greece when homo or bisexuality were more common. The film contains similar proportions of action-packed and poignant moments for DoA 2, although in this film the action is based more on martial arts and is done in a very good Hong Kong style. The cinematography of the film is very pleasing to the eye, with symmetrical shots, good color control to give the air a polluted look, and it's nice to see long, uncut shots that are so rare in Hollywood these days. Basically, there are many things that I like in this movie: good sense of humor, exciting action and some very beautiful moments. It's a great ending to the series. You could criticize him for being a bit corny, but is not that part of the charm?
