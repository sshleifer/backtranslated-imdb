The first time I saw this movie, I wanted to like it for many reasons, but I just did not like it. It just seemed a bit boring. But there was a little question I had about something I saw near the beginning of the movie, so I saw it again? and then finally he clicked for me. The first time I saw the movie was knowing the "surprise ending", and although I would definitely not recommend that the ending be ruined for you, I still enjoy much of the film and discovered the many seemingly insignificant events that everyone explains to us. a very sinister scheme. <br /> <br /> I do not think everyone likes this movie, they do not even like it. If you like any of the actors, you will like this movie because the performance is quite strong and everyone has a lot of screen time. If you like mysteries (that is, Hitchcock) you will like this movie. If you like independent or psychological films, you will like this movie. It really worked for me on all those levels. If you do not like actors, mysterious plots or psychological elements, you may not like this movie. But that is your loss. Personally, the only thing that bothered me a little were the accents. Nice try, Alan Rickman, in the American dialect, but it was not a big improvement over the Die Hard scene. (However, the wonderful voice compensates for the strange accent.) The combination of accents in the movie was a bit strange, but it did not distract so much that it became difficult or particularly irritating. Also, the change of camera from scene to scene was evident and could annoy some people, but actually I think it was added to the scenes (or scene? I can only really remember one scene in which the change was very different, but it worked ). <br /> <br /> When you see this movie, watch it at least twice. The second time you see it, I hope you realize how intricate the plot really is. Every time I watch this movie (it's less than an hour and a half, so it's not hard to see it several times) I seem to notice something else and I ask myself: "Why did that happen?" or "was that intentional?" I like movies that make me think. This he does. So just see it. Twice.
