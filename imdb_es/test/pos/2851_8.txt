If only I had seen the poster of Nurse Betty, I probably would not have touched it with a ten foot stick. But after listening to a positive buzz, and knowing that it made noise in Cannes, I decided to try it. What I got is a really nice movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as Nurse Betty, a woman who is sent to a delirious psychotic episode after a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and I was pleasantly surprised by the comedian Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> The film continually bounces between comedy, drama, romance and suspense. However, despite this apparent identity crisis, it remains pretty good. I found my eyes glued to the screen from start to finish, always waiting for the next turn in the story. The whole cast is strong, if not spectacular. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who splashed a few years ago with the awesome and dark in the Company of Men) relied too much on many cliche Hollywood conventions. The creative musical effects of humor that crammed us in the throats during each love scene were unbearable! And he did the old standard: "Let's take some of the minor characters and match them in the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance", just to make sure everyone goes home with a smile on their faces. Why should directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots? <br /> <br /> But the movie is still too pleasant to be dragged by these annoying irritations. In a very mediocre year for movies, 'Nurse Betty' ranks as one of the most pleasant surprises of 2000. 8 out of 10.
