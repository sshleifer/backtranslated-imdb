<br /> <br /> Very good movie of the 70s about mafia operations in New Jersey. When a "non-conformist" gang member does not play by the rules of the neighborhood, sooner or later, it's time for elimination. <br /> <br /> Joe Pesci was faithful to his character, soft and funny. He only improves with age. His face and current fame should not have been used on the cover of the DVD to sell this "B" grade film, since it was only the third star billed. <br /> <br /> Dated wide lapel shirts printed in the 1970s and lower quality backgrounds Music makes a distraction. It's good to see the great cars of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> However, the acting is good. <br /> <br /> The nudity on the part of Anne Johns was not necessary to make this mafia story work. And, she does not appear in the database as each performance again in any movie other than this one. Too; She did a good job! <br /> <br /> Moral of the story: Do not let your "Don" get mad at you. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something different when you wake up In the middle of the night, check out this DVD. It was part of a special DVD of three movies in one $ 5.88 at the local discount store. <br /> <br />
