In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to drive their caravan to the San Juan River. Along the trip, they find first the broken car without water of the curandero Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutas Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then, the sadistic bandits of the Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol led by the Crystal City Sheriff who is chasing them. When the Navajos cross their path, they are invited to visit their village for a dance party. When the wagon train is near its destination, the Clegg boys threaten the settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to adopt an attitude. <br /> <br /> "Wagon Master" is another great west of John Ford. The sequences with the wagon train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. The group of Mormons adventure is fun and very entertaining and the songs adapt well to the plot despite being dated. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Caravana dos Bravos" ("Caravan of the Braves")
