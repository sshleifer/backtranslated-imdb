This movie, Blade Master, can be cheap, awkward looking and sometimes it is, but shares thoughts about problems that are beyond the time when this film is developed. Ator is the chosen one who has to protect the earth against a terrible weapon, which is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the atomic weapon. It goes through obstacles like an ingenious character that is only something more than muscular strength, although it has enough is a lot. I would say that this aspect of the film makes it surpass a film like Conan, the barbarian, which is the least I can say, quite foolish. It does not diminish in any way the great adventure film that is Conan, but it gives Ator the happiness it shares with the barbarian. For a lower budget movie, this movie works well in terms of setting and the fights are credible most of the time. Zor, the villain, has imprisoned throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontations that give tension to the film, even if Ator seems too suitable for the task. <br /> <br /> What gives this movie a little more extra are those scenes that may seem extravagant, but worth mentioning. The fight with the serpent god, although it is a gigantic puppet, is handled well like the snake, with good lightning, it is still a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. The film reaches its climax in a very unusual, rather anachronistic, but impressive way: the deltaplane sequence. The scene itself is not presented correctly, it is not read at all, where Ator got that machine, it is quite unconvincing, but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful flight sequence, which is the highlight of the film, elevating Ator in A place where few human fantasy heroes have been. <br /> <br /> If Blade Master is not among the great fantastic films of all time, it is not a surprise because of its shortcomings, it is a major surprise, considering the philosophical form that it chooses over the confrontation between Good and evil, the truth. Talk and the heart shows, that this movie is so dissatisfied. I suggest it for all fans of the genre and try to take it seriously as an intelligent film that should be taken more seriously than it seems.
