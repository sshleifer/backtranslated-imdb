There are many people who put these type 80 movies, but it is possible that these people have not reached the age of majority during this time. I was just starting college when this movie was released, so I could really appreciate it at that time and my friends and I, to this day, joke occasionally about certain lines of the film. As much as I liked the character of Sean Penn, Jeff Spicoli in "Fast Times", I actually enjoy more of Chris Penn's "Tommy" character because he is the main character with more than one real discourse as opposed to just one series. of liners like Spicoli. Chris Penn should probably put this movie on his VCR and use it as a motivation to lose weight. Yes, the secondary plot with the veteran character of Randy Quaid, Vietnam seems a little out of place, but he does a convincing job on paper. If there is someone out there who has not seen this movie, but he liked other similar movies, like "Fast Times", etc. I highly recommend it.
