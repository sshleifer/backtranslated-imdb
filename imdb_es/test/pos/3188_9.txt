This is a very sweet movie of coming of age, very funny, and Russell Crowe is amazing! Those who know him only from Gladiator will be surprised to see the range of his abilities to act. Arthur Baskin (his character) is one of the best screen nerd virgins I've seen1 Watch this movie: how can we re-release it in NTSC format? <br /> <br />
