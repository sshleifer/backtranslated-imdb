In this era in which almost everything appears on DVD (I hope to see the collection My Mother the Car any day), this film has been unfairly neglected. There are countless stupid comedies from the 60s, as well as many other times that have received at least a superficial DVD treatment. As far as I know, this was not released on VHS, despite the talents involved in the creation (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman on his debut ). Obviously, it is a product of the sixties, but so is almost everything else of that time. All films reflect the tastes and customs of the times in which they are made. This was released the same year as The President's Analyst, another absurd masterpiece. That movie was finally released on DVD and has developed a cult following. This movie has many extravagant, bizarre and extravagant moments. Sure, it's painted roughly and has silly go-go music, but that's part of its charm. Create your own absurd universe. If whoever is in charge of the production of DVDs for the Columbia Pictures releases (I think Columbia launched it) makes the ballot boxes for the new releases, this takes my vote.
