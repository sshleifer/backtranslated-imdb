Ah! When good actors acquire bland material! If you are thinking of this movie as a strict police thriller, you may feel disappointed. While the situations are very true to life, the plot progresses at a very predictable pace and can be seen quite well before the actors take it there. Many of the criminals and secondary figures are really moving stereotypes. Much of the dialogue is simply silly. <br /> <br /> But! If you love watching the good actors rise above this type of material and do something with it, then you will LOVE this movie. Sam Elliott is nothing short of brilliant in making Detective Falon's one-note character come alive and deep. Those of you who have never seen Elliott express themselves far beyond their usual frowning stoic postures will be thrilled with the range of emotions that this film represents. And also, in his first fifty years in this movie, he looks fantastic! His bare-chested scene gives hope to middle-aged men everywhere! Esai Morales does a wonderful job elevating her role as Det. The anxious beaver of Falon is a new police companion. He could easily have played like a Robin in Elliott's Batman, but instead, he gave authenticity and passion to this role. He makes it work despite some of the lame lines he has to say. <br /> <br /> Paul Sorvino is fun to watch! He plays the eccentric police captain. It seems that he knows that he is crawling in this movie and that he is having a great time. He also makes it fun for us. <br /> <br /> This movie is very successful in the plot but it makes up for it with excellent performances! Sam Elliott fans should definitely get this one, as it is a blow to see him spread his wings and do much more than he is usually allowed to do!
