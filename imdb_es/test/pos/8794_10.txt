This movie is too good for words. It is incredibly great, fun and true to life. Simply by seeing this, it is known that the person who wrote it felt DEFIANTLY the way Jip and his friends do it through the film. At some point it was my life and I hoped to return home to see Human Traffic all night before I could even think about going to bed. I think you fall in love with the characters and their lifestyle. Of course, this film would not be for older people more or less than 16 to 22 years, I suppose. There is definitely nothing wrong with this movie and it will get you all the way. It does not have a particular history to it. The general idea is a weekend in the lives of older teenagers in London and what they do. The places they go to, the people they know, the drugs they take and the experiences they have. You have to get this movie on DVD, it does not matter just by looking at it, you have to have it!
