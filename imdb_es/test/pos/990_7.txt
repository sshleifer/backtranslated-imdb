Although I am very familiar with the poet Dylan Thomas, I do not know anything about his life. Whatever your life and specifically your marriage involved, I imagine that The Edge of Love (based on the novel) manipulates things a bit, but unless you are a historian or a poet, who cares. <br /> <br /> The movie is less about Thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life. One is his wife Kathrine, and the other is Vera, who was his first love. A romantic night on the beach as young people is something that both have tried to leave behind, but they can not, now that they are adults, they are good friends. I forgot to mention that this is established during the war. Vera is committed to Captain Will Killing, who leaves her pregnant and goes to war. While he is away, Vera begins to fall in love with Thomas again, and Kathrine has fallen in love with him. She is also carrying another man's son. Things get even more emotionally complex when Capt Killig comes back <br /> <br /> As you can see, it's a very soapy operative plot, and it takes shape in a monotonous fairy way, with perhaps a too much sequence of sappy dialogue. But all is not lost yet. For a production other than Hollywood, I think that Edge of Love is as elegant an image as one can get. Undoubtedly, it is more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary romances, whether or not it is Hollywood production. Some of this has to do with being established during the war, which creates an emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial, a bit like the Atonement. This presents a performance and a cinematography of equal talent for Joe Wright's Oscar nominee, but he has a much greater need for stable rhythm and progression. Things are fine at the beginning and end, but the middle section is where you can assess your attention span, unless it is deeply ingrained in the story. <br /> <br /> I doubt that The Edge of Love has that kind of effect on the viewer, but it's a good movie to verify. It could even be a good movie for a nighttime date, considering that it is much smarter than the girl movies that the bride and groom are forced to endure today.
