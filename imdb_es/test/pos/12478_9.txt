The remastered black and white film "Quai des Orfevres" offers the products in spite of the romance, jealousy and marriage that seem to stand in the way of the truth of "who did it?" <br /> <br /> inch by inch, technique by technique according to experience and intuition, the patience of this master inspector delves into the truth, but, of course, with the help of a bag full of dirty tricks of police interrogation. <br /> <br /> Martineau is the centerpiece of this film.
