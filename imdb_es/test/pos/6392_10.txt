My wife and my children were and still are the best comedy series ever made on television. I really enjoyed it and everyone in the UK still sees the summaries. The Wayans brothers. Somehow everyone should be together in a comedy show? My wife and my children were a comedy that the whole family could see and you do not understand it very often. Is not there something we can do to make it happen again? Do whatever it takes for the comedy show to reappear! 1 Damon Wayans should return! I would really like Damon Wayans to star or do another comedy like this, of course, with the help of the entire Wayans family. I felt very sad when it ended like this and I hope there will be more in the future. Bright comedy, excellent things of yours truly, DezMo
