This movie is based on the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daunton Lee. This fascinating story takes place around the time of Whitlam's dismissal, in which during his time as a TRW employee, Christopher was aware of the classified correspondence that admitted the CIA's participation in Australian political and union circles. The film shows several scenes involving Gough Whitlam (broadcast on US television), where events are held that confirm the classified documents that Christopher had previously read. The dismissal of Gough Whitlam was an organized coup of the CIA. Elsewhere in the film, it was mentioned that most people have no idea of ​​the level of deception that occurs, ultimately, to ensure that the United States is used as a vehicle to promote certain policies at the behest of everyone else. In the current era, nothing has changed. <br /> <br /> Christopher's life was deeply affected, read, surprised, by his knowledge of what and how the CIA gives shape to foreign democracies, including the democracies of nations allied to the United States. Christopher reacted, probably not in the best way at the time, selling secret information to the Soviet Union with Daunton Lee as his exchange. Finally, Christopher and Daunton were captured and convicted of treason. <br /> <br /> On May 23, 1982, while serving time in a US prison. UU., Christopher Boyce accepted a single interview with Ray Martin of 60 Minutes Australia because it was The Australian Connection that affected him deeply. It caused a stir in the Australian media for about a week, then fell silent. <br /> <br /> I liked the symbolism of the hawk movie, and in it Chris was called Falcon and Daunton the Snowman (drug). connection), but in reality the title "Falcon" was not something used by Chris. <br /> <br /> Christopher Boyce: Criminal or man of conscience? It's up to you. <br /> <br /> Resources: http://www.playitforwardoz.com/boyce.html
