I did not have many aspirations for this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. A very well made film, very well cut, really does not reach the height that Human Traffic did, but it is a very good effort. Well directed, and I thought that the main actor had an excellent performance! In fact, the only really bad performance of the movie was that of Tim Curry, who is supposed to be the name. <br /> <br /> Cool Film was surprised that it has not done better than it has done. I had never heard of him until I saw him in a couple. <br /> <br /> I'm not a raver, but I guess these people are going to like this movie.
