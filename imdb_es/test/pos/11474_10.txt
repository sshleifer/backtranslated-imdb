It's fantastic! A sick and twisted story of coincidence and deception. <br /> <br /> History is constructed meticulously and ingeniously. It really is a perfect mix: it has suspense and humor, and the story is told with great originality ... The film is built like a puzzle that is assembled piece by piece and resolves the story ... For the viewer there are many surprises until the final !! I also had a small impression that the director has been inspired by some of Hitchcock's works. I've also seen movies before, in which you see that the same event happens from different points of view, but this movie goes further. In this film, everything is based on what happens to a body that appears and disappears and appears again in a different location. Each actor in the story has its own secret and we realize it in a way that helps to put the puzzle together ... I especially loved the scenes of black humor ... that made the whole theater laugh ... This movie It is a must for all!
