I had the intention of writing a review of this film for some time, but only now have I managed to express my thoughts for the reading of others. <br /> <br /> I never had the pleasure of watching this film on the "big screen", which is a shame, as it is often visually stunning, but I've seen it again in the video several times as over the years, enjoying it immensely every time. It's definitely on my personal list of favorite movies, and for more than the stars Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, two of my `actors to watch '. <br /> <br /> Maybe I really appreciate this movie because it appeals to my slightly off-centered taste in entertainment. I like my films a little to the left of the center, unpredictable and fresh. And whether you 'believe' or not the storyline of the movie, you must admit that it is different. <br /> <br /> Everyone has different tastes and opinions, but my impression of some of the negative reviews of this film is that the viewers never saw beyond the superficial level of this film. They were caught in technicalities: "Why would there be a green light in a meter?" or 'Why would medical students do such a stupid trick?' and he could not see the art and the psychological depth of the piece. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some medical and technical aspects that do not make logical sense, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief just a little, this can be a very attractive movie. <br /> <br /> First, a note about the artistic quality of the film. Some have complained about the dark lighting and the illogical nature of the sets, but for me, the use of innovative lighting techniques, plastic and sheet sets, unusual adjustments in old and wet buildings, drip tunnels, the use of statues. , rain and undulating curtains: all add a poetic flavor to this film, an unforgettable beauty that adapts to the dark nature of the questions that are asked about life, death and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I will focus on just two examples; In an alley scene, a change in lighting allows certain elements of the set to focus dramatically, and then fade once the lighting returns to normal. It is an innovative means to transmit a change in the "reality" of the moment, and works perfectly. We are also allowed to see the inside of the character's apartments: contrast the warm wood, the bright colors, the golden lighting and the overcrowded comfort of Labraccio's rooms with Nelson's austere white emptiness. Both are a reflection of the characters themselves. Nelson's lack of "objects" reflects our lack of knowledge about his past. and his carefully constructed mask that keeps his companions at a distance. His past, we come to learn, is one of chaos and conflict. He has decided to leave that behind in favor of an orderly vacuum. unfortunately, the emptiness also reflects his relationships with others, an accomplishment that he reaches throughout his personal journey of self-discovery in this film. <br /> <br /> Flatliners is not your typical horror movie. Nor is it a typical drama or a thriller. It is rather an amalgam of all, having the best elements of all genres intertwined in a complex and suspenseful plot. <br /> <br /> This is an ensemble piece, and the cast does an excellent job of bringing their individual characters to life. His immediate impression is that the characters are representative of a well-established 'stereotype': the female ice queen, the neurotic 'doctor', the playboy and the 'good boy' with social conscience, etc. However, as the film progresses the characters are more developed, they acquire multiple dimensions and depth. <br /> <br /> The most interesting of all is the character of Nelson de Sutherland. Nelson is not a character that is easy to please; In fact, it is a bit of a b ** tard, a master manipulator who definitely places self-interest above all else. However, Sutherland plays with a hint of insecurity that gives it some appeal. As the events unfold, you realize that much of Nelson's unpleasant personality is a smokescreen, a protective mask behind which lies an uncertain and vulnerable young man laden with a terrible secret. <br /> <br /> Revealing parts and pieces Of Nelson's complex personality throughout the film, writers, directors, and the cast take him gradually to greater understanding and sympathy for him. The character that started out as an "imbecile" becomes important and valued in its own right, as you learn to "forgive" your previous behavior in the light of new information. His journey of discovery with Nelson reflects the characters' own journeys to self-understanding, as they also realize that everyone has value, and "everything we do matters". <br /> <br /> What leads to my final comment. Although many of the posters here have taken up the challenge of defying death ... few seem to have touched what I see as the main premise of the film: the importance of forgiveness and the need to be aware of everything it does, because "it matters" <br /> <br />
