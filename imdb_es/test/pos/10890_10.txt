We have all played Halo and Socom and GTA and Resi, etc., but none of them can support GE007. The game itself is great. I literally burned my N64 playing this great game, along with Zelda OOT. This game only built the mold that is essential for all modern shooters. Besides that, the multiplayer is great. Story mode itself is worth playing hundreds of times and more. It is a great game for when your board and you just want to shoot some people and there are endless possibilities of unlocking. (Traps, Aztecs, Egyptians, God knows how many multiplayer players, and the three difficulties, as well as the famous difficulty '007') Our modern games are great, but when you sit and play, you have the feeling that few games more. I can give you. And with the online capabilities of the new shooting games, we rarely see these two old ones in two death-fighting games, and when we do it is not as good as these games. And when you get bored of the story, there are endless mysteries, faults and Easter eggs that you can find and take advantage of. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best shooting games of all time.
