The criminally ignored film by Jay Craven is a sober breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic world and derived from independent cinema. First of all, photography is pure aesthetic pleasure, capturing all the somber beauty of northern New England in the late fall (filmmaker Paul Ryan made the 2nd Unit in Malick's Sky Days). Second, the performances are uniformly excellent: Noel Lourdes from Rip Torn is irascibly charming and Tantoo Cardinal's Bangor is both sensitive and exuberant, not to mention an excellent cast. However, in general, it is a tribute to the narrative force of the film that the story maintains a strong and lively rhythm while still developing in its own time, and the film reaches a conclusion, natural and genuine, which however does not It seems expected. This is one of the rare cells of dignity in the independent film world, a film that explores a small part of the intersection between humans and history.
