I love this movie. Tense with great characters. The child of "Sandlot" is excellent like Corey Feldman. When children assault the bank, it is pure adrenaline. Inside the bank, it becomes a bit like a situation of "The Lord of the Flies" in which they face each other. Justin Walker from "Clueless" is wonderful. I saw this on "Showtime" while navigating the channel. It was a nice surprise. James Remar is also quite good here as the Sheriff of a small town. Taylor Nichols, whom I love as "Barcelona", also does a good job as a federal agent. I recommend this movie for any fan of bank robbery movies with many good characters. I was surprised to discover that Roger Corman was a producer of this, since the film is not a B movie
