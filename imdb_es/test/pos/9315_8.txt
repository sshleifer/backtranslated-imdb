I've heard a lot about Porno Holocaust and its twin movie Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead. Both films are interchangeable and filmed at the same time in the same place with the same actors changing clothes for each film (and removing them). If you are waiting for the genius D'Amato that is shown in movies like Buio Omega or Death Smiles on Murder, you will not find it here. However, this film has a charm that fans of exploitation can not resist. Where else will you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie / monster and his huge cock that strangles and chokes women? Only D'Amato. There is a certain amount of blood in which many of the men are beaten to death. The film is set in a beautiful tropical island. As far as I know, there is not a subtitled version, so if you do not speak Italian you will not know what's happening ... but who cares, right? In all honesty, Gore fans will probably move quickly through hardcore sex. And if someone is really seeing this just because of sex, they will surely be offended instantly. I can only imagine today's porn fans tracing D'Amato's exit and finding this atrocity! Of the two, it seems to me that Erotic Nights of the Living Dead is far superior. But, do not even bother to look if they're cut. Holocaust Porn is an extremely low budget as expected. Even the monster does not look as good as George Eastman's character in Anthropophagus. It's worth watching the movie to laugh and complete your search for the movie D'Amato.
