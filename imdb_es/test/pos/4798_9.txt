This film is a fascinating example of the narrative skills of Luis Bunuel. This is a comedy that is not a comedy, and a social drama that is not a social drama. Although I do not think it was particularly funny, it made me laugh. Also, despite the fact that you can never take Bunuel too seriously, the film made one think of religion and its importance in the lives of some people. Bunuel tells the story of a Catholic priest, dedicated to his faith like no one else, and the spectator witnesses what happens when the priest's unwavering commitment to serve others is put to the test. As usual, Bunuel's goal is Catholicism, but I do not think he would try to make fun of the church as he often does. At least I did not take the film as a mockery of the institution. I think he's trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in today's modern society. Not because faith in itself is bad, but because people always try to bastardize the concept. Separate message, I think this is one of the most intelligent works of Bunuel. Francisco Rabal is excellent as the priest. Definitely, one of the best films of the filmmaker.
