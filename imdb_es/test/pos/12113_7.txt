Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most imaginative silent film comedians (and one of the funniest). Why is it completely forgotten? Unfortunately, the original negatives of a large percentage of his films were lost when Fox's store burned down in the early 1930s. Hamilton was not handsome or funny like Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd; He was not as handsome as Raymond Griffith. And, unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton did not try to sympathize with the audience. <br /> <br /> However, their films were very popular at the time of their original release, and they are still fun today. Oscar Levant once claimed that he asked Chaplin if there was another comedian he once envied, and Chaplin immediately named Lloyd Hamilton. The character most frequently played by Hamilton on the screen, a flathead naff, with annoying hand gestures and a duck-like walk, was later adapted by vaudeville comedian Eddie Garr (Teri Garr's father), and more Adapted by Jackie Gleason as His TV character from the 1950s 'The Poor Soul'. <br /> <br /> 'The Movies', directed in a pseudonym by Roscoe Arbuckle, is one of Hamilton's most innovative shorts, and it's very funny. First we see him as a country boy, saying goodbye to his family outside his country house, on his way to the big city. Then he moves away from the cabin and we see he is IN the big city, with a booming traffic around him! <br /> <br /> Finally, our hero ends up in a restaurant (uncredited), but it's Caf√© Montmartre in downtown Los Angeles, where all the movie actors eat between takes.There's a funny joke when the character of Hamilton encounters three costumed and dressed actors like Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt: this gag would have been more fun if the imposters looked more like the originals, and finally, our boy sits at a table, expecting to meet a celebrity. Indeed, entering the restaurant and sitting at the next table is a great movie star ... nothing less than Lloyd Hamilton! There is a double exposure shot very well done (the combination is almost invisible) when Lloyd Hamilton as he himself greets to Lloyd Hamilton as the country boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hamilton's period of maximum creativity was very short ... He began his film career in slapsti movies ck raw as half of a double act (Ham and Bud, next to Bud Duncan), and had a brief and ardent period of stardom in shorts during the period of late silence. The sound films were not friendly with Hamilton, and he was quickly pushed down the list of actors in some of the first raw comments. Then he died young. Fortunately, 'The Movies' is quite fun, and a splendid introduction to this unique style of comedians. I will rate it 7 out of 10.
