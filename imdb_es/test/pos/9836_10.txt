This show is a show that is ideal for adults and children to sit together and watch. The stories are a bit slow for adults, but they are still good. There are many children in my family, boys and girls, and it is difficult to get everyone to agree on what to look for, but they always agree when they want to see the Mystic Knights. It's a wonderful show and I hope you continue doing it. All the children in my family and I think that Vincent Walsh is the best of all. We have seen that he has done many other jobs and we think he is doing a great job. We wish all the actors, actresses, writers, directors and producers the best of luck and we would like to tell them to continue with the good work.
