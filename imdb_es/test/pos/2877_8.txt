So the WWE has done it. They have turned to the cinema, the first is See No Evil, starring his own Kane. I caught this movie and went in without hoping it was a great movie ... It seemed like a clich√© and it did not seem like anything new. To my surprise, it was not really that bad. A viewer said earlier that it's a good B-horror movie, and honestly that's the best way to describe it. Now, the question I was asking was how Kane was going to stand ... Well, let's say he became a genius of the character of 'Jacob Goodnight'. He sold the paper really well, and it really looked threatening. But what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs about 320 in solid muscle? The acting was decent, and the story was nothing new, of course, but we all know it. The management, as well as the cinematography, did very well and the backdrop of the hotel really seemed in ruins and well done. Considering that this was directed by a porn film director, I was quite surprised. I recommend this movie if you are looking for gore and killing without sense and just a little fun in general. Think of this movie as a modern day on Friday the 13th of the movie. And it also saves space for the end, because it's a good idea. And stay after the credits too ...
