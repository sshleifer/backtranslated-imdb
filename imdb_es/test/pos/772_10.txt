A beautiful movie One that made me think of God but that I did not feel guilty or overwhelmed. It made me think about death but not fear it, think about life but not hide from it. A film that gave so much love for everything I defend and at the same time I condemned it to the deepest places of hell. A movie that made me think of love and everything I've lost, but no sadness adorned my eyes, for some strange reason, relief. A child of two worlds, god and theater. And a little wine and irony! I highly recommend ***** <br /> <br /> "When the S *** hits the fan, get a tent" Oh, and we should all go camping. Everyday.
