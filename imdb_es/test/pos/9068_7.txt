The story in this movie is quite unlikely to be a B-grade, but the script required a creepy guy to take the initiative, and in 1940, that meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is in his creepiest moment in this case as the island's owner, Stephen Danel, who has the prisoners under parole in custody to work in his island's diamond mine. Upon arrival, the detainees discover that they are slave workers who can be beaten or killed at the whim of Danel. <br /> <br /> Only two things seem to have it worse than the slaves; Danel's wife, and the monkeys. The monkeys make him so angry that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get. <br /> <br /> Lorre is perfect in his role here, and slides across the screen with an industrial strength. Although the script is not of the caliber of Casablanca, the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes. This is a very visible story, but I'm not sure what niche this movie occupies. Too long for a short subject, and too short for a feature film, I'm not sure how it was marketed in theaters. <br /> <br /> I just captured this for the first time a night or early. Morning shows of MTC. Lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they have not seen it.
