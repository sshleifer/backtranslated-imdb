I would like there to be a category to place this in another that is not Horror. It just is not. Of course it has its horrible moments, however, I do not think it's a horror movie. I will give that this movie could have been better. A million small things could have been changed to improve it. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I love this movie. I am often sad that people misunderstand the whole point. It was always clear to me that the objective of this movie was to say ... things are not always what they seem. Sometimes 'wrong', it is not. <br /> <br /> Barker was in a scam I went to and he talked a little and then he watched the movie. It was very interesting. Many things that I wanted to put in the movie could not be, and a part of the movie that I thought had been lost a long time ago was cut. This was a part that helped shed light on Boone and his girlfriend, as well as some other details. <br /> <br /> I know that some people resent having no more information about the whole "race" in the background. However, I always felt that it gave the movie a more "real" feel. I have read the novel on which it was based, as well as in many of the comics. Because of this, the film always seemed like a stage for the whole story. A much more complicated story that unfortunately has never had the opportunity to live. <br /> <br /> Despite all the flaws that this film might have, I think it has a lot to offer. The 'monsters' are wonderful, very imaginative. While acting is sometimes a bit stiff, there are some very valuable lines. Every time I see it, I find something new. Keep an eye on the Boones chest towards the end. At one point, Decker stabs him and shortly after Boone falls on a game table. He ends up with a card stuck to his chest. This card stays there for a while, even after Lori pulls out the knife. Stay there until Boone removes it casually. I love that. That was a lovely detail that I thought. <br /> <br /> Basically, what I want to say is that ... if you're looking for a horror movie, do not look at this. If you think that sometimes men can be more evil than anything we have dreamed of. This is the movie for you. This is a movie about how men destroy what they do not understand or fear.
