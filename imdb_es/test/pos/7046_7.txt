I rarely bother watching comedy or television movies these days. They are insipid, vulgar and, most importantly, they are not funny. This could be seen as a refreshing explosion of the past. It's worth seeing, and I do not think it's dated in any meaningful way. Classic humor is classic humor, and good writing is good writing, regardless of the time it was created. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this movie again; I came to mind after having seen the "Summer School" something similar on television recently. Like that slightly newer movie, "Alb√≥ndigas" is fun without being cruel, too sexual or complacent with the mood of the bathroom. The key, of course, is how the adult character makes a big difference in the life of the teen character, maybe even a life-saving change, and how they both grow in the space of a summer.
