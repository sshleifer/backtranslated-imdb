By following the lines of the classic formula to the point of making another leap from the material, the remake of The Thing becomes one of the most great remakes of its time. John Carpenter adheres to what must have been a rather vague script about certain things (or perhaps very descriptive who knows), producing incredibly miserable puppets and brilliant animatronics of Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone in the harsh and distant environment that Carpenter establishes with his characters. The film tells the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the midst of an arctic climate, facing a malevolent force that takes the form of others. He is given a full life by the choice of Carpenter tones, and surprises. For someone who follows the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has much more confidence and talent in the execution of the material than most, given the opportunity to have another opportunity with an old movie. <br /> <br /> With the effects of people working at full strength, in the middle of what would probably follow Backdraft, since it contains the most shots per scene (it could become an exaggeration, but everything fits in the suspense after a while): the actors advance as a fine set. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are mostly normal players, with the leader of Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). Juicy support roles are available for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it's refreshing to see how the kind of absurdity of what's happening in the movie (an alien that starts with dogs and then moves on to others in a bloody and demented way) faces that tone of synchronization with everyone. I loved the long silences sometimes, with the spooky and curious music of Ennio Morricone in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself). <br /> <br /> It aligns with being, in any case, what Lucha offers for its gender / cult audience. It remains one of the best in Carpenter; a rare kind of horror movie in which the story is told clearly and precisely through the position of the camera, the dialogue and the synchronization with the scenes. That does not mean that the film is not full of violence, it is, and in fact, a couple of times it's almost funny. But since it goes back to what seems ridiculously a bygone era, the creatures / makeup, along with the stable and well calculated script, were made completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a T.
