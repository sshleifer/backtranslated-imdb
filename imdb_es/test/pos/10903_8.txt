IN & OUT, in my opinion, is a very hilarious movie. I thought Cameron (Matt Dillon) was wrong in saying that Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. The part I liked the most was Howard's bachelor party. This was because they were making jokes about many things, including the films of Barbra Streisand. I also thought that Emily (Joan Cusack) looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that Howard looked good in his tuxedo. My favorite quote from IN & OUT is: "Are all gays? Is this 'THE TWILIGHT ZONE'?" That was absolutely hilarious! The only character I could not stand was Sonya (Shalom Harlow). This was because she was VERY cocky and stretched. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to all Kevin Kline fans who have not seen it. Prepare to laugh DIFFICULT and have fun when you see it.
