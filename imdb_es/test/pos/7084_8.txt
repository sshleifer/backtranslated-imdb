One True Thing proves that the characters make a movie. Streep will surely receive an Oscar nomination for his role. One True Thing, a beautiful drama, is an excellent example of movie making in the late 1990s: there are still people who care about making and watching movies other than the blockbuster hits with special effects of a million dollars. Dollars. It's not the best movie or anything ... do not be silly. But the amount of emotion delivered by both the actors and the writer hit me like an expansive wave. I cried twice in this movie, which says a lot for a 24-year-old man.
