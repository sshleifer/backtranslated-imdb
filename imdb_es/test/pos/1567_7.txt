There is not much else in history. A young woman steals some money from the sad Vermont supermarket where she works, decides to go to Florida, where she dreams of going to school with her friend Julie, and meets a strange couple on the road. If you remember the elderly couple of "Rosemary's Baby", you have an idea of ​​how these two are. Bill has a funny face and is retired from the army. Sandra is a former stripper who now becomes a truck driver, although we did not discover it immediately. They are affectionate, helpful and full of common sense. <br /> <br /> They adopt the girl more or less, Alice, and promise to take her into her elaborate RV, even though they are not "driving" to Florida. <br /> <br /> This is where the movie could have been one hundred percent wrong. All the filmmakers had to do was to turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil. They would take the virginal Alicia (handcuffed to the bed or whatever) and sell her body to any fat ball driver who has a lot of money and who likes rough sex. (Alice would have had a great time to escape, with many aborted attempts, before the final shooting). But no. The couple is really nice, and Alice is far from being virginal. Alice listens to Sandra with a client, asks her about the business and tries to do a trick on her own. Bill prevents something from happening and insists that he does the job well if he is going to do it. They do not convince her. They guide you. <br /> <br /> Alice earns several hundred dollars, which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple. Bill and Sandra keep their money in the safe where customers will not find it. Alice misunderstand She does not find the prostitute a very nice job, and believes that she will never be rewarded because every time she asks to be left, Sandra responds: "What, not here, honey, not in the middle of nowhere". However, after talking to her about giving her gun to Sandra, the couple gives her the money she wants and frees her with much love to continue her trip to Florida. <br /> <br /> Do you know what I found most tragic moment in the movie? It had nothing to do with prostitution or theft. Alice hoped to be in the room with her friend Julie after arriving in Miami. Julie is, after all, a legitimate student. But when Alice calls her friend from somewhere in Alabama to assure her that she is on the way but will be late, Julie hesitates and says: "Well, my mother does not think you should be with us." And to tell you the truth, my roommate I did not agree, I invited you to go, of course, but I thought it was like a visit for a week or something, come back to Milford, Alice "There is a long silence before Alice hangs up. <br /> <br /> Only one shot is fired (a few white frames of the movie) and no one is hit. Tears appear only once. No one cheats anyone else. No car explodes in a fireball. No policeman pursues them on the Interstate. <br /> <br /> Management is occasionally clumsy. Too much cross-section between Sandra trying to disarm Alice and Alice's hand holding the gun staggering. There is almost no musical score. There is a brief masculine and feminine nudity and it is uncomfortable, as it is probably supposed to be. Alice is not unattractive, but she is not slug either. She sports Asian eyes, a kind of robust version of Molly Parker. Cinematography seems cheap and colors are erased. The direction is a simple narrative, with some illuminating flashbacks. Nothing is wasted. And evidently everything was filmed around Danbury, Connecticut. The city remains in my mind because I drove through it after one of its floods and I remember that the cars were covered with a film of mud up to the door handles. <br /> <br /> I do not know exactly what Alice found (I even THINK that the answer to the puzzle is that "she found herself"). The acting is not bad at all. Judith Ivey is better than that. Definitely worth seeing, a quiet and orderly film that treats the audience as adults.
