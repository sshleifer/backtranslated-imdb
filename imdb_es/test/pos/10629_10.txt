At the end of my review of Cache, I wrote that I was intrigued with Haneke as a filmmaker. This is what led me to get the DVD for La Pianiste, which I just saw about half an hour ago. <br /> <br /> Everything has been expressed, here in IMDb and in many of the external reviews: the appalling. A twisted pathology that would "create" an individual like Erika de Huppert, who is still trying, after years and years, to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, starting with herself. She repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of madness, to where she can not even begin to comprehend what a genuine love impulse would feel. as. <br /> <br /> This is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, one who never found the strength to get out of his childhood situation and become a functional adult. I think this topic relates to all of us: we all fight for autonomy, but there are needs, many conflicting needs, most of which are not even at the conscious level. It also brilliantly addresses the contrast between what one fantasizes, sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share sexual fantasies with another human being. The character of Huppert gets what he asks for in the course of the film, and it is not the emancipatory experience that she had imagined it would be. <br /> <br /> Regarding the scene so discussed in the bathroom: I really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge (for the viewer, I mean) sucked due to the previous scene, where she put the glass in the girl's pocket. At the moment she is acting on her "let's see if this guy is worth it" scenario in the bathroom, we have already discovered that she is dangerously disturbed and, therefore, she is not on, her little session of domination with our poor. trusted. <br /> <br /> I think another amazing achievement of this movie is how, halfway, I completely forgot that I was not in English and that I was reading subtitles. That had never happened before in any foreign film, and I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> In this movie, like Cache, the ending is not all wrapped in a nice little bow, but unlike Cache, at least we have some sense of purpose, despite the fact that it does not we do. even know for sure if the character of Huppert is alive or dead. After experiencing La Pianiste, when it comes to Michael Haneke, I am, needless to say, more than a little intrigued.
