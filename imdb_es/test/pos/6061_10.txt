Of course, I have a bit of prejudice, but for the moment it was the most accurate portrait of the marines that has been seen on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I was at Camp Pendleton and I received infantry training when Webb took his team to Filmamos some outdoor scenes and we asked our company to participate. It took me about two or three days, the best I can remember. <br /> <br /> Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and professional. <br /> <br /> During the filming of our brief scene, which seemed forever to a young man of 18 years: Webb was very conscientious in making things (things of Marine) go well and he did a good job with One exception: that scene in which a recruit was wearing sunglasses. Never happen for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> I have a video of the film and I will bore my grandchildren any time I can make them stay still for a few seconds while I show them to Papaw when I was young. Stallion and part of the greatest fighting force in the world (without boasting, just a fact). <br /> <br /> What surprised me was how well the true marines played their acting roles. That was before I realized that IDs have to have some genes that act to do their job. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've seen since it's equal to DI is the first half of Full Metal Jacket and that part is superior only because of the obscene language. When the ID was made, the curse was not allowed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of blasphemy, it's still a great movie to rent. <br /> <br /> Ooooo-rahhhhhh !!!!! <br /> <br /> Semper Fi, Do or Die
