Well, that was just brilliant. I wish the rest of season 1 had been so strong. I really needed more episodes like this. <br /> <br /> The cast worked perfectly, even though they were nobody in the past. The writing was fantastic and so was the edition. Great work on all accounts. <br /> <br /> The episode was thrilling, suspenseful and kept you guessing until the end. Which is what most episodes of MOTW had tried, but they failed so far. <br /> <br /> The first episode of FIVE stars for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I did not even remember that it was so good. I think it's even better than the great horror movie called 'The Thing'.
