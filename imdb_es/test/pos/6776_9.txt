This is by far the best movie I've seen in a long time. It is a totally original and beautiful plot. It's not boring, it's not too dramatic either. The characters are tangible and realistic, but they do not take away the storyline. The fact that it is not in English is probably the final touch. The ending leaves you satisfied in a way you've never experienced in a movie before. <br /> <br /> I wish I had found this movie before. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> More lines a lot more lines, come on, I'm done.
