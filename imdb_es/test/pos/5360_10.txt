Being a "Wallace and Gromit fan", I expected this long-running movie. Surprisingly, I saw it at the world premiere in Vlissingen (NL), at the Film by the Sea festival. A wonderful feeling of being one of the first to see this movie very funny and cheerful. It's about that Wallace and Gromit (who I think do not need an introduction) have their own pest control company in the city that organizes a giant vegetable contest in a few days. Everyone, even an eccentric baroness, waits for his carrot or giant melon to win the golden carrot. Unfortunately, the city is plagued by many hungry rabbits. This is where W & G comes in. They have their own gadgets to control these cute creatures in a human way. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and colorful story. Anyone who has enjoyed the three short films of W & G (which are more than great!), Will love this long film. Nick Park really gave a wonderful and original result with a great sense of humor. Just like Chicken Run, it really amazes me how you can capture so much history and emotions in just a few frames. "Work well done, boy" ;-) Oh yes: The music was fantastic! It really completes the ride. Enjoy!
