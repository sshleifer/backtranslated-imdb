This movie is cool ... so hard ... <br /> <br /> The cameos ... the references to drugs ... the sharing ... the love ... the ROCKING! When Jack and Kyle met for the first time at Tim Robbins theater company "Actors' Gang" years ago, who knew there would be an incredible and hilarious music legacy? All the swinging from door to door was worth it ... <br /> <br /> Although anyone who enjoys classic rock will have a great opportunity to get out of this movie, I would definitely recommend renting the 6 original HBO episodes in their store of local videos. Before going to see the movie at the cinema. They are on the Tenacious D Masterworks DVD, which is available for rent in almost all video stores. There are some internal jokes in the movie that relate to these previous episodes that will add something more enjoyable to the overall viewing experience ...
