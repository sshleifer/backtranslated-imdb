Imagine that episode of "Dragnet" in which Friday and Gannon enter a typical 1970 den of hippie iniquity, but instead of giving a conference to everyone, they "get something". That's "Joe" in a few words. <br /> <br /> This movie of a working-class fanatic and a rich man who has just killed his girlfriend's drug-dealing boyfriend has had a terrible relationship and most supportive performances are stalled, but It's still interesting to see. Peter Boyle, after about 35 years, plays Joe (the fan), and looks like James Gandolfini. In her film debut, Susan Sarandon plays the daughter with small eyes, and although she does not necessarily imply her future greatness, she can not look away from her.
