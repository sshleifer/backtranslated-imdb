I like the previous description of this movie as a life poem. Last night I captured this totally randomly on the movie channel, and it captivated me enough to continue with him all the way. There really is only a single voice in the film, a narrative poetry that is meaningful without deviating towards pretense. There are also many funny moments from the days of Wirey Middle School that are raw without being grumpy. It's sad that this movie is so low. The fact that there are so many 1s makes me think that the numbers are cooked. I can not see how anyone could see the movie as abysmal. Of course, this is not a typical romantic comedy, but it is a very singular point of view of a very singular life, of a man whose attractiveness comes from his detachment, a detachment that he must overcome before he destroys it. Give this movie a chance. It came out of nowhere for me, and I feel richer for it.
