I would like to order this film for women in treatment. I feel like this is a great movie to watch. I can not do it. No, I've been to eBay and all the other websites to order this movie. Now I'm asking you for help finding the best movie or what to do to get one. I will love to show this movie. Yes, I was like this movie and many people here in treatment to see how people can change lives and move on. I think Markie Post played that movement very well, she is a great actress, I love her movies. And if you have any other film about addiction, I would like to ask you for a treatment center for women and men so that you can see other people go through what happens in life.
