This film received less attention than "League of Their Own", possibly because it only has one "name" star. But while women's professional baseball was only eight years old in the Midwest city, Japanese baseball is a much larger entity, both in financial subscription and in popular support. That alone would make it the best movie. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Baseball" shows the facts of the life of Japan-ball: the cheers regimented, the deference to the referees, the pressure of the corporate owners on the managers, the extreme conservatism of the game, and hot dog players are not welcome. <br /> <br /> It also touches the isolation that any gai-jin, but especially an American athlete, not the people most versed in foreign cultures, feels that he lives in Dai Nippon. And the Japanese, on the other hand, do not feel comfortable with foreigners and they show it in various ways ("the gai-jin attack zone," complains an American player, "bigger than a Buick"). <br /> <br /> It is possible that the script has not won any prizes, playing once again with the theme "exchange for improved game", but I found it much more pleasant to see than the "League" pokey. Definitely recommended for those who want to see another angle in this great sport.
