Well, maybe it's because I'm from northeastern Scotland and I talk like the guys in this movie, but I thought it was really fun. Fun is cheap, no doubt, but a lot of effort has been made to make the movie look great and the actors certainly give it their all. They really affected me a lot when they died. In particular, when the captain finally fell. The script? Well, it's a game of 2 halfs. The first half of the film is well written and clear. The last half hour is not so good, with many unanswered questions. This will undoubtedly annoy others as it bothered me. But, nevertheless, it's fun and a very smart first characteristic of Sturton.
