The CGI feature film has just been released this year, but while it will provide children with a lot of entertainment, for fans and followers of Alvin who grew up with the cartoon versions of the 60s and 80s, The Chipmunk Adventure is probably the best animated film based on Alvin and the Chipmunks, ever. <br /> <br /> To begin with, animation is always the best, the designs of the characters are as they should be in cartoons, unlike the film itself, it's just fun to watch. there are no celebrity voices, no CGI effects have been generated, only pure 2-D quality, hand-drawn animation and the colors are fantastic, bright, bold and beautiful. Jokes and humor are the typical standard of the chipmunk and the narrative is accurate. In truth, The Chipmunk Adventure is everything that the live action movie should have been, but it is not. Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete with the Chipettes, Elenor, Jeanette and Britney in a hot air balloon contest and on the way, children face all kinds of problems and dilemmas that they must solve in their own way. And no Chipmunk movie is complete without the strange interpretations of classic rock and pop anthems. <br /> <br /> The Chipmunk Adventure is for children and adults alike, which is another advantage over the CGI movie. The version will win some new fans, the 1987 movie will appeal to both young and old Chipmunk. Bagdarasian and Karman provide the helium voices of the film's trio. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a must for fans of caricatures that show themselves: you will not be disappointed. If you have seen the live action version, you will feel that this movie is a much better effort in contrast. If you have not done it, you should go see it still, or even forget the Jason Lee movie and, as an alternative, continue with this.
