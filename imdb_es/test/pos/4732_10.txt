If you value your freedom! <br /> <br /> I first became seriously interested in the Davidian Branch debacle after reading an article in the British magazine "The Fortean Times". Wanting to learn more, I rented this documentary and, after seeing it, I was surprised by what I saw. This movie increased my interest in the subject and I have read several books on the subject since then. This film is a must for people who only know the facts as reported in the media called "mainstream". The blatant lies, the double discourse and the contradictory statements made by the officials and politicians shown in this film will make you think twice before calling people who question the actions of governments in this "crazy" fiasco "and" fools ". <br /> <br /> What's scary is that I know some people who consider themselves open-minded "intellectuals" and "liberals" who love freedom who are still convinced that the government did the right thing in Waco and they refuse to watch this movie or read any of the books on the subject. They keep insisting that it's not worth it, because it's all propaganda from gun lovers, Clinton's hatred, religious fanatic and right-wing anarchist fanatics. A publication of an organization composed of many of the so-called "great minds" who claim to be dedicated to promoting "reason", "common sense" and "rationalism" condemned the film saying that it would poison the minds of the people and strongly suggested that this movie should be eliminated. They even hinted that the Davidians had it coming. I will not mention his name since I am a coward. If you are one of those who read this (of course, you probably would not be reading this anyway), I can only say that it is a pity that you do not open your mind.
