I was impressed by this movie. It's one of the best sports movies I've seen. The visuals in this movie are exceptional. I love the sequences in which the camera tracks the ball when it flies through the air or into the cup. The film moves well, offering both emotion and drama. The cinematography was fantastic. <br /> <br /> The acting actions are great. I was surprised by the young Shia LaBeouf. He does well in this role. Stephen Dillane is also good as the melancholy Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth and Elias Koteas offer a capable support. The film is exciting and entertaining and, for the first time in my life, it made me want to see a golf tournament.
