Very well filmed, a bit irregular, "Nobody" is a good night of entertainment. The plot is quite simple: three yuppies get into a scrap with a group of strangers in a bar, and it turns out to be much more than they expected. The acting is decent, and there are some unexpected twists. Be attentive to the utterly incredible (such as the 10-shot revolver and the 25-shot semiautomatic pistol).
