This movie is complex and interesting in many ways. It is a non-stop plethora of topics of emotion and taboo. Sex and love Emotional abuse of women by women, physical abuse of women by men, sexual abuse of children, fresh approach to religion in real life, and everything related to blues music very raw and powerful. Sit down for the first 20 minutes and you will find the relationship and improvement of all the characters. And the end will be more pleasant than you can expect. The music is outstanding, the writing is powerful and everyone's performance was brilliant. <br /> <br /> And the DVD has some excellent features, including Samuel Jackson's background of learning to play the guitar and feel the blues. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for children and I even warn parents of teenagers.
