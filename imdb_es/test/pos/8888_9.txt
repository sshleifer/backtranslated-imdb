Black comedy is not always an easy sale. From time to time you receive a black comedy that is very successful, like Fargo, for example. But usually they do not usually find large audiences. People seem to put their minds to comedy, or to a serious chaos. There does not seem to be a big market for a good mix of both. Throw Momma From the Train was a pretty decent success, however, few people seem to remember much about it at this time. Danny DeVito almost hit him all the way back to the park in 1987. <br /> <br /> DeVito plays a strange son of a mother named Owen who seeks to get rid of his outrageously dominant and unpleasant mother with whom he still lives. . The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who died shortly after its release, and is quite a caricature. She is noisy, ugly, rude and domineering. Although Owen seems unable to take care of himself, he desperately wants his mother to be released. Fantasea with that in some really strange scenes, but clearly does not have the guts to do it himself. That's where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a possible paranoid intellectual novelist who claims that his ex-wife stole his novel and won millions with it. He is currently trying to write a new one, but he can not even come up with a decent first sentence. "The night was ..." Owen hears that Larry wants his ex-wife to die during an outburst in the school cafeteria. And borrowing the idea of ​​Strangers on a Train, Owen decides to travel to Hawaii and assassinate Larry's ex-wife. Once he seems to have done so, he hopes that Larry will return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny, and even touching. It is certainly never boring and often full of surprises. <br /> <br /> The acting is exceptional, even if Ramsey was a bit exaggerated. Crystal is as good as she can be, and DeVito has always been undervalued as an interpreter. The film is based on a bit of physical comedy that usually works, often painfully. The film makes use of some really innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the off-beat tone is really refreshing. I have often criticized the late 1980s as a time of artistic discomfort and a lazy realization of cinema. Pulling the train's mother takes risks. Both in how their characters are drawn and in their general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son who kills his mother? The movie is not too long and is full of laughs. Writers tend to find it more interesting than the general public, but it can still be enjoyed by almost anyone. 9 out of 10 stars <br /> <br /> The Dog.
