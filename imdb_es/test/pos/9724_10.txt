Series as a whole - the best work of Jim Henson. John Hurt * is * the storyteller. Often Oscar-sized scripts are not surprising when considering Minghella writing. Performance of the caliber of the Oscar, always. <br /> <br /> Sapsorrow: everyone loves 'The Soldier and Death', but something about 'Sapsorrow' puts it a bit more in my favor. In the first salon scene, costumes, music - perfection. Hurt and the dog usually interact half-way with the story, but this time Minghella pushes him up that extra notch in the 'ring' scene between Hurt and Sapsorrow. The chemistry between the characters is especially well developed, more than usual in the series, in reference to the friendship between Straggletag and the prince. Viewed? See it again. Pay more attention (to those of you who do not fanatically adore this 22-minute piece of cinematic perfection). Had I never seen him? I am very, very sorry. <br /> <br /> Luck Child, not as sophisticated as Sapsorrow, but very intelligent in his own right. This is a story about irony. Irony over irony, in irony ... I love it. Each character is acted to perfection, with the exception of the boatman. He was doing drama; Everyone else was doing romantic comedy. I forgive him. This is my favorite of the mainly comic episodes, 'Sapsorrow' and 'The Soldier and Death' are examples of more dramatic episodes. <br /> <br /> Side note: Greek myths. What he lacks in the subtlety of Minghella (a different writer) partially compensates with audacity, as he portrays the four myths chosen with more sympathy and respect and history than usual. You can also see Jim Henson's Time if you can get it. For those addicted to storytelling, he presents The Man Himself presenting the myths, the lion of "The True Bride" and ... There is no annoying opening theme! Half narrator, half pure, muppet not adulterated wit.
