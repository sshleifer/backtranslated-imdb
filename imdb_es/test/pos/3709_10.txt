William Faulkner was one of the American writers who won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Faulkner wrote mainly about life in the South, particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to the screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing story of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee, to enlist as hundreds of thousands of young men, some of whom would never return home. His younger brother does not take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother. Surprisingly, he becomes a soldier of another type as he also wants to enlist at age 10. Ron Perlman makes an amazing performance as the military leader who manages to care for and bond with the boy. This short film won an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film that is well deserved. If it were longer, it could compete with longer movies. Everything else, like the costumes, the art direction and the recreation of the American era in 1941 is perfect. The movie also shows the heartbreaking war at home as most Americans survived the Great Depression. The actors and actresses are unknown but they make a first level performance. If Hollywood made more quality films, I would probably go to the movies more. If Broadway had more quality shows, I would go to the theater more.
