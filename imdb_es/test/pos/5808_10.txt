This is a spectacular production! I have seen the show live twice in Chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that I could only perceive fragments of what was happening. The stage consisted of three giant catwalks and the platform, and as the action moves from one part of the stage to the next, at some point you will lose track of what is happening, no matter where you are. As always, this is a sensory overload that invites reflection, skillfully captured in high definition with 15 cameras! The material was masterfully edited, in my opinion, one of the best concert DVDs of all time! I just hope and I want to be released on HD-DVD Blu-Ray so we can relive this extravagance over and over again.
