This is an extremely enveloping series that is well molded and portrays a sensitive subject with great splendor. We follow Michael Ealy as the FBI undercover agent, Darwyn, prepared to infiltrate a terrorist cell led by Farik (Oder Fehr). The series is very well written and has enough twists in the plot to keep you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for what happens next. <br /> <br /> Michael Ealy is, by my definition, one of the best actors I've seen. I've seen an undercover agent portrayed. Cold ice on the outside, but still, a good human being underneath does everything possible to keep his head afloat on a very emotional roller coaster that the FBI has embarked on. Oder Fehr, on the other hand, emerges from a guy who could fit into any social setting. Big and strong, but still it can disappear in the gray mass if necessary. Highly authorized and extremely clever. The way in which the two communicate on the screen is spectacular. <br /> <br /> The way in which the story unfolds and the level of detail offered by the script makes the whole story extremely credible, and also very true to life. I imagine it is of such magnitude that it leaves you feeling unsafe, without knowing what could happen in real life. We read about terror every day, and here we have a good look at an underground world that most of us know very little about. <br /> <br /> It's a series that will surely make you come back for more. sitting there, on the edge of his seat, waiting for the next episode to arrive. In my opinion, it is a sure winner, and I have no problems in stating that this series is on my list of all the best times.
