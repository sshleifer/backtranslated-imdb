Werner Herzog explores again the psyche of a man. In "Little Dieter ...", we find a effervescent and brilliant man who survived the war in Bavaria seeing hunger and strange sights, moved to the USA. UU And he fulfilled his dream of being an aviator. War, food, death, survival, hoarding, planes, bosses going out ... how an American is born. Herzog sees madness as a plane of existence and the surrealist mixes with the moving as Herzog, the story of this psychic journey of a German who becomes an American who flies in a war of the late twentieth century, where the technology, pilgrimage and food are finished. Cans with spoons are combined with constant optimism in a man redefined in American. As always with Herzog, we face the florid madness, the brilliance and what is the man facing his own excesses, social and personal. We laugh and we shudder and we are amazed at this man. Where else for this man, but America?
