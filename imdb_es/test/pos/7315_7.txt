I discovered that this is more chaotic than the average short Stooges (oddly enough). There were several funny snippets, especially the gags ("Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!", When the glass door was broken, the Stooges entering the supply room and leaving with ... Well, you know), but also a little bit of that was occupied with things that just did not make any sense to me. I must assume that these were generally takeoffs from scenes from the movie "Men In White", but since I do not know much about that movie, I can not say for sure. Maybe if someone could explain this, I would appreciate this short more.
