Mud and Sand is one of the parodies of the popular films of Stan Laurel at that time, and this is from Blood and Sand by Rudolph Valentino (hence Stan is Rhubarb Vaseline). Although in part it is not consistent with the characterization (it does not explain how he defeated those bulls at the beginning), this was especially funny from beginning to end, since one of the best sequences is a dance he does with his common law wife , Mae Laurel. Another amusing sequence has to do with his reluctance to have an affair with a fatal woman, Filet de Sole, while his wife, Caramel, is waiting for him, which shows some glimmerings of his later innocent character with Oliver Hardy. It's worth seeing for anyone interested in seeing Mr. Laurel's initial work before his team that made him popular around the world.
