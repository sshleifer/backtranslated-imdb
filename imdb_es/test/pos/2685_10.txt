This is, by far, the funniest comedy ever broadcast on television. I own the 9 seasons on DVD and I can literally see them again and again. Someone who does not find this show hilarious, moving, entertaining and laughs hysterically, is crazy! Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedians there is. My boyfriend and I love comedy shows in Boston (where we live) and we've seen Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) once. Both are incredibly talented and simply plan their work intelligently. There are so many comedians that are horrible and Kevin and Gary really show the true side of the real comedy. Leah Remini, although she is a snob and a bitch in real life (from what I have read) is an incredible actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in comedies. She really does the show ... together with Jerry Stiller! This show is a must see and you will become addicted in one or two episodes!
