Dress only the best Italian Armani costumes, sewn by hand and adjusted to your exact measurements. Your car is the best that German engineering has to offer, and is equipped with as many gadgets as horses under the hood. You are a member of the best polo clubs, frequent dinners in restaurants like Spago and you are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. His pocket watch doubles as a nuclear explosive, while his reliable pen can also be used as a .22 caliber semiautomatic pistol. You ski in the Alps, dive deep in the Caribbean, dive in the Andes and all the time your hair is never out of place. You are Bond, James Bond, the most famous spy in the world, favorite son of the good queen, bad boy of the British SS and perhaps the most desired man in the world. The character of James Bond was created by Ian Fleming, and is the most durable icon of the film industry, being the subject of more than fifteen films spanning more than four decades. The last man to play the role is Pierce Brosnan, who assumed the role of James Bond of Timothy Dalton in 1996, and made his debut 007 in Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the scenario for the first major title developed by a third party on the Nintendo 64. Goldeneye, developed by Rare for Nintendo, has been on the market for some time. His continued dominance in the sales lists is just a test of how good this game is, and no library of reviews would be complete without it. <br /> <br /> Let's face it: most of the time, movie-licensed games are failures. Although the two seem to be a good combination, the results, for the most part, have been horrendous. Games like Cliffhanger, True Lies, Lethal Weapon, and not to mention all the failures of Star Trek, are enough ammunition against this mix. And for the record, I'm not a fan of games with a movie license, especially if I've seen the movie. At least that's how I used to think. In the case of Goldeneye, he had more reserves than usual. While it is not a bad movie, Goldeneye the movie did not have much appeal, and I do not rank it among the ten best Bond films. However, as a game, let's say it's a completely different story. <br /> <br /> The game is a first-person shooter, and to succeed, you'll need at least as much brain as strength. . For those who have seen the movie, which I imagine most of you are reading this, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the film with little variation. A plan has been initiated to control the world's most dangerous satellite, Goldeneye, in the USSR, and in the process a beautiful woman has been captured. Your missions will be many, the extreme danger. You will have to rely on your ingenuity and experience to take you through the most exhausting missions the world has ever known. M will inform you as soon as you are ready. Good morning james
