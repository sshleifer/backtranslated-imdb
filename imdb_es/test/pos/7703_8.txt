One of the most macabre documents, depressing and, nevertheless, revealing. I have seen in a while. There is no narration or story told, just a "third eye" camera that follows about 2 couples of heroin addicts in New York City through the stations. Watch them shoot on the floor of the public toilets and then "clean" their needles in public toilets ... sometimes it's too much and you have to pause to go breathe. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is currently recovering from the alcohol / drug addiction should see this when it seems like it, it really shows what he could come back to! After seeing this, it is a wonder how someone could try this medication to begin with. <br /> <br /> All I needed was a follow-up at the end to know where these people are today. Judging by what is shown in the document, there is no hope for any of them. They mention wanting to improve and stop smoking, but it seems that the only purpose of their habits is to renounce by dying. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not for everyone. I found myself seeing a car accident; After I started seeing it, I just could not turn it off. I had to keep looking with a dark / morbid fascination of what is inside the lives of these addicts.
