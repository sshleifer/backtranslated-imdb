The first time I saw this movie, I thought "what the hell?" A 10 year old boy driving in strange places, meeting strangers, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I really enjoyed this movie! <br /> <br /> Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a pity that he stopped acting. He plays his character Gus very well in the movie. <br /> <br /> Gus loses an eye, gets tattooed and goes to the strangest cities performing with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf. They want more? <br /> <br /> Okay, do not even try to understand the story, but why does this movie need one? Just open your mind and let Gus take you on this trip. <br /> <br /> "Motorama Gus, you won Motorama"
