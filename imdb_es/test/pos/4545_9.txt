Well, of course the critics hated it. This is not a movie that goes by the great acclaim of the critics. But the fact is that it is really very good. <br /> <br /> Sure, if you do not like the physical comedy of Chris Farley, or the extremely dry wit of David Spade, you will not like it. that. But for the rest of us, the film has many funny and otherwise easy-to-quote sequences, and the plot is not as silly as "Black Sheep." The parts that are not meant to be humorous are really well done, not what you would expect from a movie of this kind, and the acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" has no questions. Chris Farley's best movie. I give it an A and I suggest you give it a view.
