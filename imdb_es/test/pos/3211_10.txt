People need to give this show a chance. People who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who have not seen many episodes. One needs to really sit and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All the characters are realistic because they have many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is something weird to see on television today. In addition, for the most part the performance is excellent. Lauren Graham has been rejected by an Emmy for six years. Someone has to give this woman the credit she deserves. The same goes for Kelly Bishop, who plays Emily Gilmore so perfectly. Also, it's good to see a show that can have a girl in the center and not be filled with teenage angst. Rory is a smart girl, who does not see much on television nowadays either. If only other programs could capture the entirety of this program ...
