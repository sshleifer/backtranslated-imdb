Teen Meg Tilly, well groomed and well-educated, must spend the night in a spooky mausoleum as an initiation into a high school club. The problem is that a powerful psychic named Raymar was buried there that day, but he is not quite dead and he needs the vital force of humans for his power. <br /> <br /> The dark horror movie offers many emotions and chills, an attractive and pleasant cast, and the most excellent special effects. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> One Dark Night is rated R for Violence and Adult Themes.
