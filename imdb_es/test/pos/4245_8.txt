Remember when this movie was made by Robert Downey Senior. A very good black entertainment feature, which was a clandestine success in California-Los Angeles and New York at that time. A beloved hippy classic where, the changes that occur in the business world are a striking, refreshing and interesting comedy. Not conforming, not like the basic society at the time of 1969 that is now seen, is still very good, but today's life in America is totally different from the 69. Good for baby boomers.
