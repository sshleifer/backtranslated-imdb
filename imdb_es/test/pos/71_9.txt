I have always loved this movie. The music, the history and the action. I especially love the opening and closing of the film. The music stayed with me throughout the years. The battles of planes of the First World War were great and the comedy is typical of Blake Edwards. Slaptick is his forte after all. Julie's singing is amazing and it keeps me glued to the screen. The scenes and the scenes are wonderful. The characters are attractive. I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie singing to them. I wish I would sing in Vietnam. I also enjoyed the old cars of the time and the music of the First World War. I was glad when the DVD arrived. Now I can whistle in the dark looking at it again and again.
