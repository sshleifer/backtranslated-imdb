I know that one is not supposed to comment on the comments of other users, but I will say that many of the negative reviews seem to come from people who already knew a lot about the Manhattan Project and were upset by the things that were left out. (From his book 'Smoking In Bed' it seems that the original screenwriter Bruce Robinson is another one of them). However, I knew very little before I saw the movie and I found it fascinated. Dwight Schultz is absolutely Mesmeric like Oppenheimer: a truly magnetic and charismatic presence, an inspired piece of casting that makes me wonder why they are not given better roles and more main parts. John Cusack and Paul Newman are excellent as always. One could discuss several script options or direction, but as it is the film is extremely intense and horrible at times, and in general I give it four stars out of five.
