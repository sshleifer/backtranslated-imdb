Shadows breathes the smell of the streets of New York like no movie before. This beginning of the Cassavetes director's work is as atmospheric as it is political and the initial spark for a renovation in American cinema. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is requested to see the first work of Cassavetes in a double function with another debut, that of Godard. À bout de soufflé. Both films shaped the film production of their countries after decades and both breathe a lightness and a peculiarity that later rarely achieved those filmmakers in their career. <br /> <br /> Shadows tells about three African-American brothers, Ben (Ben Carruthers), Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) and Hugh (Hugh Hurd). The story takes place in the jazz environment of New York and the driving rhythms in the soundtrack are the protagonists of the feverish, sometimes almost dreamlike atmosphere that runs through the entire film. Not much happens in the plot. The daily life of the three brothers is defined by problems in the love relationship or in their jobs, but on both levels normality deceives. Without moralizing gestures, Cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion, in public and private life. It was, in relation to the cinematographic representation of racism, a film of great advance in the United States. <br /> <br /> This film is also due in large part to the performances of the three main actors that were previously almost completely unknown. Especially Ben Carruthers established with his energetic portrait the image of a new self-concept of young urban blacks in America, an image that characterizes the Spike Lee films of the 80s and 90s. Revealingly, none of those three actors is undoubtedly extremely talented was able to start a great career afterwards. Hollywood was not and is not ready to ethnically expand its star system, and that's why Goldoni, Hurd and Carruthers only found small artistic niches on television and in independent films later on. <br /> <br /> Maybe Shadows is one of them. of the less "beautiful" films that have been filmed, and one of the most beautiful at the same time; a film of shadows and spaces, with a camera that simply observes the flow of life in the crowded streets, bars, lobbies of hotels, apartments, causing an intriguing walk through the vibrant streets of New York.
