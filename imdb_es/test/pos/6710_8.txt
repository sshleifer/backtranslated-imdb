Is it a perfect movie? No. It's a strange adaptation of a science fiction book and presents vampires from space, naked beauties and the effectiveness of the British army. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie for the first time, I was quite young and all I can remember is the feeling of admiration for the film and Mathilda May. In fact, if it was not because this beautiful lady was naked the whole movie, I probably would not have rated her that high, but given her great magnificence, now I'm really considering voting for her! <br /> <br /> Luckily for me, I remembered the movie and saw it again now. The special effects of Imagine Raiders of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist were transformed into a fairly decent science fiction story, but with a completely superior performance. I still enjoyed the movie tremendously (like Mathilda May), but it was a mix of nostalgia, compared to the fucking movies that they do today and really wanting more when it's over. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: if you're a science fiction fan and you can not miss this movie. Oh, and did I mention that Mathilda May is young, beautiful and naked?
