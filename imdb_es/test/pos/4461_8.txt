Lucio Fulci "Do not Torture a Duckling" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of the small town of Sicily littered with a series of brutal murders of young children. This surprisingly well-directed film (especially compared to the last Fulci tests) is distinguished by the general atmosphere of perversity, evil and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence. Children who are going to die soon are described as casually cruel and incipient creatures: the almost seduction of Bruno by the nude Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) really has to be seen to be believed. Highly recommended, especially in pairs with my other favorite cult "The house with the windows that laugh" (1976).
