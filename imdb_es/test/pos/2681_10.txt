If you leave Seinfeld aside, this is the best comedy, no doubt! Simply great! <br /> <br /> "The King of Queens" has just finished his eighth season of domestic happiness. Located in the working class suburb of Queens, New York, the program follows Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), a gracious delivery man, and his wife, Spitfire's legal secretary, Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), as they explore the daily challenges of love. , life, family and marriage. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie deal with the day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and allow us to laugh at ourselves. Their mutual love ultimately leads them through every dilemma they face, whether it's fixing Doug with food or Carrie's obsession with expensive clothes. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie also have to deal with the third member of the family of Heffernan, the high maintenance member, Carrie's widowed father, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in his basement. Their constant presence and their often strange behavior add up to their daily adventures. Doug and Carrie have found an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and keep Arthur happy on his regular excursions with the gullible dog walker Holly (Nicole Sullivan). Friends of Doug Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine) complete the cast with their "boy" humor and diverse perspectives. <br /> <br /> In a way that evokes "The Honeymooners," THE KING OF QUEENS finds inspiration in the everyday situations of life. Only last season, Doug lent Carrie a deacon without a wife to help him with the Thanksgiving dinner; Heffernanos who suffer from the discomfort and financial stress of mold damage in their home; and Doug and Carrie strive to copy a couple whose photos of a more adventurous life than Doug and Carrie took home accidentally. We also observed Arthur being jealous of a new dog that Holly added to his route, and Doug discovered that his overprotective parents replaced his childhood dog Rocky three times behind his back.
