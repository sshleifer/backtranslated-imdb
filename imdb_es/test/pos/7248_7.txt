Anyone who has seen the trailer of this movie would be forgiven for thinking that this movie is a comedy. In fact, it is a happy game, although not too fun, about a couple of men on the road. <br /> <br /> There are many flaws in the movie. The script and the plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is strangely boring. However, despite all this is quite pleasant, thanks in large part to the two leaders, Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller. These two excellent actors, Carlyle in particular, are always good to watch and here there is a good chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Director Jake Scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers, Ridley and Tony, have given us movies like Alien, Blade Runner, True Romance and more recently GI Jane and State Enemy. His debut is directed with energy and enthusiasm, which makes the film continue to advance, but without the strong cast, the results may not have worked so well. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for an easy solution. A nice movie to spend an hour and a half, then you could do much worse than Plunkett and Macleane. If, on the other hand, you fancy something subtle, historically precise and stimulating, go somewhere else. 7/10.
