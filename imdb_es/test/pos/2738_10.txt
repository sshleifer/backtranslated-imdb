During the brief Golden Age of home movies with Super 8 magnetic sound, we bought a GAF projector for $ 148.00 at a camera store in downtown Chicago. It seemed that GAF was coming out of the camera and projectors business; although they would continue with their other companies, such as the three-dimensional color slide viewers of Sawyer's Vue-Master. <br /> <br /> Little did we know or anticipate the fast approach of the video camera, Betamax, VHS and the eventual revolutions of DVD. With the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Camera that we also bought, we took some recordings of sound films like our Daughter, Jenn's First Communion and her younger sister, Michelle's Preschool Graduation. This was all around the year 1979-82. <br /> <br /> During this time, we also bought some Daddy Toys to go with him; like some Super 8 Magnetic Sound LAUREL & HARDY Films and W.C. SHIRT shorts by Blackhawk Films, Davenport, Iowa. We also bought a Columbia Pictures Home Movies Sound movie from a then Classic Cartoon, GERALD McBOING-BOING from UPA (United Productions of America / Columbia, 1951). It was the success of our Home Movies Time! <br /> <br /> Being members of that generation of Baby Boomer, the Wife (Deanna) and myself remember the Character of Gerald McBoing-Boing; Gerald had a television program on the web on CBS, on Sunday nights, ca. 1955. Bill Goodwin was the Announcer / Host. But we had never seen this original UPA theatrical cartoon; Nor did we know that the young Master McBoing-Boing was a Dr. Seuss creation of the fame of "Grinch," "Horton," and "Mulberry Street." <br /> <br /> The gathered staff was very rich in talent and profound. The outstanding production values ​​are evident. Director Robert Cannon and Supervision Director John Hubley were veterans at the top of their trade. The writers were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss, Himself), Phil Eastman and Bill Scott. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott is remembered not so much for his writing contributions to UPA, but for being Jay Ward's partner in television properties like ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, MR. POWERFUL, FRACTURED FLICKERS, JUNGLE OF THE JUNGLE, HOPPITY HOOPER and FRICKED FLICKERS. With Jay Ward Productions he was a writer, broadcaster and Kibitzer-General of the entire company. <br /> <br /> The cartoon receives its only "voice" from the narrator, radio / film / television actor Marvin Miller. Remember it? It was Michael Anthony on Ssries TV THE MILLIONAIRE (Don Fedderson Productions / CBS Television Network, 1955-60). <br /> <br /> The bold schematic and imaginative color design was to give the UPA animations a special feeling of loneliness, Fear of apprehension and eventual triumph. And, we might add, the animation is definitely of the "Limited" Variety. <br /> <br /> As with so many great stories, ours begins with a simple premise; one is born different In this case, it is the young Gerald McCloy, who was born to produce sound effects in communication instead of talking. Children can be cruel and soon a group of young provocateurs nicknames him with his not-so-flattering nickname: "Nya, nya, your name is not McCloy, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing, the boy who makes noise!" At this point, the Animation Team does an outstanding job of changing the emotional gears in the young marginalized from happy and carefree to isolated and lonely, and finally to depression and despair when not being able to turn to anyone for help and understanding; not even for his mother and father. <br /> <br /> A frightfully designed dark scene involving a highly stylized UPA escape scene involving a train and an equally stylized snowfall takes Gerald to the brink of absolute despair. But then, he is interrupted by a gentleman who announces that the producer of some radio program is looking for young Gerald to play the sounds for the program in the studio. <br /> <br /> ONCE, the main show is performed with Gerald. starring in the Sound Department, he moves away in a huge limousine (which seems to have anticipated the stretch limousines of our days) before the cheers and admiration of his classmates and the world. <br /> <br /> It has been said that there are only many plots and, in that case, this story is probably a variation of The Ugly Duckling; After all, a sad and lonely child finds his place in the world and his true happiness. <br /> <br /> NOTE: United Productions of America, or UPA, for short, was a leading center of creativity in the field of Cartoons. They were responsible not only for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several sequels and a TV series, but also for the very popular MR. MAGOO Theatrical cartoons and the subsequent television show (voiced by Jim Backus), the classic original TV cartoon of FROSTY THE SNOWMAN and the rather strange DICK TRACY Cartoon Show (with the voice of Tracy played by Mr. Everett Sloane !).
