Observed Uzumaki last night and immediately recalled two of the first films of Peter Weir of Australia, The Last Wave and Picnic At Hanging Rock. They were atmospheric movies, but they lacked true horror. Uzumaki, for me, seems clearly influenced by these films. It has a series of rather mundane scenes that become more portentous as the film absorbs you. It also has more scenes of absolute horror and, although I do not think the film really lives up to those two films, it's worth the time for more reflective fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair, but I must say that years after watching The Last Wave, the film still remains with me, and it is precisely the unresolved ending of Picnic At Hanging Rock that makes it so disturbing. P.S. All the people who criticize the performance ... pullleasse ... in this genre?
