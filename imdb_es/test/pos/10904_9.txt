Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comic turn in the 1997 comedy IN & OUT. Kline plays Howard Brackett, a small town history teacher who is excited to see the Academy Awards this year because one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is a candidate. He is nominated for his performance in a movie in which he plays a gay soldier and when he wins, he thanks Howard in his speech for inspiring him because Howard is gay. Now, this surprises Howard because he has no idea why man would say this on international television. Howard is even committed to getting married (with Joan Cusack, in an Oscar-nominated performance), so he has no idea where Deron realized; Cameron Drake is gay and discovers that he has to defend himself before everyone at school, but surprised that no one seems terribly surprised by what Cameron said at the Oscars. Howard has a birthday party where he receives birthday presents as the YENTL soundtrack and ends up explaining to his guests why Barbra Streisand had to create FUNNY LADY. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked but promise to support their son, even if he is gay. He also receives the visit of a journalist from outside the city (Tom Selleck) who wants to do an article about him because he is also gay. The moment Selleck places a big kiss on Kline's lips is a classic. But all these little things make Howard really question his sexuality and wonder if he really is gay ... to the great annoyance and frustration of his girlfriend, Cusack, who is more than confused. The scene in which he leaves a bar with his wedding dress and stands in the middle of the street screaming for the lack of heterosexual men in the world is a classic. But what I like about this movie is the way Kline invested completely in the role and was not afraid to look silly or gay. There's a fabulous scene, probably the most famous one in the movie, in which he buys a record, about how to be a male, and the guy on the record talks about how real men do not dance and a disco tune is heard (I WILL SURVIVE if memory serves) and the narrator on the record says that no matter what you do, do not dance, but Howard can not help it and ends up shaking his rhythm throughout the room. He is hysterically funny and Kline plays with sincerity and enthusiasm. The film is not pro or anti gay ... it's just a skillful and fun study of characters about a man trying to find out exactly who he is. Wonderful movie
