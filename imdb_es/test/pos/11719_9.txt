An intense and dark action drama with unusually rich support from Casey, Keith, et. Al, many of whom get the best roles in their careers and run with it. The film has a strange shape: often the action slows down only to let the characters get caught up in improved dialogues, but well done, well done: during surveillance, almost the entire "Machine" is caught in comic monologues delivered perfectly. - and Reynolds, the director, deserves a lot of credit for making Reynolds the star back and give them space. And, unlike most action movies, you really like the characters, which makes the second half, when you deploy your different destinations, affect in an unusual way. The combination of character development, brutal violence, a dazzling soundtrack (Tarantino must be a fanatic - look at this and then "Jackie Brown" and you'll see what I'm talking about) make this film occasionally flawed (the bad guys are a bit melodramatic ) one of the best movies of modern police, and in my opinion superior to many of the modern noirs overestimated as "Body Heat" and others.
