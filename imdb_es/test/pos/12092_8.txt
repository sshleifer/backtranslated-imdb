This is a great documentary and the previous comments make a brief summary of how good it was, so I will not repeat the same compliments. But, Faith akin, being a man oriented to the Turks who probably knows that country more than a common European, falls into the trap of Orientalism in which other Western artists tend to fall. But come on, man, you are of Turkish blood and your film could be deeper and could describe what is beyond "the ancient city of Beyoglu". It's a missed opportunity for Akin for that reason. The performances of Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are a glimpse of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad Turkish rapper) makes a rubbish talk about the American gangsta rappers that I totally agree with. I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
