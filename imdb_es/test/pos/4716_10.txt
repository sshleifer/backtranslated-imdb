I saw beyond Rangoon about 20 times, it was SO GOOD. At the beginning, when I saw it, I saw the story of Laura Bowman, but then, after several presentations, I realized that it was also a parallel documentary. She came to have in mind a story about Aung San Suu Kyi and the struggles of women to stay strong in the face of uncertainty, danger and sadness. I would also put history and politics on the list after seeing them more, as I learned a lot about Burma's past and present, and could only guess its future. This movie is not just one you want to see, but also one that you definitely want to have a copy of. It is a film that could easily be seen by the whole family, although not for children under thirteen. However, the educational benefits of this movie can not, and should not be underestimated.
