There will not be a moment in this movie where you do not laugh. This is Mel Brooks at one of his highest points, and Cary Elwes takes the part of Robin with convincing humor. Every time you see this movie you will discover a new joke, but the ones you have noticed before will never get old. Highly recommended!
