In "Lassie Come Home", "National Velvet" and "The Courage of Lassie", was Elizabeth Taylor eleven years old? However, her charm and beauty were extraordinary, and what she lacked in talent and experience was well hidden in an excellent production that was nominated for five Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> As a horse trainer or dog owner, as a rejected wife or lover, Liz is a woman who is absorbed in giving and receiving love: devotion to the object of passion is the center of her life. ?? Little Liz produces love in horses and dogs with remarkable intensity.

Dedicated to a sober work ethic, do they live quiet, exemplary lives? Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) is the very spirit of popular wisdom; the spokeswoman for common sense and fair play, knows enough not to silence the semi-hysterical energy of her crazy horse daughter, and lets the girl have her dream? <br /> <br /> Anne Revere won an Oscar as the mother of Velvet, as did editor Robert J. Kern?
