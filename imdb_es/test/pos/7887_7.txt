Unusual film about a man who befriends his social opposite for fear of blackmail. Peter Boyle makes this film with his sullen portrait of a rigid "Joe" working class in love with the past and fearful of the future and worried about the present. The first half hour of the show presents the film debut of a young Susan Sarrandon as Melissa Compton, a rich and weak girl who lives in slums with her loser boyfriend, full of a complete nude scene. Her boyfriend is the weak point of the film, a misunderstood drug addict and merchant who finds his passing after Sarrandon's overdose. We meet Boyle's Joe in a bar when he talks and talks about minorities, crime, hippies and drugs, and it's easy to see that the last character of Archie Bunker's Norman Lear on TV is based on a clean version of Joe . The comparison even moves to Joe's wife and personal life and hobbies. Joe insinuates himself into the life of Bill Compton, Melissa's father, and the two form an unlikely pair as they search for Melissa who has escaped drug treatment and returned to the drug addicts she calls friends. Their search takes them to an "oar," as Joe calls it, a free love-fueled festival of drugs, a lot of nudity and, surprisingly, the tense Bill Compton and the Ultra Conservative Joe come together. They are stolen and this leads to a violent and murderous ending that presages the severe and spooky end of Taxi Driver six years later. Joe is a funny movie that, at least on the surface, is anti-violence and anti-racist. However, the main character of the film, Joe, becomes the very instrument of the agitation he fears when he enters and joins the illegal and unbridled sexual excesses against which he complains. So in that sense, the movie is not a powerful message and it leaves you wondering what the final result really was about.
