I sell the dead riots around the condemned grave robber Arthur Blake. Blake's friend and fellow grave robber, Willie Grimes, has just been executed and Blake will follow suit the next morning. While he sits in his cell waiting for his execution, a priest named Father Duffy enters and asks him if he will tell everything he has seen as a grave robber. Then he proceeds to give Father Duffy a quasi-biography of his most interesting exploits. <br /> <br /> The plot consists of several incidents that are only related to each other by chronology. This prevents the viewer from getting bored, but it also makes events less meaningful, as it could add or delete many scenes easily without realizing it. Although defective, I thought that in general this method added to the fun-loving nature of the film and kept it very entertaining. Most of the various stories are good, specifically the alien, the Murphy and the vampire, but others were not so great. <br /> <br /> The performance is not surprising, but it did not seem too bad. point. Dominic Monaghan had a good performance as he managed to be serious when it mattered and also play very well in the comic parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The characters were not extremely deep, but they were all interesting. I also liked how some of the villains were done almost comically. The part of the back story of the Murphy and his gang is priceless. <br /> <br /> So, in general, I Sell the Dead successfully combines horror, comedy and science fiction in a mix of fun and excitement. It is one of the most interesting and original films that I have seen in a long time, and it is unfortunate that independent films like this do not receive more recognition.
