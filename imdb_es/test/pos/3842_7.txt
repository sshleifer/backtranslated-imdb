After the release of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)', Walt Disney Productions has continued to produce quality and lively children's films, many of which I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing. 'The AristoCats (1970)', directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, was the twentieth film of the official canon of Disney, and is a romantic musical comedy that revolves around a family of aristocratic cats living in Paris, France, in 1910. In the mansion of the old Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (with the voice of Hermione Baddeley), her loving feline pets. Including the Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three kittens? They are the most important residents. When the clumsy butler, Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), learns that the cats inherit all the fortune of the old woman, he gets ready to get rid of the pets and leave them in the field, far from the big city. Lost and confused, Duchess and her children meet a street cat, Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who agrees to show them the way home. <br /> <br /> As for animation, 'The AristoCats' is nothing particularly remarkable, with many previous Disney films like 'Snow White?' and 'Fantasia (1940)', which demonstrates a similar or even superior visual style. However, the story is interesting and exciting? Particularly for younger audiences, I will bet? and the musical numbers (which I wish were more numerous) are great. For the sake of curiosity, I will name my two favorite songs as "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and "Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat", the last of which is a psychedelic back-drop of the late 60's, with a swing Jazz band and delirious colors, led by a fashion cat called Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers). The family's trip to Paris is hectic and adventurous, and we meet such friendly characters as Amelia and Abigail Gabble (two talkative geese), Uncle Waldo (the couple's drunken relative), Georges Hautecourt (the old but skilled lawyer of Madame Bonfamille) and Napoleon and Lafayette {two foolish hunting dogs with a hunger for the rump of the butler}.
