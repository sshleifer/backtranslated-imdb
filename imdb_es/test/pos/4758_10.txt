Growing up in New Jersey and having spent many days and nights on the gritty streets of New York in the 1970s, watching a movie like "The Seven-Ups," or its related spirit, "The French Connection," always evokes affection. . memories of a time and place that, for some, could have been the darkest hour of New York City, but for me, in my twenties, it was always an adventure full of fun after another. I really miss those times. As one critic commented: "This film captures with great accuracy the raw and cold feeling of the New York winter season, while sharply exposing the most vulnerable part of the infamous underworld of the region: a time and a culture." A punctual characterization of both the film and the city. The stellar attributes of this movie (the plot, the cast, the characters and, of course, the car chase) are widely described in many of the reviews here, so I'm not going to go into that except to say that one of my favorite moments occur during the chase of the car, when the camera focuses on Richard Lynch riding the shotgun in the maniacal Bill Hickman. The look of horror on Richard Lynch's face, along with the defensive gestures, are so out of place for an actor much better known as a source of terror than as an object of him, that it's really funny to see him. I get a giggle every time.
