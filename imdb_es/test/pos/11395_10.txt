I rented Boogie Nights last week and I could tell you that when I saw the movie, I had a great time. If you think that when you watch the movie you will get sick because of pornography. I mean yes, if you're not a porn person who can not bother doing it, then this is not the movie to watch. But the thing is that the whole movie is not really about pornography. Half of the film is about the porn industry, but the other half is about the development of the character and the bad situations that these characters go through. The actors played perfect roles there, especially Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly and William H. Macy. The sex scenes, of course, are great, but they focus mainly on the exaggeration of the character in pornographic films until there are no problems. Excellent movie, one of the best! <br /> <br /> Hedeen Perspective: 10/10 **** A +
