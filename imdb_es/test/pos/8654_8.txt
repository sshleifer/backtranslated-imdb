The Scandinavians are very good at making me laugh out of the monotonous nothingness of my soulless life, eh. <br /> <br /> The filming here was incredibly meticulous, every piece of framing, every expressionless look, every element of color. palette, each fragment of muzak or whooosh of those street cleaners was there to hammer the quiet emptiness of this world. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think I might have found the general feeling of emptiness dominant if it had not been absurd. Really fun and relatable. Like when Andreas tells his boss that he misses children and looks up and that the boy smiles and is halfway there, it's a kind of sad but true reflection of working with people, spending 7/8 hours at day with them, see more of them than the people you love, but ultimately, know in the background that they do not care about your problems and you do the same. <br /> <br /> This could have been a movie that the Coen had made if they had been born. in Oslo and not in Minnesota. I think his humor is more aggressive and more involved in the past of cinema, but they have the same mastery of technique and his films have the same underlying sense that life is quite inconsequential. <br /> <br /> I'll stop before I convince myself to take a bus in the winter wilderness.
