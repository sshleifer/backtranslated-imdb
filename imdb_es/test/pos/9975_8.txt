This movie has a decent story, in my opinion, very good fight scenes, but I was a bit disappointed at the end of the movie. I think it was a better way if Lydie Denier also knew Karate or if she knew how to use some weapons. Her character has become more interesting too and she was a decent opponent for Cynthia. I think when the director filmed the final 'battle' between cynthia and denier, I wanted to finish the film before, so he did not care what the ending would be like. In general, I think Cynthia Rothrock fans will be very pleased to see this movie. It's not like 'yes, ma'am'! or jury to justice, but it was enough entertainment and cynthia looks amazing in this movie, so my rate for this movie is a solid 8/10
