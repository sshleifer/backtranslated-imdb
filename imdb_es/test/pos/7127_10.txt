This movie is so wonderful that it captures the life of the game. I laughed so much while watching this. The film is about a group of game that has difficulties with a campaign that occurred to its dungeon master. The film changes from the real world and the game world as they play the campaign that shows them in the game world as their character, and then returns to the real world when they are not playing. The campaign is the basis of a module that the dungeon master, Lodge, is writing. The problem is that Lodge can not finish his module because the characters can not finish the campaign. They are more for killing and looting instead of role playing. Lodge wants them to do a role play through the campaign, something they have never done before. They decide to bring some extra help to bring a girl, wait for her, play her. Lodge also makes a npc, a non-player character, a paladin, who can not witness or do evil, to play. The movie is how they do all this and more. I do not want to spoil anything in the movie, so I'm not going to say anything else. This movie may not be a big budget movie, the performance may not be worthy of an Oscar, but if you like games or dungeons and dragons, definitely, see them. They had a lot of fun doing this movie and it shows that I'm not going to attack it for any cinematic problem, like continuity or anything, it was a low budget movie that is just fun. There is a slapping comedy that I enjoy and some very good writing in my opinion. So if you want a fun movie try.
