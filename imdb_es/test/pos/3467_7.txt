I went to the preselection of "Rory O'Shea Was Here". I like this movie better than I expected, due to the excellent releases and the powerful performance. It is a film about the friendship of two young people with disabilities. Rory is a free-spirited young man who wants to be independent, regardless of his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers, but he can speak eloquently and help his new friend, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and has significant speech problems. I guess that's enough to start with a crying drama. Well, it is. But with inspiring messages and deeply moving performances. He made me see my life for things I take for granted. What would I do if all I can do is move my two fingers? I should feel grateful for what I have and what I am capable of doing. This is a good movie, although it could have been better.
