"With all the misery in the world, how can we not get drunk?" ?? Mia <br /> <br /> A beautiful aerial view of a big city becomes sinister with the approach of a fleet of aircraft bombers; An irate hairdresser who reacts to a perceived racial insult cuts a path through the bushy hair of a businessman; A man dreams of being dragged into an electric chair after a failed magic trick and a teacher breaks down in front of his elementary school class because her husband called her a witch. These and fifty other vignettes ranging from the openly depressing to the tremendously comical of the cheerful and uplifting town of Roy Andersson, his first feature film since he was acclaimed by the critics, although he did not succeed commercially, Songs of the second floor. <br /> <br /> You, The Living is full of the same kind of imaginative pieces as the Songs, full of black humor, surreal situations and strange looking characters. Although a little more extensive and less focused than his previous work, what remains constant is the unmistakable style of Andersson with its fixed camera, sterile looking backgrounds and precise attention to details. If there is a theme that links the sketches, it is that our time on Earth is limited and "tomorrow will be another day", so let's treat each other with kindness. Along the way, the music of the tuba and the Louisiana battery entertains us. Brass Band, guest dinners in a banquet hall standing in their chairs singing a moving song, and a house that becomes a moving train. <br /> <br /> Emotions range from the gloom of a daughter trying to communicate with an Alzheimer's patient to the ecstatic dream of a young woman about marrying a handsome guitarist named Micke with the cheers of a crowd of spectators Although there is no continuous narrative thread, the theme of greed and despair appears in several sketches. The first of these threads has two large individuals and their small dog sitting on a bench in the park, the woman laments the fact that no one understands or loves her, but she happily ignores the comforting and reassuring words of the man. <br /> <br /> There is also a strong mix of irony. During what appears to be an executive lunch, a man tells another on the phone that workers do not appreciate the quality and how nice it is to appreciate the money and the things you can buy, like good wine. However, when he is not looking, a man at an adjacent table quietly lifts his jacket wallet on the back of his chair. Although Andersson's cynicism is sometimes not very hidden, You the Living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. It is a cautionary tale that analyzes the disorder in which we humans have gotten, but suggests that there is still time to turn it around, if we pay attention to the poet Goethe's warning that opens the film: "Be happy, you, the alive, in your deliciously heated bed, before the icy wave of Lethe licks the foot that escapes you.
