This movie is a bit slow at first, during the first 10 minutes or so. But once it is activated, it can not be turned off. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best parts and are excellent in their acting work. You would never be able to guess who the killer is. I gave this movie a 9, because in some parts Adam Beach needs to talk a little so you can hear what he's saying. <br /> <br /> 9/10
