Random Hearts approached me stealthily. Criticized by the implausibility of a) the premise and b) the pairing of an AI policeman and a congresswoman, as well as his slowness, the film seemed good to me, and ended up being surprisingly absorbing. I discovered my interest when the film was between the life of Ford and Thomas when they found out and tried very different ways in very different environments, the death of their spouses and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people. Could occur; The fianc√© spouses of two people could be in the same plane, the plane could fall, the survivors could be reunited by the consequences. And what if it is improbable? The improbable is not the same as the improbable. So ... what if it happened? Why not speculate? <br /> <br /> The performances of Ford and Thomas are credible and nuanced. Instead of finding their coupling implausible (opposite sides of the clues, give me a break) I felt that I was motivated by a grief and a betrayal that neither party knew how to deal with. The script does not reunite them too soon or too easily, and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship in a conventional way either. Where I find it unsatisfactory is when the dialogue shows interesting wrinkles or ideas about the ramifications of the situation, personal and professional, but it seems that it never pursues any of them very far. And if he makes the mistake of thinking too much, Harrison Ford seems to be about 10 years too old for the part. <br /> <br /> For five and a half dollars at Wal-Mart, with full comments from the director and behind the scenes, the DVD is worth having. I do not think I would pay $ 20 for that in a bet, but my wife could do it. Ok ten
