This film has a spartan and non-sentimental touch that allows us a lot of space to participate in the action without any styling telling us HOW we should feel; in 'Blue', everything was openly sad (of course, as powerful as hell, but still); in 'Blanco', it was a delicious treat. But there are no such emotional clues, or signals for that matter, in this. It's as if I finally let the force of the story work its own magic without dazzling embellishment. I think that is what initially makes it the most enigmatic of the three, but finally, the most transcendent and redeeming. Relentless and ruthless honesty has never been so beautiful.
