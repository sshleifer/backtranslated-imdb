Beautiful film set in 1962 in Hong Kong about a man (Mr. Chow) and a woman (Ms. Chan) who become close friends when they suspect their wives are having an affair. Stylistically, the movie is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses a lot of slow motion and close-ups on parts of the body (feet, hands, waist). The film itself has a reluctance and a property that suggests its period of time. It's sexy without showing everything. Wong Kar-Wai also does not allow the audience to see what the spouses look like, suggesting that Mr. Chow and Ms. Chan should be together. Smoking is even made to look elegant with close-ups of the smoke curls. A really lovely movie. Just prepare for the end. <br /> <br />
