Look ... I've come to expect this level of performance from William Macy ... the guy is still performing incredible performances ... but MEAT LOAF? At what point did you decide to put aside Jim Steinman and leave your decidedly lower weight in the wonderful world of Stanislavsky? Well, what can I say? I am duly impressed. Paraphrasing an old adage: "It's not the flesh, it's the emotion" ... and The Loaf is polishing its acting chops in recent times ... <br /> <br /> Laura Dern takes her eyes off the 40 Perfectly here ... good work from the wardrobe and hairdressing departments ... David Paymer is typecast but right in the money. Solid work chamber throughout the film. The line of the plot recalls the "Gentlemen's Agreement" (anti-Semitism after the Second World War). It's worth your time ... especially for Bill Macy's growing legions of acolytes. <br /> <br />
