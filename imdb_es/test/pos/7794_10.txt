AAA is my favorite movie ... I have seen it several times (I do not remember the recount now) and every time I love ... This is the best movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi ... The comedy, the dialogues, and the performance is Amazing ... All the actors and actresses have done an excellent job ... You can not stop laughing while you watch this movie ... it's just hilarious ... Amir Khan and Salman Khan have done a great job .... and the performance of Paresh Rawal was excellent as always ... The music is inspired by the old Hindi films (music from the 60's) and it's good ... the entire cast of the film has done a great job ... < br /> <br /> In general, it's a great Indian comedy movie to watch ...
