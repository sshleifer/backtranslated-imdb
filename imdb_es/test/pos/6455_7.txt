Clearly inspired by the first gangster films that Warner produced the same year, Little Caesar (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931), this gangster movie is one of the best efforts I've seen. Although it is not the same type as the classics mentioned above, it has a powerful performance of the young Sylvia Sidney. It is magnificent and offers its most natural lines of what perhaps nobody has done at that time. Gary Cooper is better than usual at this stage of his career and shows signs of what would follow the next few years when he rose to the top. The movie has some fascinating villains in Paul Lukas (he had never seen it so detestable) and Guy Kibbee (what a surprise to have seen him act like a bully). The address of Rouben Mamoulian is very inventive, probably the first voiceover to show a person The thoughts appear in this film. If you have the opportunity to see this little gangster movie, do not miss the opportunity.
