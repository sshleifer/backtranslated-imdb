After sleeping out of solitude, Lestat wakes up from a dream of 100 years with the sounds of a new music he wants to be part of and the band "The Vampire Lestat" is born. His desire to end his loneliness and his attitude of "living in the light" along with his music, anger his fellow vampires and awaken an evil that has been sleeping for thousands of years. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for those who are looking for a true adaptation from book to film. Those who have read the books and expect to see it on the screen are disappointed. This movie will attract those who really enjoyed the movie "Interview with the vampire". <br /> <br /> There are some plot holes and incongruities, but in general, this movie was satisfactory. Stuart Townsend plays Lestat with a sensuality and sensuality that are missing in the previous film. The relationships represented in the film were very attractive and hot. <br /> <br /> As a movie, history compels you and attracts you. The casting is wonderful. I loved this story and the movie. If you like sensuality and sexual tension, you will love this movie.
