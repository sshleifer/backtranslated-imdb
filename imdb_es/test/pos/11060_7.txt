Maybe this movie is too long, but still has some charm 45 years later. The leading roles seem more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I could not care less about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, particularly in dark hair. It is worth watching the film for the cast: Flora Robson is great as a mulatto maid. She is a white woman with a black face, and may have an expression of evil or a voodoo lover. Jerry Austin, as a dwarf servant, has a charming role, which keeps you laughing despite some too long scenes. Speaking of scenes, Florence Bates steals from most of the people she finds herself in as a social lady. I did not understand the result of the railroad fight at the end of the movie, and the last scene was pure Hollywood dreck. It's a strange feeling when you realize that the title of the movie refers to a railroad instead of a suitcase!
