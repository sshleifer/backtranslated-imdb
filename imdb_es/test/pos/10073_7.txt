So, Madonna is not Meryl Streep. Still, this is one of his first movies and a comedy in that. Give him a break! Of course, the film is, at best, mediocre and pale in comparison to its previous counterpart with Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is, however (a piece of fluff), it is quite fun to watch. I have not yet heard anyone criticize Madonna's acting skills with proofs or even other adjectives that are not "horrible", "bad" or other words so vague and descriptive. If you want to see a bad performance or justify the argument that the singers should stick to singing, how about Whitney Houston? She has had the most unmerited commercial success of any actress in history and could not get out of a box of hats. The American public, obviously, can not discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and the power of the stars. I think Madonna has always been at least credible in her films. Get real people. Madonna-bashing is so 90's.
