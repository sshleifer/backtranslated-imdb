This movie was talked about in Fangoria, where I heard about this, I was especially interested because it was direct to the video and I recognized two of the stars on the cover, James Marsden from Disturbing Behavior and Christine Taylor from The Craft. And to my surprise on Valentine's Day when I was looking for the hall of terror to find it on the shelf! Immediately I had to grab him. I, my brother and our friends looked at it and, to my surprise, it was quite good, the stories were interesting and, for once, they were SCARY, unlike many other horror films that are being made recently. I do not understand something about the plot, but once I see it, I bet I'll get it. And to my surprise, there were other stars that I recognized, including one of the girls from My So-Called Life and Jacinda from The Real World. I'm not sure why this movie was only directed directly to the video. With a little publicity, this movie could have compensated for at least how much money was spent on doing it. The only problem I have is that, since it was not released in theaters, I guess I'll never be able to see it on the wide screen. You should definitely risk it and rent this one. <br /> <br />
