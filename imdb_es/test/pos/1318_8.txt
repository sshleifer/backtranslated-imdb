The only pure life is that which ends with a signature in blood. <br /> <br /> So says Mishima, a young refugee who becomes a famous author. The life of one of the most celebrated literary voices in Japan is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army take a Japanese military base and commit ritual suicide (shown in color), flashbacks ( they are shown in black). and white), and scenes from his novels (shown in a sort of dreamy Technicolor design somewhere between the traditional Noh Theater and "The Wizard of Oz." These stories are often told at the same time, but they edit to reinforce them, the slow ones merging the life of Mishima with their fictions, until the end (or the beginning) when, like the old samurai that he admires so much, he will have a balance between the pen and the sword (when his words and actions are the same, and be a complete and "be" pure). <br /> <br /> Paul Schrader wrote the screen play for "Taxi Driver", and directed "Cat People" (a strange erotic horror movie, which left strange impressions in me when I was a child), and in Mishima, he is closer to making a really excellent movie. <br /> <br /> What interests him? ng is seeing the poet, the homosexual, the shy man and clumsy with a low body image that exaggerates his Tuberculosis to get out of WW2 (from the c ual seems embarrassed forever), become a bodybuilding, obsessed with samurai, a-sexual, media phenomena, while writing prolific amounts of novels, plays and stories. <br /> <br /> A short and sweet version is to say that Mishima has no father and is obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and self-destruction, in a tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than himself, that was always missing When you look at him with his fellow suicide cadets, you see him happy, giving his great fatherly speech, giving orders and loving control ... until the speech itself, the point where the pen and the sword are? Of course, this ignores the subtlety of the narrative trade that makes this transformation so natural and remarkable. <br /> <br /> Although the story, fascinating at times, it really is not the biggest success of this movie. The cinematography, the interpretations, the edition, the music (by Philip Glass) and the scenographies are what make it worth seeing, and more than a traditional biography. <br /> <br /> One day I will pick it up. Like a book by Mishima, he seems to have an ear for prose and to organize ideas, but for now I am satisfied with the film. <br /> <br /> Those interested in Japanese literature and post-war culture, should withdraw The fanatics of inventive combinations of facts and fictions, should also enjoy.
