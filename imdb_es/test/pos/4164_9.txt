Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active at the beginning of the 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method (poems of 'sketch'), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in front of his idealistic imagination. <br /> <br /> The film beautifully integrated fragments of Miyazawa's poems into the plot. His relationships with his students were powerful, especially in a scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing classroom materials. Miyazawa's selfless compassion for the farmers of his village, his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson for all of us. In addition, Miyazawa's devotion to science was also well represented. At a time when Western ideas were still skeptical, especially in provincial cities like Miyazawa, he understands its usefulness in helping its villagers and is inspired by its elegance. The way in which the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer was really intense and well interpreted. <br /> <br /> I felt that the CGI was integrated into the film, at the same time innovative, that it clashed with the most organic animation. . You could argue that this was intentional to represent a conflict within the main character, but I found it quite un-aesthetic. I also wish that the film had discussed the Buddhist influence of Miyazawa, but it worked well without her. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very well made. I give it a 9/10, with the point that is deducted for the CGI. Otherwise, the animation, the plot and the dialogue were wonderful and sincere. I have not seen any other Kawamori Shoji movies, but after seeing this one, I'm sure I'll give them a chance.
