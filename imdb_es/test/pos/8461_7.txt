Christine Lahti (Sandy Dunlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) worked well with soapy material, Ted Danson did everything possible with the ungrateful role of Chip Davis. The premise of this is that the friendship of the two ladies, a woman apparently happily married and the other, a career woman who is aware that her biological clock is advancing. I found the relationship that the character of Ted Danson had with the single woman played by Christine Lahti rather sordid. He behaved in a caddish manner, however, he left two "widows" crying over him, screaming. I found it disgusting when, when Sandy told him that he wanted to break it after meeting his wife, he calls her saying that he misses her (did he call his wife? There was no sign of that). He behaved like a heel. Maybe I would have made a more interesting movie if I had not been killed. Maybe the two ladies had stood up and left him. I liked the friendship between the two women, but it was ruined by what they had in common: the cad of a husband.
