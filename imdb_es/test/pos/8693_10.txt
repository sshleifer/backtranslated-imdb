This is an exceptional movie. It's part comedy, part drama, part suspense. The dialogue is exquisite. Most actors and actresses were very famous in their time, and for good reason. You will probably recognize someone, even if you do not usually watch old movies. They are also each in a role that is particularly suited to their talents. <br /> <br /> A correction to make comments from other users is that it is announced that two people, not one, will die in the accident. Perhaps the two unfortunates are a reflection of what the writer considers important in life. The film is too attractive to worry about who it is until it happens. <br /> <br /> The story is ahead of its time, but it does not lose the quality of an older movie. Time and effort were devoted to perfecting the view of the camera and the soundtrack, something that modern filmmakers tend to forget.
