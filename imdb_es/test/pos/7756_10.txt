From the beginning, you can not look the other way and you do not want to. "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu) is one of the most entertaining animes I have seen in a long time. If you can look away from insane and sometimes perverse humor, it is easy to find a job of brilliant execution and masterful execution. <br /> <br /> Part of the brightness comes from the fact that the episodes are not chronological. order, so you may not understand some of the things you're talking about at the beginning, but as the series progresses, you'll find yourself saying "oh, that's what they meant!" Although this might confuse some people, after watching the program, it will be difficult to make a case against telling the story in this way. <br /> <br /> After all, the focus is on the characters. The title character, Haruhi Suzumiya, is by far one of the most eccentric heroines of all the anime. Her opening speech to her class, in which she declares that she "is not interested in normal human beings", and is looking for "espers, foreigners and time travelers", is absolutely extravagant, but she is kind in that way. <br /> <br /> Then there's Kyon, the "normal" guy who is dragged into the madness that surrounds Suzumiya-san. He is the narrator, and his quick wit makes the scene much more entertaining. He is caught in the middle of several factions that try to influence Haruhi Suzumiya, and the other three characters are representatives of these factions; Ironically, they are the beings that Haruhi is looking for, and yet they can not reveal themselves to her. <br /> <br /> The first is Yuki Nagato, a quiet girl who happens to be the only member of the school's literary club. , and also a representative of the Integration Thought Entity; She is basically an alien, although the best description of her is a computer program in a human body. Your purely emotionless responses make it a stalemate and it always makes you think that there is more to it than meets the eye. Then there's Mikuru Asahina, the time traveler, who is incredibly cute, a great ditz, and the subject of Suzumiya's plans to announce her club, the SOS Brigade, to the world. The end result is that Suzumiya does things that limit sexual harassment, making her dress up in fetish uniforms. The final character is Koizumi Itsuki, the timid and perpetually optimistic philosopher who turns out to be Haruhi's "esper", although he can only use his powers under certain conditions. <br /> <br /> The final result of all these characters is a Comedy different from any other, which is raw and deep, and always brilliant. Do not Believe Me Watch the first episode, your "student movie". You will see what I want to say.
