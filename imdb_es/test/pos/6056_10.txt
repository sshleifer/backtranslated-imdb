Well, as you can see, I arrived at this party quite late, but I have the advantage of reading all the previous entries before making my comments. I found this site by accident, when I was looking for other Marine Corps movies. So, let me start by telling you that I played a Marine Boot in the movie, Pvt. Labarsky, and I was stationed at MCRDep, San Diego at that time. Jack Webb and his team selected 15 Permanent Staff, of which some of us had the floor to speak, and another 15 Marines who had just completed Boot Camp. That made up the peloton and the Marines who portrayed the different "ID's". The best of my memory, The Capt. And Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) were not in the Marine Corps. We spent about three weeks in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot), CA, filming the section of the film in which we were involved, and then they completed the other shots after we left. <br /> <br /> So, as you have fun here, let me clarify something that has been questioned in previous posts as best I can. "Cuff Daddy" commented on the ability of our Platoon to shout "Yes, sir" without moving and, etc. Yes, we made the screams of the Sound Guys, and it was while filming the scene. As his fellow marines remember, when the DI or who began to ask a question and before completing it, had already taken a breath of air that allowed him to shout at the top of the lungs the appropriate response. This is how it was done. <br /> <br /> "74Sooner" commented on walking through the same building on the island of Paris, however, as I mentioned earlier, all the scenes were filmed in Studio City, California. They were built from photographs taken on the island of Paris and from on-site trips and advisors to the marina on the island of Paris. Sorry, you were in the real buildings, not in the sets. <br /> <br /> "schappe1" brought many positive points, but about the incident with the peloton on the Isle of Paris at the moment when all that Jack Webb said we went, "The movie came up because of the accident, and the Marine Corps did not want to publish anything that could affect any of the Marine family members who died that night, however, the Marine Corps would provide any Marine and the necessary help for a film that answer to the public why a Marine DI does what he does. " <br /> <br /> As some of you mentioned, also at the time that we were filming the scenes I caught my own thoughts. This dialogue has been cleaned up a lot and, obviously, this is not the case in real life. In the 1950s, this is how it had to be done. <br /> <br /> A story that I would like to convey is about the interaction that took place between us, the Marines and the Film Team, and between the Film Team and Jack Webb. From the beginning, according to custom, the Marines answered "Yes, sir" to anyone who moved. At the beginning of the second week, it was increasingly common to hear "Yes, sir" from all directions. On the stage someone would bark out a request to do something with enlightenment and, out of nowhere, on a catwalk on the stage, it would sound a "Yes, sir" response. To all this in one of our informal meetings, said Jack Webb. "If I had known that I would have received so much respect from this team, I would have brought them here years ago." There was a lieutenant raised in San Diego to play the role of DI of the other platoon and with whom Jack Webb fights, but during a shooting session he was at number 32, and still Webb was still trying to work with him. through how he wanted it done and showed no lack of patience with him. The next day they used the adviser from the island of Paris who was a DI sergeant. of the island of Paris and it worked well. <br /> <br /> At that time I was something like a camera enthusiast and I could meet the Fixed Camera Man to get some pointer from him and it turned out that he would give me still photos and part of the movie 35 mm of the daily shoot that was not going to be used. I cut these strips of film and made them slides. After the movie came out on a VHS tape (The DI, 11706 B & W / 106 min.) My children and grandchildren have fun when they try to see who can find me most of the time on the screen.
