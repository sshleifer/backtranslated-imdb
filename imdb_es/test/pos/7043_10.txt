"Rattlesnake! Beware!" "Is that a bra that you carry or are you waiting for an assassination attempt?" "Spaz, what are you a homo or what?" "All right, guys, feed Fink, he's our hot man." "Do you know they use the most sophisticated training methods of the Soviet Union, East and West Germany and the newest Olympic power, Trinidad-Tobago?" "Oh, Spaz, old makeup master!" "What, not mustard?" "Oh my God, his nose is bleeding." "It's going to get even bigger now" "Our political round table ... Henry Kissinger will appear, Yassir Arafat will leave, he will spend a weekend with the children, just rap with them". <br /> <br /> These and many other great lines make Meatballs a comedy hall of fame. Only in Caddyshack is Bill Murray more fun. Probably half of the lines were improvised. The high school actors seemed to have fun being with him in the same movie. <br /> <br /> Hilarious movie to watch at any time of the year, not just in the summer.
