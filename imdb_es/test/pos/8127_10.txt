I seriously enjoyed watching this movie for the first time a few years ago and every time it is broadcast again somewhere (which fortunately happens from time to time on European cable TV) I experience the same thing, it moves me, I entertain myself and end up wishing there. There were more movies like this. <br /> <br /> It's all about Leo (Kevin McKidd) and his group of friends living in the urban area of ​​London, Leo as a gay man following a friend to a fun group of Men of the New Was. and falls in love with the straight man Brendon, played by the handsome James Purefoy, who is not so direct after all. Delivered as supporting characters, there are also the great Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving, whose parallel story is worth watching the film, Simon Callow, the leader of the group of men, which becomes a great performance. But it is really difficult to choose some people here, because each character, the feminine ones like those of Jennifer Ehle, Julie Graham and Harriet Walter, are acted in an exquisite way. Maybe even Kevin McKidd looks a little pale compared to his co-actors, but it benefits his character somewhat tenuous. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this film is simple: there is never only black and white, the classifications are difficult and it can not always stand the test of time. <br /> <br /> Leo identifies himself as gay but ends up falling in love with a woman who turns out to be his teenage girlfriend and Brendon's girlfriend for a long time. Brendon starts right but learns that gay can be more than an option for him and being bisexual can not be so bad after all. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Weaving) are gay and they love it, and even the heterosexual people in the film, like Angie, Leo's roommate, get their fair share of love and fun moments until the end of the movie. The comedy snippets (especially Tom Hollander, which is simply funny) are fun and in themselves, and the emotions are believable, as confusing as they may seem at times to read this summary. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is its genuinely positive notion. If you are gay, straight, bisexual or just are not sure, this movie makes you feel that it is OK NOT to be sure and that "not being sure" can also be something worth living! Sexuality is fluid in this film and none of the main characters seems to have a real problem with it, apart from all the homosexual / heterosexual camp fights with which you sometimes feed in other gay-themed movies. I can only be totally in agreement with the subtext of the film, in that what you feel sure of one day, when you think that you identify as gay, heterosexual, however, may seem very different in another. I've never seen (how to call it?) Bisexuality or maybe just the absence of the segregation of sexual classification that is portrayed in such a moving and faithful way to life. <br /> <br /> This film dares to go where few movies, gays or heterosexuals go, by not playing on the labels and the supposed stereotyping of sex and trusting in that. It goes further and assumes that there may be a life for sex after well-known classifications and I think times are more than ready for that and other films that explore postmodern themes like this. <br /> <br /> And for everyone else who does not care about that, hell, it's just a fun comedy that's worth watching on a rainy Saturday night with popcorn in your hands. Test it! <br /> <br /> I loved it!
