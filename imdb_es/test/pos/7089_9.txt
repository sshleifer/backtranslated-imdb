"One True Thing" is the kind of film in which the audience is inspired to a great extent by very inspired performances. I am not necessarily claiming that the film is edifying, because it is not. In fact, the movie is very depressing. I'm trying to say that it takes a lot for a film to generate emotional tears from an audience. <br /> <br /> I cried in "One True Thing", enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotional. Powerful films of 1998. The characters were perfectly cast. All performances are guaranteed to the Oscar nominees, especially Meryl Streep, who portrays the dying Kate very well. His solo performance was enough to make the film stand out to the point of recommendation, and gives him a new point of view on it. I also thought that Renée Zellweger represented a single, realistic and free woman who has to take care of her own mother. The other cast members, including William Hurt and Tom Everett Scott, were also excellent. The script of this movie was really fantastic. It's kind of funny how the concept of the film has to do with the controversial events in my local area. You see, I live near Lansing, Michigan, and at this moment a big problem here is that the assistant suicide doctor Jack Kavorkian (excuse my misspelling, if so), has just been declared illegal. The public will vote on this according to their beliefs in November. After seeing "One True Thing" it really changed my perspective on this subject, although I have always believed in it. Without revealing the end of the film, I will simply say that suicide is a distant subject in this film and I think it fits exactly with the beautiful story. In general, this film has more emotional impact than "Titanic", "Saving Private Ryan" or any other "tearjerker" released in recent years. I think that's because the main idea of ​​this movie is that this kind of thing happened every day, so it relates better to the audience. And in fact, that this can happen to you.
