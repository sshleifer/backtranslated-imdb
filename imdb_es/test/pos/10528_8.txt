I saw this television version of Christie's mystery story when it was shown on Channel 5 in New York City in 1980. At that time I was surprised that it was not shown on Channel 13, the Public Television Station that showed the greatest Part of the Masterpiece Theater programs, but (aside from some Dorothy Sayers stores "Lord Peter Wimsey," and THE MOONSTONE) the BBC productions rarely dealt with British detective stories. Another series, THE RIVALS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, dealt with stories set in the Victorian and Edwardian period, so a period of enchantment was involved in bringing those stories to Channel 13. <br /> <br /> The plot of POR WHAT DID NOT ASK EVANS? I dealt with a young couple who stumbled upon a dying man whose last words are the question of the title of the story (the novel was originally called WHY THEY DID NOT ASK EVANS?, but it was later renamed THE BOOMERANG CLUE). The young couple begins to investigate the murder and traces the crime to a group of people surrounding a questionable doctor (Eric Porter). Despite warnings from the hero's father (John Gielgud), the hero (James Warwick) and the heroine (Francesca Annis) continue their investigation, even when it becomes more murky and more dangerous. The death of another suspect by suicide increases the apparent dangers as the killer begins to silence the two amateur detectives. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, although I agree that it was too long for a single night. Entertainment (if it had been done as later episodes of Miss Marple with Joan Hickson, or episodes of Hercule Poirot, in two parts would have been better). But it has its strengths. One is the proper use of Porter as the main suspect, and an intelligent scene later in the film where he seems to be spying on the young couple who are investigating the mystery. If you limit yourself to the movie, you will have a good surprise later. <br /> <br /> But it has a flaw. When it comes to a Christie novel, the figures of the story have to be in a rigid schedule of movements so that the reader can discover what is the secret of the plot. I will only add that if you listen to the dialogue at a given moment, and how a small child was almost killed (but it was not), you will find all the parts of the story that come together and what were the villain's motivations. <br /> <br /> Except for that and the long time it takes for the telefilm to tell its story, it's a pretty good movie and worthy of being one of the best programs based on a Christie story in the period that was sudden Renaissance in films based on his novels.
