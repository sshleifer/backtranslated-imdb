You do not have to be a football fan of Notre Dame to enjoy this, because I'm not ... but, as a soccer fan in general, it was fun to watch. It almost makes me an Irish combat devotee. If you can not get carried away by the emotion in this movie, fan of the grill or not, better check your pulse because it is an emotional film with some very moving scenes. <br /> <br /> As a sports fan, I loved seeing the classic images of the first college games. They had some pretty wild plays back then with a lot of wings. They interspersed that recording with Pat O'Brien appearing as head coach Knute Rockne on the sidelines and some of the players, like George Gipp (Ronald Reagan). <br /> <br /> Reagan gets a good turnover in this movie, but his part really is not that big. O'Brien is the only actor with a big role here. The rest, all with friendly characters, includes Gale Page as Rockne's wife "Bonnie"; Donald Crisp, as the "Father John Callahan" of Notre Dame; Albert Bassermann as chemistry teacher "Father Nieuwland" and Reagan, as Gipp, perhaps the most talented and famous player of Notre Dame. <br /> <br /> What this film does very well is to balance personal history with football. None of the angles is exaggerated. The characters here are all the people you can encourage, since there are no villains. In my last look, it was interesting to discover Johnny Sheffield, the son of Tarzan, to play Rockne at the age of seven and to see George Reeves, Superman, on television, as one of the players. <br /> <br /> There have been very few football movies made in Hollywood, for some reason, and very few good ones. This is one of them.
