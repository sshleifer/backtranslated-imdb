Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turnaround in his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this thriller / comedy / road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her not good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a strange kind of amnesia and runs away in her car, not knowing that there is a large cache of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her. <br /> <br /> What Betty is chasing, in addition to a new beginning (although she can not remember previous life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). The only problem is that Dr. David is not real, he is a character in a soap opera on the show "A Reason To Love" and is really a selfish actor named George McCord. <br /> <br /> To say more about what is going on It would be too much, but Nurse Betty is certainly original. His hit men are, like the hitmen of Pulp Fiction, violent but philosophical, his interpretation of telenovelas is a material of imitation, and his performance is the best feature of all. This has to be one of the best supporting films of recent years. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for the nurse Betty, with the constant brightness in her eyes that pushes her in her search. Morgan Freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a murderer at the end of his career, and Chris Rock is his partner, a man of rage and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is at his comic best moment as the vain actor / telenovela doctor. There are also great supporting performances from actors such as Emmy winner Allison Janney (The West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Frasier's agent, Bebe Glazer) and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe in the emergency room). Actually, the cast of support is a Who's Who of the best actors in television. <br /> <br /> A unique film that is funny in one moment and chilling in the next, Nurse Betty is a mix of great acting, casting and an excellent script.
