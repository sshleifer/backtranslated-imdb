Another popular screening for a British movie at the Century theater in Coalville. A solid and well-designed drama with a plot in constant development and 'turns in the story' in progress ... while the lies accumulate! A master class performance by an impeccable cast, well coordinated by the director for the first time Julian Fellowes. Excellent performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson, but good turns by everyone involved, including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was absorbed in this movie, which includes a couple of shock incidents that really make you "jump". A good production adjusted in about 80 minutes, probably produced with a very limited budget, but a success, which should make Fellowes redirect for the big screen. Some publicity for the film seemed to suggest that it was set in the 50s (according to the Nigel Balchin novel), but obviously this is not the case. Recommended viewing
