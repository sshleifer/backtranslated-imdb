Instead of writing a paragraph, I will give four good reasons why 2001 is the best film experience of all time: 1) It is a visual Odyssey that can only be told on the big screen. The special effects he won for Kubrick, his only Oscar, are the most impressive effects before the age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least the most accurate) description of space travel to date. The silence that fills the spatial scenes not only serves its purpose as a precise science, but also contributes to the mood of the film (which will be discussed later with HAL). The fact that Kubrick filmed the scenes of the moon before the landing of the Apollo is a brave but satisfying move. Many have said that in its original release, it was a favorite "travel" movie. I can not think of any other movie that has such amazing images for its time and even of all times (sorry fans of Phantom Menace!) 2) Kubrick's style of direction is fantastic. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as a means to deepen the psychology of his characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other large ones, like Scorsese, but he sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the faces of the characters to give the audience a psychological point of view. Even he uses extreme approaches of the bright red "eye" of HAL to show the coldness and determination of the computerized villain. I could go on, but in summary Kubrick lives up to his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in the history of cinema. I totally agree with the opinion of the late Gene Siskle about HAL 9000. Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself, an atmosphere of isolation is created. Dave and his crew are isolated between Earth and Jupiter, with nowhere to escape. Combine this state of mind with the cold and calculated actions of HAL 9000 and you will have the most fearsome villain you can imagine. Still, although I have seen this movie several times, I feel my chest contract in a particular scene. 4) The controversial ending of 2001 always keeps people away from this movie. Instead of trying to give my opinion on what it means and what my idea of ​​the meaning of 2001 in general is, I would like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the film open. Kubrick has stated that he did not want to open 2001 for debate. He left his meaning in the hands of the spectator. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick allowed his film to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion about man's past, present and future. The beauty of 2001 is that the ending does not have to mean anything deep, it can simply be an explanation based on the plot and the whole movie can be seen as an entertaining journey through space. No other film, except the great citizen Kane, is left open to discussion like the one in 2001. It is truly destined to be a surrealist journey that involves not only the eye but also the mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for Phantom Menace, rent a 2001 widescreen edition and enjoy the best cinematic experience.
