I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV ads and, to be honest, I did not know how much I would like it. Last night I turned on the TV and I was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest and simple movie that attracts you from the beginning. Rupert Grint brilliantly plays the role of the socially awkward teenager Ben. He is definitely one to keep in mind in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the film, for me, was Evie's rather colorful poem. It shows how friendships can be formed between the most unlikely couples. In my opinion, watching the driving lessons is an excellent way to spend 2 hours. The landscape was also surprising, especially the countryside. Anyone who can call this brilliant comedy forgettable, I totally disagree with
