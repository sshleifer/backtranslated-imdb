I just watched this movie at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival. While watching the movie, I had the feeling of having seen a movie with a similar story before ... a movie with Ray Liotta, but I can not remember much. Of course, this is much more dramatic, especially in the end. <br /> <br /> This is the story: Emilio's life becomes a lie that he can no longer bear. After 20 years lying about his life to his wife, his son and all the people he knows, the truth is pursuing him and there is nowhere to go. after a while you get tired of the same thing ... the romance with a young girl was supposed to announce something, but it is not like that. In spite of that, the film is still fun, exciting and immersive. Or it makes you want to help Emilio with his lies or help everyone to catch him. I liked analogies, photography and good performances. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10.
