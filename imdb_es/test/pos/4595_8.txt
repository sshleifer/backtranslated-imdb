I've never seen a movie get a release worse than this. And that's a shame, since this is the funniest movie of the year! You would think that an ad with the line "From the director of" Office Space "" would be enough to guarantee a great release! But there are no ads, no posters, no website, I doubt that the stars knew that it came out this weekend. What is 20th Century Fox thinking? Mike Judge's sci-fi comedy is set in 2505, but could come true in about 10 years (if things continue as they are) Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph are frozen in a secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of consumers. Zero inbreeding delays. The film reminds me of "Sleeper" by Woody Allen, "RoboCop", "Planet of the Apes", "Blade Runner" and "Network" and the late "Futurama". Try to see it before Fox burns all the impressions!
