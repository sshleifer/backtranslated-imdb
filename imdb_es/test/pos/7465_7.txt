This movie starts a little slow but starts up quickly. Each of the three "teen girls" offers their own credible, distinct, assertive and entertaining personalities. I especially enjoyed the dialogue and interaction between Keith and Lisa. If one looked beyond the superficial "action" that was taking place, the character of Keith treated Lisa's "defloration" with tenderness and consideration. The comic development that followed was also done expertly in my opinion. David Boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult man who clearly gets into more trouble than he can handle. The dialogue was sharp, fast and flowed very well. The director and writer of this film clearly showed that none of the main characters could claim moral ground after all the scams they took. Although the film seems to be light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult, human emotions and desires.
