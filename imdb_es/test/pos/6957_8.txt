This is a good movie, underestimated, and Rip Torn, known as him, is a seriously underestimated actor. I read the novel by Howard Frank Mosher many years ago. How well Craven captures the book and beauty of the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont! I was fortunate to grow in VT in the 40s and 50s and still lived there when the "Irasburg Incident" took place. I have not seen _Stranger in the Kingdom_, the Craven / Mosher collaboration based on the incident (and another Mosher novel), but this movie has inspired me to locate it.
