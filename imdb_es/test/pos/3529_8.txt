One of the many horrors that emerged in the early eighties and, fortunately, this is one of the best. Yes, it has a cheesy plot, but I was pleasantly surprised by this film, because I thought it was really good and entertaining, although the killer could have become a little more terrifying, he just looked like a fat bum. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains because they are very dangerous. But when teenagers arrive, it does not seem very dangerous at all, well, according to my opinion. It's a pity we do not have movies like this any longer, and if we do, it's usually a boring and terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is based more on tension and fear than on the gore, because the gore The factor is really low in this movie that I was not satisfied with, but other than that, it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> In general, you will have to search a lot to find this movie and if you find it, you will like it and also be careful to finish with the final girl and the murderer. It is not what you would expect.
