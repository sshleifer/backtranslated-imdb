Six teenagers go to an old abandoned remote school where 27 years ago there was a horrible massacre for a night of fun and jokes. Instead, the children get entangled with the ruthless security guard gone mad (excellently played with an extremely spooky threat by the Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy) who committed the unpleasant murders. The director Carlos Gil tells the intriguing story at a good pace and does a great job creating a mysterious and fascinating atmosphere. The ingenious script by Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgueras offers an ingenious and inspired combination of supernatural elements that make the spectator guess until the end. The ingenious photography of Fernando Arribas makes an expert use of light and shadow. David San José's grumpy score also works. The young, attractive and attractive cast, contributes to animated and attractive presentations, with turns especially worthy of praise of Carlos Fuentes as ringleader Ramon, Olivia Molina as María panic, Zoe Berriatua as the unpleasant joker Jordi, and Carmen Morales as spunky goth chick Sandra The murder pieces are as bloody and brutal as they should be. Fantastic blow of a dark end surprise, too. A solid and satisfying shocker.
