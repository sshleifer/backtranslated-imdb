It's not as good as the movie, he said it's a nice show for children. Well, the Emperor has slipped back and become a selfish brat once again, accept it and enjoy the caricature as something entertaining. He has a lot of jokes for the parents and still keeps the attention of the children. He also has two of the original voice actors in the film. Earth Kitt who has been in numerous movies, but I am sure that many people know him as Catwoman. And Patrick Walburton (sorry if I wrote wrong), who also appeared in many movies and TV series, but is more recognized as The Tick. It is really a rare and wonderful combination. If, for no other reason, I recommend comic fans to watch at least one episode to enjoy the dynamic duo. In short, entertaining show for children, with a lot of internal jokes for adults to laugh with them. If you are looking for educational value this is not your program. If you are just looking for something fun, this is an excellent choice for Saturday morning!
