"Dirty War" by Daniel Percival, a BBC production made for television, was recently shown on cable. The film has a documentary style in the way it persecutes the people who caused the near holocaust in one of the great metropolises of the world, London. In fact, this film, produced in 2004, is almost a warning of the events of the following year, in which terrorists placed explosive devices on public transport that killed innocent people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. <Br /> <br /> The film impresses with the rhythm that the director and the production team gave to the project. There are no boring moments in the movie as we watch the preparation of the terrorists and the people who are following their dirty work. Although the inevitable happens, it is incredible to think what the consequences would be if a real "dirty bomb" were placed in such a densely populated area. <br /> <br /> The latest images in the movie have a chilling effect. The scenes of the mafia and the way the whole area is polluted send chills of fear, thinking how it could happen anywhere.
