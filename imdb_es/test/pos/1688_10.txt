The first time I saw this movie in mid-January (2005) I did not like it. I thought it was too weird and I thought that some parts in which the main star, Judith Light, acted were so different from her. (Which, of course, is true) And then I saw fragments the next day when it was reissued and I felt the same. Then I saw it again two Sundays (March 20, 2005) and I started to enjoy it and this time I recorded everything. I even cried the first 2 times, but mainly because the actress was crying and I'm a big fan of her. <br /> <br /> It is a very well acted and made television movie. Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does an excellent job in this movie. I keep seeing it again and again. It's a sad movie, but very good. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it! It's not usually my type of movie, but I enjoyed it! A +++
