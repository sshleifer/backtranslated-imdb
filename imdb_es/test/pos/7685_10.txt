I was about 20 years old and I graduated from college when this movie appeared. Seeing it was an event of great impact, not only because of the high quality of the film (as evidenced by its numerous awards), but because of its place in the historical context of 1959. Due to social progress since then, it is almost impossible to understand that my university had barely begun to admit black students (carefully selected) in 1953. An extravagant high-budget general with an almost entirely black cast was a distinct novelty in 1959. <br /> <br /> The film was given a presentation of luxury in roadshow (reserved seat) only in the best theaters, with a souvenir program that details the splendid care that had been taken with the lighting and color, the stereo sound of several tracks, etc. Almost all the black artists that we, the whites, had The knowledge of was in the movie. The music of Gershwin, superbly performed, and the universal humanity of the story was tremendously moving. <br /> <br /> I was recently able to obtain a faded copy of a two-hour cut of the film, and the repeated presentations have confirmed my opinion. Time has made what seemed like torrid sex scenes in 1959 seem quite docile, but the musical quality has not diminished. Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their performances. What a crime that young black artists of today can not see these artists at the top of their careers!
