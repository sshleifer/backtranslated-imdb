I just watched the movie "15 park avenue", which was the first nighttime movie at the Asian society film festival of Asian society in New York. I was really touched by the theme of this film and also the excellent portrait of "mithi". by the main actor, konkona sen sharma. I have one word for everyone who reads this comment, run to get a copy of this jewel and see it. My most sincere thanks to the director for his part that he has done an excellent job again. I like this appears once in the blue moon and I was lucky enough to see this movie on the screen and I also participated in a post-discussion / question and answer session with konkona sen sharma. In a simple word "a wonderful experience".
