I never saw anything of John Leguizamo's stand-up before seeing Freak, and after seeing him again in the HBO comedy recently, he was better, more animated and with things that, at the age of 14, he could not understand enough before . Spike Lee did a wonderful job of directing, keeping the visual angle on par with Leguizamo's theatricality and personal narrative style; It's substance and style that blend, but discreetly. We get Leguizamo's criticisms about race and sex (the sex parts are classic), but many of them are about the family, and what I still have in mind is about his father. Even when things get dark in some of the stories, there is something new or crazy or random that Leguizamo takes out to laugh, and works more often than not. If something falls flat (for me anyway) it could be his personality tics here and there. But in general, it's the kind of fun stuff that is not flashy, but it's so true to itself that it stings. Find it if you can!
