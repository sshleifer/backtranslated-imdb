This has to be the best movie of all time (in my opinion). It really taught me when I saw when I was 10 years old (in 2000) that the freedom of a being a child escapes sooner than we expect. Joseph Mazzello also has to be my favorite actor, and I think he and Elijah Wood did a great job in the role of the brothers. This movie is pretty sad, and some people do not understand the ending. But the story itself is pretty incredible, the idea of ​​a battered drunken father being mistreated by a 7-year-old drunken stepfather is horrible, and what the two kids do about it is sad and important. My favorite part of the movie is when Tom Hanks (Major Mike) lists the 7 things of being a child lost in the adult world. However, there are some parts that could have been done better in this movie, such as the casting of the mother (Lorraine Braco), which I think is a horrible actor. "the king" played his role well, since it is a difficult role to play. José and Elías were definitely the stars of the movie. I could not believe how well they played as victims of an abusive stepfather, considering how old they were (7 and 9). But in general, I recommend this movie to anyone, who loves great children's actors, and a great movie. :)
