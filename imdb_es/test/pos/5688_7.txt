I had never heard of this Australian horror before the enthusiastic critique of Michael Elliott; In fact, after having read it, I decided to check if the DVD was available in my local rental store and it was (although in a German edition, that is, without the extras of the R1), so I opted to watch the movie immediately. <br /> <br /> While I would not go so far as to give you a full grade? I only get a few selected titles from me, not to mention a dark modern movie? I have to say that I was quite impressed with BLACK WATER. Instead of looking back to previous crocodile films, such as ALLIGATOR (1980) and LAKE PLACID (1999), it evokes the memory of two who saw a small group of people go on a trip, get lost and find themselves mercy of The elements and the creatures that inhabit the place? Namely, LONG WEEKEND (1978), an unseen but impressive Australian production, and OPEN WATER (2005). <br /> <br /> The compact film with a simple plot involves a couple and the younger sister of the woman who decides to go fishing in a remote and forbidden area of ​​the Australian desert, known as crocodile territory; very soon (in fact, even before 15 minutes have passed!), his boat capsized and the guide was killed by an alligator. Thus our adventurers without luck take refuge in a tree. The DVD Talk critic believes that the movie suffers from spending too much time in this location. With the three of them discussing what they should do, try to retrieve the boat, find a way out of the jungle through the trees (only to find nothing but water) and the monster's occasional attack. However, I believe that the creators take the situation as far as possible without falling into tedium: this is due to the palpable suspense and, as Michael said, to the credibility of the characters (particularly the two women), but also to the done The crocodile here is one of the most terrifying and memorable of recent memory (I wonder how they did it)! <br /> <br /> I also agree with Mike that the movie contains some really effective moments of shock. the alligator that jumps out of the water to bite the petrified heroes; his head suddenly emerges in front of the women as they go to the ship; Although one of them arrives at the vehicle, the monster manages to lift its enormous weight and get on the boat with it! towards the end, while the same girl manages to find a weapon (in the destroyed body of her guide), loads it and waits for the alligator to appear, the latter sneaks in behind her (by the way, the creature is awarded The Shark's Cunning in JAWS [1975]). With this in mind, the ending is so pleasant (although on an obviously smaller scale) as the classic Spielberg box office success. Even if you have a downbeat tracking. Another definitive asset is the poor score of the film? which is usually quite charming, but it becomes disconcerting at the right times. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, BLACK WATER emerges as a breath of fresh air in the face of the demoralization of the collapse of the horror cinema. has fallen in recent times; just for this reason, deserves more exposure to remind us that there is still hope for our beloved genre (without the real need to resort to the tricks of CLOVERFIELD [2008] to get attention)?
