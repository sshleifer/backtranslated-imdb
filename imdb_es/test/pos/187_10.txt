I have no words to describe the beauty of "The cranes are flying", but I will try to write anyway. It is a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in World War II. It is the classic story of lovers (Boris and Veronika) separated by war and what stands between them. The images of the film are so beautiful that they will let you go, the technique of the film is in perfect harmony with the emotion. <br /> <br /> There are few scenes that directly portray the war: a bombing, wind, lightning. Explosions that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist, Veronika, who awaits the return of Boris. and there is another scene in the front, where we will face an emotional / visual hurricane that shows the images reproduced in the mind of Boris. Another scene works as the thread of the film and provides its title: the cranes that fly in the sky. This image is the symbol of nature and its seasons, and underlines the final message of the film: Do not give up hope and fight for a better future. <br /> <br /> Kalatozov is a great director, this film is visually stunning and also deeply moved me. It is not just pure technique. <br /> <br /> Tatyana Samojlova is perfect like Veronika. What more can I say? The film transcends the moment it was made: the action takes place during the Second World War. But it could have happened at any time and anywhere. While there are wars (big or small), the film and its message will continue to be relevant.
