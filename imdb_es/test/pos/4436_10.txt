When Nathaniel Kahn embarked on this trip, he hardly knew who his father really was. At the end of the film, he found it and came to an agreement with the strange life he lived as a child. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn was the father. He was an architect's architect. Perhaps his designs were too complex, as he tried to create buildings that did not conform to popular trends at that time. It is ironic that he has never achieved such fame for some of his contemporaries. He had a vision and never left it. We can see the characteristics of his unique style in the buildings he left behind as a legacy for humanity. Each of his creations are unique, since they do not imitate works of other architects. <br /> <br /> The life of Louis Kahn was quite complicated. He was married, but had relations with two of his assistants who produced a girl and a boy, in addition to the legitimate daughter he had with his wife. <br /> <br /> As a child, Nathaniel Kahn's life was lived in an isolated area, far from his father, who only visited late at night. Louis Kahn never recognized these children, although it is very clear that everyone knew about the existence of others. <br /> <br /> It is tragic that Louis Kahn died alone at the Grand Central station when he was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children he never recognized as his own at his side. He probably cared a lot for all his children, but he is still a distant figure throughout the film. We never know man, although in the end, Nathaniel, in his quest to discover his father's life, finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is a personal story of life. of an artist. Thanks to that son, who has the courage to tell the story, we are almost intruding on the lives of Louis Kahn and his extended family.
