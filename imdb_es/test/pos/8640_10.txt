David Lynch's ninth feature film, Mulholland Drive, is a deeply moving story about betrayal and jealousy. In any case, brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes with the often bitter truth. Each frame of this film has importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. Nothing is what seems to be first and you are left with a real puzzle while you finish trying to put the pieces together. It is a film that does not compromise, or fail to fully handle the defiant form and language of the camera, as could have been the case before with Lost Highway. <br /> <br /> Although one clearly recognizes the classic motifs of Lynchian and On the devices, the film is still very original, even taking into account that it is a Lynch movie. Lost Highway marked a new way of telling a story; It generated an unconventional means of putting emotions on the screen. With Mulholland Drive, Lynch not only managed to control this technique, but it takes it to new levels to make it much more complex and multidimensional. By doing this, it creates a framework of different layers in time and of the human mind. In a press conference about the 2001 Cannes film festival, David Lynch said that, at best, striving for perfection could give a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Talking about synergies like this one becomes highly relevant for Mulholland Dr. where the different sequences and many details contribute to the total; The oneiric and parallel landscapes intertwine to create the story. In some art, the beauty of this lies in its simplicity. This is not the case with Mulholland Drive, and has never been with Lynch. It is the complexity that color and build the worlds that Lynch creates, the same complexity that characterizes the real world. <br /> <br /> It's never forced like, in my opinion, for example, Memento, using an original way of communicating with viewers. In addition to comparing Mulholland Drive with other films, I think it demonstrates David Lynch as a master of what makes and unites art and filmmaking in a way that nobody has ever done. Compared to, say, Alejandro Jodorowsky or the contemporary Matthew Barney, I think Lynch manages more clearly not to allow the artist to dominate the filmmaker or, more likely, David Lynch to understand and better execute the creation of films as a way of art. <br /> <Understanding the plot is not a small feat, but the way Lynch works with sound, perspective, chronology and form paints a work of art so dark and terrifying that it sometimes seems more realistic than real life Lynx cinema is often, and definitely on Mulholland Drive, a wave of human emotions. Working with emotions is a delicate art that demands understanding and depth. As Lynch puts it: "A little too much, and the emotion disappears, a little too much, and it does not happen". On Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has no problem making this assessment. Lynch's portraits cover all kinds of dimensions and take different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. See Mulholland Drive is a journey through the subconscious. It is a truthful and naked film with an indisputable artistic value. That's why I love Mulholland Drive and what took it to the heyday of film history. The last movie.
