I was not sure of this film before renting it and I did it with the assurance that Hilary Swank had always given excellent performances in her films. She seems to rely on moderation to get the emotional impact she does. And she did not show me that I was wrong in this movie. <br /> <br /> However, the film also had fantastic performances from all the other cast members, whether they spoke or not. I have to highlight Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor, the two main characters, for their outstanding interpretation skills and the representation of true human feelings and failures. The whole movie was almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I must applaud Tom Hooper as director and Avril Beukes as editor for maintaining a multi-layered story that unfolds without problems, while dialogue and action progress in an understandable way. Fashion. The initial sequence of the South African landscape was amazing and I had to press the pause button to savor the picture. <br /> <br /> Why can a film like this one never be nominated for an international prize? I think you press the high rating button in all aspects. It was not just a movie, it was a true experience of life in a country that came out of apartheid. A life of poverty was everywhere, but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.
