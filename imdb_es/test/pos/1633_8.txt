Where the Da Vinci Code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his ability to solve riddles, Angels and Demons increases the stakes by offering a huge puzzle with an 8-hour limit. <br /> <br /> With a cast of award-winning actors, Ron Howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code threw you so many angles in such a short time that a short break in the bathroom would leave you a bit confused when you return. I did not feel that this was with Angels and Demons, the plot was direct and the action kept the level of interest at its highest point. <br /> <br /> Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the movie. His representation of the elitist rank, although misunderstood by the Catholic Church was very good and, combined with the victim of his Camerlengo treatment Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), he will find himself choosing immediately after the introduction. There is not a lot of time from Tom Hanks, since the film focuses more on the story than on the development of the character, and I did well because I had a more than enough introduction from the first film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he discovered that the character of Ayelet Zurer, Vittoria Vetra, was an unnecessary assistant in the search, since his lines were a bit limited and seemed very similar to a late occurrence. She plays a key role in the beginning of things, but soon fades in the background to be the "relative" of Langdon more than a necessary partner. <br /> <br /> The plot is, as such, one of the organizations. that the Catholic Church was wrong in the past (there have been many) has sought revenge in the most artistic way. Some men in the church are kidnapped and are scheduled to be executed at specific times until the final end of the church occurs. Dr. Robert Landon is taken to help decipher the clues and joins the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed the death of a colleague at the hands of the church's enemy. <br /> <br /> Music is still relevant and beautiful cinematography, could talk about these things of low status, but what makes Angels and Demons work is their conclusion. It was, by far, one of the most amazing endings I've seen in a movie and I was shocked at how unprepared I was when it hit me. Like any other person, I appreciate a great summary and this film concludes it quite well and drops a nice tie on it. Needless to say, I left the theater pleased with the movie in its entirety. <br /> <br /> If you are religious and insecure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where the DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shadowy group of sadists, Angels and Demons paint them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even some who have infiltrated their modern ranks.
