Woohoo! An incredible and lost piece of Australian And a movie of glam-rock lost of the 70 in one. This movie deserves to be seen simply to see what can be done without almost budget, but with great enthusiasm. As a retelling of the story of Oz, the film is bound to be too obvious, but it is saved by its eccentricities. The opportunity to glimpse how the glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This movie used to be presented with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the kind of movie Oz is. While it's not as frivolous or as well-built as RHPS, it's hard not to have fun with Oz. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Oz has aged well, perhaps as a by-product of the determination of the real Australia of 1976.. The passage of the story shows that many of the ideas that are being explored will eventually enter the mainstream. The willingness of the film to give prominence to homosexual characters is remarkable, especially because it goes back to the period of "revolution" for the promotion of the rights of Australian homosexuals. <br /> <br /> The performances range from a tireless brightness to a finely nuanced brilliance. Management lacks subtlety and much of the dialogue may have benefited from one or two additional drafts. Somehow, these flaws add to the appeal of the film, which is fortunately unpretentious. As in Australia, in the 1970s, this film has a certain naive charm. <br /> <br /> There are several connections with the original Australian performances of the Rocky Horror Show, which will keep the obsessive on alert. <br /> <br /> Oz is undoubtedly a minor classic and a potential favorite cult worth reviewing. Laugh at the atrocious fashion of the 70s, get along with the soundtrack of AusRock, leave ANY expectation at the door and it is likely that Oz will be delighted.
