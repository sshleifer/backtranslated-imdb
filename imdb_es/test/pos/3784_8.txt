"Shoulder Arms" by Charles Chaplin, 1918, was his longest film to date; however, with just over 45 minutes in length, it was not a feature film. With the First World War coming to an end, many popular artists of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the adorable wanderer went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept even in the simplest military simulations, such as marching and firing weapons, much to the chagrin of his sergeant. The vagabond is then in the trenches, facing a more formidable enemy, although the Germans eventually become infinitely more incompetent than himself. The riotous moment when the Vagabond declares that he alone captured thirteen German soldiers "surrounding them" made me sew. <br /> <br /> There are many other great moments in this movie. Chaplin waking up to find his barracks to sleep underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious, as is his ingenious use of a turntable tube to sleep beneath the surface. <br /> <br /> However, the most The memorable scenes in the film no doubt involve Chaplin hiding behind enemy lines disguised as a tree. The reactions of the clumsy German soldiers, without knowing it, a few meters from a sworn enemy, since they are disabled one by one, are very funny, especially when a soldier seizes an ax with the intention of cutting a tree to obtain firewood. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice movie, and one of Chaplin's best before 1920. Highly recommended.
