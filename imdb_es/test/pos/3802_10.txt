This has to be one of the most magnificent things I've seen in the movie. I do not know if it's as serious as it seems to be, but that does not matter. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. Packaging and marketing only do it more because you know that many times a mother has to reprogram her daughter to accept our reality after he verifies this in the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the road map, for one thing! And where else in America can you see a ten-year-old boy swear as much as this and then lose his eye for the perverted rival of Zed's Pulp Fiction? And that food inspector scene is the best! The number of recognized actors in this movie is one of the best things: soon, much earlier than you realize, you will also find yourself saying: "Is that meat pie? Is it Drew Barrymore? Star Trek: Voyager? Is that Flea? Is he the owner of the Twin Peaks sawmill that spends squirrels with car exhaust? And is not this type of Rob Zombie's new movie? He looks a lot like Shrek. I think my favorite scene is at the end, with Phil in the whole body. I mean, please, why do not more movies like this show on airplanes? This director has almost nothing in his name but Return to Salem's Lot, but it shows the true genius of the man-child in this creation! If you are an intellectual looking for something to waste your evening, I recommend this movie for your satisfaction. The plot of this movie is too ridiculous, but imagine it out of context: * boy fighting with an arm over an aggressive Meat Loaf, who seems determined to eliminate his anger for not being accepted in Guns N Roses, look over his shoulder and see . Voyager's doctor enters the bar * Can you imagine what any half-brain channel surfer active during the last six years would think to see that? Now imagine if you really cared about Meat Loaf or Voyager to start! Or imagine if you're a fan of fleas. Fans of Rocky Horror Picture Show, this movie contains remarkable music, of course, but its soundtrack is more clay than Mad Max 3. What does that imply for you? This is the inverted mongoloid cousin, sister-mother-puppy of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. How about when Gus's sleeve flies back to his arm in an act of special-effect quality mastery with cable access? When I saw this movie, it was at the suggestion of my cousin that I had seen half of it in a half conscious childhood attack in the first half of the nineties and that since then it has been haunted by vague memories of it. I did not sleep in three days. He made me laugh! Of course, it is also an anxiety movie. The music does not encourage the suspense, but eventually it reaches the point where it has been fully established that the US Censorship Committee has obviously missed this movie completely and absolutely anything can happen in it and, probably, every time Gus rotate in a corner or view as much as it changes the angles of the camera. I found myself obsessed with the possibility that those letters would fly out the window at any time. Watch this movie. Amazing!
