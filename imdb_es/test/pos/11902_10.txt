I was lucky enough to see a screening test of 'The Godfather' a couple of months ago in Santa Monica. I was amazed. You do not watch movies like this anymore. In the Scosese line, Chapa cleverly tells Kilo's tragic story as he maneuvers through the difficult streets of Los Angeles to rise above the ranks and become a drug dealer of Escobar proportions. The characters are complex and conflicting. The emotions are real. The action is fast and furious. The tricks are expansive. And Tilly is HOT. She has not looked so good since her "tied" days. I would recommend it to anyone. It's a fantastic tribute to the epic action movies of the late 80's and early 90's. And to all the detractors there are? Look at it again Obviously you had your eyes closed the first time. Congratulations to everyone involved in the film. I'm counting the days until the sequel comes out. Does anyone have an appointment in that?
