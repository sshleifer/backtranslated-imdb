Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a highly rated anime on almost every page of reviews you'll find on the web. So I really wanted to know why, and I was not disappointed at all. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the very strange (but quite fun) first episode, you will find yourself in a very entertaining and very entertaining place. strange world. A world very well drawn, perfectly animated, that is to say. <br /> <br /> I can not tell much of the story without spoiling it, so I'll just say it's a high school comedy ... and it still is not. I really can not say what it is about. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'm a HUGE anime fan, and I have about 50 full series, and I'm not kidding when I say that. Although I have not finished seeing Haruhi Suzumiya, it's actually in a very high range. high in my personal collection. I fell in love with it at first sight, and I assure you that, at least, you will not be indifferent to its irresistible charm. Trust me, I do not give a 10 for everything I see.
