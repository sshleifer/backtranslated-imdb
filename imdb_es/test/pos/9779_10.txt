Here we have a miniseries, which delights in its flaws, and does not make us tremble because of them ... it's an excellent narrative, which fuses black comedy, companionship (in a positive way), the pathetic waste of war, without the Total and unadulterated manipulation of a scammer like Life is Beautiful ... is an entertainment, not the meaning of life ... and shows the talent of actors both young and old ... try it out and tell us what you think ...
