I really wanted to see The Guardian, but when I entered the theater I was not in the mood for that at that particular moment. It's like the Olive Garden, I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I'm not exactly sure what it was that moistened my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the theme of the water was giving me bad flashbacks from Kevin Costner's latest movie, Waterworld. Also, despite the promise that Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely convinced of him. Something about the boy just bothers me. It probably has to do with his ape features. <br /> <br /> It took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my doubts to fade. The movie throws us right away in the middle of a tense rescue mission, and I clung more to the Kenny Rogers face lift. My concerns were briefly angered by Kutcher's initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a hard toothpick in his mouth, and a mocking smile that would make George Clooney proud. Yes, we understand it. I was totally prepared to hate him. <br /> <br /> But then he had to go to a very strong performance and force me to soften my blows. <br /> <br /> Damn you, monkey man! By efficiently blending tense, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor and solid acting, The Guardian is easily a movie that I dare say most audiences will enjoy. You can object to their clich√©s, predictability and the rare moments of annealed sappiness, but none of that takes away entertainment value. <br /> <br /> I had the bad feeling that the pace would slow down too much when Costner started coaching the youngsters, but on the contrary, the training sessions could be the most interesting aspect of the film. The Coast Guard Rescue Guardians are heroes whose stories have never really been represented on the big screen, so I feel the internal vision of what happens and how difficult it is to make it very informative and an excellent way to introduce you to the hearings. -group appreciated. <br /> <br /> Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think: you can go on dangerous missions in cold, dark and rough waters, and then you must fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia and lack of oxygen while trying to help the trapped and panicked people who depend on you. for its survival. And if all that is not bad enough, sometimes you can not save everyone, so you have to make the difficult decision of who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> Man, who wants all that responsibility? I do not! I had no idea what it was really like for these guys, and who would have thought I'd have to thank an Ashton Kutcher / Kevin Costner movie for their education? <br /> <br /> The Guardian not only does a great job in paying tribute to this rare breed of hero, but, luckily for us, it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers. <br /> <br /> THE GIST <br /> <br /> Movie fans who want a look inside what it is like to embark on a bold rescue mission in the middle of the ocean may want to give The Guardian. I saw it for free, but if I had paid, I would have felt that I had earned the value of my money.
