Well, it's okay, maybe it's not perfect, but it was pretty close. This film jumped from the criminal drama to the romantic comedy of the fools and returned so quickly that it looked like two different movies playing simultaneously and then joined again at the end. But they did it without problems, and some in the theater found that the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) were also fun. I almost vomited, but I think that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. It has the ability to perform those too dramatic soap scenes with the right facial expressions and voice intonations. His scenes with Betty seem to be taken from "Sleepless in Seattle" or some other romantic comedy like that. You almost forgot that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are looking for Betty. Morgan Freeman's fascination with Betty was pretty creepy, considering it could practically be his grandfather, but the scenes he's talking about with his picture are definitely worth a laugh! Chris Rock's performance seems more like wood, but it has its moments. Renee Zellweger is as sweet as Betty, the lovely waitress of the raw and unfaithful husband who treats her like trash. It's very unlikely that she really would have gotten a job in a hospital without real credentials, but, hey, it's a movie, just go ahead! Her roommate, Rosa, also shines, like a woman who cares about Betty, but does not know how to treat Betty's disease. And finally, there's Crispin Glover. As a fan of his, I naturally thought that the movie could have been more fun if I had been more into it. No one else has the same acting style as Crispin, and the discussion between Chris Rock, Crispin and the sheriff about the soap opera is very funny. I guess I'm saying that I really liked this movie! If you can stand blood, violence and a lot of obscene language, it's worth seeing and it will give you a lot of laughs!
