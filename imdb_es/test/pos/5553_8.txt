This is a great romantic comedy about love, work, public taste and the crisis of middle age. The main character is a talented film director who decides to make a silly PG-13 movie to get rid of the IRS. It has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from deadpan to slapstick) and good writing. It is also an ironic dispatch of the film industry. The metacommentary includes several excellent cuts between reality and the film that is being made, and in some places the film departs from strict realism. The result is a multidimensional masterpiece of the ironic humor of middle age.
