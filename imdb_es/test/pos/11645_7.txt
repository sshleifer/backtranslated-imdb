Before watching this film, I suggest that the viewer leave aside any expectation that the victims of the crimes described will get the same treatment and consideration as the author. There have been many movies about crime victims. This is about the killer. <br /> <br /> "Dead Man Walking" finds realism in the simplicity of the story: there are no crack lawyers who come to save William Poncelet and there are no dramatic twists in the story. The film does not try to put it in a good light; He is guilty, disgusted, racist and responsible for atrocious murders. Given all this, we are asked to do something very difficult: look at him as a human being in spite of his crimes. In this way, the film challenges the idea that the death penalty provides "justice". Whether he is in favor of or against the death penalty, the film raises questions about whether the culprit can find redemption, inequality in the justice system and the appropriateness of the death penalty. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. In particular, the last moments of the film show the true depth of Penn's ability.
