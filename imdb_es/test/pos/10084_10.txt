We open in a doctor's room of some kind. A girl is escorted to a seat in front of the doctor. He asks you questions. The silence continues. Keep asking questions, ignoring the traumatized environment of the girls. <br /> <br /> The story is about two girls that they take home, after spending time in a mental home after an 'incident' that happened before. Upon arrival, they are greeted by their stepmother, which is very difficult to be, but which is very bad, for which the girls obviously have resentment. As time goes by at home, the evil stepmother finds new ways to torment girls. And, to top it off, there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls recover ... <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing. It has twists, turns, and it definitely leaves you a lot to think without making sense. The relationship between the two girls is so comforting that it almost makes you cry at some points (I know I had a tearful moment of two, specifically "the closet scene"). But what I like most about this movie is the total feeling of fear through rolling credits. The soundtrack is impeccable, the furniture in the house and the use of color are fantastic. A pure joy for the eyes. This is a must see for all fans of Asian movies. OR ANY kind of movie fan! An easy 10/10.
