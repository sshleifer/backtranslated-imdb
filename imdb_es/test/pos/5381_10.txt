"The Brotherhood of Satan" is one of the most underrated horror films of all time. Why it has not reached a cult status surpasses me. This is a chilling tale of horror and witchcraft that contains one of the most powerful and disturbing climaxes of The Annals of Horror on the screen. In the small American city, some children have disappeared and their parents have been violently murdered. What is the cause of hysteria? The movie is really strange, some scenes are really disconcerting and definitely not easily forgotten. above, the acting is really good, and the climax is strange and disturbing. Take a look at this forgotten jewel of satanic horror. Absolutely recommended.
