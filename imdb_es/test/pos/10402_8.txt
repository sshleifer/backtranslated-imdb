A documentary filmmaker explores apparently unrelated paranormal incidents connected by the legend of an ancient demon called "kagutaba". <br /> <br /> Because of its appearance, the film looks like one of those camcorder movies that have been popular these past few months, including one that will be released next week (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY)! However, unlike films like CLOVERFIELD, REC and BLAIR WITCH, where most of these films are in total chaos and chaos with all the tremor, this is basically shown in a traditional documentary style. It has television excerpts and interviews, and the fears are very subtle, well, excluding the last 20 minutes in which we enter into the chaos effect and where the fear factor increases enormously. <br /> <br /> And it works. The movie is very fascinating and makes you think. Yes, you heard me right: it makes you think. You have to pay attention to the unrelated details that are given throughout the film and the reward is excellent when, in the course of the film, these things begin to intertwine with each other. The movie is also very slow, which, in this case, is a good thing. We, as a public, can absorb the details that are shown on the screen, however subtle or blatant they may be. <br /> <br /> Above all, it is a small and terrifying movie. I am a person who is afraid of ghosts and paranormal rather than murderers who eliminate teen victims, so yes, the movie gave me some nightmares. There are some images here that are really disturbing to watch, including one closer to the end where it makes you go "What am I looking at ?!" Well, it's better to leave it unanswered. There are around ten recurring characters here, all of whom gave authentic performances in their roles. <br /> <br /> The only thing I do not like about the movie is the ending because most of the questions are left unanswered. The question "Is that all?" although it was my mind. It left a bad taste in my mouth. However, the rest of the movie is simply fascinating and really scary. Do not see this alone in the dark because you will regret that choice. Also, in a couple of years I can see that Hollywood would make this movie again. That will be interesting.
