The characters of Ma & Pa Kettle were very popular and controversial. The films they presented to their children paved the way for the television comedies that came later and tried to emulate their winning formula. An obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies', where the new house was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say that the comedy of the 1980s 'Newhart' borrows his idea of ​​backward rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, did no more harm than good. Their interpretation of the Hillbilly characters makes them the target of many jokes in terms of their supposed negligence and laziness. (The real-life family that Macdonald based the Kettles on, successfully sued ... alleging that they had been ridiculed and humiliated by these unflattering references). Sure, it's a comedy and situations bring us lots of laughs and funny moments ... and political correctness, as we know it today, did not exist in the forties and fifties. But I think Macdonald could still have written these characters more sensibly and Universal International could have had their writers show them on screen with more dignity (there's something like good taste). The most realistic moments are when the eldest son Tom is ashamed of his rural heritage, but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are. For their part, the Kettles must realize that they do not exactly fit into a modern world. That's not a joke ... that's a sober truth.
