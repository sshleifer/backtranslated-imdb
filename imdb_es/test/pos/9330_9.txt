Before this was shown on MTV or VH1, I was at my local theater playing right before the main movie. I remember this movie cuts more than the movie I saw that day. It was the first time I had a musical movie like this, but I'll tell you that seeing on the big screen from a 35mm print in a dark theater gives you a much better impact than watching a panoramic and scanning version on VH1 on the eve of All Saints.
