I spent much of my childhood lying in front of the radio, listening to Round the Horne or Hancock's Half Hour or watching movies of Carry On. Probably the most famous line in the comedy "¡Infamia! ¡Infamia! Everyone has infamy!" It still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> This is a rare vision of the man behind the comic figure and the entire production is a brilliant combination of tragedy and comedy until the final appointment of the forensic court. Voices different from Michael Sheen. It was brilliant on paper. Most of the other members of Carry On's team were more or less and their Kenneth Horne was very good, but Michael Sheen took the show and there should be some kind of prize for him. <br /> <br /> He left me. feeling "wow". To quote Kenneth Williams, the cynical who says that 'life is a joke', the only answer can be 'Yes, well, let's make it good'.
