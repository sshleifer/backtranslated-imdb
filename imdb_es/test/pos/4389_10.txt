They loved him and turned him into a horny toad! God, that affects me every time. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. Memorable lines, from "Thank God, your mom died from birth, she had seen you die of shame" to "I do not understand, Great Dan." Great scenes, from the initial scene of the train (he laughed so much that I cried) to the bluegrass. <br /> <br /> Look at it. It's good, it's great, it's fun and it's based on a famous story. It's worth your time, believe me. Do not look at this if you have a weak bladder, because you will definitely wet your pants laughing.
