I read the book and saw the movie today. The plot is so powerful that almost any script or script would have done it justice. So there's not much there. However, this is still a beautiful film because it makes you think and feel, just like the book. Seeing it is not like watching a documentary about a failed state and feeling sympathy for people who suffer from an oppressive regime, but seeing how the history of any other common man develops, through generations, across continents. Amir's cowardice, his guilt, his dilemmas and finally his choice of a form of redemption could have been a story for any of us. There is not a single infallible character to admire and idolize, but they are all gray, just like all of us. <br /> <br /> Another important observation is that the film does a great job in chronicling lives. Of the Afghans through the twenty years of turbulent political scenarios. The vibrant and carefree childhood represents Kabul before the Russian invasion and the desolate and shattered remains of the city echo what the Taliban have done to him. <br /> <br /> The children actors deserve a "thumbs up" until the end. They can embarrass any mature actor. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen the movie or you have not read the book, simply enter the theater keeping in mind that you are going to witness a multi-layered story woven. on a multicolored fabric of human emotions and feelings. This film is not intended to provoke anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban sentiments, but to feel the evidence of human existence. <br /> <br /> I read some of the external reviews related to the site and I must confess that I do not. see the point writing reviews that summarize the story as a distant viewer and point out technical details about amazing cinematography or something similar. At least for this movie, one should try to connect to it instead of judging it objectively.
