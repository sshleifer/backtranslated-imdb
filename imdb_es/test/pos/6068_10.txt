THE ENGLISH PATIENT not only has everything (condemned romance, tragic war, great characters) but he has it in a way that no other film has it. It is a fascinating story told through flashbacks with incredible performances by all involved, sumptuous visual images, characters that matter to us and the most humorous love story ever told. A cinematographic milestone, the best film of 1996 and one of the best of the 1990s.
