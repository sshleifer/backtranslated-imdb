Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) is also an extremely talented pianist and singer. Ray is an intelligent man too. Ray began his career in the late 1940s before finding his distinctive style. Ray is certainly popular in nightclubs with his music. Things change, when he meets an ambitious music producer (Curtis Armstrong). Who knows, Ray got what it takes to be a strong actor and he also meets a woman (Kerry Washington), also loves and gets married on the road. Ray's album becomes a hit, when he mixes soul and gospel music. What makes Ray a controversial man during the fifties and sixties. Ray has love for all kinds of music, including Country. But Ray is not always the perfect man he seems to be. Since he had many failed relationships with another woman, while he is married. But he also had to fight against racism, the people who crossed it, his musical ideals and, of course, his addiction to drugs. What made Ray's life extremely difficult for him and also to fight against the tragedy of his childhood. Ray always blamed himself. <br /> <br /> Directed by the Oscar winner: Taylor Hackford (Against all odds, Devil's Advocate, Dolores Claiborne) made a fascinating, real-life story of the ever-interesting of the latest "Ray Charles" . Foxx won an Oscar for his moving performance of the late artist. Foxx brings heart and soul to film and humor as well. But this film has a lot of rich performances from a first-rate cast, including: Regina King, Clifton Powell, Bokeem Woodbine, Aunjaune Ellis, Warwick Davis, Terrence Howard and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother. This is probably the best film of Hackford's career to date. The movie has many songs of the best music of Charles too. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a clear Pan & Scan transfer (1.33: 1) and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. Disc 1 has an informative comment from the director and the DVD also has the original theatrical cut and the extended version. But instead, it is better that you are watching the theatrical version, because the additional material is in bad conditions and you have to click on a logo if you want to see these scenes deleted. Disc 2 has deleted the scenes with optional comments from the director (seen in the extended version), more details and more. But the featurettes are disappointingly short for this DVD. Since the movie is extraordinarily good. This film was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Costume Design, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Film. This is an incredible story of real life well told but, of course, Charles's life was even more controversial and scandalous than the final film. Still, it is very close. Screenplay by James L. White. From a story by White and director: Hackford. Oscar winner for Best Sound. Do not miss it (**** Â½ / *****).
