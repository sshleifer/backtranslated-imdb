A lot of this movie was beautiful. The performance, the stage, and without a doubt, the film background of Aaron was shown through the beautiful shots. Definitely worth seeing, since your attention will be captivated all the time and will end with the correct note. <br /> <br /> The performance of the newcomer Jonathan Furr was excellent, as one would think he was a professional actor since He was born. He has gone on to act in other films, but this leading role will always be remembered. <br /> <br /> The movie has that recognition from the academy sometimes, where it's slow, scenic and silent, so it's not a movie that kids can sit through. However, the rustic feel of East Bend and Yadkinville worked well as a movie from the 1940s era.
