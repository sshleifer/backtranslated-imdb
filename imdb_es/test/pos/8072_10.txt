I did not see a film of this kind in which the creators put so much of their hearts into their work and pay attention to the finer details for a long time. <br /> <br /> Everything was well thought out and perfectly come true. The camera work, editing and composition worked so well together that it was simply amazing. The titles were very funny and perfectly choreographed. <br /> <br /> This movie simply impressed me. <br /> <br /> The "Showdown" could have been reduced by 10 or 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is an almost perfect tribute to the early history of Silent Noir Films, the acting, the stage and the costumes were perfectly adequate and credible from the moment of the creation of silent films.
