It is possible that Dolemite was not the first black exploitation film to appear, but it is certainly one of the best. It is a fundamental film in the genre Black Exploitation, as it caused a dramatic change between previous films, in contrast to later films. It was not necessarily a moving or moving film about black culture and it is a struggle to overcome problems like racism or something as important as that, but it was the story of an evil guy fighting "whitened" with his army of hot kung. Fu mama It was a guilty pleasure, very fun and better to see him with friends. (10 out of 10)
