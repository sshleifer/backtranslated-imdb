While I rate the film with a 7, I must also point out that it is historically interesting (since it is starring Mae Marsh, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore when they were all younger and less well known) and presents a rather exciting action for their day. . <br /> <br /> The plot is strange for a Westerner, since all the problems with the Indians start with the strangest reason I have ever seen. The Indians decide to have a banquet for giant dogs (no, they are not feeding the dogs, but feeding the dogs) and when two Indians arrive late, there are no more dogs! So, they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby White settlement and this actually unleashes a total war !! This is not only silly, but seems to play with the prejudices of the audience. I do not know if the American Indians really ate dogs, but it sounds like the kind of stereotype that was then applied to other ethnic groups. All this about dogs! The movie has some excellent battle scenes and exciting moments, like when Mrs. Marsh crawls across the battlefield to save a baby! Something exciting! But, STRANGE, too!
