This is, by far, one of the best films that India has ever done. The following are the positive points of the film ... <br /> <br /> Wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the synchronization of the changes is excellent. <br /> <br /> Although the film shows the life of Mumbai police officers and their difficulties, it never becomes boring or sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Amazing performance of the protagonist Nana Patekar. Surely you can expect to be nominated for Best Actor for the awards of the academy. <br /> <br /> Controlled violence. Violence is controlled and the film does not turn into bloody chaos. <br /> <br /> There are no stupid songs like in the usual Indian movies. <br /> <br />
