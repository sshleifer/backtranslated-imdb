Maybe it's not Miyazaki's best work, but I could not help but love him to death. A five-year-old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish trapped in a bottle. He saves his life and keeps it in a bucket as a pet, but in reality he is a magical being, the daughter of a human magician and a sea goddess. Ponyo, as the child calls it, is returned to the sea by her father, who tries to dissuade her from returning to earth and becomes human, but gets into her magical elixirs and does what she wants to do. The story is simple and beautiful. However, where the movie really comes to life is in its tremendous works of art. The drawings are more childish than in any of Miyazaki's other works, but there is beauty in its simplicity. As with all his films, Miyazaki creates this world of imagination that amazed me. Seeing him in the theater brought back memories of what it was like when the initial notes of Jo Hisaishi's score for Princess Mononoke flooded me and gave me goosebumps almost a decade ago (the score here is just as wonderful). I wanted to live in this world and never leave it.
