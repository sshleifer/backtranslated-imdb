Thirty years after the classic film of 1939 won an Oscar to Robert Donat and made Greer Garson a star, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" overcame a multitude of problems before hitting the screen in this musical version. The original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remick, who in turn received support in favor of Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. Andre Previn's score was rejected, and the one that was eventually used was, unfortunately, Leslie Bricusse. The director for the first time, Herbert Ross, received the monumental task of transforming a simple love story, that of a man for both his wife and his students, into a big-budget extravaganza. That he succeeds as well as he does in spite of the many obstacles in his way is a testimony of his two stars. <br /> <br /> Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher at Brookfield, a male school in the suburbs of England, where he himself was educated. Introverted and socially inept, he is dedicated to his students but can not inspire them. Before the summer break, a former student takes him to an auditorium in London to watch an entertainment starring Katharine Bridges, the young woman he hopes to marry. The post-performance meeting is uncomfortable for everyone, and Chips, as he is commonly known, begins to explore some of the ancient ruins of Italy. Unexpectedly, he meets Katharine, who has booked a cruise through the Mediterranean to allow him time to mourn a failed love story and reflect on the direction of his career. In the time they spend together, she discovers a kind and gentle man who stands beneath the dazed exterior, and on returning to London pursues him seriously. When autumn begins, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young girlfriend, and the two settle into a life of domestic calm. Complications arise when aspects of Katharine's past appear, and again when World War II intrudes into their lives, but Chips is reinforced by the support of his wife, and his new confidence makes him a favorite among students. . <br /> <br /> Apart from a couple of musical interludes: the charming production number in the concert hall "London is London" and Katharine's declaration of love, "You and I", most of the songs of Bricusse, some of them performed in voice over while the characters explore their emotions, are easily forgettable and in no way improve the film. Eliminate the score completely, and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" works pretty well as a drama. The Terrence Rattigan script retains elements of the original while extending and updating it for a couple of decades. He has created several scenes between Chips and Katharine that beautifully delineate their devotion to each other, and infused a few with comedic relief courtesy of the friend and cohort of Katharine, the highest-level actress, Ursula Mossbank (played delightfully by Sian Phillips, OR 'Toole real life wife at the moment). It also captures life in a British public school, the equivalent of a private academy here in the United States, with infallible perfection. <br /> <br /> Ross performs well as a director for the first time, and generously sprinkles the film with incredible photographs. Moments: the opening credit sequence, during which the school anthem echoes in the school's vast stone corridors, sets the perfect tone for the film. Costumes and sets are faithful to the period. The students, represented by non-professionals who enrolled in the school used as Brookfield, handle their different small support roles well. <br /> <br /> The highest praise is reserved for Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark in the main roles. O'Toole was a first-class dramatic actor, so his Academy Award-nominated performance here is not a surprise. Clark, a veteran of about two dozen series B movies in the UK and last year's "Finian's Rainbow", is absolutely luminous as the musician in the concert hall who abandons a theatrical career in favor of life as the wife of a teacher. Her golden voice enriches her songs and almost allows us to ignore how insipid most of them are, and she beats O'Toole in her dramatic scenes together. The chemistry between the two is palpable and leaves us no doubt that this is a couple very much in love. <br /> <br /> This version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is not a classic like its predecessor, but hardly the disaster that many critics described when it was released. Ignore the score, focus on the performances and enjoy the atmosphere that Ross has put on the screen. It's a nice way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.
