A group of evil businessmen must tear down a building to build a huge complex, but they can not eliminate the tenants. Tenants and businessmen with their hired thugs face each other until the movie ends with one of the funniest fights in history! The boy with the ginger hair who gets 'eeeeehhhh' every time he throws a punch and the other guy who poses with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting, only to be beaten out of the camera, makes this essential observation if you like to laugh Movies instead of with them.
