I really did not think this movie was bad. Of course, the detective stunned a little what he did, and usually ran into Captain Howdy by accident, but he did the work. Captain Howdy himself was very scary. The makeup artist did a great job. I really liked seeing Dee dressed as a geek. I laughed so much when I saw that. Personally, I do not see how anyone can sit through the shit like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and call it a great movie, and then see Strangeland, which is more disturbing because so much of what could really happen with the Internet is so popular, and they call it bad. Personally I think the Texas massacre was a lot of garbage. Probably one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I enjoyed Strangeland. It was a very disturbing movie because almost everything happens in reality.
