In KPAX, Softley reviews the subtleties of Eastern religious customs from the small archetypes embedded throughout the film to the real purpose of Prot. Spacey (Prot) assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the film; it is as if the statements he makes embody general truths about a culture of peace that is strongly enacted in Buddhism and Hinduism. It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm; the world is in disarray and is 'bright' and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees, but Prot sees the truth - he sees the minute - and appreciates and appreciates it. Some points fear it as it transcends its social construction of reality and becomes more humanly. <br /> <br /> The film is particularly detailed, therefore, I would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how Softley interposes nuances. Listen carefully to the narrations at the beginning and end, since they really touch on concepts that are not commonly presented in Western philosophies. <br /> <br /> 9 of 10 rating: Excellent - with nominal space to improve.
