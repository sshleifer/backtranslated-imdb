"Only the Valiant" qualifies as a large sandy western. This cavalry of Gregory Peck against the oater Indians is a solemn suicide mission with no trace of humor. Veteran director Gordon Douglas has led a bleak outdoor epic with an ideal cast of tough guys under considerable pressure; even Lon Chaney, Jr., registers magnificently as a powerful Arab soldier. Apparently, "Colorado Territory" scriptwriter Edmund H. North and "A Place in the Sun" scribe Harry Brown drew his screenplay from filmmaker Charles Marquis Warren's Western filmmaker about a group of die-hard cavalrymen who could not travel. Prevent the murderous redskins from launching a devastating assault on the helpless white settlers. North and Brown stick to Warren's novel for the most part and the last-minute revelation: when there seems to be no way for our heroes to survive another attack by Native Americans, he's a fool! This tale of the beginning of the century develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the action. Douglas and the company take study sessions and make them seem convincing during the night hours. The clear black and white photography of the director of photography of "Going My Way", Lionel Linden, imbues this western aspect that accentuates its tension and atmosphere. Actor Michael Ansara, who later played the lead villain in "Guns of the Magnificent Seven," is extremely effective in a small role as the hated leader of the Indians, Tucsos. <br /> <br /> "Only the Valiant" opens with the overcoming of voice narration by the Joe Harmony Scout Army. "This is my place of sealing, I am an Army scout, my work has been reduced to me for a long time, behind that pass is the whole nation pache (there is a graphic of the territory with the head of the United States). Mountains that extend across the screen with a bottleneck.) They used to come from the swarm of the step killing everything in sight, then we built a strong Invincible Fort that covered the way, like a cork in a bottle. for a while, but "Paches is pretty smart. One day, the bottle blew the plum tree. "They show us the burning remains of Fort Invincible with a dead man stuck in a stockade and a spear protruding from his belly.Captain Richard Lance (Gregory Peck of" 12 O'Clock High ") and his men arrive on horseback and capture Tucsos (Michael Ansara), and Joe Harmony (Jeff Corey of" True Grit ") wants to shoot him on the spot, Harmony notes that Tucsos is" the guy who started this whole business " Captain Lance intervenes: "The army does not shoot the prisoners, Joe." Predictably, Harmony is horrified at this prospect. "It's not a common graft. He is as much a god as a man can be. If you shoot him now, things will calm down. Without Tucsos, the other Indians will become reasonable, as quickly as they do. "You can take him alive, you'll have all the 'Pache in the territory that comes after him, we've had three years of this, you can stop him now." In the same predictable way, Captain Lance refuses to kill Tucsos and Lance's decision to recover the Indians puts things into action. <br /> <br /> Colonel Drum (Herbert Heyes of "Union Station") surprises Lance when he tells him he should. They have shot Tucsos. As it is, they need to take Tucsos to another publication. Everyone, from soldiers to Joe Harmony, knows that taking Tucsos to Fort Grant is asking to die. The Apaches are located in the mountains and the fort is under force. Meanwhile, they introduce Captain Eversham's daughter, Cathy Eversham (Barbara Payton from "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"), and young Lieutenant William Holloway (Gig Young from "They Shoot Horses, right?") And play a part in a great narrative complication. You see, Lance and Holloway want to marry Cathy. Clearly, Cathy wants Lance. Colonel Drum refuses to allow Lance to take Tucson to Fort Grant because Drum can not forgive Lance. The drum changes orders and Holloway receives the mission at the last minute, and everyone is surprised. Lance has never changed an order. In addition, Lance saw Cathy and Holloway kissing in public, and everyone thinks that Lance has reassigned Holloway out of jealousy. In fact, an officer observes that the rewriting of orders has to do with a possible rewriting of the Bible. As expected, Tucsos escapes, the surviving soldiers and Harmony return a dead Holloway. <br /> <br /> Although Drum expects a help column of 400 soldiers to arrive any day, Harmony signals to Lance that Tucsos will attack. Tucsos has seen the fort and knows its lack of strength. Lance requests to take 6 or 7 men of his choice to the Invincible Fort man and prevent Tucsos from collecting a wargame. The bottleneck in the mountains prevents the Indians from advancing strongly; instead, they must go through one at a time. Lance believes that his men can frustrate them until the help column arrives. Drum gives him permission and Lance chooses the worst men. They all hate him and would kill him voluntarily. <br /> <br /> "Only the Valiant" is an example of the new generation of Western military after the Second World War. This is not a western John Ford gung-ho cavalry. In fact, Lance's own men want to kill him, and this presages the attitude of the troops during the Vietnam War when they fragment their own officers. Lance has everyone's responsibility, except for the few who know the circumstances that led to the change of orders, which put Holloway in charge of the details. Black and white photography improves the extreme nature of this western. "Only the brave" is equivalent to a last western position until the last minute of suspension. Reportedly, Peck hated this movie, but this is not a western spit and polish on Technicolor. In any case, "Only the Valiant" is at the height of the origins of Warner Brothers. It is small but significant and it is dirty with a lot of dramatic and unpleasant characters, virtually a "Dirty Dozen" western.
