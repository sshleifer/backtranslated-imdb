GRANNY IS THE BEST MOVIE OF NONE Ganny is the best movie I've ever seen. The plot was like nothing that has been seen or done before these people are truly blessed with a talent that is no joke. I love this movie. I need to buy it but I can not find it anywhere. It's a dream for me to go meet the actors and try to become a grandmother. I rented GRANNY on a Broadway video and kept it for a week longer than I should and asked if I could buy it. It was not a big disappointment and an even bigger one the week after I returned. I wanted to rent it again, but when I found out that the Broadway video was not working. If someone has the movie or knows where I can buy it, tell me, write to me at iloverot@aol.com
