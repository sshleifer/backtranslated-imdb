I really enjoyed this little musical fantasy that I bought a copy to share with my friends. It's a pleasant and fun change from our mundane lives ... I think we can all benefit from a life of active fantasy, one of joy and indulgence, I recommend it with all my heart! <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent, and the music uplifting!
