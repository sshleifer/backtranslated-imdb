Hi, I was wondering if someone has a copy of the movie Broken Promise? I loved this movie as it grew and I saw it every time it came out. YEARS have passed since I've seen it and I'd love to get a copy. I have checked the entire internet and I have not been able to find it. If someone has a copy to exchange or sell, please send me an email to NoelGypsy@Yahoo.com ... Thank you and have a great night! Christine --------- The "broken promise" was made to eleven-year-old Melissa Michaelsen, whose parents have abandoned her and her brothers. Taken by the County, Michaelsen has had to observe without being able to do anything, since his brothers and sisters separate and dedicate themselves to different families. Even one of the children is institutionalized. Youth court officer Chris Sarandon joins Michaelsen in his struggle to reunite his family under one roof. Broken Promise was originally offered as a presentation of "General Foods Golden Showcase." It was issued for the first time on May 5, 1981.
