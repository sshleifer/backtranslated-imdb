Slick, neat and well-made version of the old school of how to make a great international thriller. Determined to attack a feared global terrorist known as "Carlos the Jackal", Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, "Unlimited", "Space Jets"), a CIA agent and his Israeli counterpart, Amos (Ben Kingsley, "Gandhi", "Sexy Beast") gets a naval officer, Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn, "Music of the Heart"), to become Carlos and use it in a daring plot for the KGB to kill the real Carlos, because he took an Offer from the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are good here, but the film really belongs to Quinn, who is embodied here (in a double role). The director Christian Duguay and the director of photography David Franco offer another great advantage of the film here with suspense as Hitchcock and the best views in the world.
