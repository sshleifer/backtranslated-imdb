My son Adam (5 years old) is a big fan of Scooby Doo. He likes this movie very much. He especially liked it when the Loch Ness monster tried to attack Shaggy and Scooby. The vote score is your choice and reflects your love for the characters. <br /> <br /> Having first seen the movie "Vampire Rock", this, of course, was very similar, since they repeat a basic plot very used in a different configuration. <br /> <br /> Few adults will encounter this without having their own memories of the television cartoon series and even fewer will see them without children. You like this or you love it. I loved Scooby Doo for half an hour as a child, I'm happy that my son likes it, I can take it now.
