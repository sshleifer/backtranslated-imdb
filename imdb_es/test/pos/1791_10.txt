As Margot in "Fear of Fear" falls victim to her ambitious husband, as Fox in "Fox and his friends" is taken to suicide by her boyfriend who took all his money, as Xaverl Bolwieser in "The wife of the station chief ", who goes to prison to give his unfaithful wife the chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann, who seeks refuge in madness to escape his stupid wife and bankrupt company, so Hans Epp is a victim of German society "Wirtschaftswunder" after the Second World War in "The Merchant of the Four Seasons" by RW Fassbinder. Simply by the fact that Fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women, as well as between heterosexual and homosexual couples, it must be clear that it does not favor any sex. <br /> <br /> In the case of Hans Epp, there are women who lead him to despair, illness and finally death. When she returns from the Foreign Legion, where she flew because she could no longer bear the pressure of her mother, she complains that she is still alive while her neighbor's good boy was murdered. Hans then gets a job as a policeman, but is surprised by his foreman while being seduced by a prostitute. After losing his job, he works as a fruit merchant with little income, going from backyard to backyard "screaming" his product. Her mother, one of her sisters and her husband are ashamed to have a "street worker" in their family. "The love of her life" (she has no name in the film) refuses to marry him because his work does not fit with his social status and origin. Then he marries Irmgard, whom he does not love and who does not love him. Because of his constant pressure on him, he flees to drink. One night, after his wife was harassing him, he explodes and hits her. She flees to her family so this event was just what they have been waiting for. When Irmgard is calling a lawyer for divorce, Hans suffers a heart attack. Imrgard decides to stay with him, but from now on he is no longer allowed to do heavy work and drink alcohol. Then he begins to feel increasingly superfluous, he becomes more and more calm and more and more depressed. When he learns that Irmgard cheats on him, he decides to end his life, but not like Hermann Hermann for a trip in the light of madness, but he dies to himself in front of Imrgard, his little daughter and his friends. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. The question, however, is: Did Hans commit suicide because he could no longer bear his miserable surroundings, or did he do his own justice?
