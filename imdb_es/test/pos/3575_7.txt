Performances by Jim Varney as Harem Girl and A.U. They are incredibly funny, on a level that surpasses Chaplin and Keaton. Linda Kash is excellent in her unique role in life as the local waffle waitress who longs for adventure. Unfortunately, the remaining 90% of the movie was incredibly bad due to the atrocious plot. The creators of Ernest Goes to Africa did not accept the creative challenges inherent in the production of low-budget films. It's just worth seeing on cable.
