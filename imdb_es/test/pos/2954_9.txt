I always thought that my father had a second life and was anxiously awaiting the development of 51 Birch Street when I sat down and saw him for the first time. Surprisingly, the journey of this film took me to places I had not expected and made me reconsider assumptions and judgments. Truly a remarkable personal story told in an intelligent but direct way. I especially enjoyed the use made by the filmmaker to get the type of diary of his mother, very effective. I read the previous comment and wish to note that the sound was fine when I saw it and I suspect that the film was changed a bit or that the theater could have contributed to the poorer sound quality for the other writer.
