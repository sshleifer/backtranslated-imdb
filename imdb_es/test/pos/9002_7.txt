Now, before people start having a breakdown about this movie (those who play rugby anyway) this is a movie! He has been given the Hollywood treatment to entertain people and, therefore, those who play rugby (me included) are naturally going to make holes in the choreography of the game in the film. All in all, it's a decent movie and draws attention to the morals and ideas behind the game of rugby. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real team, a real coach and his work to help guide children to the right. The direction to be better people in the future, and also based on real people who have played for the Highland team. In this case, it is just a typical sports movie with a character that is misguided and finally finds its way on the right path through the medium of rugby. In general, it is a movie that feels good and that is nice, but it has flaws in terms of its representation of the game. However, as I said, it is a movie under the treatment of Hollywood.
