I do not understand where these bad comments come from. The film had you on the edge of your seat and it gave you a little fear of going to your car at the end of the night. <br /> <br /> The part that catches you is that all this could happen. Not to the extent perceived in the film, but the whole idea is reality. This movie took that reality and turned it into a nightmare of Dee Snider. <br /> <br /> Three thumbs up (the third comes from the dead body of my freezer).
