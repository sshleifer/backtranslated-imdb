I know this movie is not for everyone, and I will not express my opinions about you, but what I have to say is the truth about what people feel about this movie ... It was the best thing I've ever seen! !! It was incredibly funny, and even though it was not the most terrifying movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I did not know what was going to happen next. If you like horror movies, you have to see this one!
