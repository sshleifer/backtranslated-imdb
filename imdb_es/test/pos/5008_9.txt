This show was a pleasant surprise after watching Mad TV on a Saturday night. Spike is an excellent host who can be said to be still getting used to him, but he is adapting very well to his new job. I can imagine that it is a difficult transition from writer (Seinfeld) to host, however, unlike many of the new talk show hosts, he does not let fly the broadcast time as he tries to figure out what to do next. He is quick minded and each segment and section are rolled together without problems. It also does not hurt that it's a bit sexy in a nerdy way, so it's not as hard on the eyes as Leno or Letterman. I can not remember the exact date of the episode that was my favorite, but I especially LOVED the work of Idiot Paparazzi with a fake J-Lo and Katie Holmes. Great new show!
