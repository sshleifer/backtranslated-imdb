Margaret Colin stars as the main figure in this story; As I watched him, I remembered his part in the Adriannfaithful film Adrian Lynes as the neighbor of Diane Lane in a New York neighborhood. <br /> <br /> This movie was surprisingly good, and Diane Stillman deserves credit for an accurate depiction of class, crime and misdemeanors, which actually occur in luxury neighborhoods (the thought perishes!). It is real but it is not too dramatized; the public lives through his accident, the pain he has caused; the negation; and the final resolution. <br /> <br /> It's more than just a question of "what a good person is", as Colin talks to her husband ... it's the character of a person defined by a single act; And should they be condemned forever for their action? The questions are pertinent; It is also fun to see several cinematographic references to Martha Stewart (that is, the picky and annoying mother); Colin is considered by her friends sometimes as a "perfect hostess, with perfect genes" ... (gag); and a scene in which Colin confronts the police; (the "friends" also betray her, later) .... <br /> <br /> The denial and facades of American society are addressed; (Ah, murder does not happen here, similar to the theme in "Ã„ Season in Purgatory," by author Dominick Dunne, about the actual murder of Martha Moxley, in Greenwich, Connecticut); Colin is aware of his crime; but consciously he is perpetuating the facade, until finally this movie is broken, rented or bought; She is an underestimated actress who does quite well in these roles.
