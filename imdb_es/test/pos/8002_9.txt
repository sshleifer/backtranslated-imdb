I really wanted to give this movie a 10. I thought it was my favorite of four modern Batman live action movies to date (and maybe it still is, I still have to see Schumacher's films) again). I am also beginning to worry about whether I am subconsciously somehow contrary. You see, I've always liked Schumacher's films. As far as I can remember, it was 9 or 10 for me. But conventional wisdom is that the two films directed by Tim Burton are far superior. This time I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman (I ended up giving him a 7) and I apologize for what I could, I just could not help feeling that Batman Returns has too many problems of direction, argument and script. But scattered all over the world to justify a 10. <br /> <br /> But Burton _almost_ solves the problems with the force of style, and although there are many small flaws, Batman Returns is still a great movie, especially if you re a Burton fan, since Batman Returns has as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as with anything else in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The movie starts strongly, with the Cobblepots having a baby. We see their consternation: people leave the delivery room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later, they have the baby in a small cage. Finally, they take him out for a walk at night and throw him into the Gotham City river. The baby ends up becoming the villain of Batman The Penguin (Danny DeVito). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the "evil capitalist" of the film, comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He plans to cheat Gotham City in several ways, and we see him emotionally abuse his secretary, the shy Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the infamous plans, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but the cats rescue her and she becomes Catwoman. <br /> <br /> While all this is going on, The Penguin, who has always been alone is rumored to exist and is thought to be dangerous, begins a plan to be presented to the public as a good guy, despite having motives ulterior less benevolent. <br /> <br /> Before going back to see Burton's movies in Batman this time, I did not remember how small the films about Batman (Michael Keaton) are. It's almost as if Burton does not feel that the character is interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the villains, especially on The Penguin. Batman does not appear very often, especially at the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often, we see him watching The Penguin. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw, I can not say that I do, even if I wanted to know more about Batman and follow his story more. The stories of the villains are also interesting, and as a "story of origin" for the two most important villains in Batman, Batman Returns is already more complex than the plot. <br /> <br /> However, there are some character problems that I do count as a flaw. The penguin has a group of circus artists who carry out his orders, but although they usually appear on the screen, we can never learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those of Tod Browning's Freaks (1932), with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he has no space to use them. <br /> <br /> For that matter, he barely has space to explore Catwoman. The film is presented as if Catwoman could have been as developed and presented in as many scenes as The Penguin, but that cut of the film would have lasted 4 hours. So most of Catwoman's scenes had to be eliminated. Of course, all this hardly leaves room for Batman. Burton makes Batman very dark to the audience in this movie and, unusually, never bothers to solve this. As far as we know, in the end, the Gothamites still think that Batman is a lunatic killer. That is an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended up falling between this movie and the next one. <br /> <br /> Regarding the script, although there are minor problems that include some non-secuiturs and strange decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters, it is clear that Burton and the writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not trying to tell a traditional story Much of the dialogue is oriented to word games, but often this is quite subtle and / or complex (of course, sometimes it is also very brazen or transparent). It helps to see Batman Returns as a more "poetic" movie, since I think it was the intention. This also moves to more general decisions about plot and direction: many actions of strange characters, even secondary characters, are made to serve a mood or general style, and that style works very well. "Dark" is the easiest way to summarize Batman's returns in a word, and whether that is positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I love the dark. So for me, Burton's style goes far beyond the flaws in the plot and the script. In many ways, Batman Returns is like an insane horror movie and countryside, with a beautifully mysterious production design. Like Batman, Burton still makes many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there is still a small reference to Star Wars), he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) (included that "Max Schreck" was the name of the actor who played the character of Dracula there), Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal and dark edge) and Movies of zombies: they are explained in the final scene of The Penguin. <br /> <br /> In visual terms and general environment, and that includes the general "feel" of the story, the characters, etc. It could not be a stronger 10.
