Late in the evening, on BBC1, I was headed to bed, but curiosity woke up in a contemporary Irish movie, so I stayed to see it for a few minutes and then I stayed until the end. I must admit that the main attraction was the only British actress, Kelly Reilly, who is impressive to watch. <br /> <br /> This is considered a black comedy, which is one of the hardest things to achieve. . It should be the perfect combination of horror and horrible laughter so that in the end you do not know why you're laughing, for me, the best example is After Hours (1985) by Martin Scorsese. Dead Bodies is more black than comedy, but the plot moves along and spiraling into darkness. I did not see the last twists in the story as other posters did here, so I was suitably surprised. <br /> <br /> As a snapshot of the Irish film industry in 2003, everything seems quite valuable; It does not seem that they have spent too much on their manufacture, so he had the opportunity to recover his money. The script could have been much more sharp, but the performance was pretty good in general. I'm glad I saw it, fail and all, although I do not think I've learned much about Ireland today, especially about its police methods!
