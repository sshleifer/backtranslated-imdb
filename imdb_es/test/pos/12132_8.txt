Surprisingly good crime drama type "Mean Streets". Projects elements of "Goodfellas" and "Casino". The first big role of Joe Pesci. Intelligent dialogue I think the Maltin guide gives this a bomb rating. I can only imagine that nobody really bothered to see it. <br /> <br /> He saw this at the Tarantino Film Festival and said that Scorsese used several of these actors in Raging Bull.
