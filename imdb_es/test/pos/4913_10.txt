You have to think about the Last Tango lines in Paris for this, because the mood and emotion follow the same lines and maintain the same heights. The difference is that in this exceptional, intense and torrid representation of love among the ruins. of a dispossessed Dostoevsky, the environment is a gay-subcultural medium, perhaps even one that is going to fade with time, and not the equally surprising but heterosexual context of Bertolucci's own film. <br /> <br /> The last third of this movie shows a passionate love never seen in gay movies. Talking about pornography or gay selfishness loses the meaning and intelligence of this work. This film, although on first impression seems to take us to the familiar and, often described, underworld of gay street life, then precedes to subvert the rules of this genre by exaggerating it to a super real degree. The result is a hyper-charged emotional increase, an exceptional strategy that elevates the drama to one of the great universal themes and giant gestures. <br /> <br /> This movie takes the field due to the brilliant performances of its actors, in particular a young Jean Hugues Anglade and the direction. A tour of the strength of cinema. Outstanding in ambition and it is incessant to fall into the depths of human emotion. As a contribution to gay cinema, this film conquers this difficult terrain and makes its own triumph.
