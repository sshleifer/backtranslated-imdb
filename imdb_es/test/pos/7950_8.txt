How would you feel if you only had a few weeks to live? This movie helps you to know through the eyes of a boy who is facing that situation. It has sympathy and without much emotion. Some may feel it quite slow, but I think that adds to the realism of the movie. Some may see it as a love story, but I think it is secondary to seeing their last days through their eyes. The loves of his life are part of the end of his life and give him more impact. Key and smooth, the film unfolds history as life does. No clich√©s and unexpected events in a context of survival. If you like your movies gently emotionally realistic this may be for you.
