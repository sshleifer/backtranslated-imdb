Captain Corelli's mandolin is not an Oscar candidate, but it was quite good. I have to admit that Mrs. Cruz can really act. She does a very good performance. In fact she makes her boyfriend Tom in the drama. John Hurt was great as always. Nicholas Cage seemed to be having fun. I bet he felt like he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I learned something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany, the many Italian soldiers killed during the period there surrender to the allies and the eventual surrender of Germany.
