This is one of Julie's greatest tributes to music, along with her album "Trapped in the Body of a White Girl". To quote the great Medusa "Dare to get naked, just put on your underwear, you will go home every time" - Wow! Now that is good advice. "You can dance, at my party! Yes, justify your dance shoes! ... You are invited to the party with my pants Yes, come on, let's dance, to the party with my pants" Julie Brown is very funny !!! It's almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long, but every minute is incredible.
