As a fan of The League of Gentlemen, I had to wait months to finally see this movie when it was released on DVD, but it was worth the wait (unbearable). "Apocalypse" is fantastic, funny, strange, intelligent as hell, full of jokes and cryptic references to the television series; basically everything you expect from the gentlemen. <br /> <br /> The plot has already been discussed in other reviews, so I will not bother to put a cap on it again, although I will say that when I read it for the first time I was a bit hesitant. Obviously, this device (characters fictitious that enter the real world to confront their creators) has been used before, especially in the books "New Nightmare" undervalued by Wes Craven and "Dark Tower" by Stephen King (where King was a character). However, the Knights have fun breaking the fourth wall, and even add a new element: a second fictional world ("those days"). Soon, the three realities have become intertwined, and the result is exciting: Geoff Tipps was knighted in the Middle Ages (and trying to woo Queen Victoria Wood); the true League of Knights in Royston Vasey, which faces characters like Pauline and Dr. Chinnery; David Warner summoning a homunculus outside the church of Bernice. I heard that some people did not like the secondary plot of "King's Evil", but I found it funny, especially the character of Reece (who seemed to be channeling Judith the "Witch" series three). <br /> <br /> Speaking of the characters, I was relieved to discover that although Hilary Briss, Geoff and Herr Lipp were firmly planted in the core of the film, other more familiar characters received their due. At first, Bernice's confessional was hilarious, and she recalled the faster and more sketched-oriented feel of the first series. Pauline and Mickey have cameos (although Ross, although strange), although I would have loved to have seen Mrs. Campbell-Jones more. Papa Lazarou is told, as are Tubbs and Edward. All three are used sparingly, giving their meager screen time an almost magical feel (and what the hell did hacking dad, like an obscene hairball?) According to the DVD commentary, a "greasy pubic hair bundle" "). /> <br /> The movie looks amazing, but then, what's new? Music, as always, is impressive. I was thrilled to hear Joby Talbot's new interpretations of the song, and its reworking of the majestic and charming piece that closes both "Apocalypse" and the last episode of the series three. <br /> <br /> I have some minor complaints: it would have been nice to see more of the old and familiar Royston Vasey, and I felt that the stop-motion creatures (beautiful, by the way) were a little underutilized. Both problems, however, can be justified by the budget of the film, so they are understandable. Even so, although I loved Bernice's new church, it would have been great to see the final battle on the main street (the original vision of the Knights, according to the commentary). <br /> <br /> In general, "Apocalypse" is amazing, especially if you're a fan of the series. I can not recommend it highly enough. 10/10.
