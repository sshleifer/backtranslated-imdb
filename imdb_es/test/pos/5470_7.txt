And I would have rated it higher than 7 out of 10 if it were not for the Irish accent of Barbara Hershey, who is very uneven, in the main role of Mother Madalyn. The accent came and went, unfortunately, which I found more than a little annoying. <br /> <br /> However, the performance of William L Petersen in the role of Joad was outstanding, he brought a warmth and depth to the character despite some periodical dialogues. Captivating and genuine, I found it quite amazing because of the way he captured the character. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is quite simple, the construction of a staircase forgotten in a church. It is based, I think rather flexibly, on a true story and I had heard about this staircase before watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It was a feat of engineering phenomenal for its time: a floating double helix made without nails or screws. It exists to this day, although now it is privately owned. <br /> <br /> ** Minor Spoiler ** Good cast cast and Barbara dies so well in all her films and here she does not disappoint. Many special moments. <br /> <br /> 7/10
