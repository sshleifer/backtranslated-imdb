This hugely entertaining short is considered one of the best shorts of all time, and I certainly will not discuss it. Even in a country where first-rate animated short films are created regularly, this film still stands out. If you ever have the chance to see this movie, do it. It only lasts ten minutes, and yet it contains a man who is obsessed with the mountains, a woman who aspires to the bathtub and a nuclear war. What more could you want in a movie?
