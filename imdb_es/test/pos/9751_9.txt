I really enjoyed watching this movie! Only a few parts were slow, but I was just setting the mood and preparing for action. I thought that this film was very educational, it taught me more about my Croatian heritage. I also learned more about Louise Arbor, and I can say that she has a great influence on me. Time magazine named Louise Arbor one of the 100 most influential people in the world in April 2004. I recommend this movie to people who like historical movies (obviously). This movie was very dramatic, but still told the truth of the events in the former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbor is a brave heroine, and I'm glad they made a movie in honor of her. If you see the movie, I hope you like it.
