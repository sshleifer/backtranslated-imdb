'Water' (2005), the final part of the elementary trilogy of the Indian film director Deepa Mehta, based in Toronto, has finally been completed, almost ten years after the launch of the first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996) , which was followed with a slightly less controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998). Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film 'At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch' (1975), but it was her Canadian feature film about the lives of Indians living in Canada that brought fame back to life. this. , his country by birthright, 'Sam & Me' (1991). International recognition got in the way of 'Camilla' (1994), starring Bridget Fonda, along with the actress who in 1990 won an Oscar in the category of Best Actress in a leading role at the age of 80 years, paving the way for middle-aged actresses. I still have hope, for her portrayal of an old stubborn Jewish woman in 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989), the late Jessica Tandy. <br /> <br /> 'Camilla' dealt with a friendship between two women from two other extremes of human life, a May / December friendship. 'Camilla' was the last photo of Tandy; she died the same year. <br /> <br /> International fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the launch of the controversial 'Fire', which spread furiously among the false patriotic consciousness of Indian extremism. After having explored the friendship between two women in 'Camilla', in 'Fire' Mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two neglected lonely women. Set in modern India, the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi, shows two brothers and their wives, the elder brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) who joined a rare Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy, true to his guru's existence without sex. The younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) is having an extra marital relationship with a Chinese woman (Alice Poon). Therefore, both wives, Shabana Azmi playing the wife of the older brothers and Nandita Das the youngest wife, are abandoned in their own way. One forced to lead a celibate life, thanks to the eccentricities of her husband, and the other whose only interaction with her husband is through sex, and nothing else. Living in a world of in-laws and being the only two people outside the family, having no one else to trust, the two women fall into their arms. This is the theme of lesbianism. If there were an outside man to cry about, there would probably have been a possibility that they would fall into the arms of a man, but having no one else to trust, their need for mutual support is quite obvious. It does not necessarily state that all unattended women would end up taking lesbianism, it simply existed with respect to the two women in this context. In short, the film is excellent and goes deeper than two women who lie in bed. The key focus is not the lesbianism in the film, but the plight of the neglected Indian wives of modern times, even in the capital city, the two female characters have a sexual relationship. <br /> <br /> Two years later, the second installment of Deepa Mehta was the element of Mother Earth, released in India under the name of '1947: Earth', another excellent film by a great director, this time in Hindi. Language, unlike 'Fire', which was made in the English language. <br /> <br /> Now Deepa Mehta has managed to complete the trilogy, despite many problems, having launched the latest installment recently, 'Water'. Without a doubt, it would be as good as the other two.
