I'm sorry, but I can not help it, I love seeing Iron Eagle. Now, do not get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a great movie. No, rather, I would say that this is an infinitely entertaining movie. People who cut this movie in pieces for not being realistic lack some sense. Of course, the plot of Iron Eagle was ridiculous. But I think her target audience was children, and I remember remembering to find this great when I was little. Now I find it fun as a guilty pleasure, like Road House. This film is part of the great pantheon of the 80s, films for children that take over the adult power structure. You must remember D.A.R.Y.L, Real Genius, E.T., etc. If you ask me, at first, seeing Doug and Knotcher "Ride the Snake" is worth the cost of the DVD. All that sequence was so stupid! But, at the same time, it was hilarious, fun, totally from the '80s, all those good things. In short, Iron Eagle is a great guilty pleasure of the 80s. Hairstyles, dancing, music, dialogue, everything is fun as hell. I have Iron Eagle on DVD and for me it was totally $ 9.99 at Best Buy. If you love to laugh at outdated and unrealistic action movies, this is a must see. Oh, yeah, and I think his plot was just a little more stupid than the other action picture of the 1986 fighter pilot, Top Gun.
