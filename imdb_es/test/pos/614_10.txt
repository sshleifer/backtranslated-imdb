I expected it to be good, after having seen other magnificent moments from another ozone, and I read a lot about that ... but this movie is brilliant: intelligent, very bright (emotionally and visually), perfect at all times. Every movement is there for a reason, everything fits so close and primordially true and honest. This is the movie about beauty and innocence. about its simplicity.
