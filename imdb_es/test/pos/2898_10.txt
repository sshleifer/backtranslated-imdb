How are these guys still? They have about 50 years each, and act as if they were only 30 years old. They play 3 hours of music in each concert and they hardly sweat. This DVD is their first concert in Rio, Brazil. Although people do not speak English, they try to memorize the words of the most famous songs of Rush, and try to sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends. <br /> <br /> From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of Radio, this concert DVD will keep you in the chair without wanting to pause or get away from the classics you heard when you were young. This is your 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). I went to their concert in Scranton PA, and this was just as good, although in PA they did not play Freewill, so I was upset. <br /> <br /> They have Freewill, they have The Trees, they have YYZ, The Pass, Driven, Dreamline, Network Sector A, Limelight, Roll the Bones, 2112 and much more. 10 out of 10, because nothing else compares. If you never go to a Rush concert, at least buy this DVD.
