Here is another one of the westerns of the 1940s that I see every time it appears in TCM or FMC, because although it may have historical flaws, it is extremely entertaining and well acted, in addition it has Randolph Scott, my favorite actor in second place, only Gary Cooper OK, fourth behind COOP, Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. But the film itself, for me anyway, is reasonably historical and, as I said before, it acted well and "flows" very well; I bet I've seen it 50 or 60 times, and I enjoy every display more than the previous one. I have it on the TCM tape but I would buy it in a minute if it came out on DVD. See it if you do not have it, I guarantee you will like it!
