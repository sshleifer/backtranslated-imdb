This is a totally incredible movie! If you have not seen it yet, you should do it. Of course, the plot develops slowly, the special effects are ridiculous, the performance is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed, but as the DDP fighter would say; That's not a bad thing ... it's a good thing! Everything about this movie is hilarious, especially if you get the dubbed version, which has even worse actors. There are countless laughs until you reach the end, longing for the sequel, where the mummy fights against women fighting. So, I give it ten stars. Unless you are one of those 'distinguished' and 'smart' people with good taste, who only like 'high quality' movies of the highest caliber, I recommend this completely mono-film film.
