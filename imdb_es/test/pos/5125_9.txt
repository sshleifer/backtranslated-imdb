The story is amazing, it starts with a new boy in the city named Roy, while on the bus to school, he realizes that there is a boy running without shoes, and that same day he breaks the nose of the big bullies that are trying to fight him. . Roy soon discovers that the boy is a fugitive, and he and his stepsister are trying to ruin a construction view, which could kill all the beautiful owls that live there. Roy decides to help them fight there. Can they win this fight before the clever but clumsy policeman Dave Delinko (Luke Wilson) stumbles on them? A nice, funny and adventurous movie. I admire Luke Wilson for taking this role. I do not think his brother Owen took this role.
