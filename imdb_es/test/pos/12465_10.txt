.. especially by Lambert. This is the essential Tarzan de Burrough that I grew up reading when I was a child. I have read some negative reviews in this movie and I could not help but wonder what their problem was. Obviously they did not see the movie I saw or expected something that was more like the series on Saturday afternoon. <br /> <br /> This was the Tarzan that was from the novel and the filmmakers should be applauded for tackling the source material and taking it seriously. Lambert was excellent. I still think he's one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. This was a movie in which he shines. <br /> <br /> The photography and the apes, made by Rick Baker, were incredible. You definitely felt the one from the jungle. The second half, Tarzan's attempt to be civilized really pushes you into the emotional conflict he had to solve. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie
