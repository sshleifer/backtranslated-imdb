I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. He knew that he was a former prisoner of war from Viet Nam in Laos who escaped, but he did not know much more. Actually, I did not expect too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what distinguishes this film from other biographical documents is that Dieter himself tells most of the story. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. Your personality really shines. He tells his story about his life as he grew up in Germany during World War II and the difficulties. We are there with him in that same small city while he describes his family, his inspirations and his struggles. We follow him to America and his way to fulfill his dream of being a pilot. Then, later, Dieter describes his story of capture, escape and survival in the Laotian jungle. We are with him again in that same jungle while he describes and recreates in great detail his imprisonment and his path to freedom. We see the same primitive huts, villagers and forms of detention that he dealt with that have not really changed in 30 years. We see the thick jungle, the mountainous terrain and the rivers that Dieter faced during his flight. It helps us to understand their emotions, pain and situation. I enjoyed the man, the history and the style. Work well done!
