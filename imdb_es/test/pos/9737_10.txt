I loved "Flash Gordon" when I was a kid and watching the series again on DVD brings me such fond memories. Each episode of 15 minutes presents the adventures of our hero Flash, the charming Dale Arden and the intrepid Dr. Zarkov on the planet Mongo, with Flash escaping death at every moment: the Shark Men almost drown him, he faces the Monster of Fire in the Tunnel of Terror, and you are in mortal danger in the Static Room! <br /> <br /> The characters are still fun: Buster Crabbe is the blond hero of Dreamboat and Jean Rogers is a delicate and beautiful Dale Arden. Princess Aura still plans to steal Flash for herself, King Vultan of the Hawk Men still has her laughter and angel wings, and Ming the ruthless, emperor of the universe, is still giving everyone the evil eye and fear . <br /> <br /> This series would probably not interest kids today with their hokey effects, oh, that spaceship! - But it's a bit of fun nostalgia for those who liked it the first time. The actors act in a straight way and are not limited to children. I appreciate that the young spectators were expected to read the synopses of the chapters that had very important words. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it came out on DVD. It is very fun to revisit this classic science fiction series.
