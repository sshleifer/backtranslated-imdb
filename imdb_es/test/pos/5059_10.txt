We begin all our comments with the following information. My wife and I have seen almost 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we are honored to receive lifetime movie passes for any movie at any time at no cost! So we can see what we want when we want. The point of this is that the CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are not really different from you or me. The only difference is that they write about the film and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they want to or not. Therefore, we believe that if you get the value of your money for two hours of fun, it's enough for us! We NEVER listen to or read critics. We only care about our friends and those we know as the same things we do. Pretty good about that. <br /> <br /> When Meryl Streep, the head of the NSC in the film says "The United States does not torture", she laughed a lot with this movie. Of course, it is a lie that the Bush Administration has denied again and again. It is a very good movie and it is scary in what we can do since we lose all our civil rights. They can simply "catch" it anywhere and tell one that they have done it. In this case, they snatch a man who has a similar name to those who killed thousands on 9-11. Of course, it's like you or me. And, then, they take it to a secret place outside the US. UU To torture him and take him on board. <br /> <br /> Very scary. Well performed by Jake and Reese and all the cast.
