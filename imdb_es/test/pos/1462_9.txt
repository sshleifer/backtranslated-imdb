A comedy talk show from the creators of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' The new series, Man to Man with Dean Learner, focuses on Garth's manager, publisher and advertising agent, played by Richard Ayoade. <br /> <br /> Nightclub owner, restaurateur, editor, international playboy: Dean Learner is a one-man brand. <br /> <br /> After your co-funded television channel 4, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, now invites you to his luxurious penthouse for an all-new, entertaining and immensely elegant television talk show. <br /> <br /> Man to Man with Dean Learner will introduce all of Dean's famous friends, as well as a lot of live music and excellent fish dishes in a show that reeks of class, but not to fishes! <br /> <br /> The ones I attended Two of the live recordings and he had me in stitches. There are different comparisons with the Alan Partridge design "Knowing Yourself," but the unique writing style of Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness takes it to another level. <br /> <br /> If you're a Darkplace fan, then you can not. I miss him. Catch it when it goes on the air this summer.
