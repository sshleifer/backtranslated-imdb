I absolutely hate the idea of ​​making movies for television. For me, TVMs usually involve Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult disease to treat, all in such a sweet way that the public does not need tissue, needs insulin. So when DEADLY VOYAGE is a BBC and HBO television movie based on a true story that I vaguely remembered a couple of years before appeared on TV schedules, I sat waiting to bore you senseless. I was surprised <br /> <br /> Without hitting the last sentence, I was not surprised that it surprised me. Here is a TVM that catches it stronger than a great white shark, in fact, DEADLY VOYAGE does not deserve to be relegated to television schedules, it should have been created and distributed by one of the main Hollywood film companies due to its absolutely premise terrifying and what? Moreover, unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS, it is completely true <br /> <br /> For those who do not know the story !!!!! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡WITH THE PARK !!!! At some point, in the early 1990s, a group of Africans moved on a Ukrainian cargo ship bound for France to work there. Of course, it was an illegal immigration attempt, but the freighter's crew had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants to enter their ship from a previous trip and did not want to have any more problems with the maritime and immigration authorities. The crew killed the Africans after discovering them hide in the cellar. All except an African, Kingsley Ofusu, who manages to escape the firing squad but must try to survive aboard the ship, but the problem is that the crew is chasing him and France is still several days away. <br /> <br /> Just typing the previous paragraph remembers how good VOYAGE MORTAL is. What a remarkable story, and once again it is, unlike many stories that claim to be, totally true. It is very well written, directed and acted, especially by Sean Pertwee (Why is this guy not a big star?) And, above all, it is a disturbing and claustrophobic tense thriller that I can still remember vividly six years after having seen it. for one and only time. I hope to see again. <br /> <br /> But you must ask yourself, how can a TVM be better than most of the Hollywood action blockbusters that came up almost at the same time? Oh, wait, I just had a disturbing idea about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a new version with Tony Scott directing and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley, Brad Pitt playing the role of Pertwee, a massive artistic license taken with events, etc. VOYAGE a superlative TVM instead of a poor box office success
