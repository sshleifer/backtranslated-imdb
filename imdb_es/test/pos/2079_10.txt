This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is by far the best I've seen. Although it may not have the production value of some of the most recent adaptations, it does have the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Jacobi's representation of the disturbed Prince is multi-layered and fascinating. His demonstrations of emotion range from hatred to pain, from love to revenge and elsewhere on the map, but without seeming forced or exaggerated. In fact, some of the most powerful sequences occur when you underestimate them, with stillness, soft speech and thoughtful expression. As to whether or not he interprets Hamlet as crazy or sane ... well, they must decide for themselves; I changed my mind more than once. At one point, it seems that he thought he was sane and just playing madness, but he suspects that, in reality, he is crazy, a revelation for himself, captured in a beautiful way. Having played the role of Hamlet on stage more times than any other actor in history, Jacobi's affinity for the role is not a big surprise. <br /> <br /> Regarding the production itself, it is presented as a kind of "Recorded copy" of the play, with small special effects or sophisticated camera work, minimal sets and without musical accompaniment of the what to talk This production is based on the acting skill of the cast and the words of Shakespeare to evoke the emotion and interest of his audience. And works. The other players are also top-notch, particularly "Claudius" by Patrick Stewart and "Gertrude" by Claire Bloom. Together, the cast presents a perfect set. <br /> <br /> The last element (but not least) that makes this production stand out is the work itself. Here it is presented in its entirety, a rarity in the cinema. But, curiously, I never realized the time. He was too busy stuck in history. I suspect that you will too.
