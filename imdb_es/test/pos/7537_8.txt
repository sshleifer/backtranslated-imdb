As funny as the British comedy of the 50s can get, THE BELLS OF ST TRINIAN'S has almost a joke per minute ... and at 91 minutes it becomes a fantastic moment. Other films that I also recommend from the same period are THE TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT and THE GREEN MAN. In fact, any movie with Alistair Sim or Terry Thomas, George Cole, Richard Wattis or Joyce Grenfell or any combination is a delight. In ST TRINIAN'S, we received a double dose of Sims playing two roles with that hilarious disdain that constantly lets her face undulate. Joyce Grenfell as Ruby Gates (oh dear, that name!) Interprets his 'jolly hockey sticks' incognito agent to hilarious perfection. Possibly the best laughs come from George Cole as Flash Harry (who comes out of a bush when he is whistled) and several visits to Ms. Fritton's classrooms (Sims) that react to the explosions ("Oh poor Betty!") Or the production of gin in the science lab "just send a few bottles of that to my room"). Each part of the movie is fun for the characters, their costumes, the antics and the stage. There were sequels, but the first three are the best: including this one. BLUE ASSASSINATION IN ST TRINIAN'S and later in color THE GREAT ROBBERY OF ST TRINIAN'S TRAIN.
