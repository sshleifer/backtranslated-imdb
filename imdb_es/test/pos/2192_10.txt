Having not seen the 1936 version of this story, I can not offer any comparison there. However, I can say that Stephen Sondheim's musical treatment of this story is absolutely brilliant. Only Sondheim came up with music and lyrics that are stellar in their own right, but that adapt perfectly to the very strange subject. If someone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, they should see this (and "Dr. Strangelove" as well). When Mrs. Lovett goes from having the "worst empanadas in London" to a booming business with great recognition, we are not talking about "Soylent Green", but the ingredients are similar. Particularly brilliant is the song where Mrs. Lovett presents her idea to Mr. Todd. Even in the introductory number, the line "... went to your Maker impeccably shaved ..." gives a great indication of the premise, drama and comedy to come. Exceptional!
