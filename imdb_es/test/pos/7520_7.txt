I had never paid much attention to this film until I learned that Paddy Chayefsky, author of the brilliant "Red", was the screenwriter. His work there had instructed me about his genius, so when 'Hospital' appeared on TMC, he was eager to see it. I was not disappointed. Seeing both this film and "Red", it would seem that its great theme is the absurdity, the madness and the sheer wickedness of great human enterprises (for example, hospitals, networks) against the sanctity of individual experience and the human spirit, and Everything was delivered with a sharp sense of completely black humor. "Hospital" is a comedy as black as "Network", and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable Scott, does his job with all fairness. This is a guardian; Definitely do not miss it.
