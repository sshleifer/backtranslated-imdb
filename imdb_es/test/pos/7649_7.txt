Having not heard of this movie, it was a surprise when it was shown on cable recently. Gary Ellis, the talented director of "Tough Luck," works wonders with the screen play written by Bill Boatman and Todd King. The film involves the viewer from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Archie, the young swindler at the center of this story, has been involved in all kinds of misdemeanors. In fact, we are witnessing a confrontation from the beginning that makes him leave New Orleans, as fast as he can. He ends up at the carnival which is led by the mysterious Ike. Archie falls in love with Davina, the woman he should have known how to stay away from. The result is a fatal trial for Archie, who then becomes the object of a double crossing everywhere. <br /> <br /> The director should be praised for the casting of Norman Reedus, who is obviously loved by the camera. Despite his nature, one feels for him because we know that his heart is in the right place. The beautiful Dagmara Dominczyk is perfect as the exotic dancer Divana who, despite being the lover of Ike, incites Archie to fall with her. Armand Assante is barely comprehensible with the thick accent he speaks during the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> "Tough Luck" shows a new director, Gary Ellis, showing that he will do bigger and better things because he knows what he is doing.
