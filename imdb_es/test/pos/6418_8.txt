Well ... The end of this can be a bit disappointing after what happened before ... And Klaus Kinski should have cut off his 10-second appearance ... But there's no way to avoid the fact that this is a really Wonderful Euro atmospheric thriller ... I can not believe I've never seen this so far ... It's good to know that there are movies out there that are still worth tracing ... And this really is ... Stunning images ... Haunting ... And it creates an incredible atmosphere ... Florinda Balkan is perfect as our heroine ... And the scene on the beach with Nicoletta Elmi is one of the most relaxed and perfect performances you can see ... Lila Kedrova is a visitor of the city that may or may not be who it seems ... If you miss the hay days of European cinema, then look for this ... There is a decent widescreen print that goes ... And please, take this out a restored DVD, someone ... They did it with the directors "Fifth Cord" ... And e This is a much better movie.
