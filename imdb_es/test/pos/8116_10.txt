I've never seen a movie like this; I did not think of seeing it, but it was worth the turn of the television channel. I am mostly a sci-fi movie viewer, but I would be more than happy to add this to my collection. It starts as a one-sided movie with a simple love triangle, then it becomes a bit different (I can not say more about that, but it involves two men and a girl, not what you'd expect). In addition, this film was starring Hugo Weaving of "MATRIX" and "THE LORD OF THE RINGS" in a role I would not have expected ... very funny. This movie is playing on HERE TV, but if it does not have a satellite, it's worth renting it. So give it a try; You will not be disappointed.
