Undoubtedly, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of "AAA" stars and musicians gathered for a family adventure rated "G". This is a must buy for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skilfully combines the rodeo / 4H competition drama for the "GRAND CHAMPION" cow with a poignant and amusing story of perseverance against difficult challenges. Joey Lauren Adams offers her typically solid performance as the well-intentioned mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS, whose presence in the camera is as bright as that of her famous aunt, JULIA. You can expect a lot from this young Roberts protest, as is already being demonstrated in his new Nickelodeon series, "UNFABULOUS".
