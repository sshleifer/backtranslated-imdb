I am an Australian who currently lives in Japan. I saw this movie on television here and I was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of the colliding Japanese and Western ideologies. Whoever wrote the script and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it is like to be a foreigner living in Japan. The only thing I thought was that I was too Hollywood when the character of Tom Selleck kisses the woman in the center of his office and she leaves him. Public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. Finally a film that highlights the true 'gaijin' experience! 9/10
