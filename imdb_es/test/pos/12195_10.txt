Although this film does not have the darkness of books, in my opinion it is a great movie. It's a great campy fun with the beautiful Stuart Townsend as Lestat. She may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are described so vividly in the book, but to be fair, she would not look good with blonde hair, and Lestat is definitely about looking good. He moves like the predator I always imagined Lestat would have. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely incredible. It's not an interview with the vampire, so do not try to compare the two. The interview is the story of Louis. This is a cut and paste version of Lestat. In any case, I highly recommend it.
