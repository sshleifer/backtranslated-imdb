Kazuo Komizu attacks again with "Entrails of a Beautiful Woman", the sequel to "Entrails of a Virgin". This time, the story is based on a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to confront the Yakuza to take revenge for the suicide of a drugged and raped patient who one day ends up on the threshold of her door. When he passes his head and the Yakuza captures her, he learns his insidious platform of doping the girls and selling them into slavery. Apparently, it ends badly when she overdoses on cocaine. But soon it merges with another body to be discarded to become "dum, dum, dum" "Super Slime Hermaphrodite Zord"! This one, she = makes minced meat from the yakuza and saves the day, not really. <br /> <br /> Well, it's better than "Entrails of a Virgin", but not by much. Most of the movie (a whopping 67 minutes) consists of a rape and nebulized sex and the usual ho-hum stuff. Almost towards the end, we finally got our gore rhythm with some great sequences (like a monster-penis inspired by the aliens through the stomach scene and a sticky suffocation) but still suffers from a low budget feeling that makes it fun but you can not elevate it from the z-grade soft horror kernel rate
