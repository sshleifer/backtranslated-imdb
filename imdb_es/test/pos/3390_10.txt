Shelley. <br /> <br /> Based on John Jake's successful novels "North and South", "Love and War" and "Heaven and Hell", this was a television miniseries from 1985 to 1987. Its success is due more to the success of "Roots" to an era similar to the Civil War / telenovela of slavery televised approximately a decade earlier in the 70s Patrick Swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time he was making many films like Dirty Dancing that would make him famous, stars Orry Main, a young man born on a South Carolina plantation that heads to West Point. Here he meets George Hazard (James Read), who is supposed to be the hated enemy, the Yankee North, but with whom he joins closely. Soon, the leaders of the south and the dangers of the north become friends despite the turbulent times that lead to civil war. The theme of family, friendship and doing the right thing, even when the nation was crumbling, is at the heart of this soap opera full of action and romance. Clariss and Ashton (Jean Simmons and Teri Garber) portray the sisters who become enemies when one of them marries Yankee Billy Hazard (John Stockwell.) The malicious, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil of Ashton is fun to watch The screen Although the series did not cover everything in Jakes' novels, what we see is a condensed version and changed some things to turn it into a kind of historical romance with accompanying history lessons. Main scenes of the Civil War: Harper's Ferry where the abolitionist and feminist Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) loses the love of her life, former slave Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox and we are aware of the White House where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Halbrook) battling the war in his conscience, we find all the prominent players, including Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis. Golden Age Hollywood veterans: Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Ha The villands have cameos and it is interesting to see them. This is not a historical fact, it is a historical fiction and a purely dramatized entertainment. But it has cliffhanger endings and beautiful photography, costumes and places. It's like watching an epic film that lasts longer than Gone With The Wind with war scenes in it! The script can be bad sometimes and the performance may not be the best, despite the good casting. Swayze does it like Terri Garber does, but some performances, like Kirstie Alley, James Read (as George Hazard) and Leslie Anne Downes as beautiful and strong Madeline are really good performances. They filmed in sets and in places in the south. The music is lovely and this is a good movie where we are encouraged by the good ones and we observe the scheme of the villains and finally we get their due. All fans of Civil War movies and Jakes novels should see this. It is available on DVD and VHS.
