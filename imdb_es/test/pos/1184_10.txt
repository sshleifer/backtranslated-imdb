I just saw Hair after a lapse of 20 years. He hit home. For those of us who try to lean on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight against the rule of privilege and power; who resisted the fascism of the Johnson / Nixon administrations; who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in Vietnam every day until finally the beast of the United States died and fled; for all who said no in many different ways, the failure we had is remarkable. How big was the royal table on which Treat danced. How he propelled the magician behind the curtain. We were 20, 22, 24. We did not know the nature of the enemy. The size of the monster that during the next thirty years and counting would continue to eat the world. How could we even with the smoke and the bat (the bat!) In our hands, like Treat, we were too young, too middle class, too committed, too important a part of the actions we hated. <br /> <br /> But there was a moment. As Andre Gregory observes in My Dinner With. . . There was a time or two somewhere in the late 60's and early 70's when we might have found something besides the yellow brick road. Something not fed by Bechtel, prisons, Enron and Dick. Something collaborative. Something innocent and critical at the same time. Something with the dance. <br /> <br /> But we miss him. Like Kong bending a beam, the "revolution" became itself. In sexism. Racism. Homophobia And the class crushes politics. Until we get to "W". Deal I would have hated "W". And Iraq and the pathological lies. If they were in that movie. So. But the moment passed and "W" was almost inevitable. General incompetence leading to the drunk, furious bull towards the estuaries, the lives of children and the stores of China. <br /> <br /> We should have done something else. Something better. But clearly we did not know what. <br /> <br /> Now what?
