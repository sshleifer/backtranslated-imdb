I have not seen this movie since it came out in the mid 70's, but I do remember it as a very realistic representation of the music business (right next to Paul Simons "One Trick Pony" ... another very underestimated movie IMO) < br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel does an excellent job as a producer caught between the music he believes in, and the commercial "tripe" that the record company "suits" wants him to work with. <br /> <br /> Since I spent my entire career in the music business as a composer / arranger / producer, I can really answer for the plausibility of this movie. <br /> <br /> If it ever came out on DVD without cutting, I would buy it!
