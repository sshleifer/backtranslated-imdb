A light, edifying and attractive movie. Seeing Irene Dunne is a delight! While you look at her, she stops being Irene Dunne and becomes Paula Wharton in every way. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed Irene Dunne in all the movies I've seen, and that would be almost all. What a pity that most of his films need so much restoration. I hope that Irene Dunne's film is restored before it's too late. They are treasures. Thank God, this is not the case with more than 21. <br /> <br /> It is a must if you like excellent acting and witty comedy with serious nuances. I agree with a previous comment about the speech "The World and Apple Pie" was one of the many highlights of the film. I read somewhere that Irene Dunne helped write that speech along with Principal Vidor (Irene Dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life) and she certainly seems to show up in her films!
