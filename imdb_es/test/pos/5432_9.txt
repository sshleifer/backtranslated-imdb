This movie reminds me of the great movies that awaken me temporarily when I realize that the Emperor is really naked. Our election process is casual and somber. My conscience is greater and I want to see the change of the world. After a short period of time, I returned to my little complacency and "bubble life". In the best sense of the film, this work will ferment in an edible stew for me and, as in "Red", I want to be condemned to say "I AM LIKE HELL, AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS MORE!" But who? My vigorous youth idealism has slowly been reduced to concerned parents with silent convictions or rather "beliefs". "Man of the year" reveals how much I long for the honest and, at times, humorous takes of our current political situation. The Dobbs line "I inhaled because I thought: 'What the hell, it's on, it's in my hand, I'll inhale it.'" It was refreshing or it would have been when Clinton was president. Why can not politicians be honest and set that tone for debates? Do we, the people, have to realize how much appearance is being presented as real? I'm fed up with this electoral process, someone else? Remove the veils and establish an agenda for our elected officials and take them to the task (do not re-elect them) when they continue with the evasion and non-representation of citizenship. This film can inspire us to increase our expectations of politicians who emit rhetoric. Great movie!
