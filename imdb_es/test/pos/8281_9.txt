I think it's great one of my favorite movies when I was a kid and he said that the songs were unforgettable, that I still do not remember. I can still remember them. WORD BY WORD. The movie is still my family's favorite and my younger cousins ​​are also addicted to it. they even know that the songs in this movie are great and a nice movie for kids that has a moral lesson, so do not say it's not good because it shows that lying does not get you anywhere with a farewell comment: this movie is incredible. I would like the soundtrack, but I can not and yes, the animation is good, the jokes are funny and the action never stops. This film will go down in the history of children's cinema and, in my opinion, it is one of the only safe films left to show children.
