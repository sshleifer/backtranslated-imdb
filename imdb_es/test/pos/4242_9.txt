Chucky (the killer doll of "Child's Play" and 2 fucking sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using "Voodoo for Dummies") revives him. Then, through circumstances too complicated to enter, SHE is killed and puts her soul on another doll. Together they fall in love and kidnap a good couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's casket to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again ... <br /> <br /> Much better that sounds After the last two sequels of "Child's Play" (both were horrible) I expected the worst, but it was really fun. The film is not taken seriously for a second (seriously, how could it be?) And the lines and situations are quite funny. There are also some VERY bloody murders to satisfy horror fans and the movie never stops moving. The film also has some things that are not usually found in a horror movie: a gay best friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett) who is smart and does not play for laughs and a sequence in which Stabile takes off his shirt just to show his muscular body. John Ritter also has a good cameo as a sheriff. <br /> <br /> The acting is good. Stabile is young, VERY handsome and nice; Heigl does not have much to do, but he does, and Brad Dourif (Chucky's voice) and Tilly are as funny as killer dolls. My favorite part is when the dolls have sex (do not ask) and she asks for a rubber band and he replies: "But I'm MADE of rubber!" The special effects are good (there is no lousy CGI here) and this is one of the few horror movies that mix humor and violence in an entertaining way. Worth seeing. I give him a 9.
