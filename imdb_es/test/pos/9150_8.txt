Fran√ßois Villon was a real-life poet and rogue who lived in Paris in the fifteenth century. However, most of what is portrayed in this historical film is actually fiction, of a work created at the beginning of the 20th century. While in the film he met and befriended Louis XI, he actually died in his 30s and was never involved in all the intrigues as he was in this movie. In fact, he wrote some charming verses and was often on the wrong side of the law, not in the combination of a patriot and a Robin Hood-like character, as in the movie. As long as you know that the movie is almost 100% fictitious, it's worth watching, but do not assume it's a good history lesson. <br /> <br /> In THE BELOVED ROGUE, Villon plays with a wild abandon. John Barrymore. He was also very excited to see that his three friends were played by very familiar faces. Angelo Rossitto, who was a brave dwarf, played in tons of movies over the years and had a very long career. Slim Summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to movies. Mack Swain is better known as the silent film in many of Chaplin's short films and played his partner in THE GOLD RUSH. All four of these men did a good job and they have no complaints, even with Barrymore's excessive treatment that reminds a lot of the performance of Douglas Fairbanks. However, the performance with which I had a serious problem was Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI. Calling this "not subtle" would be a gross understatement. He played the role as a high school student who believed he was supposed to be the stereotyped Richard III, who hid and acted like a demonic caricature. While Veidt was wonderful in many, many movies (both silent and sound), but here it's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it is full of lustful adventures and action, like a braggart movie without the slightest effect. boats. The sets worked well for all this, as they had been used the previous year for THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. Both films were shot in the same period of time. <br /> <br /> In general, it is one of the last great silent films. There's a lot to like and the movie is a lovely combination of romance, comedy and action. It's worth watching, although he loses a couple of points for Veidt's overacting, as well as for the way the film develops quickly and loose with the story. <br /> <br /> By the way, this film was also made twice as much as IF THERE WAS KING (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are the closest to the original work. However, in total, six films have been about Villon and have, more or less, variations on the same story.
