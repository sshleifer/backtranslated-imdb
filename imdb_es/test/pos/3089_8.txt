Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary film by the extraordinary German filmmaker Werner Herzog, filmed for several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that must be heard with the comment activated. It is a visual feast of images from North Africa (mostly Saharan) that is timeless. It just could not be said that it was done more than thirty-five years ago. The film's soundtrack, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and the rock music of Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality. The narration of three different German narrators (the German film historian Lotte Eisner, Eugen Des Montagnes and Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg) is solid, and Herzog follows and continues the importance of Eisner for this project, himself and the history of cinema , but English The speaker of the translation, James William Gledhill, has a voice that seems frankly deific, which lends itself much more perfectly to this project, although much of the text, in either of the two languages, is quite superfluous. Yes, the false biblical sounds of the Maya myth of Popul Vuh Mayan in the first part of the film, Creation, are interesting, but the text Herzog wrote for the remaining two parts (Paradise and The Golden Age), along with quotes from a German poet Herzog. Names like Manfred Eigendorf, almost seems a satire of the somber tone of the first part. The film, it seems, was joined during the filming of several other Herzog projects at the same time, the fictional Even Dwarfs Started Small, and the documentaries The Land Of Silence And Darkness and The Flying Doctors Of East Africa, but the rejected material from these projects only add to the beauty of this film, like aerial scenes of a flamingo mating lake from afar, that give one a strange supernatural sense, one about which Herzog sings in his commentary. This supernatural feeling is present from the beginning of the film of several planes that land on a desert track, with increasingly blurry images as the heat of the ground increases, and increases the distorting waves that spoil the images. That this film was influential in Godfrey Reggio's Quatsi films is an understatement. But, while Reggio is content with just throwing images at you, Herzog has a skill that only American filmmaker Terrence Malick also has: creating a vocabulary totally independent of the juxtaposition of images and words, and one dependent on emotion: first push The analysis It can fail when it leads to such efforts. Herzog often does not even understand why his art is great. The best he does is often totally unconscious and mesmeric. This is the reason why his contempt for the pap of the lowest common denominator in Hollywood is overtly manifested in the commentary. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best illustration of this comes in a scene that, in the commentary, Herzog tells us that a severe drought in Cameroon followed. It shows the corpses of cattle, and Herzog describes the unbearable stench. However, the viewer can perceive all this from the images, the blackness of the portions of animals dried in the sun and the bleached bones. However, even in that comment, Herzog focuses on the stench, not on a deeper meaning. He is pleased to let you imbue and interpret what you will do and his work, like the almost erotically feminized forms of the sand dunes, that evoke a scene from Ingmar Bergman's Wolf Hour, where Max Von Sydow passes his hand Curves of the beautiful naked body of Ingrid Thulin. However, the archetypal image of this film, which symbolizes much of Herzog's career, is that of a distant car that advances and recedes on the surface of what appears to be a lake. It is profound, hypnotic, illusory, elusive, supernatural, but real, just like Herzog, the believer who came from a family of militant atheists. But, then, like everything else, it ends.
