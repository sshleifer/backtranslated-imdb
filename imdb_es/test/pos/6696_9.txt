As with some of the best movies and series, I stumbled upon this by accident. It was late, a storm was in full force outside and I was sitting comfortably on the couch when I passed a channel that was about to show one of the episodes. He intended to simply watch a couple of minutes while he waited for the ads to end on another channel before returning to some other series of comedy. About an hour and a half later, I remembered my determination and was so happy I had not done it. Needless to say, I made sure to watch all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> John Hannah has been brilliant in almost everything I've seen and he has not disappointed me either. All the other cast members also do a stellar job. My personal favorite (apart from John Hannah, of course) is Gerard Murphy. <br /> <br /> The only downside to this series is the limited number of episodes. Only 8 with JH and 1 additional with another person. I'd love to see McCallum on the screens again, although it would have to be with JH!
