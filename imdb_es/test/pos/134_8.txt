(This has been edited for the space) <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analogue to the viral invasion of a body), romance and some other things as well. It's a movie that has almost too much on your mind. The film takes its own subjects and mixes them with classical European literature, in this case "Thérèse Raquin" by Emile Zola. It is a strange mixture that does not always gel, but nevertheless has incredible power. It's been almost 24 hours since I saw the movie at Lincoln Center (with a discussion after the director's film) and I think my cage is getting more and more hectic. It's not so much what happens, it's annoying, it's more than its powerful history and its themes sound in retrospect. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film has a beloved priest who decides in the best way. Help humanity is volunteering in a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. Infected with the disease, it eventually succumbs and dies, but due to a transfusion of vampiric blood (it is not explained) it actually survives. Acclaimed as a miracle worker, the priest returns to the hospital where he had been treating the sick. Unfortunately not everything is fine. The priest finds that he needs blood to survive. He also discovers that he has all the typical problems of a vampire, and it is not possible for him to leave during the day. Things get even more complicated when you are reunited with a childhood friend and your family. The priest, some of his aroused animal passions are taken with his friend's wife. From there, everything goes sideways. <br /> <br /> A film in constant change, this is a story that unfolds in a variety of genres while telling the very human story of a man who discovers that his life has been radically altered. For a fortuitous event and discover that he is no longer who he thought he was. It is a film that you have to stay with until the end because the film always evolves towards something else. It is also a film that has a lot in mind and the themes with which it is performed are constantly explored in different ways. <br /> <br /> The movie has enough activity to do it, and people will probably do it, write books about the movie. <br /> <br /> The two strongest parts of the movie are its vampiric elements and its romance. The vampiric part of the story is brilliant. There is something about how you establish the basic rules and the nature of "affliction" that makes so much sense that you put aside old vampire ideas. Last night, sitting in the theater, I was surprised how impressed it worked. I think the fact that I played more or less directly is what makes the earth tremble. Here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life. It contrasts with what happens later, making it clear that living an existence of human hunters will not really work. It's not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, it's something else. Personally I think that the film changes the playing field from a great idea or dream to something more real and tangible. (The sequence where powers are activated is simply great) Romance is also handled wonderfully. Of course the sex scenes are amazing and well done, but it's the other things, the look, the conversation, the gestures out of sex that make this special. I love the looks, the quiet looks while the forbidden couples look at each other hungry, unable to act, the disappointment and pain of betrayal, both real and suspicious, and the crazy passion of possible consummation. This is one of the great film romances of all time. It perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of a deep passionate love (and lust). If you've ever loved deeply, I suppose you'll find something of your ear on the screen, I know I did. The phrase "I just wanted to spend eternity with you" has a sad regret. It is both a statement of what the intention was and the depth of the emotion. The tragic romance will break your heart. <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you and say that the movie is perfect and great. Not so, as good as the pieces are and almost all are great (especially the actors who have unfairly failed to seem amazing), the whole is not always given. The various genres, thematic elements and tones occasionally clash with each other. I often wondered where the movie was going. I stayed there even though the movie seemed to wander aimlessly. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie. I loved the pieces more than the movie as a whole. It has been going around in my head since I saw it, and I suppose it will for several more days. I like it or love is irrelevant, since this is a movie that really should be seen, since it has so much to offer you enough material to think and talk about during the following days. One of the meatiest and most abundant films of the year.
