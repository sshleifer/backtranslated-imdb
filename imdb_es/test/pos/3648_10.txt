People who say that some of the Looney Tunes cartoons are inappropriate for children have apparently forgotten something: originally they were not intended for children. They were produced for the cinema, to be shown before the movies, and so they could show what they wanted. "S.O.S. of Tweety" has that evil puddy Tat Sylvester find Tweety aboard a liner and board the ship to try to catch it. But two things work against Sylvester: the grandmother is vehemently protecting the canary, and Sylvester is easily dizzy (we do not see him vomit, but with his green face, they make it perfectly clear that he was doing that). And then, of course, the seemingly cute Tweety has a bad patch. <br /> <br /> It's great to see how these cartoons were not afraid to do everything possible; Whatever they thought to show, they showed it. We have to understand that cartoons should not always be a nice entertainment for children. Very funny.
