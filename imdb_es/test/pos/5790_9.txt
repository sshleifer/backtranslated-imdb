This documentary was my first introduction to the peak oil theory. A fascinating concept that has many terrifying consequences if it turns out to be correct. I had no idea that the effects of oil depletion would come so quickly that they literally took my breath away. This movie will probably open your eyes as to how strongly the American lifestyle depends on the "abundance of cheap oil," a term used throughout the film. Many of the issues are simply common sense, and do not delve much into any of them. But you probably never have put all the pieces together like this movie does. The interviews with the authors and experts in energy are very interesting. I do not think this movie is to scare people. It simply intends to inform people about what to expect in the next few years, and perhaps encourage them to think twice before traveling 100 miles to work and leave the lights on all day. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I was no longer able to look at the cars and buses zooming in the same way. Great documentary, everyone should see it.
