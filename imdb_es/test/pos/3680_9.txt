This movie is the most moving and funny movie I've seen in a long time. As a housewife ("housewife") and a fan (Rupert), I thought she was sympathetic. Anyone who misinterprets Dirk's angry outburst is wrong. Kathy Bates is not really an actress I know, but she's perfect, the whole cast is perfect for her roles. Julie Andrews had me on the dot. I'm seeing it after reading Rupert's self-biography, so the inclusion of it was even more fun. Sometimes it is terribly moving. I'm not really a fan of the kind of music in the movie, but you're attracted to the romance and you find out you're singing the songs for days. This movie deserves to be more available. Our favorite The scene involves Dirk and a gun and his pants, look at them and look!
