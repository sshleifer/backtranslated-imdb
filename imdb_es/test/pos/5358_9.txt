Wallace and Gromit are the main characters of some of the best cartoons ever created. The excellent combination of visual humor and pronunciation makes "A Grand Day Out", "The Wrong Trousers" and also "A Close Shave" some of the best animated images that have been presented on television. Winning several Oscars and many other awards, Nick Park became a very popular man in the United Kingdom, but its impact in the United States has not been great. After the third short film by Wallace and Gromit, there was all this speculation about a full Wallace and Gromit movie, however, for years nothing had happened. Then, in 2000, instead of a full Wallace and Gromit movie, we got another brilliant Nick Park movie, which was Chicken Run, which was almost nominated for best film at the Academy Awards. Maybe it was the success of this movie that finally led Park to finally work on a Wallace and Gromit project. <br /> <br /> 5 years later (this type of movie takes a long time to know) and much anticipation, Wallace and Gromit finally reach the big screen. Despite the weakest trailers and marketing campaign, this movie offers many ways. This film will be a delight for children and parents. With tons of adult humor hidden under the brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that manages to attract both children and adults. This rather difficult technique is one that only Pixar has perfected and DreamWorks has had many problems lately. Even though the DreamWorks logo was pasted on the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff of Aardman Animations. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are the first to see a business that protects the crops of the townspeople from being ruined by rabbits, which had apparently been running wild and in large numbers lately. Their business has given them a lot of respect from the others who live in the city because a gigantic vegetable contest was fast approaching and the crops needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace tries to manipulate the rabbits so they do not like the vegetables and then unleashes a large eating machine in the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the giant animal and prevent them from eating through the gardens and also their approval by the townspeople. To add to that, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, who also caught the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of Victor. Simple plot, yes, but there is more than meets the eye, get ready for some fun surprises along the way, like in the other cartoons of Wallace and Gromit. <br /> <br /> In animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that should establish the rhythm and mood of the film. Although it takes 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of images, the reward is fantastic. There is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one visualization to really be noticed. Even more incredible than the detailed and almost impeccable animation is the really indescribable amount of visual humor that is put into the film. Whether it's a creatively placed shot or normal tags placed in the most fun position possible, or are the adorable bunnies that are constantly shown in the movie, most of the humor in The Were-Rabbit Curse comes strictly from just watching the movie In itself and capturing all references before it's too late. Just imagine the movie Madagascar, except that references to pop culture are much less fun and better animation. <br /> <br /> The casting was great, although in a movie without much dialogue, it was not so important. Peter Sallis once again does a wonderful job like Wallace, although in this movie there was not a prominent quote that could be used at any time (The Wrong Trousers: "It's the wrong Gromit pants, and they were wrong!"). Ralph Fiennes does an excellent job as the main villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy protagonist in the cult hit "Fight Club") lends her charming voice while playing the loving interest of Wallace. Although nothing could overcome the final chase in "The Wrong Trousers," Curse of the Ware-Rabbit had many action scenes, including a fantastically performed chase scene between Gromit and Victor's evil dog. Last but not least, rabbits really steal the show in some moments. Whether it's their cute expressions, their funny movements or their howls, the rabbits in the movie even take some of the glory of the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the same rabbit "damn", until the end of the movie made the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: despite not being as memorable as "The Wrong Trousers", this movie is as good and entertaining as Chicken Run. Unlike almost all the films that will be released this year, the film does not creep at all, it registers in a brief 85 minutes and, nevertheless, it contains so much joy and fun, it will leave all those who see it asking for more. There is very little wrong with the movie; It was a pure pleasure to see him. This movie is a total contrast to the decent but vulgar, uncut, raw movies that have won a surprising amount of money earlier this year (Virgin of 40, Wedding Crashers and Sin City) and for families and those who They want harmless. entertainment; That is a good thing. Highly recommended, this is the best animated film that will be released this year and among the best we have seen in this decade. Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit: totally harmless fun from the second 1 to the second 5,100.
