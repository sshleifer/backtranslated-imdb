I like Dylan Moran from his work at Black Books, although I thought some of his examples were really indulgent in terms of long, confusing gaps ... however, I was intrigued to see this film starring him and Michael Caine, and curiosity It called my attention. better of me <br /> <br /> I was surprised. <br /> <br /> Dylan's vocal range and the characterization of the different people he played in the film was absolutely perfect, something beyond the abilities of a simple comedian and really on par with everyone else, John Hurt and the other greats, truly he was an expert in his interpretation. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine was a very convincing prima donna and the standard British movie. The device of having a precocious child on hand to be too wise and withered worked, the only aspect I really did not like was the incredible plot of the chemistry between Dolores and the cockney gangsta tough man played by Dylan. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it was great. <br /> <br /> I also like the ending not cop-out where it ended happily forever, but with MC getting a beating. Okay, it's not exactly what your enemies are chaining and they're disemboweled (which is what a real crime boss would do to you if you stole 50,000 pounds), but it showed at least a small part of the reality in the story. <Br /> <br /> I liked the movie, and I would recommend it to anyone, but I also warned you not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a little slow. If you hold it, everything will come back. <br /> <br /> And as far as the oath is concerned, well, they're in Ireland. Otherwise it would not be real.
