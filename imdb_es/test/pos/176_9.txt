Having seen Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on Saturday's blog linked to YouTube, I used those same sources to see a remake made in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man, Ub Iwerks. The colors, compared to the previous black and white, are actually used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the players of the skeletal band hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses the head and takes off the other or when one The dances with the other and part of that other disappeared are as fun as the previous short. It becomes a bit repetitive towards the end. However, Skeleton Frolics is worth seeing by any animation buff who wants to compare this with the previous Silly Symphony.
