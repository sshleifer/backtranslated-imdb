I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites are Unforgiven and Tombstone. This movie, however, I loved it! It was great! The plot was well made, and it was a fun movie. Everyone who had a role in this movie made it excellent! I even think he overcame both films in some way. Well, not really unforgiven because that was an excellent movie with which these two can not be compared in the long term. I think he beat Tombstone though. Both had strong points. For example, both had excellent well-known deals, very good plotting and very good shooting. But Posse beat Tombstone in four ways in my opinion. First, the characters were more unique in Posse. The music was better in Posse. The idea was original in Posse, unlike Wyatt Earp. And the biggest difference, the action sequences! Oh my God! Posse was a western with very good action sequences. I mean really good! The action was fast-paced. Like modern movies based on shoot'em up. The action also had big budget explosions! The fights were also pretty good. Mario Van Pebbles was great in this movie! I suggest buying this excellent movie!
