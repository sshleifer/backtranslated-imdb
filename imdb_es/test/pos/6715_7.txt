Lifeforce begins in outer space where HMS Churchill tracks Haley's comet and his team detects an alien spacecraft 150 miles long at the comet's head, unable to contact Earth due to interference. Colonel Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback) decides that this is the only chance to investigate it. Exiting in spacesuits, Carlsen and some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship and find the remains of a bat race as creatures and three perfect-looking humanoids, two men (Chris Jagger and Bill Malin) and a beautiful woman ( Mathilda May), all those who have been aboard the Churchill. Thirty days later, and back to Earth, Churchill is detected on the radar, a rescue mission is sent only to discover that the spacecraft is burned and all the crew supposedly dead. However, the rescue team finds the three humanoid aliens and takes them back to Earth, where in a space research center in London they come back to life and begin to literally suck the life force of the human victims that their Once they must do the same to stop dusting, things look bleak as the epidemic spreads across London ... <br /> <br /> This English production was produced by the famous Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus, who during the early years of the 1980s were responsible for many low-budget action films under their production company Cannon, usually starring Chuck Norris and wanted to move on to the big time and signed director Tobe Hooper into a contract of three movies (which were Lifeforce, Invaders from Mars (1986) remake & The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), a sequel to Hooper's own classic, all of which failed and it went bankrupt to Golan and Globus and Cannon no longer existed. Anyway, despite being a commercial failure at the box office, I must say that I think Lifeforce is a very fun science fiction horror, although quite silly. When it was originally released in theaters in 1985, Lifefore was reduced to 101 minutes by Golan and Globus, but in recent years the longer cut of 116 minutes virtually replaced it on DVD, VHS, Laserdisc and TV, although apparently the original cut of Hooper The movie lasted 128 minutes, so there are still more images somewhere. I'll base my comments on the longest 116-minute cut, the screenplay by Dan O'Bannon, Don Jakoby and the unproven rewrites of Michael Armstrong and Olaf Pooley based on the 1976 novel 'The Space Vampires' by Colin Wilson and has Many Ideas, its scope is really ambitious and one felt that it ended up being a bit of a disaster, but a hell of entertainment. It moves like a rocket and in the heart there is a very interesting story here, although the movie is entangled. There are also some funny moments in Lifeforce, the scene in which the security guard tries to convince the naked Vampire woman to surrender by offering him a half-eaten biscuit that is a true classic of the camp, the scenes of horribly exaggerated hypnosis, including the one in which Railsback ends up kissing. Patrick Stewart and many, many more besides. I do not know, call me weird, but I just thought that Lifeforce was tremendously funny and very entertaining in almost every way, from the ridiculous character, the strange dialogue, the strange ideas that never come together and some fantastic images. The movie that bores you. <br /> <br /> Director Hooper had almost more money here to play than he has (the double he had for Poltergeist (1982) even) and uses each part to bring this spectacular film to the big screen, John Dykstra , the person in charge of Star Wars (1977), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and more recently, Spider-Man (2002) was hired to handle the visual effects and, in general, to speak they look fabulous The sequences established in the outer space with spacecraft in particular look great, there are also some really good visual effects on Earth, including the destruction of London when hundreds of blue souls fly everywhere. There is some nudity but not much gore, there are some withered corpses, some bullet wounds, the skin of someone's hand is removed, squirts of blood from someone's eyes, nose and ears and there is a severed arm as well some zombies. The special makeup effects are also generally very good. I would not say that Lifeforce is scary, since it is more a science fiction movie than terror. I loved the way in which Hooper films the sequences of outer space while still turning his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness and there is no 'solid' floor so to speak. <br /> <br /> With an alleged budget of around $ 25,000,000, he earned less than half that of his theatrical career and has not illuminated the world on video or DVD, which is a shame because although it is a little messy It is very nice to see. Shot on location in England. Well shot on a 2: 35: 1 widescreen, the cropped 4: 3 image is awful and cuts huge portions of information from both sides of the screen, this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish what is happening and the sense of the immensity of space and the alien spaceship is lost. The acting is fine in a very silly movie, Patrick Stewart replaced Sir John Gielgud, Nancy Paul replaced Olivia Hussey, Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinski while Anthony Hopkins rejected the role of Caine. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a bizarre film, there are no two ways to really do it and anyone looking for something simple and direct should look elsewhere. Anyone looking for something a little different in the science fiction genre that Proves Lifeforce, since it is one of those bad movies that are so good with some impressive effects and that is not your average career in any way.
