I saw this the week it was opened four years ago and I really did not know what to expect as I was not familiar with Sorrentino's work at that time. He has created a very intriguing and ultimately moving account of a strange character, one for whom the phrase "life is for living" no longer applies. He beat me at all times and the story constantly surprised me. I really enjoyed the rhythm and the way they gradually gave me the pieces to solve what was happening. Tony Servillo is excellent, as is Magnani. It opens with a panoramic shot of brilliant style and concludes with a very moving image that takes the film to a sublime territory. I thought much later about the main character and the position he was in and his final destiny, and I did not shake it for weeks. I recently bought the movie and that final scene where he thinks his friend catches me every time. I still have to talk to someone who has seen this. It is a pity that it has not reached a wider audience, because if this is the direction of Italian cinema, it can only be a good thing.
