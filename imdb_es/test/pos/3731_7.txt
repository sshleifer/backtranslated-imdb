I saw this today with little background on what to expect from the story. I go to the cinema as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a "story". I thought it was a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :) <br /> <br /> Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere is not an over-actor. He remained firm and has a certain presence that we always hope for. It contributes its own style to the film. <br /> <br /> I think it was the kind of love story that is not always told. It was complicated and they had other priorities, but they wanted to be together and they wanted to wait for each other. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it!
