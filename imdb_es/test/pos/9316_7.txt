Supposedly he did back to back with 'The erotic nights of the undead' with the same cast and setting, but surely this does not have Laura Gemser. Very ridiculed by all, rather I like this movie. Of course, the plot and the dialogue are codwallop, but this is very well filmed in such a wonderful environment and I really like hardcore. I find it both naturalistic and exotic, and that does not mean there is a black girl and loose penises. I find the many and varied very credible sex scenes, even if two are placed on the trunk of a tree at the edge of the ocean with the waves constantly splashing. The creature does not deign to appear until half an hour before the end and it is, it must be said, a disappointment. Even so, in the remaining time he manages to kill all but two of the expedition and in case the girls have sex with them first (or at least in one case!) And this movie is not as slow as some argue. In addition, there are some good moments of sexplotaci√≥n, among them the scientific lady and her desire of two "natives", and the glorious end when the two survivors rush in their boat, they look back to the island from which they have escaped and find there. It is still time for a final act of copulation.
