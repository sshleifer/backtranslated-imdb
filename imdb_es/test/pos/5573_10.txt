Not since Babylon 5 by J. Michael Straczynski, a television program captured the wonderful art of applying a story arc to a television show. This is easily the best on TV right now! The characters are nice and one can easily attach to them and take care of their well-being. The villains are the type you love to hate and they leave you wondering what they will do next. And Brian Hensen's puppet work is the most innovative that exists. Congratulations to Rockne S. O'Bannon for a job well done!
