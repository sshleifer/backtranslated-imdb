I loved the complete savages! Why did they cancel it anyway? They should have done a second season and so on ... God! They always cancel good shows ... and leave all things boring. Nothing interesting on TV since Complete Savages has disappeared. This show was a great idea. A single firefighter father with five crazy children and a lazy dog ​​... Each and every one of them have their own madness in that house. TJ is always the child ... always the smallest ... Kyle is cool! He breaks everything he touches! He's always stopped, he's always doing things wrong ... But still, he's so funny because of all the things he does. Sam is the smart one. He is always shy and stupid when it comes to girls ... Finally, he ends up dating Angela. Chris is the sport type who does not have much to do with school, study and things like that. It is always funny. And finally ... Jack! The rock of the show. The oldest of all, the macho boy, "the rock star" ... But still, as crazy as everyone else. Nick is ... defenseless with these guys. Oh! And I almost forgot it! Uncle Jimmy ... He is the man! He is like a 30 year old boy. It's like doing the same stupid things that kids do. I always wondered how he ended up being a fireman ... And the dog is the image of the whole Savage family. The thing is that ... this show had everything to become something really big. I had everything, man! But, of course ... they canceled it ...
