In a word ... magical. And so incredibly real. Vijay Raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable, that you just want his characters to succeed, in whatever he does. And he interprets Hari Om impeccably, from his absolutely perfect "Bollywood e-shtyle" to his awkward and shy form with a first kiss. He is a truly talented actor and would not hesitate to see him in anything, because he gives everything to life and gives him a soul. Camille Natta is absolutely beautiful. It took me a while to warm up with her, possibly because she plays the role of an ignorant tourist but fascinated very well. Her transition really became her and she adapted very well to her role. Even the man you love to hate, her boyfriend Benoit, was wonderful, although you never really like her because of the scum she plays, Jean-Marie Lamour represents a perfect cad. The script- so real. I found myself repeatedly resorting to my friend throughout the film to say, "that's exactly what happens in India! They made it!" Very real, very raw. VERY bittersweet, but you certainly leave the theater feeling satisfied. The music of Nitin Sawhney is wonderful and blends perfectly with constantly changing moods. But Vijay Raaz ... I'm constantly coming back to him, because that's what this movie does. He is the hero, the most charming and charming rickshaw driver you have ever met, it is magical. A charming actor, real, sweet, incredibly talented that I can not wait to see shine and succeed in Bollywood, Hollywood or anywhere else!
