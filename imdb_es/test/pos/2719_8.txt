I thought I was wasting my precious $ 50 to watch this movie. But at the request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to appear for the film. Going to this cheap theater really bothered me, because I had seen King Kong for $ 50 at one of the best theaters in the city. At any time the movie started and, surprisingly, I did not complain. <br /> <br /> A great story and a really wonderful performance by Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma. Shabana Azmi, a divorcee who has dedicated her life to the welfare of her mother and step-sister. Konkona Sen Sharma a schizophrenic (avoid the spelling), who imagines things all the time. Rahul Bose also gives a stellar performance. <br /> <br /> The story is that Mithi (Sen Sharma) is a schizophrenic, and after being brutally raped in her fieldwork as a reporter, her levels actually increase, her girlfriend abandons her, for the person in the who became. In all its world it falls on her. Shabana Azmi, her older stepsister, takes care of her, and Mithi in her imagination believes that she has married her girlfriend, has 5 children and stays at 15th Park Avenue (which really is a place in New York). The plot continues as Mithi becomes suicidal, since she believes that nobody believes her and that she is held captive in her house by her husband. As fate would have done, Mithi and his girlfriend meet when they are both traveling. 11 years after the brutal rape, his girlfriend has no existence in his real world, he can not recognize it. His fiancee, now married and the father of two children, feels it is his duty to correct the wrong he did 11 years ago and promises to take her to Park Avenue. and he makes her take her to a place in Calcutta that supposedly looks like her husband's house. Like Joydeep / Jojo (Rahul Bose), his girlfriend is talking on her cell phone and loses track of Mithi. Everyone comes to look for her, but she is not anywhere. Finally, she gets what was denied to her, to her family, to her own imaginative family in her own world on 15th Park Avenue. <br /> <br /> I must say that it touched my heart. I myself am now a fan of the Aparna Sen address. The work of the camera is excellent. And the quality of the performance is the spelling of spells. Konkona Sen Sharma gives a solid performance as the schizophrenic child. Shabana Azmi gives another hallucinating role as the divorced older sister, who has the burden of supporting the family. Rahul Bose, another clean and calm paper (I do not know why this guy does not have great opportunities, he has a lot of potential). Finally, Aparna Sen, she still captivates the audience, even if she is not in front of the camera and behind her. <br /> <br /> A well-deserved 8/10 ....
