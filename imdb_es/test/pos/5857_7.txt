I knew little about this movie when I entered the theater for an advanced screening. From the ads I realized that it was a thriller. <br /> <br /> What we have is that "Compulsion" meets "Matlock". Two teenagers decide to commit a perfect murder. A victim is selected at random and then carefully executed so that no traces of the real killers are found. Then they put a bunch of false leads pointing to an innocent bystander. (Innocent of murder anyway) <br /> <br /> Enter Sondra Bullock as the investigative officer. (IMDB says that she is an FBI, but I do not remember that, I thought she was a regular policewoman) She is frustrated by the inconsistency of the profile of the murderers ("The profile does not fit the profile!") And by the power and influence of the father of one of the children. <br /> <br /> She also has her own demons, which figure prominently in her decision to become a police officer. But this is the only character that is really more than one-dimensional. All the others are quite flat. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, there really are no great emotions. It's mostly a cat and mouse game like an episode of "Matlock" (which she's watching at one point in the movie). The twist is that there are two involved in the murder. Who is the real killer, Justin or Richard? It will cost you eight dollars to discover it.
