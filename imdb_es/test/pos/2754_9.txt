Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you would be seeing when you attended a live performance. The feet, the faces, the general vision. Unfortunately, it is a bit short. But with that said, watching Colin Dunne is gratifying. It's an interesting contrast with Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, the changes in the original production of Dublin are evident. <br /> <br /> "Trading Taps" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion. Tarik Winston is amazing, as is his partner in the piece. <br /> <br /> I think the audio was better in this version than the original video production (1995). In Dolby 5.1 on DVD, it's excellent. <br /> <br /> Despite faulty videography, it is a must for Riverdance fans.
