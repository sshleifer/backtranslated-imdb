I totally disagree with the other comments! I also saw this movie in an early screening and I found it quite nice. Robin Williams is in top form. It's true that the tone is familiar, but it's Good Morning Vietnam's Williams: smart, funny, sharp. After too many dark turns, Williams finally returns to what he does best. The supporting actors give excellent performances, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays himself, as usual, but as the "agent" of the next president was a delight every time he was on the screen. Lewis Black plays only himself basically, but he is wonderfully well used here. There's also a funny twist on Jeff Goldblum. The movie is more than the trailer suggests, too. The movie is fun, but it is not a pure comedy as suggested. It has a bit of a suspense line, which everyone should seriously consider, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.
