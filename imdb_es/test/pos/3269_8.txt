The inspiration for this movie was the fact that the American Gangsters are well dressed, but the Aussies, well, when you can kill a guy as soon as you look at the blighter, you can dress up as badly as you want and people will not criticize you. . <br /> <br /> Jimmy is a fighter, an illegal boxer, sometimes an unhappy one, and Pando, the local leader of gang members on the cross, offers him work (ie, the famous Kings Cross district of Australia, not the London Cross as many British backpackers discover it by the hard way). <br /> <br /> Due to the feelings of love, he gets a job, loses a lot of money and has to give it to Pando before Pando and his heavy men can kill him. . <br /> <br /> A lot of black humor, interesting action, revelations about Australia's underside and human nature. He is very focused on Australian nature and explores the nature of Australian criminals (compared to the Americans and the British). <br /> <br /> One problem is that each element of the story does not have enough substance and depth, but it is a painting with broad strokes that covers a large amount of area not previously covered, so, as A global package, it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Combine it with "Chopper" and "Dirty Deeds" for its festival Aussie Crime or "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Miller's Crossing" for an International Festival that falls short in the gang festival criminals <br /> <br /> By the way, Bryan Brown is a great actor who has just made a large number of really bad movies. Here is one of his great movies.
