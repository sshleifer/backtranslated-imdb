This program is our family's favorite, and we believe it MUST be released on DVD for seasons. The title of "Promised Land" is very appropriate, since it is a positive statement about all the good that remains in this great country and the people who live in it. It is a type of "God Bless America" ​​program with inspiring stories, old-fashioned values, simple characters, truthful and encouraging messages, beautiful landscapes and well written humor and drama. It is a program that the whole family can enjoy and benefit from, without worrying about bad language, "adult" issues, harshness, violence, etc. We always feel blessed when we finish watching an episode and we can not wait to see it. Each of them again when they are finally released on DVD!
