Oh my God!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so amazing ... I loved it like a little baby and I still love it as an adult. It's my favorite Disney movie of all, the time, all the llllllllllllllllllll! You should look at it, look at it and love it. My friends and I look at it a ton ..... It's as good as yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart. My favorite part is the song and dance number with all the alleys and Thomas O'Malley. The writers / producers / directors completely nailed this ... yes, they nailed it to the wall. <br /> <br /> xoxo ~ Wolly ~ xoxo
