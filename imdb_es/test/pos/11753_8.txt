Holden and Jones SIZZLE in this film, but not in the way we think of today's sizzle, is very subtle and subtle, but palpable. Jennifer Jones, in particular, is SO SEXUALLY HOT in this film (much more than a caricature like Monroe ALWAYS was) because she creates a real woman, with ALL facets of being a woman: she is intelligent, intuitive and elegant. She is desirable and desirable. <br /> <br /> There is a scene on that famous hill, where she is lying on the grass, looking at Holden, and the expression in her eyes is classified as X, however, in the context of the scene and the character , in makes complete sense It is not necessary to say everything in the dialogue, as explained in most modern movies. Everything is there in his eyes, sexy but elegant. What an awesome and underestimated actress she was. (I saw it for the first time in the MADAME BOVARY program and I was equally impressed). I'll take it over Bergman, Davis or the two Hepburns any day.
