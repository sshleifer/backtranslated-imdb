It is characteristic that this film is not better known. Obviously, it lacks most of the elements that a successful theater film needs: heroes, villains, conflict and resolution, interest in romantic love ... <br /> <br /> Here everything is upside down, nothing works like I should, everyone is clumsy Sad, angry, hurt and hungry and nobody has a solution at all. In short: it is war and it is hell for all involved. People try to do their best, but interests, loyalties and so-called duty interfere. The image transports us in time to the Civil War with an intensity that is rarely seen in today's cinema. Honest and direct images of an intense beauty. The actors are very well chosen for the story and they make the characters come alive before our eyes. <br /> <br /> One silver dollar in a pile of five cents!
