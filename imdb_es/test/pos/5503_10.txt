A very different movie from Jerry Lewis, not like all those famous movies that everyone knows. Lewis deals with the difficult task of World War II and National Socialism in Germany in an unconventional way. But even more interesting and important, he does it in a very anti-American way. And as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry, the non-American means more sophisticated, more subtle, more intelligent or simply better. That is the reason why the film was not successful in the USA. UU., But a great success in Europe. <br /> <br /> In general, Jerry Lewis has shown with this film that he can do much more than that. simple slapstick comedy.
