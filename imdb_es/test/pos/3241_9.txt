Although it is a little away from the book, you can not stop loving the music and atmospheric settings. <br /> <br /> The scenes in Bath are exactly as they should be. Although if you have seen it as many times as I have noticed, the people in the background are the same in each scene, but other than that, I like the scene where they are in the hot baths, but did the men and women actually bathe together? how that? You could see all the men sitting around outside looking at the women. It also seemed strange that everyone had their hats, but maybe this was the style at that time. The scenes in the ballroom were very beautiful, the dance and the outfit looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first scene of the ballroom. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey looked appropriately imposing, but I enjoyed the Bath scenes better. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger offers a good performance, but not exceptional, as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance that Mrs. Allen feels. <br /> <br /> Ugh Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, he just talks a lot of crap, and he's not a cleric like he should be, it's hard to think He was in love with Catherine, but then the book never gave that Print. <br /> <br /> General Tilney is pretty good for Hardy, and Stuart also offers a good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, well, he gives the impression of being a corpulent and lustful man, maybe not the character represented in the book, but I like him a lot. <br /> <br /> I can handle scenes that are cut out of a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added, it usually bothers me. The marquesse! I hate her. She is not part of Northanger's story and neither is her page child. <br /> <br /> Some of the scripts are peculiar. When Catherine asks Elinor Tilney about her mother's death, she asks, "I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear?" What nonsense to say! Elinor's calm response is also stupid. <br /> <br /> Anyway, tell me if you agree or disagree with me
