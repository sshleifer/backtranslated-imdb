Some time ago, we read about the results of a survey conducted by some Sports Journal journalists. The questions posed were only two, and they were brief and accurate. <br /> <br /> Question number 1 asked the respondent to tell him who his most beloved college football team was. Question number 2 asked the fan to name his most hated college football team. The answer to both questions was simply, Notre Dame! ND is the maximum in both lists! Yes, love them or hate them, but you surely do not ignore them, <br /> <br /> The roots of this unique position of this Indepent * College Football Powerhouse are in one's life and career. , an adult, the little boy Norweigen Immigrant from Chicago called Knute Rockne. <br /> <br /> As a biopic, the production of KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-American (1940), was relatively close to the death of Coach Rockne in a plane crash of 1930. It took about 10 years since the movie premiered . That would mean that the preliminary work on the project began approximately 8 years after the great loss of Mr. Rockne in our Nation. <br /> <br /> His image and voice were well known by newspapers, radio and film news. Both Knute's Widow, Bonnie Skiles Rockne, and the University of Notre Dame had approval rights when choosing the actor to play the lead role and approve the script. We thought that they could not have done the job better. Pat O'Brien really looks good and was a footballer in college. Ronald Reagan plays the pivotal role of George Gipp **, a free-spirited student who goes to Notre Dame on a baseball scholarship! He was a soccer player "standing up". <br /> <br /> The cast is full of talented players. We have Griffith's veteran, Donald Crisp as p. Callaghan, C.S.C., President of Notre Dame. Albert Basserman is the father. Newland, Rockne's chemistry teacher and mentor. Gail Page appears as Mrs. Bonnie Skiles Rockne. Owen Davis, Jr. is Rockne's cohort, Gus Dorais (the pin in that historic ND vs. ARMY game at West Point). <br /> <br /> The cast is completed by Kane Richmond, Nick Lukats, William Marshall and William Byrne as the Four Horsemen Real life college coaches of Big Life Howard Jones, the 'Pop' Warner, Bill Spaulding and Amos Alonzo Stagg appear as themselves in scenes of Congressional Probe in College Sports and add an authentic touch. <br /> <br /> As for the biopic, KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American !, all you can say is that it is running, and did not slow down from start to finish. There is no lost time either. All screen time is used to move the story along. <br /> <br /> The use of the Notre Dame choir, the Campus itself and all that Brass Band rah-rah music all go with the feeling of really being there. *** <br /> <br /> * For this day, despite the fact that his basketball team and other sports teams compete in the Big East Conference, Notre Dame remains independent in NCAA football. What this means, in effect, The Fighting Irish plays a national calendar. <br /> <br /> ** There was no such agreement with the George Gipp Family. Some years ago there was a demand on the scene that portrayed the young Mr. Gipp giving the famous "Win Onr For The Gipper Speech". The television impressions of this KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN were less the speech on the deathbed scene. <br /> <br /> *** Throughout the years other Notre Dame films with themes were made. THE SPIRIT OF NOTRE DAME (Universal 1931) featured J. Farrell McDonald as a Rockne coach who looks like himself. It also featured the presence of Lew Ayers, Andy Devine Nat Pendleton, as well as members of the true Notre Dame Championship teams with the four real riders. Then, of course, we have RUDY (Tri-Star 1993) with Sean Astin, Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton, among others, in an excellent cast. There was also talk of an unauthorized film, critic of Notre Dame called GOLDEN GLORY, but nothing has materialized, right? (Warn me, dear reader, THANK YOU!) <br /> <br /> **** Warner The brothers always had good music, both in opening songs and in incidental music. In this Rockne movie, they have incorporated THE NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG into the score. Along with him were STEP NOTRE DAME and THE NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, which premiered at Rockne's funeral in 1930 at the Basilica of Notre Dame.
