SPOILER ALERT !!!! This was my son's review of the film, which he wanted me to publish. He wrote this, I swear it. <br /> <br /> With Malcolm in Middle, Frankie Muniz, and Amanda Bynes from Nickelodeon, they're going to show business. They are united in the actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar, and turned it into a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) have to go to L.A. to recover it. Jason's dad does not think he wrote that essay. So every time they see each other, Jason asks Wolf (Paul Giamatti) to call Jason's father because he wants his essay back. Wolf does not make the film, but the president of the company does it. In the end, the family and Kaylee see the film, made by Wolf Pictures and based on a true story written by Jason Shepherd.
