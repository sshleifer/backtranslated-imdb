I would recommend this as the most successful attempt so far to make a film about the Afghan Soviet war. And it is a very honest and responsible image, from small details of uniforms and weapons to human relations, war routine and landscapes of Central Asia. He was shot in Tajikistan just after the withdrawal of the troops that occurred in 1989 and not in 1985. The Italian star Pl√°cido was simply perfect in the role of Major Bandura. Other characters also seemed very natural, especially the administrative officer of the club was always drunk :-). The scenario seems a bit stuck in the end, but it could be an impact of the Civil War in Tajikistan that started right during the filming of the movie. All the film crew had to escape sometimes even under fire. The last scene is the kind of behavior purely "harakiri" and it reminded me of the final phrase of a famous samurai movie: "We won all the battles but we lost the war". It could also be a metaphor for the collapse of the USSR, the great country that allows itself to be shot in the back by the offended little boy.
