This movie is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are truly hilarious. The dialogues are ingenious and colloquial. The tension in the film comes not so much from the plot of the "murder mystery" as from the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel. <br /> <br /> The first story involves the characters played by Trintignant and Kassovitz. Trintignant is an old adrift, with a somewhat ridiculous macho hardness, who is followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz with many kind smiles. Many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters, for example, when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz how to intimidate. <br /> <br /> The second story tells how a salesman, played by Jean Yanne, gives his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend. Yanne plays the role with a kind of aggressive irony. I wish I could describe this better. <br /> <br /> After a while, the viewer understands how both stories are connected and, in fact, are at the end, in a surprising but also logical ending. <br /> <br /> The film is a successful mix of the ingenious but superficial gangster films that the director's father (the famous Michel Audiard) used to write, and the "typical French film" with a lot of psychological depth and great care in the exhibition of emotions.
