My family (two of 40-somethings, one of 8 years old and my mother of 71 years old) saw this in advance on April 29th. We all enjoy the movie very much. The story was good, and knowing that it was based on real-life events made it much more enjoyable. Luke Wilson was hilarious (pun intended) to watch as Tim Blake Nelson. And seeing Neil Flynn touch something other than "the bad Scrubs concierge" was nice. The children of the film did well and I am sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic group at the strength level. The images were simply beautiful and Jimmy Buffet's music was added to the "Florida feeling". Well, maybe the story was too clean and well packaged for some adults, but hey, who cares? I can not compare it to the book, I honestly had not heard it until the movie came out. <br /> <br /> It was just a NICE movie and I had a good message. Plain and simple.
