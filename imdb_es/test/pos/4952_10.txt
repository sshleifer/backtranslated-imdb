Lou Gossett, Jr. is great as 'Chappy Sinclair', a super pilot of the US Air Force. UU Who comes to the rescue of a sympathetic but undisciplined 'Doug Masters' (Jason Gedrick), the son of a captured pilot who is determined to borrow a pair of fighters from the F-16 to use in an attempt to save his dad from a dictator (David Suchet) from a foreign country in the enemy. <br /> <br /> Better than 'Top Gun', this Air Force aviation movie has enthusiasm and a lot of explosions, you know, all those cool things you'd want from a movie of contemporary military adventures. <br /> <br /> Great music, like Dee Snider from Twisted Sister that says "We're not going to take it" and The excellent 'Never Say Die' by King Cobra. <br /> <br /> Aim high! Air Force!
