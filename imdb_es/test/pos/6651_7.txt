Its initial premise is based on the American Civil War, but ultimately it is a love story. We begin at the beginning of the war, where the main characters (Kidman and Ley) are obviously aware of each other and there is an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss the day they go to war. The main objective of this film is that the character of Law returns to Kidman and his struggles to achieve it and his struggles to survive until he returns. The reason why he can not convince is that we do not see enough of this relationship before Law's character goes to battle. It is hard to believe the premise that 2 people crave so much because they have had so little contact. Everything else is fine, Renee Zellweger and her incumbent father and her entourage are lovely additions, as is the threat from the gang that chases the defectors. Of course it's a long movie, but it keeps the interest and the cinematography is great. An honorable attempt that does not succeed but that is worth seeing.
