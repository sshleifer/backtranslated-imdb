"A Gatto nel Cervello" / "Gato en el cerebro" is one of the greatest horror films ever made. There is a lot of blood and blood, including the chainsaw, the bloody stabs and numerous beheadings. The movie is also interesting parody "of Fulci, but gore and violence is the key element in it." Some of the gore FX were taken from Fulci's own films "When Alice Ruppe the Specchio" and "I Fantasmi di Sodoma" "(both from 1988), plus gore FX taken from Fulci supervised" The Snake House "aka" Bloody Psycho "by Leandro Lucchetti," Massacre "by Andrea Bianchi," Non Avere Paura Della Zia Marta "by Mario Bianchi," Non Si Sevizia i Bambini "by Giovanni Simonelli and" Luna di Sangue "aka" Fuga dalla Morte "by Enzo Milioni (all year 1989) The scene in which Brett Halsey hits the woman's face to the pulp is from" Quando Alice " Ruppe lo Specchio ", a film that Fulci had made for Italian television in 1988. The chainsaw of the female corpse is initially taken from the same movie, as is the head in the microwave and the boy tha is handled again and again Highly recommended, especially if you like extreme cinema.
