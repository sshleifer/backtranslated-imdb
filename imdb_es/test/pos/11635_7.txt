Mighty Like A Moose is one of the many shorts that director Leo McCarey made with Charley Chase. What a dandy! Charlie and his wife undergo plastic surgery to improve their horrible appearances without the knowledge of each other. Then they meet at a party and fall in love with each other. Now they can not allow others to discover that they are cheating. That is the absurd premise of this frantic farce. Vivien Oakland, one of the few comic short tracks to have a flourishing career long after the silences, is perfect as Charley's wife. Charley has a horrible case of dollar teeth, which are quickly sent to the dentist. After the police assault a party for no other reason to practice raids, Charley and his wife try to avoid each other at home for fear of knowing the alterations in appearances. Both have been photographed with their new features at the party. Home hilarity culminates when Charley tries to teach a lesson to the no-good-nick cheating with his wife. The no-good-nick, of course, is the new Charley, which his wife realizes long before Charley gives him a lesson in fidelity. This is one of Charley Chase's best efforts. *** of 4 stars.
