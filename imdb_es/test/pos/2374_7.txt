The final delivery sees Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi (looking cooler than ever in their reversible coat) thrown against each other for a final battle, this time in the future. The plot owes a lot to Blade Runner, but done in a low budget style, frantic and comical Takashi Miike. I felt it was the weakest of the three DOA films, and although the ending was still outrageous, it lacked the shock value of the previous two. Compared to the likes of Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q, DOA: Final is far from extreme, but it is true to the other two films in the trilogy. That said, fans of the first two (and Miike fans) will get a lot from this as it unites the three films and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists.
