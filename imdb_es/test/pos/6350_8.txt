This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle way, something that sets him apart from most movies with this plot. Mr. Lam (Jacky Cheung) has a relationship with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also very good at "Koma") in what at first seems to be an inexplicable situation. He is married for 20 years to Ching (the great Anita Mui, in his last role before being cruelly removed), and it seems to be a loving relationship. When Ching offers to take care of her and Mr. Lam's former teacher, Choy and Mr. Lam have the opportunity to be together. What makes the movie so good is the rhythm of the director Ann Hui. It takes a while to discover the secrets of Lamsm and everything makes sense. The movie is very dramatic and moving. You do not feel repulsion for the situation of the teacher / student, something that elevates this film over many with the same plot. It's slow, but stay with that. Also, enjoy the wonderful, unpleasant but beautiful performance of Mrs. Mui. She was and is someone really special and in this movie you fall in love with her for the last time. It is worth the time to witness and just be there with her.
