There is something that one of the characters (the old film director who pretends to be dead) says that he can summarize the whole film: "In Italy it is the dead who rule". True! This is a country without a future, in the hands of old and jaded men. And Bellocchio's cryptic portrait of the country, which revolves around the seemingly meaningless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to make a living, manages to say a lot about what does not work here. But foreigners can lose the point, since it is not clearly expressed. I understand that Australians or Canadians who see this can get bored and wonder if there is a meaning; Well, there is a meaning, but it is clear only to the people who live here today, and keep their eyes wide open ... like Bellocchio. Surely not one of his best films, and not as powerful as Buongiorno, notte, but it's worth seeing ... for Italians living in Italy.
