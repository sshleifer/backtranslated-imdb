this is great !!! There is no society like Errol and Olivia. There, love is genuine! I'm 24 years old, but this movie is as captivating now as I'm sure it was 60 years ago. Raoul Walsh is an undervalued genius, his direction is so wide, so wide, but so intimate. The last scene between Colonel Custer (Flynn) and his wife (de havilland), almost made me cry (It's not easy for a 24-year-old boy!), It's so heartbreaking. There is also a profound Christian message implicit here, the faith that Custer has in bringing your glory with you, and the trust and fidelity of his wife to the point of letting him go, so that he fulfills his moral duty to protect the innocent. Civilians of a certain massacre. There is not a movie that deals with these issues in this way. A must for anyone who wants to see this defining moment in American history and military from the inside. Patriotic, for all the right reasons. I knew that Errol Flynn was a star, and De havilland was a screen legend, this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the greatest!
