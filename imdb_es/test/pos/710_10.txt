I love seeing the Jericho Mile. I mean to see Peter Strauss running the mile, it's like seeing how 100ft bolt sprint uses. I think Peter Strauss is an excellent actor and should make another film to run. He is very fast, has a lot of energy and can run a mile in less than 4 minutes and my friend is amazing. No living man can get out of the Murphy rain run. I mean, the man runs 80 miles a week. Nobody does it, except him. I have seen the Jericho Mile 100 times and I will see it 100 more. Great movies are seen more than movies that are not. I thank the creators of this film for giving years of life to achieve it. They are excellent people and I bless you all. Thank you for letting me give my word again, thank you all.
