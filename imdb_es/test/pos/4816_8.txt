This eloquent and simple film makes a very clear statement about a teenager and his father. Although it is a theatrical version, it has a quality "made for TV". We can attribute it to the director, John Frankenheimer, who learned his trade in the early days of live television in New York City. In fact, he directed the teleplay game on which the film is based, "Deal a Blow," on the CBS drama series "Climax." "Young Stranger" represents his debut in Hollywood. After a break of four years, during which he would make more television, he directed "The Young Savages" with Burt Lancaster and, a year later, "All Fall Down" with Warren Beatty and Angela Lansbury. <br /> <br /> The casting is competent with James Daly and Kim Hunter (particularly good) playing the parents of the title character played by James MacArthur (his first theatrical film) who played the same role in the television version , which was his first appearance on The Small Screen. Look for James Gregory and Whit Bissell in supporting roles.
