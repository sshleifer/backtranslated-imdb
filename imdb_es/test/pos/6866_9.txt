This movie will send shivers down your spine, even if you do not understand German. I first saw it in my German class in high school and found it for $ 5 at my local Wal-Mart. I've seen it at least 20 times since * this was only a couple of years ago * and it's great to see it on a movie night. The plastic bodies are mostly real, used by Body Worlds. This movie was an attack on that. A German Dr., nicknamed Dr. Death, began to laminate human bodies to exhibit them and now Body Worlds is a touring agreement, right now in Chicago IL. Many people opposed this and a great German horror movie was made. Personally, I love this movie and I would recommend it to everyone who likes suspense films.
