In general, I enjoyed the movie Scarlett. I'm a big fan of Gone with the Wind. I have read the book and have seen the classic movie many times. I even have a small collection of Scarlett O'Hara ornaments and other things. I must admit that Gone with the Wind is my favorite book and movie of all time. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are notable actors and two of my favorites. Unfortunately, I could not read the Scarlett book, but I was excited to see the movie. In fact, the film is not a place close to the caliber of Gone with the Wind and neither are the actors. However, Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were nice actors in the roles and on many occasions Joan sounded like Vivian Leigh in her interpretation of Scarlett. Dalton also represented Rhett well sometimes. It took a while to get used to the different actors, but in general I enjoyed it a lot, being the fan of What the wind took me as I am. A big disappointment was that Joan did not have green eyes and Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Leigh did. I also found Mr. Fenton absolutely atrocious and I did not like his character. If you are a fan of Gone with the Wind and / or enjoy romantic stories, watch the movie Scarlett. However, do not expect it to be remarkable as Gone with the Wind. It's far from that, although it's interesting with the new characters and so on. I'm happy it's not a remake and some of the events in the story were what I imagined the continuation would be of the love story of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. If you have not seen it today, do it tomorrow, after all, tomorrow is another day. :)
