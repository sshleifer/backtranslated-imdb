Almost no film experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a school teacher who suffers from amnesia. Even in the PTA! But then, a car accident awakens the woman she used to be, and she's HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is as funny as the low-income private eye that tries to help Davis find his past, only to discover that he's in the way of the head. Davis also has some fun lines, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well. <br /> <br /> Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse finally managed to get rid of his TV image of St. Elsewhere. The film is directed by Davis's husband, who seems to have built almost the entire movie around him, but it works. <br /> <br /> I take out this DVD and I watch it again often. I still love the makeup scene. Is Geena hot or what?
