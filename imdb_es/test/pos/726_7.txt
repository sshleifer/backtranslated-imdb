What can I say? Not as bad as many here have made it to be. The only reason I even saw this movie that I had never heard of before, was strictly for IAN McSHANE. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed in the least. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings a surprising subtlety to his role. It's always great to see and for my money ... an extremely underutilized actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the movie ... All the other actors in the film offered solid and solid performances. These people certainly were not paid large amounts of cash for their participation (since it was a fairly low budget film), but this did not mean that none of them "sent" their appearances by mail. All were convincing and convincing with the parties given. for them. <br /> <br /> I was even pleasantly surprised by the performance of ADRIAN PAUL, although I must admit that I have only seen him on the HIGHLANDER television series before this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was A good rhythm and the plot is intriguing and very similar to real life, not all ends tied in a nice little package at the end of the movie. Someone who was waiting for a clear answer, by the numbers, connect the "conclusion" or "answer" points at the end of the movie ... CLEARLY I was not watching the movie with enough attention! This movie is not going to tell you what the "meaning of life" is! The idea is that after watching the movie, you can go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends having a coffee. I certainly did. <br /> <br /> No car chases ... No explosions ... No fights at the bar ... (sounds pretty boring, huh?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed by the Movie and It is just a small piece well written with an interesting hook and a solid performance of characters by all parties involved. <br /> <br /> ****** WARNING ... ****** If you're the kind of person who does not like movies that hang a huge "question" as the central engine of the story and then they end it without answering that particular question directly ... <br /> <br /> YOU COULD NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE.
