The Simpsons, of course, started with the Christmas special "Simpson's Open Fire", which had basic drawings and does not laugh out loud, but this episode is probably the first to laugh out loud and from here the show simply improves and better. This episode centers around Bart, who in this episode exchanges a test of Martin and enters a school for gifted, which leads Bart to repair his friendship with his father and lose all his companions. The episode is very funny and shows what would become the best show that has ever been seen. The fans of the series will love this episode, as it presents the characters exactly how they became 20 years later. So watch this episode in a Season 1 pack and enjoy the first Simpsons doing what he was meant to do, laugh at the people. I rate this episode 73%.
