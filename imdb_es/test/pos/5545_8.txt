This is a funny movie with subtle intention. His comedy out of rhythm is very funny for me, without grace for my friends. The soundtrack is perfect. <br /> <br /> I own this on VHS and I've seen it many, many times, because it's just a fun and funny love story with great performances by all the directors (although I only use Joan Cusack as a perch for her big hair was a waste of her talent, I know, I know, she was still young ...). <br /> <br /> On a sad note, I decided to watch the DVD last night (instead of watching my VHS tape), and FOUND to find many crucial scenes. And in the copy I saw, there was no special feature of the deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes had never existed! I am very happy to have bought the used VHS in a flea market. <br /> <br /> It is clear that there was a lot of choreography in this, which is another reason why I love it. It takes great skill, talent and genius to get around the scenes like Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell and Matthew Modine from scene to scene (notice the scene where the grocery carts converge, rolling on the ground during the shooting Miami, Chicken Lickin 'debacle, foot massage, hair washing in the living room.) There is a very "theatrical" feeling in this movie, which may be the detour for many who are followed badly by critics: I know some spectators who do not understand this style well confuse exaggerations and exaggerated performances with poor performance and worse direction. Not so Jonathan Demme does a great job giving life to the whole company and their respective roles. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and the first scene are also among my favorites of all time (another of the opening credits / first favorite scene: Fly home). <br /> <br /> Too bad Matthew Modine jumped so fiercely from the public eye; I really like it, and I found his PERFECT casting in the role of Mike Smith. Actually, this film is well distributed from the soup to the nuts: all are believable and faithful to their role. As for the question of waiting for the audience to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians, why not? I thought you did it perfectly well. <br /> <br /> Charming, fun, exciting ... what do I not like? If you want to have a little fun, look at this peculiar and colorful story of love adventures and mafias. If you want more information about organized crime and their families, tune in to The Sopranos on HBO.
