This is a great movie to watch, since it is very well directed by Andrzej Wajda, but at the same time I wanted the film to have something more in depth, in terms of its history. It is a historically relevant film about the last days of the French Revolution, but even so, the film forgets to focus on the motivations of the character, which makes the film a bit too shallow to be considered a brilliant and relevant film. every thing. <br /> <br /> Somehow it does not make the movie less cool to watch it. It is made with passion and an eye for detail. All aspects of the film are attractive, such as settings, costumes and camera work. <br /> <br /> Also, the story is still powerful, although at the same time it could have been much better. more powerful with just a little more character development and historical information. I suppose if you are completely familiar with the French Revolution and the stories of Danton and Robespierre in particular, this movie will be perfect for you to see. <br /> <br /> It is typical of a French film to tell a slow and subtle story, without even giving too much detail. This often works charmingly, but in this case the film could have done it a little more deeply. Apart from that, this film is still a good example of French cinema, although it is being directed by a Polish director and also has many Polish actors. <br /> <br /> GÃ©rard Depardieu is excellent in his role, although the film also decides to concentrate a lot on many other different characters. Maybe the movie has too many characters, but each and every one of the performances are excellent, so this never becomes a big complaint, apart from slowing down the story a little in certain points. <br /> <Br /> A great movie that could have been brilliant. <br /> <br /> 8/10
