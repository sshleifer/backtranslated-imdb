Better than the original, "the Gamers: Dorkness Rising" manages to carry out a funny comedy with good acting, good special effects and comedy that transcends the knowledge base of "gamer" and does it with a low budget. I have seen many low budget movies that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their high budget counterparts. This movie blows most conventional movies! The parts are a little weak (the bit with the pirates and the ninjas, although funny, it lasts a little without explanation and it takes you a little out of the movie) but, in general, this is a very strong movie. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to say that I bought this movie as soon as I saw it and brought it home. <br /> <br /> Any chance we can see another Gamers movie of these guys? :)
