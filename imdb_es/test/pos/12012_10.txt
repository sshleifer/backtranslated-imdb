This film accurately portrays the struggle that life was for the typical East German. Observed by the secret police, friends and co-workers, most Orientals simply existed. <br /> <br /> The Strelzyk and the Wetzel were two families who decided they would not take it anymore. <br /> <br /> Despite the extreme danger of escaping to the West, they feel that the rewards far outweigh the risks. John Hurt and Beau Bridges, portraying the respective family heads, had the idea of ​​flying over the heavily fortified East German border. <br /> <br /> There are tense moments as they gather and place the necessary materials for the flight. They work in their day jobs and build the balloon at night, right under the noses of the authorities, one of which is the neighbor of Strelzyk (Klaus Loewitsch). <br /> <br /> The first attempt, involving only the Strelzyks, ends in failure when the balloon crashes a few meters from the border. The starry globe is discovered by border guards and begins a relentless search for conspirators who are determined to try again. With the sales of materials that are monitored closely, Peter and Guenter still manage to obtain pieces and pieces of cloth with which to build a second balloon so that their nails escape to freedom. The film also features a moving and effective soundtrack by the late Jerry Goldsmith.
