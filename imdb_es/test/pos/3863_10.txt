The twentieth Disney animated classic is often criticized by many people as "mediocre" or of poor quality, but it is a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that "The Aristocats" does not get the well-deserved credit. Personally I see it as one of my favorite Disney classics. <br /> <br /> Despite being extremely underestimated, it is one of Disney's funniest classics. It is full of hilarious moments (some of them hysterical). <br /> <br /> Edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain of the movie, but it's a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favorite Disney villains because he's so funny. <br /> <br /> All the scenes with Edgar and the hunting dogs Napoleon and Lafayette that chase him are among the most fun you'll ever see, especially Edgar's. He drives his motorcycle to the river and around the bridge, with the dogs chasing him. That is hysterical! <br /> <br /> But classic humor does not come only from Edgar or hunting dogs. Other characters also have their moments. <br /> <br /> On the subject of quality, it is not perfect, but it remains at a high level. Even after the death of Walt Disney, these artists knew how to stay true to Walt's spirit and "The Aristocats" is one such example. They do not do it that way today! <br /> <br /> As usual, the legendary Disney actors express the characters. In this case, we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. <br /> <br /> The characters are great in general: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and his 3 kittens, the Roquefort mouse, the street cats, the English geese, the hunting dogs and the horse. The human characters are also included: the eccentric and amiable singer of Opera Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, the comedic lawyer of Madame Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself. <br /> <br /> On the soundtrack, it has some nice and catchy songs like the theme of Thomas O'Malley (but I do not remember his name), "Everyone wants to be a cat" and "The aristocrats" (sung by Maurice Chevalier), for example. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in Paris (France), in the year of 1910. Above all, this is a happy, pleasant and very pleasant film. A timeless classic that is often underestimated and forgotten, but worth a lot. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the Top 250.
