This comes from much of the same creative team behind "Better Off Dead", but it's not as good as that incredible teen comedy. It's a lot of fun, but it's everywhere and it's not that fun. Curtis Armstrong is used to a minor effect (it was incredibly funny in "Better off Dead", Bobcat Goldthwaite is funny, Cusack is good, Demi Moore is Demi Moore (only with better hair here) .In general, it's fun, and as a person from Cape Cod, captures the feeling of a summer of the 80s on Cape Cod. For some reason, this movie feels more "conventional" than "Better off Dead." There is not so much absurdity in left field here. from John Cusack and Savage Steve Holland, it is definitely recommended.
