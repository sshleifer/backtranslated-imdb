I was in a friends house for Thanksgiving and I saw a DVD of the movie, Eddie Monroe. I've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years (I loved the McMullen brothers) and I was impressed by how good this movie is. My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this movie was shot on Super 16. The picture was so good that it looked like a 35mm session. In addition, the music combined with the direction of Fred Carpenter, was art. The story was original and led to an ending that surprised everyone we saw ... very well. The performance of the entire cast was good, especially the actor he played, Uncle Benny. He was amazing This movie was a delight for the holidays, and I loved being one of the first to see a movie that many will see in the future.
