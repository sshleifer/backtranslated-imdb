Uzumaki has a unique history and I will never see spirals in the same way again. Actually, it's not a chill of terror, this movie has a dark and sour feeling. During certain parts, was it just me or did you see vortex images? The camera shots are interesting and the movie lets your imagination run wild. The strange supernatural feeling of this film appeals to you, just as the title suggests. The performance is well done and the configuration of the city itself seems to be wrong to begin with. <br /> <br /> This may take some sightings to sink. A great trippy movie.
