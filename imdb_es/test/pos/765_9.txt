I heard about this movie, but I did not see it until my daughter, who saw her on a flight to Australia, told me it was a great movie. I was interested in seeing if Rupert Grint, far from Harry Potter, was showing the promise you see in the Potter films. I was not disappointed. He has become a good actor, showing a range in driving lessons, from a shy boy who is beaten by an obsessive mother who surpasses him, to a young man who considers himself worthy of his own esteem and that of others. Reviewing the lines of the plays and poetry with his old-age employee, it is obvious that she is ready to take on much more complex roles in the movies and on stage. But the jewel in this movie was Julie Walters. I had seen her before in the films of Potter, Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls, and I loved her. In Driving Lessons, just as she does lines of poetry and Shakespeare, I was impressed by her times, her command of the language and her body language. I hope it's make-up / costume, because it portrays an older woman with osteoporosis, although it's not mentioned in the movie. As a nurse, I can say that she did it perfectly, playing a woman on the verge of old age, but clinging to the brilliant past in which she delighted. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I wish I'd seen it in a theater first, but I doubt I've ever played anywhere in Albuquerque. Here we miss many of these movies.
