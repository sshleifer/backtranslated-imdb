Of all the Star Wars parodies I've seen, this is probably the most fun. Not for the premise, Star Wars with simple electronics instead of space ships, but for the bad performance it has. This is overexcited on purpose, and it makes it hilarious, and as everyone knows that it is purposefully overrun, nobody complains. The special effects were also intentionally as terrible as they can be, and include a toaster on a visible string that shoots a toast and an egg beater on a string. This short is fun for any Star Wars fan (which I am not), or anyone who has 15 minutes to kill. Great short! <br /> <br /> My rating: *** of ****. 13 minutes Not Rated
