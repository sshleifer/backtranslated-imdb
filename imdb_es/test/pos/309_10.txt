Of all the films of the Vietnam War, this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and it is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. He has this strange feeling. Everything is so chaotic in the movie that it scares you. It's not like it shows many different things compared to the other movies of the Vietnam War. What drives such a high level is: <br /> <br /> The direction was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows his talent in his latest epic film. Unlike other directors, it makes you feel like you are at war. Most of the others only show and show the horrors of war. Coppola although it makes you feel confused, surprised and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. This is something that I have only experienced very rarely when watching a movie. The writing was, of course, incredible too. It brought you writing in the middle of the movie. I never got bored and this movie is three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the direction that was added to the strange experience of watching this movie showing all the chaos that surrounds you, even when everything seems calm. <br /> <br /> The performance was chilling. Just look at Marlon Brando who is also giving his last big performance as a deceived, out of place colonel. When I think of a crazy madman done, I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando in this movie you do not want to look him in the eye. Like the movie was a freak. For me, this performance is as memorable as it was in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best of his career, making you see everything through his eyes all the madness he is experiencing and still want to reach his goal. It's just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show some of that madness with his absurd battle strategies, among those who play music to tell the enemy that is approaching. Also the character of Duvall who asked one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was shocking but believable. A young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest gave other great supportive performances, which summarized the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a clich√©. Also, for once, the cameos were used having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford, whom I love so much. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and everyone involved in its realization is at its best. There's nothing more I can ask for from this film with his great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and grand finale. Look at it and you will see why it is up to its title Apocalpyse Now.
