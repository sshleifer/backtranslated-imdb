I discovered that the story was enough of a thriller in which the wonderful music of Henry Mancici did not calm me down. julie andrews was excellent and I do not understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out, because in the end it makes me happy to have everyone singing. and I like happy forever after the endings, which I think you can say that this movie has along with some traditional blake edwards humor ...
