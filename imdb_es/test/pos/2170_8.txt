This movie was better than I expected. I do not think he deserved a grade of R, however. I've seen PG-13 movies with worse language and violence. I found this movie entertaining and I enjoyed it. If you are a person who analyzes everything, you may find many errors, but if you take it at face value, I think you'll find it entertaining.
