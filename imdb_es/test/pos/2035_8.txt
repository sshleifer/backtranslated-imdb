ROCK STAR is a well-told version of the Hollywood style of the story based on how Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg took advantage of his charming boyish charm and acted admirably admirably, something he's known to have done since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS. <br /> <br /> Stephen Herek, no stranger to music-themed films, takes the audience through the wonders of the dizzying lifestyle of an extinct species, the God of hair-metal rock. "Izzy", by Wahlberg, acts as the host of the film and plays all the men who come to see his wish come true. His friendly character quickly wins over the heart of the spectator, who wants to see him succeed and gives him the opportunity to give him the hand signal "Horn of goat" metal several times. <br /> <br /> The only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast, that is, the other members of the band, did not materialize, or even show up, correctly. Greater interaction with these rock musicians of a lifetime would have amplified and solidified Izzy's new surroundings. <br /> <br /> Naturally, ROCK STAR is full of good music. The score of Rabin, the original work of Steel Dragon and a lot of successes of Metal in the style of the 80s, make this soundtrack an essential tool. Let's hope that films like ROCK STAR not only give credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation, but also provoke a much-needed renaissance.
