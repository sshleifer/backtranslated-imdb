If I had to decide which was Ernest's best film, and not act as if that kind of thing did not happen all the time, it would be this one. <br /> <br /> All of Ernest's films are entertaining, but the best ones are those that have Jim Varney making several different characters. In addition, I am known for enjoying the comedy styles of Bill Byrge and Gailard Sartain as brothers Chuck and Bobby Tulip. "Ernest Goes to Jail" contains all those elements, as well as a funny script and a cast of support that features several actors of beloved characters. <br /> <br /> And that's why I chose "Ernest Goes to Jail" as The King of all Ernesto's films. I do not agree with you if you have to do it, but deep down you know I'm right.
