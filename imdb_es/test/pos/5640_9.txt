This description of the desolate Japanese forces in the Philippines is a tour de force in the total lack of meaning of war. It is an effective representation of Japanese pacifist views after the Second World War. In the movie, the Japanese soldiers have been left to fend for themselves in the jungles of the Philippines. In the face of imminent hunger, they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose what little humanity they have left. To call depressing this movie would be an understatement. The viewer is left with a totally hopeless sense of the lost value of life in modern combat. The final scene is almost too nihilistic, but the film is a worthy statement of nothing. Highly recommended
