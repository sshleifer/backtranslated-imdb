"Duckman" is a great show. I saw it for the first time when I was 10 years old at the time and after school I ran home and turned on Comedy Central. I saw a caricature called "Duckman" and I LOVED IT !! It's such a fun and great show. It is created by Klasky-Csupo, who are great creators of cartoons. They encouraged some of my favorite shows, like "The Simpsons" and "Rugrats". <br /> <br /> I have seen many episodes of this program and I think they are all very funny and sweet. The voice actors also did a great job expressing the characters. <br /> <br /> I wish Comedy Central could recover this program, along with "The Critic" and "Dilbert". <br /> <br /> But this is a great Comedy Central show. Great job, Klasky-Csupo!
