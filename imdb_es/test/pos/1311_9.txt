I saw this originally on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic movie that left a great impression on me. However, I saw it recently on Irish television and there was an additional narration by Roy Scheider ("We're going to need a bigger boat!"). This ruined the movie for me. His monotonous monologue does not add anything to the movie, and if anything it takes the film off its shine. I wonder if the new version of DVD that Roy does not have (for legal reasons?) Would prevent people from buying it. Well, believe me, the movie is much better because of that! <br /> <br /> Regards <br /> <br /> Damian
