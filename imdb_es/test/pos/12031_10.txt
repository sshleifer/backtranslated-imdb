I was a schoolboy when I saw this movie for the first time. The next day I knew that all the students of our form saw it and everyone was fascinated by the movie like me. I think the same situation was in all forms of our school and throughout the Soviet Union. Later I saw him every time he showed up on TV and wanted to see more. I think the comparison with "Back to the Future" or other science fiction movies is not appropriate. "Gost'ya iz budushchego" is unique in many ways, once you've seen it, you never forget it. <br /> <br /> This film is full of beliefs in peaceful scientific achievements, in the beautiful future. of our world. It is not only the film, but also a forecast of many inventions and scientific achievements. The time shown in the film is the year 1984 (the year of its creation) and the year 2084 (where a student Kolya Gerasimov has traveled for some time and where his friend Alisa Seleznyova was from). The year is now 2005, many inventions and achievements planned in the film have not yet been made. As "Mielophone" (a device, which can read the thoughts of any animal and human), expeditions to Venus and Mars (as easy as going on a picnic over the weekend), create and launch satellites as a task for the students, Easy to drive flying machines (which completely replaced cars), biorobots, "historical identification" of any kind of material or creature made in a couple of minutes, and many others. Meanwhile, some of them became much more realistic than they seemed in 1984. Just wait until 2084 :-) <br /> <br /> The film also shows the typical Russian schoolchildren and schoolchildren (and it does natural form!). With his inventiveness, curiosity, humor, reverie. For example, in Fima Korolyov, you can find that character in almost every form of every school in the Soviet Union. A similar character was in my form too! Alisa Seleznyova ... Myself and many of my classmates fell in love with her at first sight! By the way, later, an actress who played Alisa became a scientist. I think the movie influenced her as much as the people who saw her on television. <br /> <br /> Beautiful idea, beautiful realization, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song "Prekrasnoye Daleko" ("The Wonderful Far-Away") ... Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ... <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is that the different remakes and "new" versions of the song of the film and even the film itself were made later and spread on television and on the Internet, they are not even comparable With the original, I should not even comment on them, my comment is only about the original, so request the original and enjoy it!
