I just got home from watching "Radio." I have not seen such an inspiring story in a long time. My children are 8 and 5 years old and I would like to take them so they can "feel" the message like I did. I should look for the best in people and love them for what they are, not judge them by their differences. . Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris deserve the Academy Awards for this film. I do not know why we can not have more movies like this, instead of the trash that is served in the cinemas on a daily basis.
