Okay, I do not think this is the typical love life of homosexuals, but since when are the romances straight in real life as on the screen? This movie is well balanced with comedy and drama and I enjoyed it myself. It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a gay sex-obsessed real estate salesman who uses his clients' homes for his encounters with Darren (Tom Hollander). And having seen him in Priscilla, the queen of the desert only the day before, he is probably one of the most certain actors in his masculinity. :) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male union scenes were hilarious. Thumbs up! 8/10
