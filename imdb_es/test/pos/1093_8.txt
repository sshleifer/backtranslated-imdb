It is, by far, the most definitive film about the police force I've seen. Although it is not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of a RGV movie. Direct dialogues, direct treatment of the subject, brilliant direction and excellent performances (even for those with little work to do in the film). The chemistry between Nana and the Don, even if they are professional rivals, is amazing. And so are the small events, like a connoisseur who does not give information to Imtiaz, even when he's being hit in the locker, but only to Nana when he's out. The change in working conditions with the change of the older person is treated wonderfully. The first half keeps him absolutely absorbed, moving like a documentary with Nana acting as a mentor to Jatin explaining the complexities and philosophy of the work. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the brightest films about cops in India. movie theater. It definitely can not be lost.
