As a movie, THE ITALIAN JOB is fine at best; good (not excellent) acting, <br /> <br /> nice visuals and rhythm, a mediocre plot, but nothing bad enough <br /> <br /> to leave. But as a car dealer for the new generation of MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers, this movie is spectacular! <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Ok, it's a typical hit the movie with a weird twist (the safe cracking underwater was nice, if not improbable), and the cast was quite solid <br /> <br /> (with the exception of a Wahlberg putrefy), but when everything came <br /> up here, the real "stars" of this image were the three MINI <br / > <br /> Coopers, in all its high flight, speed races, ramp jump, <br /> <br /> shooting of bullets, gold, bright and new glory. The audience I was actually sitting between "ooed" and "aahed" when Theron's little red number <br /> <br /> first appeared on the screen (oddly, she nor <br /> <br /> Wahlberg got the same reaction). <br /> <br /> The film starts being promising. Def Mos, Seth Green, Donald <br /> <br /> Sutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham start as an interesting and humorous band of characters, with the only true <br /> <Br /> uninspired performance is that of Mark usually good <br /> <br /> Wahlberg. Why he says that this is his best film that I can not imagine; his character <br /> <br /> is completely one-note, and he plays it so softly that it's as if Mr. Rogers came back from death and was living <br /> <br /> his body. Charlize is fine as Sutherland's daughter, though <br /> <br /> is not magic at all. The character of Seth Green is perfect and the Napster jokes (including a cameo by Napster founder, <br /> <br /> Shawn Fanning) are very funny; he and some of the first lines of Mos Def <br /> <br /> add some very necessary sparks of humor. Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland do not get close enough <br /> <br /> to the screen. <br /> <br /> You can see most of the plot coming from an A mile away, and the <br /> <br /> dialogue is full of bad phrases and gifts, but I doubt that the filmmakers < br /> <br /> were willing to reinvent the wheel here, so taken as a typical action / action of suspense / action, it goes well. It is worth seeing in <br /> <br /> cheap night that I would recommend. <br /> <br /> 7/10. It's not worth its weight in gold, but it makes for nice fillings.
