Fantastic, Chris Diamantopoulos has to be the best Robim Williams I've ever seen ... He does it perfectly, perfectly. This was like seeing Robim Williams as he really was and is ... He almost made me cry when he saw him. <br /> <br /> I had no idea that Robin was such an intimate friend of John Belushi as he was. The portrait of this relationship was very good and could almost be sustained on its own merits ... Very sad, what they both went through. <br /> <br /> I really felt for Val and Robin in their difficult moments. I'm glad you finished it on a high note! <br /> <br /> I hope Robin puts a $ 100 bill in this guy's hat! <br /> <br /> And it was great to be filmed in Vancouver!
