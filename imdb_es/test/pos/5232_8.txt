My rating of 8 in this film is relative to other feature films of the 1930s. By the standards of the films made a few years later, this movie could receive a score of only 6 or 7, mainly because the sound quality was so poor. Now it is possible that the movie sounded better and that Fox Movie Channel showed a degraded impression (it had many lines and scratches), but I guess the sound problem was always a problem. This is because the sound in the movies was still a novelty in 1930 and many of the images that spoke of Hollywood in 1930 sounded terrible, since the background characters often drowned the clues, the characters grouped to make sure that the microphones or the inconsistent quality caught them. like what was seen in THE BISHOP MURDER CASE, HELL'S ANGELS and other movies of the day). All this was made much worse in THE BIG TRAIL because most of the film was filmed abroad, something unheard of at that time. Quite an innovation, but also something that really stretched the talent of sound technicians! So, although the movie was very hard to hear, I realized that they had to start somewhere, so I can forgive this, especially because the outdoor scenes are awesome, an important innovation for the 1930s. <br /> < The plot is quite similar to CIMARRON, a western that came out the following year and won the Oscar for Best Picture. Unfortunately, CIMARRON is not such a good movie and I really like THE BIG TRAIL more because of the film's scope. While some resist the slow pace of THE BIG TRAIL, I saw it as a great history lesson about the difficulties that those who travel west in the wagons endure. In addition, everything seemed so beautiful, since the director Raoul Walsh had many problems filming in the place and THE BIG TRAIL looks like a film version of some prints of Ansel Adams. <br /> <br /> As for the acting, it was pretty good. This was an important break for the young John Wayne, since his previous screen appearances were, at best, minor and uncomplicated. Here, he was given the leadership and did an excellent job, although he was obviously young and a little less "John Wayne-ish" than in later films, since his character on the screen was not yet firmly established. Another interesting part was played by Tyrone Power II (the father of Tyrone Power). He looked nothing like his extremely handsome son and he looked and sounded almost exactly like Bluto from Popeye cartoons! He made very few sound films, dying only one year after making this movie, so it is a rare opportunity to see and hear this actor who was once famous. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is worth watching despite some sound problems and some too long scenes here and there. By 1930, it was a remarkable achievement, more than the much more famous and award-winning CIMARRON held the following year. Most of the reason why THE BIG TRAIL did not win an Oscar was probably because EVERYTHING QUIETO ON THE WESTERN FRONT came out the same year and is really one of the great movies.
