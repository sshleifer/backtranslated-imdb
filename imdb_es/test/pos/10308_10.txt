Regardless of the accuracy of the facts, Bandit Queen is a true story, it is true because the issues it deals with are as true today as they did in 1994. This film is violent, powerful and stimulating. The protagonist is a woman. of flesh and bone, whose adversity brought out the best (or the worst) of it. Keeping subjectivity aside, there is no doubt that Phoolan's character is of an 8-year-old girl, who is married by her father to pay off a debt (with a pun), with a gang leader who becomes in a leader of the lower caste. , has become a champion in its own right. His interpretation is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre. <br /> <br /> I can understand that if the Western audience is not able to appreciate this masterpiece, Bandit Queen needs to be "studied" in the Indian context, and not only stereotypes get rid of. He may not be able to sell it because of its universal appeal, but it is certainly a must for the Indian public, it is a pity that the film has had a delayed and openly censored release in India. <br /> <br /> Bandit Queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in India, being a woman and also a lower caste, her rebellious nature and her inability to surrender only caused her the most horrible experiences of life, which only strengthened her to become a self-proclaimed goddess. She responded to violence with violence and did not become the submissive woman that society wanted her to be. Call it divine justice or judicial decision, if it had killed only one person, it would have been hanged, it would have killed 24 people and it was venerated, respected and glorified. <br /> <br /> PS # Whoever found his character "psychotic", needs to be sodomized at 8, gangraped by 10 men at a time and paraded naked. Then they should be asked: How normal do they feel?
