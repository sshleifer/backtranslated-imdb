Although I'm not crazy about musicals, COVER GIRL is a delight for lovers of classic movies and especially for fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. The film can be dated according to today's standards and the story and the songs may not be anything special, but the musical numbers are superbly organized and there is an excellent cast to accompany the film. In addition, the film is a worthy introduction for Rita Hayworth fans ... she is simply stunning in glorious Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Despite Jerome Kern's collaboration with the film, his music here is not as special or memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936), however, the songs serve the film well. The dance is excellent, especially for Gene Kelly's solo number and my favorite musical number, "Alter-Ego Dance". Funny Phil Silvers almost steals the movie as Kelly's partner. Otto Kruger, Eve Arden and Edward Brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles. And Rita plays a sweet and lovely girl here; a role that is far from his femme fatale babes in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941). <br /> <br /> In short, this is a lovely movie that is worth seeing, even if you do not like musicals very much. . However, the music of the film could have been more memorable if only my favorite composers of the time, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter, wrote the songs for this film. However, it is the glorious cinematography of Technicolor and the imaginative dance that is really dealt with in the production of the film. <br /> <br /> While I was watching Rita Hayworth doing her things, I think I've never seen a more beautiful or elegant redhead dance on the screen since I saw Moira Shearer in Michael Powell's masterpiece, THE RED SHOES (1948). Just look at Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her.
