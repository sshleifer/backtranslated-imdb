A band of bandits led by the astute, robust and ruthless Monetero (a perfectly imposing performance by Gilbert Roland) steals gold coins worth $ 300,000 during a daring train robbery. But the unreliable member Bahunda (a funny turn of Jos√© Torres) takes the coins and hides them. Unfortunately, Bahunda is murdered before he can tell Monetero where he hid the loot. So Monetero has to join forces with the cunning, arrogant and enigmatic bounty hunter The Stranger (played softly by the handsome George Hilton) and the cautious banker Clayton (a charming portrait of young idol Eddie "Kookie" Burns) to find the coins. . Directed skilfully by Enzo G. Castellari, with a clever, complex and torsion-laden script by Castellari, Tito Carpi and Giovanni Simonelli, a playfully amoral and nihilistic tone (all continue to cross double and triple with a happily miserly abandonment), a Alessandro Alessandroni and Francesco De Masi, intertwined, tasty and energetic supporters, a lot of poignant shootings and incomprehensible punches, a wickedly malicious sense of mocking humor, a constant rhythm and a real surprise. In the end, this dizzying and often hilarious feature makes it an inspired delivery of "The good, the bad and the ugly" by Sergio Leone. Appearing in clever secondary parts are the delightful Stefanie Careddu as Monetero's ardent friend, Marisol, Ivano Staccioli as a tough army captain, and Gerard Herter as legislator Lawrence Blackman. An immensely fun and enjoyable romp.
