Do not miss the good old days when Disney really made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself captivated by the characters. Each and every one seemed truly talented and knew how to act throughout a film. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the television just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my favorites of all time. I never forgot this movie. Even to this day, when the song "Susie Q" is mentioned, I always remember the movie. If someone is thinking about watching this movie, I promise, you will fall in love with it. I do not think I can ever forget it. You will not regret having seen it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's sad to see Disney movies like "The Hannah Montana Movie". What happened to Disney?
