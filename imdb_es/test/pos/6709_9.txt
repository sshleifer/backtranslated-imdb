Many people say that the end did not make sense, but it did. With the vampire dead, the link with the earth broke and the ship took off, having collected a lot of Life Force from hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough to revitalize those hexagonal cells and create new bat creatures. It seems they do not have sex, like vampires of legend. <br /> <br /> vampire bats from outer space can be absurd, but killing them with a shot to put the center of force under the heart is consistent. All you can ask for is consistency. The spectator has to suspend disbelief, even to scifi. <br /> <br /> The only problem is having to be a sword or a stake, not bullets. That puts in a supernatural turn that does not fit with science fiction. So that is a problem. <br /> <br /> The only major inconsistency I found is killing the male vampires with the sword, but the soul of the girl and Carlsen climb the ship. I suppose the male souls also got on the ship, but they do not show up. <br /> <br /> What about all the murdered humans? His forces qui ("souls") go up to the ship as discrete entities, all the forces of life are united in one, to use as a ship it seems convenient? In other words, all the human souls that went to the ship could reincarnate as bat creatures. <br /> <br /> The basic concept is no more ridiculous than the "Force" of Star Wars or even reincarnation. <br /> <br /> This movie was about the kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien and Dracula), but in many ways it is profound. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and the end were ethereal. It started ("what's happening to me") and ended as a love story. <br /> <br /> Most criticisms of the film refer to it being strange. And that? Bizarro is an art form. As for being ridiculous, everything fits. The concept of plague is much more interesting and subtle than the aliens that kill people. Maybe they did not need Patrick Steward's blood to make an image of the girl, but it was a very distant, surreal scene. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the film is hated is in the end. But the ending fits perfectly with the principle. People are so wrapped up in the naked girl that they miss the core of the movie. It is a lover's story, from beginning to end. Start with Carlsen and the girl in the alien spaceship and it ends the same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are obsessed with the hero who kills the monster, and this movie did not end that way, which is precisely why I love it. <br /> <br /> Instead, it has a happy ending, with the 2 of them returning to the ship, to be reborn. Much colder than the hero kills at the end of the monsters, but that is the reason why he bombed. It was not a direct horror, not even a scifi / horror, but a love story, with a beautiful beginning and an end. All those souls shining in the ship. And the crystal room throbs with new life. <br /> <br /> Most people can not deal with a love story that is also Alien meets Dawn of the Dead and Dracula.
