I came across this movie while navigating a channel one day; And I decided to give it a try. To my surprise I enjoyed this darkhorse movie. I felt some genuine chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. It was such a happy and warm film that when it was over, I felt optimistic. Sure, this movie was predictable from the start, but I give it high marks for the way it made me feel when it was over. I must admit that I have never seen Challen Cates, but I feel that she can definitely act. When you combine his good performance with his pretty face and his attractive figure. She has the ability to at least become a known star.
