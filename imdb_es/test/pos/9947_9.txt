Okay, I admit, I'm 40 years old and I still shed a tear every time I see Johnny call the Robot at the end. <br /> <br /> "Robot, now stop! Do not do that, for the attack ... Robot, what are you doing, Robot ... Robot, where are you going? Robot, come back! Robot .. Robot, please, do not do it, you'll die ... Robot, Robot, please, come back, I need you here, giant robot, Robot, giant robot, Johnny the Sokko, the last of the guillotine emperor <br /> <br /> Of all the Tokusatsu there is, the giant robot has a special place in my heart and will always be there, I credit him for getting into everything in science fiction and anime when he was a child. <br /> <br /> LIVE IN GR!
