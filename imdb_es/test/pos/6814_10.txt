I came across this movie while I was navigating the channel, and I was impressed. It was being aired on a lesser-known short film program here in Australia. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I was so impressed with a movie, especially one so short. <br /> <br /> The power of history, the quality of acting and the impressive cinematography ... wow. If it were available, it would be a very good addition to my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> I am certainly impressed, and I look forward to the next film by Joshua Leonards. <br /> <br /> An exceptional experience 10/10
