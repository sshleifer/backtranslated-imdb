On more than one level, I can relate to what happens in this film in a very personal way. And all I can say about it is that, at the end of the story, what Dexter's mother tells Eric is that she really "cured" her son by taking away his sad feelings and loneliness. <br /> <br /> This film emphasizes a philosophy with which I strongly agree. We are all going to die one day, sooner or later. In the end, it is not the amount of time we live, but the fun / good times / happiness we have during that time. It is not quantity, but quality that counts. <br /> <br /> I suppose all the other words used here will only prevent you from seeing this movie, if you have not already done so. I would really like to see it released on DVD. It would definitely add to my "classics of all times" right away!
