This movie is where the Batman franchise should have stopped. Although I will admit that the ideas behind "Batman Forever" were excellent and that a competent director could have done them easily, it turned out that it was not so. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman movie by Tim Burton turned out to be. Aside from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton and the conservative cowardice of his subsequent decision to turn the franchise into a tribute to the 1960s television series, I do not understand how "Batman Returns" can be considered disappointing. /> <br /> True, it is not exactly the same as the first movie, although it repairs all the minor style deficiencies found in "Batman", a weaker script that divides the antagonism between not only two but three characters. Be unfavorable comparisons with the masterful couple of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. However, for all this it remains a superbly dark film, true to the way it was supposed to be Batman, and highly satisfying. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton returns as Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, entangled with him. the new rich tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honor of the German silent actor of the 1920s), his partner in crime Oswald Cobblepot, the penguin (Danny DeVito with bright makeup reminiscent of "Richard III" by Laurence Olivier ), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances as both himself and the Batman. The four directors present excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting concepts in this movie. On the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limp in the script in some places, which I think is mainly due to the way this movie is a four-pronged fight. There simply is not enough time to adequately explore what is happening. <br /> <br /> However, this is a very good movie. I recommend seeing this in conjunction with the first, and then mourn how good the series could have been if it had continued under Burton and Keaton.
