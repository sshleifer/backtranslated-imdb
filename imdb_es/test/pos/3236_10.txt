VHS: I've seen it again and again and I LOVE it every minute, so now I've ordered the DVD. I just wished the movie had lasted longer. I never worry about what other people think I prefer to do my own opinion and totally disagree with the negative comments and I will not allow others to spoil my enjoyment of the movie at all. Make up your mind and do not let others discourage you! I have all the BBA series of Jane Austen, but this is my FAVORITE. I see that there will be a NEW Northanger Abbey launched in 2007 that I will buy when I leave, but it will not stop me from seeing the Northanger Abbey that was launched in the 80's.
