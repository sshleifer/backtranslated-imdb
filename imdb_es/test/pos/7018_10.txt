I have already seen this movie about 50 times and it seems that I will never get bored. I always see him with my best friend and now it's a kind of tradition for us to see him almost every month. Every time we watch this movie, we both get very excited, we laugh and cry in front of the television, we sing all the songs out loud and in the end we always dance. Now we practically know even all the dialogue. The heart and watching the movie is like watching our old friends on television. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect! Although I have to admit that the story itself is a little cheesy, but the characters, the dance, the music and even the place where it takes place make you forget everything and begin to believe that things like that really happen. that the song "all you need is love" actually has some kind of meaning. <br /> <br /> I am really a normal person and I do not take this comment of mine too seriously, but I can not wait until the next time. We can see Dirty Dancing.
