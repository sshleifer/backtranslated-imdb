I am new to the games, but I would have started MUCH earlier if this movie had existed! I caught him in Gen last year (a trip made only as a favor to my husband) and I LOVED! Even for a non-player as it was at that moment, it's fun and accessible, so much so that I finally regretted it and started sitting in my husband's playgroup. <br /> <br /> I do not want to do it. Give away any detail of the plot, but if you are a player, you NEED to watch this movie, and if you are not, you will have a great time in spite of yourself. There are certainly "in" jokes, but the vast majority of the film is accessible to anyone. <br /> <br /> My only complaints: I wish it would be longer and available on DVD. Soon, maybe? ...
