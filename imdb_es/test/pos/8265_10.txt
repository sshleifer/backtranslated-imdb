I am lucky to have a good quality copy of my VHS on DVD, so now I can see this again and again. The characters are so well interpreted that I can not find fault with any aspect of the casting. Okay, there are some differences with the book, but the old clich√© of love that conquers everything is portrayed so strongly that it makes no difference. The reality of living in rural countryside in the early nineteenth century in England is beautifully contrasted by the changing seasons, from winter to the glorious summer days and this is reflected in the different characters, from the harassing father of Prue to love which covers everything of Kester. A story that changed my life.
