This is undoubtedly one of the funniest and most entertaining movies I've ever seen. I really enjoyed the characters in the movie. All of them are wonderful strangers in themselves. It's something I've never seen in any movie before. <br /> <br /> The story almost does not stop from the beginning to the end. There are no boring moments. I was totally captured by the movie. And I thought that the performance was excellent. <br /> <br /> So if you want to watch a funny movie. You must look for the green butchers. A great movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10
