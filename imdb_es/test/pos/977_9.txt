I just had to add my comment to increase the average in this case. Paul Giamatti lets everything go well in this and it's a hoot. I would probably say it was easy, but it really does a great job and I should have earned something for it. We have had the DVD for several years and my children (now 4 1/2 child and 9 child) will see it again and again, and the humor is adult enough so that I do not mind having to listen to it in the background (and I run to the TV for the really fun parts). A simple moral message, a lot of decent action and slaps, "bad" adults acting foolishly to satiate the limit, bad language and minimal jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard.
