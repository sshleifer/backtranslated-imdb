From the beginning of "The Edge Of Love", the viewer is transported to the world of WW2 London. We follow the lives of four people who could have been created just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the tensions caused by marriage and infidelity. Except that one of the characters is called Dylan Thomas, perhaps the best English poet of the twentieth century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but sometimes really despicable. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on Thomas's writings on love and romance. These were adapted with a sharpened script by Sharman MacDonald (the mother of Keira Knightley). The director, John Maybury, states that the other three main characters were real people. <br /> <br /> The four are performed very strongly. Sienna Miller is Dylan's wife, Keira Knightley is the cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas, and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first section of the film takes place in London during the Nazi air raids, and Vera is pursued by Willaim, a soldier awaiting deployment. By a chance meeting, Dylan meets his first love, Vera. From there Vera meets up with Caitlin, Dylan's wife. While the three of them drink, William successfully breaks Vera's guard. <br /> <br /> The movie follows their lives as Vera and William are married and he is sent to war. Vera has become pregnant and returns to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There they face a harsh existence, with Vera supporting Dylan and Caitlin with their husband's war pay. Through these times, the friendship of Vera and Caitlin grows. The same goes for Dylan's infatuation with Vera. She gives up. This creates the first test for the two women. <br /> <br /> When William returns from the war, he hardly recognizes his wife and has no bond with his young son. Things get worse, while Dylan idly watches his friend struggle with battlefield fatigue (post-traumatic stress disorder). William realizes that something happened between Dylan and Vera, and in a drunken attack shoots at Dylan's house. <br /> <br /> "Edge Of Love" begins as an elegant romance in the war torn in London and ends in hard and hard life. of maternity, infidelity and attempted murder in Wales. The treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder is well done and should talk to a US audience. Someday (see end). <br /> <br /> Each star has a great moment. Miller when she is pulling stitches on her head in response to her abortion from another man's son. Knightley and Murpy when he finally joins with his son. Oh hell, almost all your scenes are awesome. And Rhys, when he purged himself on the stand to send Vera's husband to jail. <br /> <br /> However, the real star of the film is the cinematography of Jonathan Freeman and the direction of John Maybury. They seem to understand that no matter how good Thomas' story or story is, this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time. And they appreciate their scenes with impressive shots. While this is not the best photographic material, it is a very good movie (much more attractive than "The Dutchess"). It has a visual lyricism that emphasizes the use of Thomas' poetry. In addition, this is clearly the second best performance of Knightley in his career, and perhaps the best of Miller. <br /> <br /> I've always had a weakness for the Artist in the fight, whether it's the Hulce Mozart or the Hoffman Capote. But I was surprised at how little sympathy I felt for Dylan Thomas. Their struggles with alcohol are well known. But his antagonism of William and Caitlin for obtaining the possession of his first love, Vera, makes him a bad man ... <br /> <br /> So, does he deserve this Academy Award? Clearly not At least not this year. It will be released on the state side in March 2009, so it will not be eligible for the Academies. This is 9 months after its launch in Great Britain. Between Atonement, Miss Pettigrew and Brideshead Revisited, EE. UU He has had his fill of pieces from the British WW2 period. Too. This movie is better than the others, except Atonement. But in this case, Knightley's soldier returns, but like a shell of the man who left her.
