This movie is not a comedy, it is an exhibition. I've always hated dog shows, considering the ridiculous disguises that people put on their dogs and the idiotic names they give them. Therefore, the reason for my uncontrolled laughter while watching this movie. I like that something is taken so seriously, although the profits are small and insignificant. It's like miniature golf, the rope jumping championship or the need to set a dark world record. The performance was much more refined in this film than Waiting for Guffman, and is mainly due to the greater fluidity of the characters, who seem more comfortable with their specific performance partners in this film than the previous one. Eugene Levy was great, like Michael McKean and Fred Willard. However, it was the dogs that finally stole the show. But, again, who wants to see a group of humans in a movie about dogs anyway?
