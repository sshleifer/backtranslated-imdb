If you have ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know that they are longer than most movies because of the multiple routines of songs and dances (each lasts more than five minutes). Fortunately, it has fewer song and dance routines and conforms to the "standard" length of the movie. Do not get me wrong, I like Bollywood movies, but I tend to move quickly through the parts of song and dance. I bought this DVD because I'm a fan of Ian Bohen. Although his role was not as big as he expected, he still had a good amount of screen time. And his character was very different from his other roles. <br /> <br /> In general, this was a good movie. Like most Bollywood films, there is at least one element of controversy / conflict in traditional Indian culture. But true love triumphs over adversity and everyone has a happy ending.
