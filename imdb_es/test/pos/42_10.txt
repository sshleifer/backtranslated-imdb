This is one of those movies that you do not want to end. The characters are rich as a well-woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters attract him and tell a story of people who lived in a boardinghouse for decades during the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A dynamic, big-hearted woman who runs the house welcomes a young man and these are stories based on his experiences. <br /> <br /> I could not believe it was a movie for television. It was so well executed. S. Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as Nanny and gives a lot of life to this role. You want to be there among your guests. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie so much that I bought the DVD.
