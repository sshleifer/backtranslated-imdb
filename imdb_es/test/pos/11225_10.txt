It is a rare and fine spectacle, an allegory of death and transfiguration that is neither predicative nor mawkish. A work of mature and courageous insight, Northfork avoids the distinction between asylums and refuses to belong to a type. Unlike the most memorable and successful film to impose an obvious comparison, Wim Wenders of 1987 Wings of Desire (Der Himmel Ã¼ber Berlin), maintains an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum that ranges from the mundane to the supernatural. This history of eminent earthly and celestial domains in the American West retains the fairytale literalism that marked its German predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels stripping their wings with obsequious sentimentality. His celestial transcendence, whether inspired by a sad faith or driven by a feverish dream, is never divided into harshness and decay. This firm foundation is a great credit for the writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish.
