This film is definitely the best film of Fonda. The plot is incredible, the performance is incredible and the direction is incredible. An all-time classic, this should have won the best image, not Kramer vs. Kramer. Although I was not even nominated. Jack Lemmon and Micheal Douglas are also at their best. One of the best finals of all time. If you have not seen this movie run, do not rent it. I should have been in the top 100 of Afi. See it not only for Fonda, but for everything. <br /> <br /> **** of **** 4 of 4
