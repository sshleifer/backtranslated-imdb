Each story has a lesson for young and old. But what I have to say the most can ruin a future story. But, I think what I have to say is for everyone; only for one episode in particular: The Soldier and Death. <br /> <br /> Well ... of all the stories, the one that stands out the most is "The Soldier and Death" because that was the point of my life. He realized that life was terminal. I'm not kidding. The transmission was on my 8 1/2 birthday ... and I will always remember it. I did not remember his title until tonight, but I made a new synopsis. (May 15, 1988) <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part of life. It is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. I am living proof (currently 28 years old) that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind adults ... <br /> <br /> I write this with tears in my eyes. Heath Ledger, a wonderful actor of my age, died today. It reminded me a little of the many lessons I have learned in my life. So I write this as a reminder for Young and Elderly ... no one is immune to what awaits us. <br /> <br /> I hate to say that Death is going to happen, but this Story was the first time I saw Death as something not bad; But a part of life, was quite literally in this story. I can not help it It was a moment that changed my life and always will be. <br /> <br /> And that's why ... <br /> <br /> I love you Jim Henson (and I still remember a lot of your work in life until the day you died, and your memorial Muppet Show) and thanks to Brian Henson for keeping the workshop alive. Honestly, I thank all of your co-workers, editors and interns. <br /> <br /> The stage is just a stage / And a show is just a show / But the imagination will create Magic / That Forever The world will know. <br /> <br /> Thanks !!! <br /> <br /> (And for all those who doubt me ... Dance, Magic Dance)
