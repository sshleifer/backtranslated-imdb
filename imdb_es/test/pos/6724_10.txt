I saw the Korean version of Daisy first. It appeared as a simple love story that flowed very well from beginning to end. I saw it 3 times while I waited for my copy of the director's cut to arrive. <br /> <br /> Then I took the DC and saw it. Woohoo! I think this is the first REAL director cut I've seen. Incredible how detailed is the edition in both versions! The DC is presented as a hardcore thriller, with the love story in the background. It moves at a slower pace than the Korean version. The variations between both versions are so drastic that they seem like two totally different movies. I thought I would be exhausted watching the movie again, resisting only to look for the added scenes. That was not the case. I really felt that I was watching a completely new movie. <br /> <br /> While the DC is 20 minutes longer than the Korean version, it will be difficult to find where or what has been changed. 2 seconds cut here. A second added there. A complete scene added here. Another erased there. In both versions, the scenes have been added, omitted or cut and reordered. In some scenes, whole lines of dialogue were replaced or reordered, while the scene itself was intact. Even simple sound effects were added / omitted in each version, which had a great impact on the mood of the film and, sometimes, even changed the outcome of a scene. What appears as a tender moment in the Korean version is sad and somber in DC. The completions of both versions leave room for interpretation. As far as I can tell, both versions end with a very different LOT, and were thought that way. <br /> <br /> I guess most people will acquire the part of the director of the movie, and you will find it pretty pretty. Decent, but a bit long and boring. If that is the case, look for the Korean version. Same movie, but different feeling. I think there is a deluxe version of 3 DVD that contains both cuts of the movie, I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> The versions complement each other so well that, as a couple, I will see Daisy more often than I do. Any of my other favorite Korean movies Alone, I would say that the Korean version is a nice love story that I would see from time to time. The director's cut, I'll see it maybe once or twice, and never again, since I find the rhythm boring. But they just go so well together! For what I consider the best experience, I would say that first see the Korean version. Then, see the director's cut to help fill in the gaps in the story that interested him. <br /> <br /> The edition is the true star of the film.
