This little movie is reminiscent of many other movies, but manages to maintain its own style and mood. "Troll" and "Do not be afraid of the dark" come to mind. The suspense builders were good, and they only crossed the line from G to PG. I especially liked the non-clich√© elections with the parents; in other films, I could predict the dialogue literally, but the writing in this movie made better selections. If you want a movie that is not disgusting but gives you chills, this is an excellent option.
