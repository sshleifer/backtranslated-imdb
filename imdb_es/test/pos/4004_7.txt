First of all, when I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not a real movie. I mean, I would choose a good Deniro movie or play a video game any day. But, friend, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, okay? The adaptation to the videogame of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name. The strange thing is that this was released three years after the film was released. Whether that is due to a time of slow development or simply laziness, nobody knows. At least, I do not. <br /> <br /> The game allows the player to play as the four main characters of the movie: Jen, Shu Lien, Li-Mu-Bi and Dark Cloud (Whose story is a secret bonus that is unlocked for the game by separate.) These four characters have fighting styles based on how they fought in the movie. However, the real attraction is the evasion movements that allow each character to avoid the blows of an enemy attack in the most impossible and challenging ways of gravity that were first shown in the film. <br /> <br /> The story is obviously based on the story told in the movie. The story of the game is told using CG movies and it is spoken in a Mandarin subtitled language (A small detail, considering that I prefer the foreign language track of the film to the folded one). The story continues to expand what might have happened to the other characters during the film and even (not surprisingly, since almost all the adaptations of video game films have done this) alters what officially happened in the movie so that the game have more action I never thought that Jade Fox would go so far as to go and get hired thugs. <br /> <br /> The real advantage of the story is the ability to decide how the game ends. What would happen if Jen had all the ingredients to cure Li-Mu-Bi in her power? What if Jen had not recovered her comb? What if Li-Mu-Bi had not regained green fate for the second time? Your actions will decide the outcome of these scenarios and the fate of the characters in this game. This is truly the best feature of the game. <br /> <br /> However, despite all its strengths, it also presents some flaws. Enemies often tend to become a nuisance after a while and the angle of the camera tends to be fixed in the most useless places. Not even the special features (which are unlocked after winning the game) are good enough to forgive the difficulties that are imposed on the player. <br /> <br /> If you loved the movie, you can enjoy the game. However, this game is the only way you can immerse yourself in a playable version of such a beautiful and amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, you could have chosen a Deniro movie instead. .
