At first I saw it several years ago when I was sitting on the couch and I got stuck watching it on HBO. With the remote control out of my reach, I decided to go with him and was waiting for a miserable movie that I had been avoiding for a year. So it started and I was not very optimistic about it, but after about ten minutes I found myself laughing. Quite the opposite as expected. The comedy was intelligent, the acting was quite good, the cast worked very well together and the story (although a bit clumsy and false) was quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> Three convicted brothers manage to escape their sentence and will finally go in search of their fortune. The film is set in the 1930s. Along the way, they encounter a series of fun and interesting characters. Everyone has a different story or achievement for which they fight. Actually most of the movie may seem random. Some may say that it was useless and boring, but if you look for the intelligent comedy (and sometimes stupid) that is integrated into the film, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I liked it. the performances given by George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. They all did very well in their roles, and they worked very well together. But to finish this, "Oh Brother, where are you?" It's a smart, fun and movie adventure that would not let happen.
