<br /> <br /> When I heard this for the first time in 1997, having a coffee with my friends, I decided to check it out. The only problem was that it was on a small screen in one of my local theaters. <br /> <br /> That did not stop you from enjoying watching a simply great movie, with a first class cast in Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland, and Ben Kingsley. The whole movie, it kept me glued to my seat. <br /> <br /> I just did not find any flaws in this great movie, I give my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers. I am very proud to have this in my collection. <br /> <br /> 10/10 (I do not give it lightly).
