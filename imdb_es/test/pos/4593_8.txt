First, let me say that although I generally appreciate the work of Mike Judge, in my response to Office Space, King of the Hill, and Beavis and Butthead I have simply been lukewarm. I generally prefer the smarter comedy, and that's where the irony lies with Idiocracy. <br /> <br /> In a future world in which the personification of the views of Beavis and Butthead, the most basic instincts and intellectual capacities are the framework of chaos, disorderly, semi-Mad Max semi- Blade Runner Society, where the fantasy of each trailer-trash becomes reality, a man with average intelligence is threatening and accused of talking gay, and the mentality of the mafia takes over. And this world is also incredibly fun. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is obvious that the executives of Carl's Jr., Starbucks, Costco and Fuddruckers will be horrified by the twisted values ​​given their products in the year 2505. <br /> <br /> There were some opportunities Lost with the movie, and the relationship between time travelers, the other of which is a woman of average intelligence who is worried about the retribution of her boyfriend (pimp), could have been stronger; The chemistry is there. And there do not seem to be too many women in the future. <br /> <br /> I left with a smile on my face, but the experience is a little better than the memories. So, it's my kind of popcorn movie, and it will be fun to watch it again on video. Recommended! For your information, stay through the credits for an extra scene.
