This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the movie seem partially realistic. I used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue. This movie was like a Cinderella movie, but a little different. A father of 12 princesses gets very sick. His cousin poisons him and he wants the throne. The girls find a secret magic land thanks to the stories of their dead mother. It is up to them to save their father and society. With the help of his handsome prince. It was a fun movie and my friend and I had fun watching it. We enjoyed it very much and we also enjoyed the Indian talking parrot. The music was very beautiful and made the movie even better. He had a great classical orchestra. The voices were great and the characters adorably sweet and cute. I liked it, so enjoying the movie is great for the family. With everything I would see again.
