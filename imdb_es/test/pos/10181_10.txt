While all the "Superman" cartoons of Fleischer / Famous Studios are excellent, "Billion Dollar Limited", the third in the series, is probably the best of all in terms of overall animation, plot and rhythm. Why he was not even nominated for an Oscar as Best animated short film for 1942 (Incredibly, only the first was) in unexplainable. <br /> <br /> Here, Lois Lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the American mint. Masked gangsters in their super motor (for 1942) take off after the train, determined to obtain that gold. Without revealing too much, what follows is an exciting journey for both the characters and the public, with truth, justice and Superman triumphant at the end. <br /> <br /> As they did throughout the Fleischer / Famous Superman the cartoons, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who played Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane on the radio, have the voice of honors of work here, and Fleischer, the perennial Jack Mercer, also has something to do with one of the bad guys.
