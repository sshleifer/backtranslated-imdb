The legendary hammy and arrogant horror film star Conrad Radzoff (splendidly played with a sardonic poise Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack. A group of students from the theater school steal Radzoff's body from his vault and take him to a dilapidated mansion so they can celebrate with her. Radzoff comes back to life and removes the rude youths for desecrating his grave. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane makes a fresh, original and even elegant twist on the usual premise of body counting, offers a clear evocation of Hollywood's dazzling setting and does sturdy work to maintain a pleasantly misty ooga-booga atmosphere and spooky The killing pieces deliver the spooky items, with a girl on fire, a juicy beheading (the severed head rolls down the stairs to the lawn so a raven can sting it!), And another poor crushed girl with a levitating casket rating as the highlights defined scares. There are also congratulations for the star cast of familiar faces from film B: Mayne has a delightful ball that rolls his eyes with his eye-catching role, Leon Askin contributes with an entertaining cameo as director bitter and washed Wolfgang, Nita Talbot adds such a class scaly psychic medium, Mrs. Rohmer, in addition, there are good turns of Luca Bercovici as a theater student, Jennifer leader, Starrett as the sweet Meg, Jeffrey Combs as the geeky Stu and Scott Thomson as the nerd Bobo. Chuck "Porky" Mitchell as a detective, Patrick Wright in one of his usual police departments, and Tallie Cochrane as a corpse. The polished cinematography of Joel King gives the film an attractive bright appearance. Jerry Mosely's bad-tempered score also hits the shuddering spot. A funny little horror movie.
