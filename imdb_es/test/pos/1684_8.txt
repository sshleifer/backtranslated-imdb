Over the years, there are some movies that simply go unnoticed and almost nobody sees them. <br /> <br /> Choosing Conner is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> This little gem was played at some festivals and a short 2-week run was made at a small theater in West Hollywood making almost $ 5500. <br /> <br /> It's now on DVD. I hope many more will see it now. <br /> <br /> It is a strange drama of a shrewd and young politician, who influences a very bright character. Boy of 15 years. This politician also has a handsome nephew (about 17 years old) who befriends the 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The previous paragraph is slightly vague as to what happens, THIS is the movie, and that's what I appreciate, we do NOT get all the data, there is much left for our own thinking. You will hear a dialogue that makes it logical ... <br /> <br /> Steven Weber (Wings) is our politician, his role is slightly vague, this is another point for the audience to reflect <br /> <br /> Alex D.Linz is our 15 year old son. He was about 17 years old when they made this movie, but he can easily pass for younger. He has worked in film and television since he was a child. He is a very good actor and he is quite convincing. <br /> <br /> Escher Holloway is the oldest teenager, this role is his first important part and he is also excellent. <br /> <br /> Now I am saving the best for the end, the writer / director, <br /> <br /> Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. For a first effort a big thumbs up. I hope that he and our two boys have a long career. <br /> <br /> Qualifications: *** (of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
