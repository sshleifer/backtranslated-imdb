The complete film, an ingenious adaptation of one of Joyce's "Dubliners" stories, takes place on the night of January 6 (Epiphany), 1906. Most of the film is made at an annual party organized by three people (two sisters and their niece). ), where a group of upper class Dubliners gather for a night of music, recitations and dinners. While there is very little plot per se, the interaction and conversation between the group reveals a lot about Dublin at the beginning of the 20th century, when the efforts for independence were just beginning. The cast, all talented actors of Irish theater with the exception of Anjelica Huston, are universally wonderful, and one really feels that he is a guest at the meeting. The touching final scene, between Ms. Huston and the amazing Donal McCann, reveals a lot about the marriage of the characters. There is a mixture of humor and insight, and for those who like quiet and reflective films, "The Dead" is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we do a ritual to see this wonderful movie every 6th of January. After many visits it never ceases to move me, and every time I pick up something that I have lost before.
