Dashing Errol Flynn brings his usual talent for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining movie from the life of George Armstrong Custer. The handsome and jovial Flynn rehearses Custer, from his days at West Point as a reckless and reckless cadet, through the Civil War years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history, and finally as the unparalleled Indian wrestler whose error in Little Big Horn is excused as a sacrifice by Custer from his command as a way to expose the corruption of government officials and post merchants, as well as a protest at the unfair treatment of the Indians of the plains. Olivia de Havilland, Flynn's co-star in several other films, counts as the devoted and adoring Libby Bacon, and Anthony Quinn looks like the fierce chief of the Sioux Crazy Horse. The battle scenes of the film are excellent. The battles of the Civil War are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which Custer, apparently supported by only a handful of soldiers, strikes the Confederate army to subdue him. The last fight of Custer against the Indians is a great spectacle, a wild clash between red and white men, without quarter in a savage mixture of military power between determined fighting men. The great direction, cinematography, casting and wonderful music of Max Steiner make this film a Hollywood classic.
