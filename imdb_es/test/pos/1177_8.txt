Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, both sadly missed, proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their job of bringing fun moments to the screen. This movie is just another example of this. <br /> <br /> This time they play with two brothers-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board. <br /> <br /> Of course, your boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named Gil Godwin who simply enjoys harassing these guys. It's funny how Lemmon gives a quick dance lesson to Matthau and how the latter dances an unbridled rumba with the owner of the ship, Rue McLanahan. So little to do, but its parts require that. Matthau falls in love with Dyan Cannon, on board with his fellow gold bulldozer mother, the usual scandalous Elaine Stritch. Unknown to them, Matthau does not have money either. The widower Lemmon falls in love with Gloria De Haven, looking more beautiful than ever. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as a tribute to his illustrious careers.
