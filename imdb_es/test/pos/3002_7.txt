The medical team of Marido and wife Carole and Niles Nelson are progressing moderately well in their careers, but Niles has a gambling problem. His luck changes when (unknowingly) saves the life of a mob gangster Joe Gurney and gets a great bonus from the leader of the gang. Loving his change of fortune (and his sleek new apartment), Niles continues to receive benefits for repairing other injured members of the gang. Unfortunately, his shady dealings are revealed in a police raid, which also overshadows his wife's career. <br /> <br /> At this point, the plan is focused, as Carole Nelson has to rescue her career sooner. his license is suspended. This implies taking the gang to justice more or less without help. <br /> <br /> This is not a hard-edged gangster image, but a plot that could have been comfortable in a program like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There is some tension, but the mood is kept light by Bogart's ironic performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the "Napoleon of crime." Your other gang members also function more like fools than thugs. And there is a quick dialogue between Bogart and Francis, especially when she is treating her wounds in her hiding place. Of course, as in all gangster films, there is a great end to the shooting, but with a touch of humor. This is a good short film that shows Bogart in his rise to stardom.
