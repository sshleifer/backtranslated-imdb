I had the privilege of seeing Mar Adentro last Friday, and I am still surprised by its beauty, the powerful work of each actor and actress and the incredible ability of Amenabar to tell the story of Ramón Sampedro, who was very well known in Spain for asking for legal euthanasia, lost the court case and, finally, died in front of a camera drinking a glass of poison, freezing all our hearts with his determination not to continue living forever immobilized due to an accident. <br /> <br /> Before watching the film, I was already hypnotized by the strong symbology in its title, which I would translate as "Into the Sea" and not as some suggest "Out to be", and which is taken from A original poem written by the man who deals with this story. Then I saw the movie. Oh my friends This is a cinema with a capital C. The narrative flows to take you to the heart of each character: Sampedro, reincarnated in a Bardem that you forgot from the beginning, is in the center like a man full of sense of humor and full. of hope, and his hope is to die, because for him, the life he is living is not worth living. The rest of the characters except one dance around him and respect his decision because they see him as an independent human being (forgetting that he depends on others for everything), although they love him so much. And that's what the movie is about: love. You can feel it, you can breathe it in the skin of each character. You witness the growth of feeling within the three women who know him in the film: Gené, the member of the association who defends his right to die with dignity, his friend, his story in the film is the hope for us, the lucky you can live a normal life in this world; Rosa, the woman who meets a good man in the middle of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used her and despised her; Julia, the woman who shares a tragic destiny with Ramón, and in the end acts in a way that we can only understand. <br /> <br /> However, before meeting these women, Ramón knew what love was like, because you can not know him. without loving him, and his selfless family loves him deeply: four unique characters in their humility and courage, each with their own thoughts about their decision, each thought respectable in their own way, because the terrible thing about this story is that nobody is the fault of what happened. That, unfortunately, life is sometimes that terrible. From this family quartet I especially liked the work of Mabel Rivera as Ramon's sister-in-law, Manuela: an excellent performance. <br /> <br /> I would like to draw attention to three episodes that are for me the best highlights I have seen. In a long time, and if you have not seen the movie, do not read this, pass this paragraph and reread the next one that begins with "Mar adentro", let the film show you its secrets. The episodes that I loved were: 3. The best love scene I've seen in a movie, when I really felt that love invaded the screen, is when Ramón daydreams when he flies to meet Julia on the beach and they kiss. 2. Gené talking on the phone with Ramón, the day before he does it, and he tells her that it is better to get fired at that moment, so as not to put her in trouble with the authorities. And then she knows that it is the last time they are going to speak, and she has fought for her right to die ... but she does not want to lose it, because she loves him as a true friend, and even though she is. Respecting their decision at all costs. 1. The best. A young Ramón on the beach, watching his girlfriend in the sun, jumping into the water from the rocks to a sea that retreats. We see the shock, we hear his voice remembering what happened and claiming that he should have died at that moment. Bardem's face, face down, shows us from below. And the hand of a friend who takes it from his forehead and returns him to a life that will be hell for him in the next 30 years. There are many others, such as the impressive final, despite the fact that in Spain we know very well what Ramón did. <br /> <br /> Sea inside did not deceive me, Amenabar never knows, but this time yes. thank the actors who participated in the project, and maybe they took it personally, because this is not just a movie, it is an elegy for a man who died only when he asked to die "legally", which meant for him, as Bardem He pointed out, dying with the people he loved and who loved him around him.
