It's a great movie for the whole family. I do not think many people have seen it because I ask people and they say that they have never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister-in-law. My favorite scene is the whole movie, I can not even choose a favorite scene. My favorite character is Hubert because he is a fun but intelligent dog. If someone has not seen him, he is missing a great adventure. I've only seen it because my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy of it. If someone is reading this, I suggest buying the movie and I guarantee that it will not be a bad decision. I've seen this movie about five times and every time it gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people who just give them a chance.
