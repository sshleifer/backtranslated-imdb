This is a remarkable movie so it is not shown as much as it is. What is shown is the incredible poverty in Sicily when the 19th century gave way to the 20th century, a lifestyle that made people dream of the "New" World of America. The Mancuso family lives in a place that is not even a village, just a stone country house amid the hard and inflexible stones of a country that can not offer even a single blade of green grass. An opening sequence sees the men of Mancuso climb barefoot up a steep slope, with stones in their mouths to offer in a sanctuary at the top in exchange for a "sign" that they must go to the New World or stay where they are. In addition, it shows life aboard the ocean liner, huddled masses, longing to breathe freely, and the conditions on Ellis Island, where their journey has not yet ended, are interrogated and examined to demonstrate their "fitness" to enter the United States. What is NOT shown is the ship at Longshot, or indeed ANY shot that would identify it as a large ship of line; what is also not shown is something that identifies the United States, without a clich√© vision of the Port of New York and the Statue of Liberty, so that Ellis Island could be anywhere in any country. Perhaps the most remarkable shot is that of a Camera Crane that watches hundreds of people stuck; Slowly, almost imperceptibly, two thirds of the people in the left screen begin to separate from the third on the right screen and we realize that the people on the left are on board the ship and those on the right are on the dock, a powerful statement of the fragmented society. There is a strong documentary feel throughout as if we were following a real ship full of immigrants even though it has been carefully worded and is clearly an amalgam of typical families / conditions at that time. With almost nothing happening in dramatic terms, it's not for the popcorn squad in the Multiplex, but for the rest of us it's a very good movie.
