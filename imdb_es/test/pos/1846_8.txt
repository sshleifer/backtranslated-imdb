This particular movie was one I wanted to see in theaters, but I never got to see it. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001, I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD soon after. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a wonderful job with the script and they are wonderful to hear in the audio commentary that is included in the DVD. They did a great job creating characters that really interested you. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions when watching this movie, including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also does a great job of showing the importance of the family (a rarity in today's movie), which is a reflection of the director, Bonnie Hunt, based on the comments she made on the DVD. David Duchovny showed me here that there is life beyond Fox Mulder that offers a wonderful performance with some quite moving scenes. I strongly recommend that you give a vision to this movie. I am very grateful to the creators of this movie. They have given me a wonderful cinematographic work that I will recommend to all my friends. I have seen many movies over the years and it is very rare for me to leave with such a feeling of satisfaction after watching a movie. I will see this again and again in the next few years. Return to Me reminds me that there are still filmmakers who know how to genuinely please their film audiences. Thank you!!
