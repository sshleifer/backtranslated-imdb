I think it was Fran√ßois Truffaut who said that the best films have to do with the joy of making movies or the agony of making movies. This movie is definitely the first type. Tromeo and Julieta are a pleasure to see from beginning to end. The fervent zeal that fuels this Shakespeare chanche is contagious. I do not think I've laughed so much since I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail. That is good!
