Over the years, I have become a fan of the director / writer Barry Levinson and I was not disappointed with this funny look at politics. Popular television comedian Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) has illustrated the nation with his scathing jokes about the state of the country and the elected politicians responsible. Night after night, he has his fans rolling around the islands; then the question arises that Dobbs is running for the president. His manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken) says to go for it. The frantic truisms of Dobb provoke a movement of roots that puts it on the ballot. Comedian to the president-elect. Meanwhile, a young woman (Laura Linney) finds a flaw in the computer system that will count the ballots from coast to coast. My favorite sequence is Linney's merger in the cafeteria. Williams is absolutely hysterical with his quick jokes. Other of the note in the cast: Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black and Rick Roberts.
