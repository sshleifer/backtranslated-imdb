"The king of the queens" can be divided into two eras. <br /> <br /> The first was, constituted by the first seasons, portrayed the problems of the daily life of a man and his wife who do it through life in the city. Check by check <br /> <br /> The second era, expanded the scope of the program, addressing current popular culture and marital problems with a humorous touch. <br /> <br /> But besides all that ... <br /> <br /> This show was tremendously fun. <br /> <br /> Kevin James, when he was not making comedy movies with Adam Sandler, is a genius of laughter, and his chemistry with Leah Remini was unparalleled. on television. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller, like his father-in-law's psychotic father-in-law, added his own unique style of quirky humor, and Patton Oswalt as the "man-son", Spence Ulchin was amazing, (he's a great comedian too ) "The King of Queens" was the last comedy of the 1990s to get off the air, and it's a damn shame. Now, all we have to see are the idiotic comedies full of actors and actresses without talent whose only attraction is their physical appearance. I like many fans of really funny TV shows, now I'm in a state of mourning
