SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love the Simpsons, and I've seen all the episodes that have come out. I must admit that the first season is, by far, the most undervalued season, and this is the most underrated episode of the first season. The episode begins with the family playing a Scrabble game to prepare Bart for an intelligence test he must take at school. . He says the game is stupid and does not want to play it, but he needs to. He says a word that angers Homer and chases Bart around the house. The next day, Mrs. Krabappel assures the class that the test is not part of their grade, just a test that will tell them what their future will be like. Bart can not answer a question. He thinks fast He quickly changes the test with Martin Prince, the smartest of the class. Later that day, Marge and Homer are called to go to the principal's office to talk about Bart's behavior. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the school psychologist comes and tells Skinner, Homer and Marge that Bart is a genius and that he must go to a special school for the gifted. Bart agrees to go since he would not have to do any homework. The next day, Homer takes Bart to the new school. It is presented to everyone and everything. Unfortunately, your day is not very good. Smart students take their lunch smartly, can not read any comic, but does it anyway, and their classmates criticize it. Luckily for Bart, he and Homer start having a great time together, but Marge bought tickets for an opera. They go to the opera, and they make fun of it. The next day he goes to his old school, but his friends make fun of him. They call it a dexter point. While at his new school, Bart is told to do a chemistry experiment. He does it badly and exploits the school, leaving it green. The psychologist tells Bart to tell him why he did it. Instead, Bart tells him that he wants to go undercover and go back to his old school to watch other children. The psychologist is intrigued and asks Bart to explain it on paper. He finds it very difficult and instead he writes a confession that he really is not a genius. He gives it to the psychologist. All that matters is that he misspelled the word confession. That night, Homero bathes and Bart and Bart tell him that he really is not a genius and that he cheated on the test. Homer gets angry and chases Bart in the house while Lisa and Marge look at them casually. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an episode of season one very underestimated. <br /> <br /> 8/10
