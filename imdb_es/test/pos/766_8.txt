I really only saw this movie because I had Rupert Grint (who I knew as Ron for the Harry Potter films). I had never really appreciated Rupert as an actor until this movie. I loved the whole movie. Rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious and quirky movie. I think the movie could have been fine without sex, but it worked in some way. I can not wait to see more Rupert movies in the future. Julie Walters also did an amazing job. In the Harry Potter films, she has a very small role, so I did not know what to expect from her either. But she was wonderful as Dame Evie. The part where the key is swallowed was absolutely hilarious. In general, an incredible movie.
