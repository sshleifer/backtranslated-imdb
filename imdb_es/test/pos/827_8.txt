I thought this was the most interesting movie that JCVD ​​has done in a long time. I loved his character and everything with the rabbit marked a different tone for this movie. In my humble opinion, JCDV can really be something in the future. A little more cheerful, some obvious tributes to other movies, mixed with some great fights ... I would like to see more this filming style of him. One of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a Desperado scam. Immediately I saw R. Rodriguez's connection too, but I thought he was very intelligent and made me want to go back to watch the movie to look for subtler signals from other movies. JCVD rocks !! <br /> <br /> Other things after reading other comments: <br /> <br /> Is there no music in the dungeon fight? At first I did not like that at first, but then I thought it was interesting because it made me lose my balance by giving us something we did not expect. It made it seem more real. <br /> <br /> They also always make me laugh when the directors cry as if they were 2 years old because their movie was "stolen" from the studio. The directors are paid to do a job. The studio is the boss and they want the product they want. Very few directors have absolute final cut in a movie. In this case, JCVD ​​is THE talent and the only reason why someone is watching this movie. I'm sure he got a movie that he was happy with. I have a family member who works in a post office who knew a little about the history. PRESUMABLY, the director worked and delivered his film cut. Everyone who saw it said it was a disaster ... then JCVD ​​and the studio reissued the movie. This happens all the time. He also saw the final cut (which he claims he did not see) and his "delicate genius" ego was severely hurt because they hated his court delivered. If this director were smart, he should have taken credit for this, since it would have been his best.
