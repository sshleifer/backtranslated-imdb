I thought that this movie was extremely charming. I guess I'm partial. I love worshiping Kathy Bates. I found her singing an additional pleasure. He has a very pleasant voice. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Bates plays Grace Beasley The film takes her from her married life of Doledrums in Chicago to England, the home of her recently murdered singer idol Victor Fox. There she meets her three surviving sisters. He also discovers that Victor leaves a male lover, Dirk Simpson. <br /> <br /> The story takes you to some surprisingly comical and moving situations, as Grace and Dirk develop a true mutual affection, after a rather rude initial rejection, on their part. They return to Chicago where they unite with Grace's funny and gracious daughter-in-law, Maudie, to find the serial killer who murdered Victor. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the photo did a good job. We especially enjoyed Julie Andrews, Lynn Redgrave and Barry Manilow. This movie was fun. Make you cry. The music is absolutely charming. <br /> <br /> Other posters here that found problems with any part of this movie, just do not have a clue. <br /> <br />
