A new guy in an armored car company is convinced to get involved in an armored car robbery by his fellow drivers to earn some quick money. The problem is that they really do not have much plan and, when complications arise, things become deadly. <br /> <br /> The fast-moving popcorn action movie has a lot to do with it. The first thing is that the movie has less than 90 minutes, so the film really does not have time to get stuck in the plot. He starts everything and leaves. Then the movie has some great action sequences, so one moves towards the edge of the seats. Finally, the film has a stellar cast that includes Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Lawrence Fishburne. It is a first class cast that sells and covers the stories that will be presented briefly. <br /> <br /> This is not a brain surgery, it's a popcorn movie and at that level it has a high rating. Worth a look.
