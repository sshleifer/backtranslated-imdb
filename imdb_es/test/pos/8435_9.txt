The China Syndrome is a perfect rhythm thriller and is not slow or boring at all, as some people tend to say. The transitions from one scene to another are excellent and the tension accumulated in the film will keep him on the edge of his seat for the full two hours. Jack Lemmon is great, as always, as the somewhat nervous plant operator and Jane Fonda are once again successful in bringing some real emotions to the story. You can see this film as a political statement of the time, or simply as a thriller done in an intelligent way. Either way, it's definitely worth seeing.
