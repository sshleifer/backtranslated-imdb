I watched my video last night, for the first time in at least ten years. I found the work itself and the performances as exciting as they were in my memory. George Hearn, of course, was the master of Sweeney's role; there is never a touch of softness in his determination to take revenge on those he believes caused the death of his wife and the disappearance of his daughter; at least not until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex representation, such as Mrs. Lovett. She understood that Sondheim wanted that role to be a kind of "comic" counterpart to Sweeney; and even brings some tenderness to his sweetness of Sweeney and to the care of the boy Tobias. For those with long memories, this performance leads to his debut in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Gaslight; Long before the murder, he wrote. Only a year ago I saw the musical at Chicago's Lyric Opera. with the current opera superstar Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others have commented on the operatic quality of the score. My conclusion is that "Sweeney" works better with actors who can at least handle vocal lines, than with opera artists who have limited acting skills. As a final note, I congratulate the artist who played Tobias. with his mixture of loyalties and confusion about what happens around him. It seemed fitting that he had virtually the last word.
