The joke and the humorous rescue scene help make this one of my favorites from the 14 movie series. Wonderful performance, great cast. And this film contains one of the few facts often noted about Sean Bean's career. The part in which he and Alice Krige fell from the horse to the water was not programmed, but it stayed since both continued acting right after it happened. <br /> <br /> This is a good follow-up of the intense end of Sharpe's enemy.
