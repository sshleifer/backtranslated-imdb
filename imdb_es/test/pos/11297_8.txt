One of the great tragedies of life is that Disney is very successful in everything they do. If they were not, we could have small more unique animation gems, like "The curious adventures of Mr. Wonderbird". The story is that an evil king has usurped the throne of a place called Up-And-Down-Land (it could have the wrong name). He is hated by everyone. His favorite pastime is shooting birds, and at some time in the past, he presumably killed Mr. Wonderbird's wife (a bird, played in the typical style of Peter Ustinov) leaving him with four young chicks to raise. Meanwhile, we see that another of the evil king's hobbies is painting. He has made three paintings in particular: a self-portrait, a painting of a shepherdess (of which he has fallen in love), and a chimney sweep (of which he is jealous). One night, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep come down from their paintings and flee together. The self-portrait of the king also gets out of his body, and eliminates the real king (Do you think I'm inventing this? It's the real plot) and sends the royal police to the young lovers. Mr. Wonderbird then helps the lovers try to escape the King's forces. <br /> <br /> The plot is wonderfully surreal, and the Up-and-Land establishment is an incredibly imaginative place, filled with accessible high-rise buildings. Only by elevators. It is an equal mixture of the worlds of "Metropolis" and "1984" and the drawings of Dr. Seuss. <br /> <br /> Watch it to see a unique viewing experience that does not fit the standard formula for most animations. characteristics.
