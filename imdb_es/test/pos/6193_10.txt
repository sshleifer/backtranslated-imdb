a really scary drama, there is no other drama out there that scared me as much as me, the characters are not your typical Islamic terrorist, you have a blond boy with blue eyes who is as silly as he seems. , is a converted Muslim. A very respected businessman, who claims to be a Jew and a Frenchman who has converted to Islam, but clearly has taken the word of the Qur'an to a whole new level. The hero of the plot is Darwyn, who is an undercover agent of the FBI who has infiltrated the terrorist cell, and has to do all sorts of terrible things to prevent detection. The first episode is a small sample of what follows. Although these are Islamic terrorists, the drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all Muslims are extremists, which is comforting to those concerned about racism, considering that half of the terrorist cells are Islamist, it makes you think that instead they are the only ones. to be afraid of. The most chilling drama I've seen. The reason why it is so chilling is because you never know who your friends are really, your husband or your neighbors. Terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, at any time.
