I did not know much about this movie in which my roommate dragged me. I was very pleasantly surprised! The plot really caught my attention and held it, and the characters are well drawn and realistic. The script is very smart and funny, and the cast does great things with it. And best of all, he managed to entertain himself without sex or explicit violence! If this movie gets anywhere within your area, you should really go see it: defend this little movie, it's worth it!
