I recently got the video from THE SEVEN-UPS and I must say it was a very nice movie. Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are great as the cop and the thief, respectively, and a young Richard Lynch is great as the psycho Moon. The late Bill Hickman is quite good as his partner Bo and establishes a brilliant sequence of car chases that will keep him on the edge of his seats. The other three members of the Seven-Ups team are pretty bland, but hopefully. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that many people on this site have supported this movie. I think it should be a movie that should be released on DVD and not just forgotten. I certainly enjoyed every minute of it. The final scene between the two protagonists is excellent, since the bad guy must face the consequences of his actions. THE SEVEN UPS does not disappoint.
