Meticulously constructed and perfectly reproduced, To The Ends Of The Earth is a simply amazing journey out of our reality and into another era. <br /> <br /> Based on William Golding's trilogy, these three 90-minute films describe the journey to both Australia and the experience of young aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Benedict Cumberbatch) aboard an elderly man of war at the beginning of the 19th century, while heading to a Government Down position. <br /> <br /> Among the crew and the hopeful emigrants who share His passage is a stormy and harassing captain (Jared Harris), a politically radical philosopher (Sam Neill), a cunning first lieutenant who made his way from the bottom (Jamie Sives) and, fleetingly, the first touch of love in the form. of a beautiful young woman (Joanne Page) whose ship literally spends in the night. <br /> <br /> Aside from the amazing degree of historical physical accuracy, director David Attwood and screenwriters Tony Basgallop and Leigh Jackson have an astute eye and Ar for manners and the rigid etiquette of a previous time, elaborating a microcosm totally convincing of the Napoleonic era. <br /> <br /> Life on board is a brutal and monotonous round of dizziness, misery and danger after another and, as Edmund becomes entangled in the loves, hopes and miseries of his fellow travelers, experiences a delirious whirlwind of the difficulties of life, the inhumanities of man and his noblest feelings. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoyed the Master and the Commander: The other side of the world or The series of novels by Patrick O'Brian on which he relied will love this? For everyone else, it's a whole new world to discover.
