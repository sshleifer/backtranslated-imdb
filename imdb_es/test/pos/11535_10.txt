For my life, I can not understand why the rating here for this movie is so low. This was one of the most beautiful movies I've seen this year. He really hit a chord with me. I had been anticipating this movie for several months and I thought: there's no way I can meet the expectations I had for her ... seeing how I built it in my head as much as I did. Needless to say, not only did it meet my expectations, but it far exceeded them. Jordana Brewster and Cameron Diaz were excellent in every way. His superb performance by much. Both were in their element and completely natural for roles. The places were absolutely beautiful. Each filmed shot was captured perfectly and adjusted perfectly to the environment and environment. I found this movie very moving and I took it very seriously. I would even contemplate saying that this could be one of my favorites of all time. At least, I could certainly see it again and again. <br /> <br /> I swear I could not find a flaw in this movie. It's hard to say that about any movie. I would highly recommend this one. It is moving, meaningful and says a lot about human nature and family. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10. Well done by everyone.
