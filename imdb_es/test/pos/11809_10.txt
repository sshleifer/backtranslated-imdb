*** Contains spoilers *** <br /> <br /> A charming movie, starring Brad Renfro and the always wonderful Joseph Mazzello. I like Joseph Mazzello, of all his films I've seen to date, I've loved them for many different reasons and The Cure is no different. Brad Renfro also does very well in this movie. The Cure is a drama / maturity film from the point of view of a sick child and his friend. <br /> <br /> The basic idea is: Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) has AIDS. He ends up making friends with the boy next door (Brad Renfro), but Erik's mother is very close, misinformed and is "thick" when it comes to Dexter's illness. She thinks AIDS is contagious like the Common Cold, so she does not want her son to get close to Dexter. <br /> <br /> After many attempts to make his own cure unsuccessful, the boys head to New Orleans to find the cure after reading a booklet about him. After receiving kicks from Playboy magazine, Dexter's health goes south shortly thereafter and, as his health deteriorates, there is still enough life in the boy next to Erik for two jokes to pretend to stop breathing. Unfortunately, poor Dexter does die of his illness, leaving poor Erik behind to wonder why he could not find the cure. Throughout the film, it ends up being linked more with the mother of Dexter that with his. <br /> <br /> It's a very moving movie and it's not absolutely perfect (movies rarely are), but that will not matter to you. As you get more involved in the movie. A must for fans of Joseph Mazzello, one of his best performances. Highly recommended movie must-see - if you can find a copy :)
