A western through and through. As the title character portrayed by Glenn Ford says, "No, I do not want to fight, but I'll fight if they impose it on me." This movie is about being smart, strong and fighting for one's beliefs. With courage, never stop fighting for what you feel is right. Great action and above all of fast pace. It's good to see Brian Keith in this role and Edward G. Robinson as an older Western man. Glenn Ford lives up to his western image. A completely enjoyable movie includes a non-military strategic war. Of course it is violent, as the title says, but not too graphic as in the computer-generated era films. It is mainly about strong personality clashes.
