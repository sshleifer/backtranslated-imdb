This is a necessity for everyone, but especially African-Americans. It is time for a movie that expresses and shows the concerns in African-American relations. It also allows other cultures to see in a fictional humorous way how positive African-American relationships and their results are in place of the undesirable stereotype that affects the African-American community. I love this movie a must see !!
