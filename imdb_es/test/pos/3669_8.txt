Ignore the comments of everyone else for this movie and watch them pay cable (as I did) or rent them. You owe it to yourself. This movie is what it's about (it's supposed to be) all the movies. It is difficult to categorize (and God knows how it was launched as a "high concept"!), But it is one for the angels. Check it out. What can you lose?
