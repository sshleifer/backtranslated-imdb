Lights of New York was the first full-length film that spoke everything. Of course, The Jazz Singer, released in October 1927 as the first feature film that incorporated a synchronized dialogue. However, this film released in July 1928 is virtually untouched by its place in the history of cinema. It started as a short film, but gradually more was added until, arriving at 58 minutes, it accidentally became the first full-length film that spoke everything. It opened for a house race and to the surprise of Warner Bros., made more than a million dollars. That was good money in 1928. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. Two country barbers shop naively at a hairdresser on Broadway that is presented as an easy chat for "The Hawk", a gangster. When they discover the truth, they can not afford to leave, because the youngest hairdresser, Eddie, has all his mother's money tied in place. Kitty is the youngest hairdresser's girlfriend, and gangster Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) has an eye to hand over to his older girlfriend (Gladys Brockwell) for a newer model: choir girl Kitty (Helene Costello). A policeman dies while trying to prevent Hawk's men from unloading a shipment of contraband liquor, and Hawk sees it as an opportunity to frame Eddie, and thus get Kitty to him. <br /> <br /> This early talker is a lot. Fun for the enthusiasts of these pioneering works. Of course, the plot is elementary and the dialogue is forced, but there is something that is not seen much in the first talkies: the musical score in the background. Vitaphone had originally been used for this purpose, and here they are still using it for musical accompaniment along with dialogue. And there are numbers singing and dancing! The scenes in Hawk's nightclub are used as an opportunity to show what movies could never do before: musical numbers. There is even a master of uncontrolled eyes with some heavy makeup of the silent era which is a great challenge to see. <br /> <br /> Vitaphone could not go outside at this point due to the static camera booths, so Scene in the park between the two lovers Eddie and Kitty is simulated, and cheap. The vegetation looks like something out of an Ed Wood movie or maybe a high school production of "Our Town". <br /> <br /> Gladys Brockwell, like Hawk's abandoned girlfriend, offers her lines with punch. She is a true soldier considering the lines she has to deliver. For the Hawk: "So you think you can have the chicken you want and you'll give me back to the deck!" Eh mixed metaphors to someone? And then there are his final lines "I've lived, and I've loved, and I've lost!" Was someone paid to write this dialogue? Brockwell was achieving great success in his talkie career after winning some triumphs in silent films (the evil sister in "Seventh Heaven"), when a fatal car accident cut him off. <br /> <br /> Then there's Eugene. Paleta - the largest of the two barbers in our history. His frog voice, his natural distribution of lines and his affectionate aspect gave him a long career as a character actor that usually appeared as a family man / businessman with a brusque exterior and a heart of gold. In fact, Mr. Palette is the only member of this cast who still has a remarkable career in movies just three years after this movie is released. <br /> <br /> Finally there is the question "where is that hidden microphone?" The microphones were still stationary at this point, and it's fun to find out where they've hidden it. There is a famous scene, however, where everyone can understand it. Hawk is in his office talking to his two henchmen, who seem to understand as slowly as they talk, about "taking Eddie for a ride". If you see this scene, you would swear that the phone on the desk is a character in this movie. It is in front and center throughout the conversation. It is likely that the microphone is placed in the phone. <br /> <br /> There is something heroic in these pioneers who fly blindly to the new sound technology. You have silent actors who are used to using pantomime for expression, vaudevillians who know how to play for a live audience but do not know how to make the same impression in a Vitaphone camera booth, and you have dialogue writers who try to write a conversation. as compact as the title cards did or filling movies with endless chats. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this. It's not boring, it moves fast and it's really fun if you know what to look for. And no, I do not expect it to be available on Blu-Ray, but I hope the Warner Brothers people will add it to the Warner Archive soon so everyone can see it.
