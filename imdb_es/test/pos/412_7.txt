Look, this movie is dark, bright and a classic that must be searched by any means necessary. I suppose that the powers that have been decided have to be relegated forever to the gangue compartment; however, we could only pray for the opportunity to see this on DVD. I would say that it even exceeds the great Phatasm. If you like a dark movie, with many spooky images, look for it and see how it is supposed to be a horror movie of the 80s.
