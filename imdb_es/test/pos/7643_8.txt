TOUGH LUCK follows a homeless homeless man as he becomes entangled in the clandestine world of the crime of deception and chaos. Archie (Norman Reedus) has been released and has nothing to lose. He almost died before the owner of a carnival named Ike (Armand Assante) hired him to work. Soon Ike reveals a strong desire for Archie to murder his naughty wife, Divana (Dagmara Dominczyk), an erotic dancer of the Carnival. Things soon get complicated when Archie falls in love with Divana and warns him about the plan. They get involved in a very arduous matter that leaves little to the imagination of the spectator, after which they soon make a plan. Together, they try to assassinate Ike, but things do not go as planned. <br /> <br /> I would be lying if I said that this movie did not surprise me. Personally, I was surprised at how good this movie was. When renting it several years ago, I expected another clich√© thriller with many of the typical elements and themes that are shown in many movies of that type these days. In a few minutes I was hooked and I found myself quite involved with the world of this movie. It's the kind of movie, like BUFFALO '66, that absorbs you and transports you to the style and sensation of paranoia. It's a movie that really does it in an impressive way. One thing I particularly appreciated was how the movie showed its characters. The film is not as easy and clear as it may appear in the plot summary. These are characters that really interest you and fascinate you, including the characters that are supposed to be the bad guys. In truth, there are no good or bad in this movie. All the characters have flaws in ways that are realistic and incredibly realistic. There are not many films that accomplish this task as impeccably as this movie does, but it is definitely a movie style that I like and I want to see more of today's movies. There were a lot of crime movies that were like that in the early 50s, but there has not been as exciting and unique as that since then! <br /> <br /> In terms of failures, I have mostly minor complaints. The film itself is not exactly original. However, I doubt that most people expect it to be original. The editing style of the movie can also be annoying for some people, as it tends to have a kind of shaky camera camcorder everywhere. While it did not bother me and I really felt that it added to the atmosphere, I am sure that most viewers will not be so enthralled by it and that, in general, they will find it unpleasant. However, despite the minor flaws, this is one of the most underestimated movies of the 2000s. It's so refreshing to get lucky and see an unknown movie that turns out to be good. It seems as if this movie was a direct release to video, although this movie is much better than that. If it had been put in the cinemas, it would not have won any prize or seen much, but it would have much more recognition than today. Recognition that this movie deserves. TOUGH LUCK is an amazing, entertaining and twisted neo-noir thriller with a true sense of class and juxtaposed style and enough substance to make the average viewer more than satisfied.
