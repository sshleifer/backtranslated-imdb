A stark presentation of the decline of family values ​​and human dignity after Soviet communism, Vasili Pichul's film, Little Vera, is a historical film of Russian modern cinema. Pichul's brutal drama marks a strong departure from the images of sanitized idealism promoted in Soviet times (as in the Circus of Aleksandrov), shamelessly moving the social chaos of his time towards public attention. A contemporary Ukrainian configuration further intensifies the effect, first by the immediacy of the film to its period of time, second by its use of a locality that not only fights for identity rather than a Soviet system, but also as a distinct nation of the Russian language. who had dominated the USSR <br /> <br /> Vera, the character and protagonist of the film, is a rebellious teenager with a "dysfunctional" family that includes a drinking father and a well-cared for mother. Rejecting her future boyfriend Andrei, Vera begins a destructive (and mostly sexual) relationship with a college student named Sergei. Despite the displeasure of his parents for the lazy Sergei, and despite Sergei's rude disdain for his parents, he moves into his small apartment. The tensions increase until Vera's father stabs Sergei. Vera must decide if she will remain loyal to her intolerable family by testifying that her father acted in self-defense, or if she will continue to support and defend the always distant Sergei. <br /> <br /> Unbearable in almost every conceivable way, Little Vera captures and masterfully communicates the inescapable emptiness that remains in social life after the collapse of communism. The sexual aggressiveness of the film (it was the first film to show explicit sex) combined with the implacable presentation of social reality (a marked distinction of socialist realism demanded by Stalin) effectively confronted the conditions of the former Soviet's life. The most interesting, however, was the public reception. While many wrote hate messages to the director and the star, the movie was very popular. Here arises the double-edged nature of the "film as a social criticism": if done correctly, the film will make the audience feel uncomfortable. Because there is no easy solution, some viewers will hate the film and the filmmakers for "posing" the problem. Many movies come to mind as something comparable in this aspect: Larry Clark's Kids, Harmony Korine's Gummo, even popular movies like John Hughes' Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to those viewers for whom the prospect of almost two hours of internal conflict and social miasma is not too daunting. The movie is absolutely beautiful, and incredibly challenging. Despite the difficulties to see the movie, some moments are very beautiful. Of course, the socio-historical and cultural significance of the film can not be overlooked, and in fact it functions as an even more assertive reason to watch this movie.
