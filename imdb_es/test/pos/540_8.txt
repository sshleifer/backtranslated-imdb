I was lying in bed, flipping through the channels ... and I have channels ... 500 of them. With more than 70 movie channels, I probably watch a movie on cable, once or twice a month ... the DVD has spoiled me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm browsing and I came to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman, I'm interested. 110 minutes later I'm still interested. How could this be? The first time I saw the previews of this film in the movies, I remember making fun of it. I never thought I would see it ... I do not like it. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a book, and you can tell it. The film is very episodic, and it's not like the movie has a big plot, it just sucks you. It may be that the performances do it. I'm pretty sure it must have been. <br /> <br /> This movie was good for no reason ... <br /> <br /> Rating of Peter's movie (out of 10): 7
