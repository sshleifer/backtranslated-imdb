While Disney has been THE animation studio for the last 70 years, there have always been rivals in its supremacy. When this review was drafted in 2009, for example, companies such as Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman, produced animated films that could be said to defy Disney's dominance. At the beginning, in the troubles of the 30s and early 40s, when Disney was serving film banquets such as Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was offered by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer. Despite releasing two very commendable films, they never monopolized the market. many attribute their fall to the commercial failure of Mr. Bug Goes To Town, launched the same week as the attack on Pearl Harbor (which gave the American public something more important to think about than going to the movies to watch a cartoon). The film has vanished in relative obscurity, it is a parody. <br /> <br /> In a patch of a garden covered in greenery in the city, a lot of insects are in grave danger. Humans use the earth as a shortcut, discarding garbage and cigarettes, and other dangers, right above the houses of the insects as they go. The owner of the store Honey Bumble (with the voice of Jack Mercer) fears that the future is bleak, and wonders how he can raise his daughter Honey (with the voice of Pauline Loth) in a more secure environment. A highly unscrupulous creature, Bagley C. Beetle (with the voice of Tedd Pierce), offers a safer place to live if he accepts his hand in marriage, but Honey is much more interested in his girlfriend of childhood, the always cheerful and optimistic. Hoppity (expressed by Stan Freed). Hoppity believes that everything is about to be resolved for the better, but he looks foolish when Bagley Beetle and his partner of comedic comrades manipulate the crisis to their own tortuous end. Only at the end, as their patch becomes the basis of a huge new skyscraper, do insects change loyalty to Hoppity as they search for it to take them to a new and safe home, far from the destructive influence of humans. <Br /> <br /> What really works in this movie is the charming characterization? All errors have been intelligently developed and designed to achieve the maximum attractiveness of the audience. The clumsy villains Swat the fly and Smack the mosquito (funny names, if you stop to think about it) are particularly memorable. Equally admirable is the narrative impulse? even the youngest children can enjoy this story, while at the same time skillfully conveying a message to older audiences about how human oversight can affect the survival of wildlife. Time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film, and upon seeing it, the public must accept (and forgive) these occasional signs of age and general wear and tear. But in general, Mr Bug Goes To Town is an animated, fun and very cleverly presented, with a message worthy of initiation.
