WOW!! Talk about a movie that divides the audience! This is a true love or I hate the movie a little. Personally I enjoyed it a lot. I noticed that other reviews are comparing it with Pitch Black. This is a bit silly since the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can be really stupid. No, this movie is much more in common with The Thing (how people do not realize it is amazing, they even have the same basic music). There are many touches of Carpenter, blue-collar heroes, sharp humor, endless landscapes and death. Things do not understand. Perhaps what prevents this film from being a true classic is its respect for other works by Carpenter. No less important Dark Star with which he has something in common. I would be interested to know how much it really costs? $ 8,000? Is that possible? Maybe it was based on a short film that cost $ 8000? But I found myself strangely moved when several spatial types died. They are so minimized that it's like watching a documentary sometimes. Having said that the script is a little awkward and only half of them can act, and I'm not sure that the big man who plays the Captain is one of them. But his weapon is awesome! Give it a try, if you like the Carpenter early, you could fall for it, but do not wait for 2001.
