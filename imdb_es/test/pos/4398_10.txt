I was in the movie immediately. I've seen the other Coen movies, with the exception of Raising Arizona, and I've noticed that each of his films has a color. Fargo is gray / white, Lebowski is bright orange and this film is a nice yellow. <br /> <br /> The nice and bright qualities of this movie start immediately. Soon the look is accompanied by great, great music. It's the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written at a time when music was enjoyed as part of everyday life. Enjoyed by all, gangs of chains, choirs of churches and even fugitives from the prison. <br /> <br /> Now, about the prison fugitives. I do not know what crime his characters may have committed, since they are a very friendly group of guys. Clooney is fantastic, he is completely overcoming his role. <br /> <br /> Go see this as soon as possible. I think anyone can enjoy it at some level. For some reason, the theater I was in was full of old and old, and they loved it. <br /> <br /> You will also love it, I promise. I was forced to put my hands on the soundtrack immediately.
