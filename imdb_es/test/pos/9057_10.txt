This is really a great movie. Full of love and humor, it forces the audience to really care about the characters and participate in their journey. Michael Parness managed to reunite a great cast of the best players, a small miracle for a first movie. Without a doubt, they moved to help him tell this beautiful story. David Krumoltz takes the film with his discreet intensity and honesty. Natasha Lyonne is unpredictable, exasperating and, nevertheless, totally friendly as Grace. Also a big change from Karen Black (which is a pleasure to see her on the screen again) as Grace's crazy and compassionate mother. There is sharp wit at all times, which allows us to relieve laughter when we face the pain of life. The performance is impeccable, the editing adjusted, the direction inspired, and the music creates an appropriate environment for the environment. Given the current fashion of Hollywood Blockbuster, full of big budgets, big names, car accidents and special effects, 'Max & Grace' is a refreshing departure. Treat yourself and see this movie.
