Roy Anderson's film 'You, The Living' comprises a series of fifty sketches, snapshots and vignettes set in a Swedish city. Some characters are on the screen for only a few seconds, while others appear in numerous scenes and, sometimes, they are seen loitering in the background while another story unfolds. Many scenes are drawn from the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of the strange but believable characters that inhabit this world. It's a fascinating approach: each of the scenes can be enjoyed in isolation, but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be human. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour or so, 'You, The Living' is gloriously fun. Much of the humor is focused on the members of a music band, whose musical practice infuriates the neighbors in their apartment block. The climax of the comic, however, is provided by a clue to the dinner that went terribly wrong. After this hilarious introduction, however, the mood of the film darkens considerably. The dream of the dinner becomes somber when the unfortunate protagonist is judged by his life, establishing a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> In the following scenes, the unhappiness of The cast of characters becomes increasingly apparent. Theirs is a world where people can not connect with each other, where talking about dreams, nightmares and fantasies is widespread, but where no one can be comforted, even when other people seek help. The woman killed with the chorus of 'no one loves me' and the young woman with unrequited love for the rock guitarist, Micke, are archetypal characters. <br /> <br /> The world of 'You, The Living' is also marred by selfishness. An elderly professor is deprived of the warmth of a vast banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous son who is looking for money; a thief steals the wallet of a ruthless executive; An arrogant and impatient businessman insults a Muslim barber and receives his due. In the darkest moment of the film, a woman in the church tells the long list of human sins while her parishioners move in at closing time. <br /> <br /> And yet, for all the dark moments of this film, the shared refrain of 'tomorrow is another day' points to the ability of people to continue living despite many miseries. The soundtrack provided by Benny Anderson (of ABBA fame) seems inappropriately jovial at first, but it makes more and more sense as the film realizes this human ability to persevere. <br /> <br /> 'You, The Living' has an extraordinary style image. The same faded and pale green colors are repeated, and there is no shadow in sight; This makes the characters look exceptionally pale and creates the feeling that human life is left uncovered for examination. Almost all scenes are captured in a static camera frame, as if they were photographs that come to life. The few occasions in which the camera moves are even more extraordinary; The contrast between life and the movement of the great banquet form a striking contrast with the death of the wardrobe scene. In the most intense moments of longing and despair, the characters transfigure the viewer directly in front of the camera. They know they are being examined and have a few moments to pour their hearts out to us, the spectators. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, human movie.
