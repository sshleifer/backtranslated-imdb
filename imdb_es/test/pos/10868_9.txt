I found it charming! Nobody but Kiarostami can do so little and yet get so much. You might think I'm weird, but I was so delighted that I could not talk during the movie. While during other films I comment a lot. The short film made by him for Lumiere et Companie, that of the eggs, is unbeatable in my heart, but this is also wonderful. I liked it better than Ten. Kiarostami is, perhaps, the best director in my opinion, because he can see things! You do not need to use many things "brought from home" to illustrate your images, just take a camera. Not many can do that ... Maybe I do not know much about movies but I do not care about complicated things, all someone has to do is touch my soul. Kiarostami does it.
