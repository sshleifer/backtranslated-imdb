In the S.O.S of Tweety, Sylvester goes from collecting garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise that leads to a certain species of Canary bird and his grandmother, its owner. Uh oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to catch the bird. Sylvester also gets dizzy several times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the boat that has something to cure his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can fire! I will stop here and say that this is another excellent caricature directed by Friz Freling starring the popular duo of cats and birds. Tweety's S.O.S is the most recommended.
