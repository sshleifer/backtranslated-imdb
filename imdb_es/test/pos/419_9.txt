Everywhere I hear that people are calling this program wrong because their premise is too remote ... well, maybe a well-made taxi driver in Philadelphia is pushing it a bit (at least taxi drivers have been found), but that is what he does The show is fantastic. <br /> <br /> The fact that this show is a bit removed from reality is a problem, but it's still nice and fun. It is very visible and, although you know that Mike wins, in the end he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the main role. His cast is excellent and I must say that the location of the program is especially excellent. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not see this program because I am looking for a good dose of reality or a program with a lot of action. I see this program because it has a great performance, a good premise and a great story every week. It is also an advantage when I can choose the reference points through which it passes, or know in which intersection it is. I love this show and I love Philly !! Give this show a chance!
