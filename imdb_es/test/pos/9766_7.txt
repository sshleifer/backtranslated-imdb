I ran to the library to see this miniseries after having finished listening to the wonderful "talking books", a complete version of the book. The first half of this TV version is really very good, but stumbles a lot in the second half. The relationship with the trustee is overestimated and there are inserted conflicts between Jean and Joe that do not exist in the history of Shute, recklessly in my opinion, since they greatly diminish the power of their love story. I was disappointed to discover that Bryan Brown's wonderful Joe seemed much more arrogant and much less attractive than the man in the book, but Jean de Helen Morse was really very good. I think they would have had to make this a 10-hour miniseries to properly develop the story of the Outback. But all this said, I saw everything more or less once and I appreciated its merits, wishing that someone would do a less soapy remake.
