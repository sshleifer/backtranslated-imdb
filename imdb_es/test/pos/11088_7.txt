"The hawk and the snowman" is the story of two young people, a CIA employee and a drug dealer, who become disillusioned with US foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. The events of the film are based on a true story. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are convincing in the main parts and develop interesting characterizations. The cast of support also performs well, particularly with a performance by David Suchet of Hercule Poirot as an experienced Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> The film is generally effective to establish its premise, develop it and give a feeling of two children caught in something they did not understand correctly when entering. However, it seems too long and cumbersome at the intermediate points. The ending, however, is tense, impressive and effective. There are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack, but also unfortunately a repeated soft synth track that does not fit with a spy story. There are other spy movies that are worth searching for like "The Falcon and the Snowman," but it's a decent movie.
