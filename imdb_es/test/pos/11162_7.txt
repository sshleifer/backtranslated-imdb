Hey, this Ralf Westhoff seems to know a lot about people! We have nine women and nine men who participate in a fast dating event, each person has five minutes to talk to each of the opposites. A good idea to make a movie of these conversations. And even better: it works very, very well! The dialogue is witty, original and authentic, each person is subtly characterized, without falling into the cliché trap, something that is unusual for German films, remember: All these years, the Germans were tormented with silly zeitgeist comedies like "Workaholic "or" Stadtgespräch ". <br /> <br /> But now the time has come for young German directors to do their thing and risk producing entertaining, fun, intelligent and at the same time sensitive films. The moment of "Shoppen" is also good: although it presents mainly the dialogue, it maintains tension and interest. After a while, you really feel curious to see what this man and that woman would look like. Some of the participants meet later for two-ones, it's fun to watch them interact together in "real life". Of course, the film has some drawbacks: it is not very cinematic (but can it be a film like that?), The musical soundtrack could have been better, but all this is only marginal. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie: we have some very good actors here. Imagine this: all of them are still quite unknown even here in Germany (most were derived from the theatrical scene of Munich or Bavaria). But I predict that of the 18 main actors, at least 11 will be quickly known in the movie and television scene here. It's great to see so many new faces and at the same time talented. Well done! <br /> <br /> For those who want to read more, here is a summary of the 18 actors: (spoilers!) <br /> <br /> Sebastian Weber: The silent waters are deep! Memorize your monologue "Flower Garden", you can win the heart of any woman with this. <br /> <br /> Anna Böger: An incredible woman! Every time you open your mouth, you can not help but laugh and feel good. Listen to how he pronounces "asshole" and call "Bürscherl" the man in the pink shirt! <br /> <br /> Felix Hellmann: It's fun to see the "Bürscherl" from above. The inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those types around. His appearance reminded me a bit of Flo Weber of "Sportfreunde Stiller". <br /> <br /> Katharina Schubert: This woman has it all: love, hope, despair, beauty. His scene "do you want children?" Its a classic. A great actress that we will hear again, without a doubt. <br /> <br /> David Baalcke: Now this guy is a loser or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in "Sideways". I hope this is NOT a method of acting. <br /> <br /> Julia Koschitz: The "pretty" woman in the circle. Julia used to play theater in my hometown, congratulations! I think it will appear in many television series to come. <br /> <br /> Martin Butzke: The revolutionary boy catches the prettiest and most conventional woman at the end. Would you like to share a taxi with this guy? <br /> <br /> Kathrin von Steinburg: Last year she had an impressive performance in "Tatort". His trance performance in this movie is no less. Look at her beautiful face and listen to her dirty laugh. The best scene in the movie belongs to her. <br /> <br /> Matthias Bundschuh: I know that these "write everything": buyers return from school. I'm not sure if the hot blonde had her allergic reaction because of him or her cat. The representation of Matthias of such a chicken is exceptional. <br /> <br /> Mediha Cetin: My ex-girlfriend's sister-in-law was the same one who talked like her. The day I met her was the only day of my life that needed tranquilizers, so I have bad memories here. <br /> <br /> Thomas Limpinsel: the "nice and desperate boy" of the circle. Limpinsel has a comedic talent that is much better than most so-called "comedians" on television. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wagner: The victim of the metaphor of Sebastian's "flower garden". Lisa's face is funny and full of melancholy, her story made me feel good and sad at the same time, wow! <br /> <br /> Oliver Bürgin: The "handsome" man in the circle. No wonder I caught Julia in the end. These two really fit together. I think it will appear in many television series to come. <br /> <br /> Julia Heinze: The "nice and conventional" woman. I hope it is not underestimated: the change of Julia's face from naive to wounded to furious is great! <br /> <br /> Stephan Zinner: Does the "nature guy" from Partenkirchen like to cook, eat? and good sex Watch the body language between him and the hot blonde! Zinner usually plays CSU politician Söder on stage! <br /> <br /> Anja Klawun: The "bargain girl" has some good moments, but, sorry, it fails (like most actors) to play a drunk on the screen. <br /> <br /> Christian Pfeil: interprets the arrogant and narcissistic guy. I could not believe that this same actor owns two cinemas in Munich. <br /> <br /> Tanja Schleiff: plays the girl who sleeps with every man around her. I'm sure many male visitors will go for it. I heard that she can also play dramatic roles, so I'm curious.
