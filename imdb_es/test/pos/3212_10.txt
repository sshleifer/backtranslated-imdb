I have seen this program since the beginning, and I am 45 years old. For me, this is much more than a show that attracts women. This is the story of a family, possibly unusual, but still a family. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive women and, in their own way, successful. Lorelei has her home in Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history and a population of people who may be unusual, but who act like a dysfunctional family. The show also shows the relationship between Lorelei and her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, people from the old DAR WASP money who do not approve Lorelei's choices in life, although Lorelei does not care. The history of relationships and the line are what makes this show, in my opinion, the best in the WB network (soon to be the CW). Look at this show!
