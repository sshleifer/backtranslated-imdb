People who thought that THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed the HORIZON EVENT, probably did not see the movie that spawned Vin Diesel's head killer to begin with, and probably have no intention of doing so. Pity, because PITCH BLACK actually kicks your ass. <br /> <br /> Directed by the genre veterinarian David Twohy (WARLOCK and the excellent but underestimated DOWN) and written by brothers Jim and Ken Wheat (LIE, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK begins with a prologue "ALIEN" . When a cargo freighter / passenger cargo ship is severely damaged by an abnormal meteor shower (which also kills the captain), the co-pilot, Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell of SILENT HILL) has an important decision to make: get rid of the cargo or the passengers? Near the collection of ore on the occupants, the forced landing derails its last course of action. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, because the catastrophic landing was made on a premonitory rock that once had a mining colony. Among the survivors there are a couple of settlers, Shazza (Claudia Black of FARSCAPE) and Zeke (John Moore); an Imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say "red shirts", boys and girls?); an antique dealer named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); a 'young boy' named Jack (Rhianna Griffith), and the most controversial members of the group: a Marshall named Johns (the superbly thin Cole Hauser) and his prisoner ... a dangerous murderer named Riddick (Diesel). <br /> <br /> The way in which the group dynamics are agitated causes great dramatic tension to be achieved, especially with concerns about Riddick and the number of people he could divide into dice if he ever runs away. But nobody here comes out alive, as the saying goes, and the bigger turns have less to do with how they get along, than how they will survive when they discover the unthinkable. You are not alone in the planetoid. Things that are hungry, clawed and fast are slipping through where you can not see them, living in the dark where they can survive and thrive. They want the meat of the newcomers to satisfy their appetite, but they can not go out into the light of day to look for food. <br /> <br /> Does the phrase "total eclipse" make things a little more interesting? ? You can bet. Hence the title more than appropriate. <br /> <br /> Vin, more monosyllabic than Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry on his most grumpy day, dribbling more testosterone than sweat, has a field day with a character that really seems worthwhile. a sequel or two, and Hauser, who oozes threat and bile is as good as his father Wings was in the villainy on screen. However, surprisingly, Mitchell stands and manages to be strong and understanding as Fry. You would expect nothing less than a strong presentation from Black, She Who Once Was 'Aeryn Sun', and she does not disappoint. (Too bad his role was not greater, but that's all I'll say about it). And David leaves his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith will be truly tested in the very pit of hell. <br /> <br /> The rhythm moves faster than Riddick sliding behind his prey with a shank on his teeth, and once the darkness descends, the terror and tension never diminish, almost like in other classic movies sci-fi / horror that imitates But if the imitation is really the most sincere form of adulation, Dave Twohy and the Wheat deserve a big setback for getting a good revenge, and for giving us an end that is anti-Hollywood to the fullest. <br /> <br /> I do not want to ruin the surprises, so I will not say much more, except that if you saw CHRONICLES first and you were not very happy, give PITCH BLACK a try anyway. And if you have not seen any, definitely start with this one. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Vin is doing up until now, but I certainly could do worse than calling these guys again. I would love to see what they would dream next ...
