We found this show on a Sunday morning at 6:30 a.m. while we browse through all the cable channels, and it turned out to be the best show! It is absolutely adorable. We need programs like this for children (and adults, since I am beyond the years of my childhood). As one of the other comments pointed out, this program benefits from the simplicity of the characters and the story lines. The puppets are fantastically pretty, the backgrounds are colorful and, although they are made of cardboard, foam, paint and pure imagination, they remind us of our own childhood, when we could spend the day in our grandmother's house, exploring the world around us. For those who never had the luck to have a grandmother as kind as Nana, this show is for you, you will recover the lost time! This show is a true inspiration and is full of intelligence and humor, and is simply fun, both for children and adults. In other words, do not overlook this show, just because it's more than three years old! Spend a half hour with Mona, Nana, Mr. Wooka and Russell, they will be friends you expect to see!
