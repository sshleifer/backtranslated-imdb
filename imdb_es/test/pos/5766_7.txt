Although it is possibly the most stupid, insipid and violent slapstick comedy ever made, Guest House is also very funny. Do not listen to the critics, they do not have a sense of humor. While the climax runs out of steam (but does not vomit), it's still a fun partying movie. Seven candles in the eye in ten.
