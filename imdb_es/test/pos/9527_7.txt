In Victorian times, a father separates from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and sent to live in the country. Children adapt to their new situation, make friends and turn to the help of a friendly old man who they greet on the train to help reunite their family. <br /> <br /> The actors who direct the films are often not very good at that. Jeffries however, the great veteran actor of dozens of classics of British comedy, is one of the few exceptions. His brilliant conception (he also wrote the script, from the novel by E. Nesbit) of a British children's classic is what elevates this film to art. While the story can be highly idealized, the wonderful performances and the fabulously evocative scenarios of Yorkshire Vales combine to make a truly memorable movie. Arthur Ibbetson's photography is the definition of good film making: it is not wasted even once to tell the story, but at the same time the images combine to create a fabulously romantic atmosphere. Agutter is simply perfect as a good-hearted Bobbie (well, I fell in love with her at an early age, but I defy anyone to disagree) and Cribbins, whose comic pedigree is on par with Jeffries, is unforgettable as Perks The humble but proud railway porter. This is a movie out of time; Romantic, charming, enormously nice and with a wonderfully naive sense of good-hearted kindness towards everyone.
