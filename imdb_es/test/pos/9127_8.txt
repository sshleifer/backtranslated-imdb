LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very good movie, although it suffers a bit because there have already been similar movies. In too many ways, the film is reminiscent of previous robbery films such as RIFIFI and GRAND SLAM and many others. Then, while the director Melville and the actors did great works, everything seems to be a case of Déjà vu. Because of this, it cost me a lot to give this excellent movie a higher score. <br /> <br /> The only unusual aspect of the movie is how thieves come together. Instead of the usual means, Vogel escapes from prison and meets Corey, a career criminal who has just come out of prison! Both are a good combination, but having them both work in parallel for much of the movie until they met was a smart touch. Apart from that, as expected, much of the film refers to the meticulous details in the planning and execution of the crime. I also liked that the film showed offenders in such a cold and distant way: something relatively common in French crime movies, but rare among American films until recent years. <br /> <br /> In general, very well elaborated and valuable seeing ... if you do not mind that it seems a bit repetitive, you will see something of good acting, direction and a lot of tension.
