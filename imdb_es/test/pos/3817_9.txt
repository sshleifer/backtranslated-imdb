The Outer Limits is a brilliant show that for the most part leaves me with very strong emotions. There are undoubtedly some stinking episodes, but it's essentially an old pulp comic turned into a television show, so it can be expected. For the most part, he is excellently done, well produced and directed, and often presents some renowned talents who seem to enjoy working on a solid short fiction translation to an hour-long television format. <br /> <br /> The Outer Limits tends to focus on rather large ethical / philosophical / moral issues and rarely ends without the voice-over intreating serious thinking. <br /> <br /> From time to time, the topics are too deeply rooted for All but the fattest spectators. In addition, although a certain level of distrust in the government is conducive to an effective democracy, unfortunately it can capture several consecutive episodes on the border of the absurd with respect to distrust in the Army / CIA, etc. that any large group with power (the Roman Catholic Church, the Evangelicals, the People's Republic of China, etc.) is cast in a bad light on a frequency that goes from one to the other. <br /> <br /> While the show can beat a dead horse if it has been seen enough, the overall quality is amazing, and I am grateful that Sci-Fi has decided to continue transmitting it until they produce a DVD set season by season (and I can afford it).
