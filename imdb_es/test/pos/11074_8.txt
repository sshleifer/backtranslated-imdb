This is a very realistic movie. It's the most realistic thing I've seen in urban youth. The actors were great. I'll look for more Gómez movies. I had never heard of the movie until someone mentioned it recently. I bought it on DVD. I was impressed. I have not seen anything as close to life as I know it in Philadelphia. This is very close, in fact, a scene in which there is an accident (I will not ruin and give details), it reminded me of an almost identical situation in Philadelphia. At first I thought that Gómez took the scene of that real life event, but then I realized that he made the movie a few years before that situation. I also agree with the point that this movie did not try to expand its appeal by putting in the garbage of Hollywood. Gomez also directed "Laws of gravity", I'm anxious to see it.
