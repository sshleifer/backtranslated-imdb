I love this movie. The chemistry between the two leaders, Miller and Carlisle, is amazing, they light up so well on each other, creating an unlikely comedy Duo. Alan Cumming is very funny, his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident as he camps. The acting is excellent and it is a genuinely funny and moving movie. I admit it's not the best movie ever made, but it's a lot of fun, and I would recommend it to those who enjoy other British movies. It includes some of the best British actors, including Michael Gambon, so you will not go wrong. Look for cameos by David Walliams and Matt Lucas from Little Britain and Rock: profile fame.
