It's a war drama: World War II, with Frenchmen, Jews and Germans, but this is somehow fun, honestly. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau co-wrote the screenplay for his hit movie "Bon Voyage" (2003). Unlike the director "The Safe Behavior" by Bertrand Tavernier, also known as "Laissez-passer" (2002), the "Shady Sunday" by Wolf Rolf Schubel (1999), or "Lucie Aubrac" by Claude Berri (1997) Wd. The title sounds - c'est la vie (whatever) - and we have to thank the beautiful and talented Isabelle Adjani. It's his charming performance as the center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of all this, which made the movie as enjoyable as it is. Hell, what's another derailment of your plan and expectations? He will worry about that again. The backbone of the story revolves around a couple of young enthusiasts: Grégori Derangère as Frédéric and Virginie Ledoyen (from "8 Women" by Francois Ozon) as Camille. The incomparable Gérard Depardieu, the witty Yvan Attal (from "My wife is an actress") and the versatile Peter Coyote (who juggles in French, English and German here) are some of the star actors involved. <br /> <br /> There are many characters that come and go in this plot of a movie, and how it moves is a skill that does not require analysis. Rappeneau is simply a genius. The story is only based on itself, one episode after another, or even with superimposed events, but never confuses: that's what it's all about, somehow, all the details appear on the screen and we simply wrap them up like a French presented with taste. Dessert, literally like that There are emotions, trills, tender hesitating moments and tense and sinister escapes, all playing before our eyes. <br /> <br /> After reading the Director's Note on the official Bon Pictures site of Sony Pictures Classics, Rappeneau indicated that this is his most personal and successful work. Representing Bordeaux 1940 from the memories of his childhood years is very close to his heart and "had worked and reworked the script for almost 3 years". This film is a work of love in general, the cast and crew complement the passion of the director and a formidable script of collaborative writers along with the director and his son Julien, adaptation efforts of Gilles Marchand, Patrick Modiano and Jérôme Tonnerre. <Br /> <br /> Music by Gabriel Yared (varied the tone of his previous film as "The English Patient" or "Talented Mr. Ripley"), which provided a chord theme that kept the rhythm and rhythm of the plot , almost like a train that goes on and on, reflecting the lively energy of Adjani (even when she is tired), keeping her going when she finds what is coming, walking with her head held high and wearing an elegant outfit always, without looking back , much less with time for regrets. <br /> <br /> Oh, we must not forget the magnificently translated subtitles of Ian Burley, who also made subtitles for Italian films: "Pan y tulipanes" (2000), also known as Pane e tulipani, "The Last Kiss" " "(2001), also known as L'ultimo bacio, and" El cielo "by Tom Tykwer (2002). <br /> <br /> If you find this war relations drama too light, try" Aimée and Jaguar " by Mäx Fäberböck (1999, in German, based on a true story) with brilliant performances by Juliane Köhler as Aimée and Maria Schrader as Jaguar.
