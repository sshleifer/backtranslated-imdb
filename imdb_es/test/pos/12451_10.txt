How his status as a man and ape evolved was outstanding. Not to mention the setting of the movie. Christopher Lambert was amazing as Lord of Greystoke. Christopher is the soul of this masterpiece. I was so enthusiastic about his performance that I could feel the beat of my heart. The whole movie still moves me to this day. His interpretation of John was worthy of Oscar; how he should have been nominated for it.
