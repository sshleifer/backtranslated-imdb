I had never heard of this movie when a good friend recommended it to me. I trust this friend's taste, so I bought the DVD. My wife and I sat down to see him without knowing what it was about. I thought it was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time, mainly because I saw the truth in satire. I recommend this movie to all my friends. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. Some people will see the rude humor and the aura of stupidity, and they will find that Idiocracy is one of the stupidest movies they have seen. What these people do not seem to understand is that the crude humor is there, not to amuse the audience, but to show what attracts imbeciles in the future. <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson is well regarded as an "average Joe". Mainly, it is there to be susceptible to scathing comments about the society that are spread throughout this film. Many of the funniest bits are in the background, so it's easy to see them several times. What makes the film even more fun and terrifying is that I see elements of it in everyday life, in people I know or in the media. Then, I see Idiotocracy again and I realize how good it is. <br /> <br /> The few people who have seen and enjoyed this movie can be part of an elite club. I'll see an advertisement for a product with a new innovative ingredient, and I turn to my wife and say, "He has electrolytes!" She knows exactly what I'm saying.
