This film is much better than the first "Astérix et Obelix contre César", but it is far from perfection. The adaptation of the comic is good, some of the images and dialogues of the film are the same as in the book. But there are few things that made the film not as interesting as the animated film released in 1968. For example, the fight between Numerobis and Amonbofis. This was not necessary or even credible, nor for the little love story of Asterix. They also missed some things, like the songs that are in the animated film, and some other things ... I'm cheated by the movie because they cut the things I expected to see and showed things I did not want. Or necessary to see. I know it would have been very difficult to make the film exactly like the comic or the animated movie, but that's what I expected. In conclusion, even if the film is good, I still prefer the animated film, which, in my opinion, is much better.
