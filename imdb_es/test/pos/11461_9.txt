I love this movie! Evil Dead has NOTHING in this movie! The Night of the Demons 2 and 3 is a total festival, but this is a classic. It's super cheesy and the acting is fine at best, but what more could you ask for from an 80s horror movie? Stooge has some of the best one-time phrases on this screen. (It's my favorite character) A lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favorite is the ending, unfortunately it has nothing to do with the main characters, when the old man eats his Halloween apples in a Pastel , and her throat is shattered from the inside out. The sound track is impressive. The scene with Angela dancing is totally creepy, especially after the strobe light comes on, and you can watch her jump from one part of the floor to the next with each sound of the camera's shutter clicking on the song being played. The makeup effects in this movie are pretty sweet; Angela gave me nightmares when I was a child. If you are the type of person who demands the perfection of your filming experience, you may want to give a pass to this. But, if you're like me, and you really dig all Halloween, the house enchanted with the clich√© of demons, then this is definitely a must.
