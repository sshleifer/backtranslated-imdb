I saw him at the Tribeca Film Festival, in the family section. I'm not sure if any of my children got the movie, but I must say it was a wonderful short film. <br /> <br /> 'Nostradamus and Me' is an interesting short film about hopes and fears. We all feel like growing up in the 1980s, which in turn extends to how my children feel today. So, we had Regan, today, we have Bush. Instead of Nuclear War, we have Terrorism. <br /> <br /> I really identified with the main character, and I went out with a 'Curehead' in high school myself. We all had the feeling that "nothing mattered" when we were 16, but it's great to see a movie where they discover that everything matters! <br /> <br /> Once again, I probably would not have put this in the family section ... there were too many curses for the younger children, but it was a wonderful and enjoyable movie to watch.
