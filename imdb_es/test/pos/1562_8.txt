Judith Ivey as the old cheating whore is incredible. Emily Grace the young one. It is innocent and exciting as you learn what is happening. Excellent address and camera. The story is dark and disturbing. The cast of support is good. It shows what happens and can happen with a bad patch. Great independent film. Little cast The rhythm is slow at first and then it moves well. A good movie to show your teenage daughter who wants to leave home early, on the open road and adventure. This movie, the movie has a low budget feel, but it works because of the short life and the areas in which these people move. Never again will I stop to rest without thinking about this movie and checking my tires before I leave.
