¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ I bought this movie for a dollar !!! Scottish science fiction film by Mark Stirton and according to The Making of (hysterical by the way) the production costs only $ 8000. Eight thousand !!! That would not pay even half a minute in Hollywood! However ---- This is a very funny movie. If you like rough things, then a whim waits for you. These are some tough characters with harsh voices and bad words. I did not care, but my girlfriend did it !! The actors do a good job and it's interesting to see people that I've never heard or seen before. It meant he had no idea who was going to die first. <br /> <br /> If you watch a movie because of its more recent visual effects, look at a Star Wars. The effects here are fine, but somewhat weak in space. But the monsters are very well made, although a bit predated. <br /> <br /> Stirton does an amazing job with not much and I'd love to see his version of a real Hollywood movie. At least it was not predictable and I almost fell off the chair when a guy tears his head off! Okay, it's a little derivation of other science fiction, but for this budget it's an incredible attempt and anyone who thinks that making a science fiction movie for 8 g is easy or does not know anything about the film industry. <br /> <br /> Good grades for a good movie, additional brands for working so hard, additional additional marks for a really interesting Making of. Here there is no standard bull, all production problems have become Lost in Mancha with only one film at the end. But why are there no comments? KEEP SCOTS!
