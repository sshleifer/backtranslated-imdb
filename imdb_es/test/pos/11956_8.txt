If I ever write movies or do them, I would like one of them to be like this. I enjoy the sense of humor and jokes contained in the game. This movie does stupid things without looking like it. The names of the places and characters are invaluable, Generic New York High School, Squid Calimari (George's sister), etc ... genius. I've seen this movie so many times because it was a staple of cable TV as I grew up, of course I did not get all the jokes back, but it was still funny. This movie is a classic without time.
