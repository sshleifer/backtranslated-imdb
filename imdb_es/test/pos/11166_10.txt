Great movie about a great man. Thomas Kretschmann is first class as in all his other films. I never would have imagined him as Pope John Paul. Speak volumes for the casting director. Why do they keep casting him as a German officer in the movies? And only came to universal attention after "the pianist"? Of course it looks so hot in uniforms. I know many girls drool over his beautiful face. But this guy is a great actor and has great potentials. If you do not believe me, go see "Stalingrad". I hope you have many excellent roles in the future with more diversity. Otherwise, what a heartbreaking waste of great talent.
