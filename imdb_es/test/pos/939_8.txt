Brilliant Australian movie ... A little slow at first, but once it gets going, you can not stop laughing. When I saw the film for the first time, I knew the plot vaguely, as I'm not sure many people know that this movie is based on a true story, and more in particular, the director and his mother (obviously the names have changed) ). I only knew this fact because the director is a friend of a friend of my family. When I saw the movie, somehow my stepmother kept it a secret that we were going to meet Matthew Newton after the screening ... What a good gentleman (except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex)! Brillian casting also with Sam Neill and others! A great reason to continue supporting the Australian film industry.
