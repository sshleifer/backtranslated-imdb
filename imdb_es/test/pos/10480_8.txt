If you find that the first 30 minutes of this movie are so slow that you wonder why you are watching it, do not give up. In addition, listening to the Danish language is a bit new for most Americans, who do not see or hear many Danish films. Anyway, as the film progressed, it improved more and more and the viewer is rewarded for his patience. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of the movie "Out Of Africa", this movie aroused my interest because it is based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the main character of that film. <br /> <br /> The food, Babette's party, was incredible. I am not a chef, but I was impressed! The way one interprets the story also varies, I guess depending on how much you read on this and your religious position. If it's the latter, the way you see the definition of "legalism" can affect the way you interpret this story. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a good movie, but do not look at this if you're on a diet. .
