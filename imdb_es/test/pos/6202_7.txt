I enjoyed this series, but I felt that everything was disappointed by the sound recording / mixing. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, they had to employ a large amount of what is called ADR, where the actors replace the original location sound with a new recording in a sound booth. <br /> <br /> The reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location, or because someone made a mistake somewhere in the sound production chain. . <br /> <br /> It would not be so bad if the ADR was done well, but sometimes it's just a distraction. Not only the ADR is the problem, the sound mix does not match the quality of the performances and the images. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what went wrong.
