I was happy to discover that at least now this movie is beginning to get the appreciation it deserves (just see those votes). No first class action like "Die Hard" or "Lethal Weapon", but something like a solid 7 out of 10: good script, good actors with active chemistry and a director who knows what he wants (unfortunately, this was the director Harlin's last good movie "Deep Blue Sea" managed to reach the status of "an OK roller coaster", but "Cutthroat Island, and especially," Driven "are deserved failures!) Personally I think the detour at the box office could having been the subject "Woman as an action star." Well, give it a shot, because Davis offers above-average performance, and, after all, this film does not focus so much on the "feminine." -on the side, but instead, in good deed, buddyism (Jackson, as a partner, is given a lot of space here, plus his share of action, and around a thousand murders!) the writer of " Lethal Weapon "and" The Last Boy Scout. " The last of which, as a film, is on many levels very similar to this ... the theme, the intelligent plot, also so good and so underestimated!) In general: if you have not seen it yet, do not you forget to rent it for the next quiet Saturday night!
