My opinion on the end. Bobby died at the hands of his stepfather. Mike had tried to get Bobby out. Only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. Bobby died ... Mike as a child survived creating an alternative ending in his mind ... about how Bobby went ... Mike made a plane that flew to Bobby. Children who are sexually abused and violent often create other whole worlds in their minds to survive. <br /> <br /> It was also great to see my old housing area. We called it San Jose Boulevard and I lived near where these houses were filmed. It was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses ... not in the studios ... It was my kitchen, my bedroom and my living room. And those hills ... we used to walk as children ... looking down on our little valley ... watching flashes of the bay. It was a true journey of nostalgia for me.
