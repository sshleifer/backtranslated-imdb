I really love action / adventure movies and this is one of the best. Of course, we love the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest, but it's the story that really counts. The best are somewhat feasible, but we can tolerate those who are a little "exaggerated" as in the action style of comics. The more twists and turns, the more extreme situations in which the heroes are involved and the most shocking moments of the film; The more we enjoy action / adventure fans. "In the line of fire" has ALL the necessary elements for an action thriller that roars. He has Clint Eastwood as a Secret Service agent close to retirement whose only moment of failure is after him. He has one of the most evil, despicable and maniac villains of John Malkovich, the kind where you can not wait to see him, "do your part". He has Rene Russo as the 'love interest'. It has twists and turns, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. It is extremely well run by the director Wolfgang Petersen and even has a score of the great Ennio Morricone. This is a true roller coaster of a thriller! Do not miss it!
