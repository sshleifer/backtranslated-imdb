I have tried to track The Age of Kings for many, many years. My theatrical life was filled with the actors of this series. At that time, in 1960, I could not follow everything, since I was working in the theater, a lot of night work. Now in retirement, I have a LONG TIME to have this and save it for me. Please, please can not be published on DVD, I would not care what it costs. I see that there are others out there who feel the same. What can we do to do this? Something as big as this should not be sent to oblivion. I have to write two more lines. OK, I can do it by saying that I want this series more than anything else in the world. Just to be able to see some of the best actors of our era performing the best words of our wonderful Shakespeare. Is not that enough? An uzmen
