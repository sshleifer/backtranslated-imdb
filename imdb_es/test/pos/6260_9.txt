`Shadow Magic 'recaptures the joy and awe of the first film audiences. It also shows the power of cinema in its capacity to bring the world closer, overcome cultural barriers and preserve for future generations. Certainly, anyone who really loves the art of the movie will enjoy this movie. It is a great first effort by the writer and director Ann Hu, who hopefully will have many films to follow.
