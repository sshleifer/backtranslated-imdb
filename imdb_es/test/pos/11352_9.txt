When I saw the film for the first time, I said to myself: "so that a film can be made like that". The beautiful and poetic love story of Wong Kar Wai captured me throughout and even after the movie. I must admit that this is one of the best love movies, perhaps the best of all, I've ever seen. The content and the form overlap perfectly. By observing secret love, we see the characters in limited frames that limit their movements and feelings. The beautiful camera angles and lighting make feelings and blues can be touched. I want to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee for their fantastic photography that creates the atmosphere for love. In addition, the music defines the sadness of love that is reproduced in the beautiful slow-motion paintings and shows the characters in a desperate mood. And, of course, the performances of the actors that make love so real. Eventually, all the elements of the film combine perfectly under the direction of WKW and give the audience the feeling called love.
