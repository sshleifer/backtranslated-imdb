Richard Cooper's 1991 documentary on Gary Cooper: "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" gives us a glimpse of the tremendous American star through his films and his life. Narrated by Clint Eastwood, the theme is definitely "Gary Coooper, American", as they take us through quick clips of his many westerns appearances, and "Meet John Doe", "Deeds Goes to Town" and "Sgt" scenes York. "The best part of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family, as well as the photos of his childhood, which show him as a beautiful blond boy with the sunny smile he would have all his life. There's also a hilarious Cooper clip on "The Jack Benny Show" coming back with the "Bird Dog" number, and Benny loses it. The documentary also briefly shows us his tumultuous relationship with Patricia Neal, which almost ruined their lives. <br /> Lacking a certain cohesion in this biography / retrospective: it jumps a lot and does not have images of the interview with Cooper, which would have added a lot. In addition, Clint Eastwood's narrative was described as discreet. boring and monotonous. Since Cooper himself used to be the loud, silent guy on the screen, we could have used a little animation. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, Gary Cooper was one of the most sensible men I have ever seen. He lived - they took a look at his early films, but it's not enough for this fan. That smile, those lips, that bone structure, he was handsome all his life, but in films like "Morocco" and "Desire", it's devastating. Instead of sitting through a scene from one of his worst performances, like Howard Roark in "The Fountainhead," he delivered a speech that he admitted to the author that he did not understand: a young, soft Cooper in a suit would have been a nice touch . This documentary, unfortunately, was definitely produced by a man.
