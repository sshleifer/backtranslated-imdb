Not knowing much about the commission of Truth and Reconciliation, I can only see this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late (recorded from the BBC2 earlier this year), but once I started I had to watch it until the end. <br /> <br /> The downside is that it is indeed a court drama. - It is never my favorite genre - but it is very well photographed (largely in supersaturated ocres) and it is well acted. Like a good novel, I could not leave it. At all times, I would have liked to see it in a cinema to do justice to music and photography. What happened to its premiere in theaters? I'm an admirer of Chiwetel Ejiofor since I saw him in Dirty Pretty Things, and Hilary Swank looks great in this, very feminine and sexy for a change (possibly out of place, but adds to the visual appeal of the film). <br /> <br /> This image deserves a wider audience than it seems to be receiving.
