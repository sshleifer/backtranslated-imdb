As a Circle around the human condition, 2001 begins at the beginning, jumps half and continues to the end, right where we started. Noting the weakness of the words in comparison with the image (s), Kubrick wisely dispenses with the dialogue, prefers the power and essence of the scenario and allows the public's intelligence to decipher. Or not, depending on the audience. <br /> <br /> A monolith in film history, 2001 is a high point of direction, execution and achievement. If you take into account the ambition of the film (a film especially) and the measure of success that the film achieved to that end, you can make a very solid argument, since this is the best of all movies. <br /> <br />
