This movie was great and I've been waiting for a long time. When it finally came out, I was really happy and I expected a 10 out of 10. It was great and it lived up to my potential. The performances were great on the part of the adults and the majority of the children. The only bad performance was of Milo himself. There was a problem that I found with this movie (and other similar ones). All the characters I wanted to live were being killed. In general, I give this movie an excellent 9 out of 10. Maybe we should select better people to kill next time, okay?
