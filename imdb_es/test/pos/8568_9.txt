I remember hearing about this movie and how it was heard in almost all the drive-in theaters here in Toronto. It is a group of girls who are not accepted by the other brotherhoods in their university, so they start their own group, and of course they call it H.O.T.S. It's a fun movie, which is simply full of nostalgia when driving! Lots of T-shirts, vans, fights and a match of football matches like no other! It has been compared to "Animal House", which is a good movie in its own right, but nothing compares to H.O.T.S. It has its own brand of fun and character. If you are looking for a classic T n'A movie, look no further, because H.O.T.S. The girls are to the rescue, the boom boom and everything!
