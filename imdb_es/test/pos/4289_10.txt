Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime, despite the betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is not a brutal Othello, in the context of modern England. Thus, little by little, a network of deceptions is being woven. And we are witnesses of cycles of jealousy and drunkenness, guilt and fornication. And so, the network of "separate lies" begins to fail and then rejoin. And life (and death) continues, despite the shining flame of husband's love and the deep despair and guilt that are intertwined in so many lives. How many deception networks will be shown in this growing tapestry? The impulse is to shore up reputations, careers and relationships in this most civilized corner of the world. Wilkinson offers an emotional performance, full of grace, discretion and decorum, and yet, of humanity, of those who have much to hide. Those who desire clarity and openness on the path to justice will be disappointed by the evil of so much deception. And yet, who among us does not have something similar to hide about their loved ones? However, the viewer may wonder if this website is destined to fall apart one day.
