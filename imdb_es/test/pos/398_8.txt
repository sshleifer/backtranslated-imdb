<br /> <br /> `The Last Frontier 'is a superior western who overcomes numerous shortcomings by weaving his story of trappers Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with the Army, particularly Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston (Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft). Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians, Jed, Gus and Mungo adapt to live "civilized" life inside a fort on the edge of the "last frontier." Jed, who has been raised by Gus, inspires and looks at the "elders" Gus and Mungo, and has an especially difficult time dealing with "civilization". His real problems begin after he feels strongly attracted to the colonel's wife, Corrina. Colonel Marston is a reckless man, who endangers everyone around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent. Corrina, a woman restrained by her position and sense of responsibility, loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for what he is. Caught in the middle is Captain Riordon, a brave and sympathetic man divided between his duty to the army, his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the possible disastrous consequences of the Colonel's imprudence. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that, in most cases, the weaknesses and strengths of "The Last Frontier" are EXACTLY the same elements (forget it of the insipid title and the old music)) <br /> <br /> First, the script. Almost all the subplots (in particular, the reckless Colonel) have done better elsewhere, but have rarely met with such eccentricity. Just when you THINK you know what will happen next, it will take off in a DIFFERENT direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: 'The Last Frontier' is a film 'Production Code' (in the past the word 'virgin' was taboo), it is very surprising that the adultery factor has been handled in such a mature and tolerant manner. He expected Jed or the Colonel's wife to reap some retribution for his sin. I was surprised and disappointed a bit that the film did not take advantage of that expectation to create a less predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Second, the casting. Maduro is at least ten years old, too old to play the role of Jed, the wild-eyed innocent raised in the forest. James Whitmore, who plays Gus, "the man who raised Jed" is actually five years younger than Mature. However, Mature is very endearing, playing a character who is innocent of civilization, but in no way is stupid. Although there were several actors who could have played the role at that time (in particular, Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), none could have played Jed better. Preston (also Junior of Mature) plays Colonel Marston, missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a motivated man. However, Preston perfectly captures the sense of honor that someone must have seen in Marston to promote such a reckless imbecile to the rank of colonel. Bancroft is a particularly astute choice like Corrina. Bancroft's dark hair has died of blond, and this achieves the same effect it had for Winona Ryder ('Edward Scissorhands') and Christina Ricci ('Sleepy Hollow'). I mean, I felt in conflict with the character without knowing exactly why; I think the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shadows. In addition, Bancroft has always projected a hardness that borders the hardness (although here the blonde hair softens it a little, however). This allows Bancroft, 24, to be face to face with Preston, 40, and Mature, 37; Yes, she could be a colonel's wife. Madison performs a careful balancing act like Riordan, handling a complex role and, sometimes, an uncomfortable dialogue. Playing a role similar to that of John Wayne in 'Fort Apache' Madison does a more skillful job. <br /> <br /> This movie has a "Silverado" camaraderie. That just makes it worth seeing. It also has memorable performances, beautiful settings and great action and direction. I just hope that there is a version of mailbox available (many have been lost), because this movie makes the most of that format.
