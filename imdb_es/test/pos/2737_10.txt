I have remembered this caricature for more than 50 years: what power of permanence it has! It was fun and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren had seen it. It is at the height of Winky Dink, another favorite. I was pleased to discover that one of the creators later worked at Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot for them that the cartoons for children of today do not have. The caricatures of today seem to drive the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed in bad or dangerous circumstances. While the first cartoons did not deal with the evil much, it was a much smoother and safer time, allowing us to develop our own talents and our character.
