Every criticism I have read so far seems to have lost a crucial point. Shakespeare wrote for accent and pronunciation as he did for nortenos in other works. The Scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of language and profoundly affects what is said and how it is taken. Then, listen again and notice the difference. The work is well done and the rhythm of the words is much better than that provided by people who use English received, educated and enunciated. I remember the time when a teacher from a school in Leicester, without knowing it, asked me, at age 14, to read a fragment of Walter Scott written in the tone of the border. I come from the border and when I read it as it should be read, it made all the difference.
