This has to be the funniest movie I've ever seen. Chritopher Guest is truly talented. He has a gift for humor. I almost died laughing. Actually, when I saw this in theaters, I considered leaving because the movie was so silly. But it's silly in a good way. It's funny-silly. And this is a very good combination. You will laugh from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> This fictional style movie follows a variety of characters competing in Kennel Club Dog Show. The cast includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and many more. <br /> <br /> This is a really fun movie that will make everyone laugh. Someone born without personality would laugh at this movie. It is presented in widescreen to give the image that is watching a real documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity. BEST IN SESSION: 5/5.
