LIFEFORCE is an extremely schizophrenic film, based on Colin Wilson's novel, The Space Vampires. The script ignores most of the concepts and structure of the novel (in fact, it is due more to the QUATERMASS series than to the novel), but the scenes from which it emerges are The novels are almost identical to those in the film. And speaking of the script, it must be one of the most unequal in the history of cinema, although it was written in chapters by several different people. Take, for example, Carlson, he disappears after the first scenes of the ferry, which led me to believe he was dead and then reappears in the middle of the film to explain the plot to the besieged British and this lack of attention by the writers. that spoils the movie And there are many other awkward scripts, like the heroes who return to London in a helicopter and do not realize that the zombies have been overcome by them until they fly over them. <br /> <br /> I could continue in a lot of these holes in the plot, but LIFEFORCE is really nice to watch as long as you do not use your brain. It's good to see a science fiction horror movie from a time when aliens were described as adorable creatures that children hid in their rooms so that unpleasant human adults would not lay hands on them. The special effects and the pyrotechnics are very good, there is a lot of action and tricks and LIFEFORCE has one of the most memorable aliens in the form of the space girl. When LIFEFORCE is mentioned in a conversation with men, it is always a race to say "Have you seen the alien in LIFEFORCE? You can suck the life force at any moment" It is not surprising to see the demographic data of the votes that this film is more popular with men than females <br /> <br /> "Do not worry, a naked girl can not escape from here" Can not she? Pity <br /> <br />
