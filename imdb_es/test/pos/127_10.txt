The previous critic, Claudio Carvalho, made a much better summary of the details of the plot of the film that I could. What I remember most is that it was so beautiful, in every way: emotional, visual, editorial, just magnificent. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that are wonderful to watch and also have emotional content. so that beauty is relevant, I think you'll be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art. <br /> <br /> On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give a 8.75. The only reason I forget 9 is that it is a piece of humor. If you're in the mood for a very artistic, very romantic movie, then it's a 10. Definitely I think it's a must, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so, in general, 8.75.
