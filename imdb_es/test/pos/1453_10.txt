This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s. Otto Preminger directed only four or five really good films and this is one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and the music of Elmer Bernstein is dynamite. From the initial titles (by Saul Bass) to the hysteria of the drug addict Frank who is getting cold, this is a fascinating movie! With Kim Novak (with a very good performance), Eleanor Parker (with a very bad performance), Darren McGavin as pusher of reptiles and Arnold Stang as a friend of Frank. Beware of bad impressions: this movie is in the public domain, so some copies are quite difficult.
