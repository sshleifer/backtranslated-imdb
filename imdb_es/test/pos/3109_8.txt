Wow, I'm learning fast enough that sometimes when you see a movie as a young man and then 20 years later you get a different vision, mainly because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was, what a great director he was and how much that made this film fly. All I can say is ... I really liked this movie because it touched an area that was parallel to my life: the lifelong friendship between two women. Can it ever exist? Well, in certain doses, yes ... and this movie was released a bit in ... "how". <br /> <br /> Being a young man with little life experience the first time I saw this so I focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part between the two. At that time, I had no idea that there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered that it existed ... and how that would affect their friendship. Through his men, his career, the decades that defined them. And realizing that one thing was still stronger than anything else ... their friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else could have done it. <br /> <br /> Then I got older, I studied the film a bit ... and I saw this. Go back to shoot with my best friend from the institute. We understand the 'rich' and 'famous' angle ... and we are still best friends ... but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece ... it can sometimes be seen as a bit corny ... a bit exaggerated in points (a bit on a level of 'Dynasty' and 'Dallas' for me ...) and I can honestly identify with the "teddy bear" scene because we share a bear that means a lot more than a fun stuffed toy through our tests and tribulations with men / races, and others ... so it's not as exaggerated as it seems ...! As many have already said, seeing Meg Ryan and Matt Latanzzi and Dack Rambo and David Selby are great in this piece of 1981. This is a good "girl" movie!
