We all know fragments of Gulliver's travels. Small people, yes, of course. Liliputians. Giants too, some of us can remember. Some may remember that the word yahoo comes from here. That's where most people stop. <br /> <br /> Swift's book is ubiquitous in school libraries. That was when I read it for the first time, and there were many people who read it for the last time. It is treacherously written lightly, like many of the old adventure books. The children can read it. Still, it's dripping with satire, black and uncompromising. That's something that I think most screen writers forget when they adapt this movie. <br /> <br /> However, this movie remembers. Our hero, Ted Danson, gives a credible and serious performance as the man adjusted to the world who has been thrown into mysterious countries like ours. Gulliver's trips criticize everything. Theists, scientists, government, common people, ethnicity, humanity itself. Few are saved, and most of the satire is just as cool today. <br /> <br /> Although very faithful to the story, the film also dares to add new angles, all of which work very well. The writer of the screen deserves all the credit for achieving a good balance between time and activity (it is not boring, that is). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​go far beyond a television movie. With some marketing, this movie would have performed well at the box office. All the fantastic worlds that Gulliver visits are well done, explained in detail and often very funny, like Swift's book. <br /> <br /> All the actors are professionals, since this is a British production. Mary Steenburgen stands out, along with Dr. Bates from James Fox, the chilling and cruel doctor who, like Nurse Ratched, only wants the best for the patient. <br /> <br /> So, a modest proposal, if you ever have the chance To get this movie, do it. It is a real pleasure.
