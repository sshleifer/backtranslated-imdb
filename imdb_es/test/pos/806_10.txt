This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one. "THE HOLLOW" is a great novel by Hercule Poirot and the turn at the end deceives most people. I am delighted that this film has remained completely true to the novel. There was no important difference he could detect. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced in the story before the novel. The performance was excellent, and the music, as usual, was an incredible quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles. In no other film I've seen so far, Poirot has been interpreted so brilliantly! Congratulations to the producers: they have made a film that, along with many others, I will appreciate for a long time!
