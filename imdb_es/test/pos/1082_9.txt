It would seem a fact, but if a spectator forgets the context, he runs the risk of losing the opportunity to enjoy. <br /> <br /> It's easy to go to the tent, from the heights of the 21st century, to the styles and prices of the Great Depression; but the intelligent spectator will remember that magic word, "context", and will understand better and, therefore, will enjoy "Accidents will happen". <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ronald Reagan showed himself again as an attractive and pleasant guy, and again he gave a correct performance. <br /> <br /> A criticism earlier said that Gloria Blondell played the nasty wife role, but that was wrong: she plays the award employee who is in love with Reagan's character, Eric Gregg, but stays away while married . <br /> <br /> Gloria was cute. Not as beautiful as her sister, Joan, she was still attractive and a good actress. Perhaps his appearance that Joan was a detriment to having a more successful career, and certainly is our loss. <br /> <br /> Sheila Bromley was Mrs. Gregg, and she played well. <br /> <br /> Other actors include Dick Purcell, and the great Earl Dwire was able to play something besides an evil cowboy. <br /> <br /> Once again, most of the players never achieved the status of "family name" that many of them deserved, but by God they gave good performances here, in a story that is still current.
