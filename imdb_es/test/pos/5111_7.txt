This was easily one of the rarest of Ernest's films, especially when it came to production design. What happened to the pink guard uniforms? Unfortunately, this movie probably destroyed the Ernest series, turning the series into a direct video series. However, Jim Varney gave one of his best performances when playing Nash, his criminal alter ego. One wrong step in the series, but it was not so bad in most aspects (Electro Man's routine was classic).
