I think this movie has it all. It has really great music that I can never get out of my head. It has beautiful characters. IT'S REALLY funny (you know, the kind that will crack on the floor and continue repeating the funny parts every day for three weeks). Despite the bad performance, the bad history and the bad story (about the cops going after a robot), it's really great. It's one of those movies that you and your whole family can see, get together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy and watch it twice more. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun parts, like when Kurt was trying to get Edison's attention, gave him his finger and then threw a paint gun at him so they could play the paintball. For that part, I kept saying "Remember, remember?" To my cousins ​​who saw it and showed them what happened. There was also a really fun part when Edision came running into the room and Kurt was there (just before they fought) and Kurt was talking about his "strange dream" and what "Superman" was like. I LOVE that part, although it's been a while since I saw it, so I do not remember that part. Everything the actors said was fun, as Kurt says: "I adore you, like a GOD!" to the robot. <br /> <br /> Although there were some bad things, in general it was a GREAT movie. Man, I can not stop laughing. I wish I had that movie. );
