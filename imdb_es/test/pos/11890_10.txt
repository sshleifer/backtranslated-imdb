I've seen this movie more than once. Actually, The Godfather was one of the best feature films I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> There was a great cast, Jennifer Tilly, Faye Duanway, Brad Dourif and Damian Chapa who really shone as a true star in this part of Kilo. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie was filmed for less than two million dollars. I have seen films filmed for 33 million that can not be compared with the quality and the production value. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, why are not you getting offers and more movie jobs? EXCELLENT WORK!!!!!!!!!! I can not wait to see the sequel, and I hope you have the same action. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly has made a classic cult character with Sabeva. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa moves with coldness in every scene very similar to the movie stars of the 40s and 50s. So tired of watching these non-charismatic actors like Ben Stiller get all these movies when there is talent like this one that has something to show. A great movie. <br /> <br /> GO GO GO KICK SOMETHING BUT IN SALES THE GODFATHER !!!
