My friends and I rented this movie simply to satisfy a friend who was willing to rent it despite having no idea what it was about. We all thought it would be like "a Canadian American cake", but when we saw it we were completely surprised, we all fell silent throughout the film and we loved it! He did not look anything like American Pie and had an argument that teenage girls would surely love (seeing that the boy is defeated by him at the end), after that night it became my favorite movie, not only because of his plot, but because of the actors. and the great writing. There was not a moment when I thought it was incredible. Everything is very realistic and easy to relate to anyone who lives in a small city with few possibilities. I love this movie and I would recommend renting it the next time you have a chance, it's worth it.
