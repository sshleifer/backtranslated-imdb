Let me clarify that. This is not a "good movie", but I'm so happy to be out there, I'm so glad I saw it, and because of the role it plays in my DVD collection, it's sublime. It is the last game of PG-13, it is the university as we imagine it will be when we are freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it could be happening on Mars. It's so healthy that even when you try to get dirty, it would not make your grandmother feel uncomfortable. Seeing it requires so little sophistication (in fact, thinking too much about what is happening will make your appreciation of this work difficult), it makes me feel that I am 12 years old again. And that kind of experience is worth more than $ 9.99.
