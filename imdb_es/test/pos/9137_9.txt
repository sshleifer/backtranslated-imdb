Everyone likes the memorable movie of theft, created in a cold way. Alain Delon provides the antihero, Melville provides the great, and a handful of other great talents (Yves Montand, Gian Maria Volonte and Andre Bourvil, mostly) arrives to add an attractive and attractive film ... <br /> <br /> ... with very little dialogue. This is great, because a certain aspect of the genre tends to be a great dialogue that involves the experts and their different repaired. This movie, however, could be seen with the sound completely off and not be lost too much. Not to mention that the sound is bad, oh no, the jazzy soundtrack and the clear audio that captures the small movements make the patient's slow and patient deliberation very convincing. <br /> <br /> What is also really good about this movie is that color cinematography is quite fantastic. Generally when it comes to cinematography, black and white films tend to stand out in my mind, but this movie has some very strong and beautiful images that make the film a pure visual pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
