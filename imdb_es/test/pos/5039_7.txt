Angels are a bit like an American obsession, but they're often pretty boring. They are the messengers of God, and also bow angels are great warriors (Lucifer is the strongest and best seen until he was expelled from heaven). <br /> <br /> So, what happens if you do not believe in him? anything, much less the angels and you are sent to investigate a story of angels, only to find one with wings and an attitude less than angelic. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's what America needs, being a puritan is different from being good. Michael is a rude, obnoxious, womanizing messenger who will fulfill your wishes and make you worry enough about the world that will touch you. <br /> <br /> Funny, but not so much, touching but not overly Sentimental, intelligent without being intelligent ... it's just a good simple and small comedy. Watch a lazy Sunday afternoon.
