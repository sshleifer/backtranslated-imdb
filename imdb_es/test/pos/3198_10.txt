I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was just brilliant; the saving grace of what was a forgettable sage for a simple and bad grouping of films. <br /> <br /> A perfect use of intense black and pure white, with an excellent and simple animation, this is simply the story of a Cat chasing the moon. Fun, charming and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics and anyone else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your city, look at it. This short is worth the price of the ticket.
