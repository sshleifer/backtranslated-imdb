I saw this series after having seen the Naked Gun movies. I found it much better than the movies, and I thought the movies were great! This series literally hits the television before the next word game, the gag in sight or the funny situation (the place of the wicker night, the flamenco club). I do not think I've laughed so much in a television series in my life, even after watching the movies first and, therefore, knowing some of the jokes. I think it's a pity that there have only been six episodes, but I agree that writers would find it very difficult to maintain this level of comedy for more episodes. In general, the series is a must for those who like word games, bad jokes and jokes in sight.
