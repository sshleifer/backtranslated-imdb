"Boy Next Door" is a hilarious game of male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most feature films can not match. Excellent performances, excellent camera work and editing: this short is a classic from beginning to end. Congratulations to Travis Davis for fulfilling his double role as director and star. It's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a pleasure to see Richard Moll again. If you thought that all you could do was play "Bull," the sheriff in "Night Court," think again. This gem of a movie shows the brilliant writing of Stephen Garvey. Remember that name. Forget about Charlie Kaufman, Steve Garvey is the true king of quirky comedy.
