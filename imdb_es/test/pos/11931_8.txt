It did not sound like it was from a fantasy movie. The movie is dark, with dark shades. The soundtrack is too stimulating to the point where it was introduced into the visual elements. I'm sure they were pointing to something militant, but it just did not work out. The scene in which Astin tries to escape is a perfect example. Why does it sound like the Goonies? There is no comedy, there is no brightness for this! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is great, and the acting is also very good. I enjoyed everyone's performances. It is available in Netflix online viewing. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, but write your own soundtrack !!
