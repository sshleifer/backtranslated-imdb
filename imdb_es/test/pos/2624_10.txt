This movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best mysteries of television movies I've seen. The acting is excellent. I've seen it twice and I'm still confused in some places. I would love to have a copy so I can play certain parts over and over again. I am interested in buying a copy of this movie, but I can not find it anywhere. I wonder if anyone has any suggestions on how to find it. I've tried e-bay, Amazon.com, Internet searches and I'm completely frustrated. I have not seen it in Turner Classic Movies, nor in American Movie Classics, and I have even put flyers in our community asking if someone has a copy.
