Jon Cryer returns to his role as a neurotic man in Two and a Half Men, which he perfected in this series. He longs to have a good relationship with a girl as his co-worker has developed, and the tet-a-tet between him and his girlfriend's best friend is pretty fun. Then they realize that they are attracted to each other and begin to leave. In one of the funniest lines of TV EVER, I think in the final episode, he and his partner are arguing that he wants to propose to the girl. <br /> <br /> Your partner prepares you for the moment by suggesting: "What is the worst that can happen?" She says no. <br /> <br /> Armed with a newly discovered optimism, he proposes his final date. Dinner. To which she responds, <br /> <br /> "GOD, no!" <br /> <br /> I laughed so much I cried.
