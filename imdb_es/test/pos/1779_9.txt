'Identity?? . . . . I am part of what surrounds me and I separated from them and is able to make those differences clearly that allow us to have an identity and what is inside our identity is all that has happened to us "(Ntozake Shange qtd in" Fires in The Mirror "). <br /> <br /> Pieces such as the Decalogue V used to intimidate me, I felt that if I accepted them, I would be compromising something, what I thought before is really not worth getting in. I understand what naturalism is trying to do. I experienced a tangible katharsis, and one that came to exist little by little, and another that is still alive, that I still have to keep in mind, it is still working inside of me. <br /> <br /> The film does not It was comprehensive, per se, it is not necessary to say that the death penalty is a bad thing, there are certainly evil people, if they should die or not for another movie, what Decalogue shows is that there are good and beautiful people who kill others. people when their society and their impulses are fine dials raise them. <br /> <br /> The 'science' of naturalism is what has helped me appreciate the Decalog V. It is not worth writing the space to explain why he had not told me before, but now I see the value of making art. so to 'make' people, or maybe get people to do something. <br /> <br /> There is a method for Lazar's commitment to him. . . light. Much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect. This should not be a very strange idea: after all, how much of respectable science does not gain any sense in hindsight. I grimace when I say it, but naturalism seems much more productive and much less nihilistic when I have the power to say to myself: "This ruin, this process, this natural process, makes me want to counteract the system". <br /> <br /> I do not believe that Naturalism is painting an apocalyptic portrait of humanity, telling us to give up our powdered wigs and go to the forest. Instead, I think it's the cataloging of tests and experiments, which, of course, we're free to ignore. We can ignore everything we want, if we want to give the naturalists more corpses to bury them. <br /> <br /> Surely, despite their specifically designed aesthetics without sympathy for the possible and catastrophic fate of their characters, they are passionate about readers' inaction and scriptural snobbery. I see the delicious risk in the hope that the audience will understand what should be done with what they see. As mentioned, there is danger in those desperate to see their destiny immortalized in stone. There is a danger that hope disparages the natural because it does not correspond to its vision of the world. <br /> <br /> And I do not think that the "hopefuls" have to be rich or lucky. I have not seen it, but it seems that the American Beauty movie demonstrates the insufficiency of the circumstances as a provider of vision or comfort. There are ascetics and gluttons, as well as beggars who wonder where their humanity is within themselves, who suffer because they can not find anything to separate them from their landscape. <br /> <br /> Landscapes can be portrayed in a powerful and beautiful way, but in reality, landscapes are not represented. They change, clearly and dramatically, but only by a large set of natural laws over which no one has power. But you can not change by yourself.
