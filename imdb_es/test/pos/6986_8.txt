It opens with your cliché ship too long flying through space. All I could think of at this time was "Spaceballs" and hoping there would be a sticker on the back that said "We do not break for anybody". The film then shows some cryogenic freezers with the narration of Vin Diesel. I've always thought that his voice sounded great since I saw Fast and the Furious. Since I discovered that I was a criminal, I thought the movie was going to be a cliché. Was. It was very cliché and fate seemed to be against them at all times. Black out every 22 years. Luck them, they land on that day. The aliens can only be in the dark, hey, it's a solar eclipse. As much as I thought it was too easy and just a cliché, the film spread and kicked the biggest @ss. I even went out and bought a copy of Pitch Black after seeing it. I really can not wait for Riddick's chronicles.
