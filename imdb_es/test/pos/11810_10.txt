For all the viewers who have seen 'The Cure' would agree with me in this comment that it is an excellent and very moving film. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro prove their star status in this film, along with Dexter's mother (Mazzello) Annabella Sciorra. <br /> <br /> When I first saw The Cure on TV, I did not know what to expect, but as I watched this masterpiece, it soon became clear what it was about. Dexter, an 11-year-old boy who is plagued by AIDS, sits in his garden playing with his toys when one day he meets his neighbor Eric, who at first is a bit uncomfortable for the two children, but they soon became good friends . <br /> <br /> During the movie, I kept asking myself what would happen to the two children, as they made me think. I wondered how the hell they would get to New Orleans sitting in a doorway with a cracker underneath and pulling an inflatable crocodile behind. There were other great scenes throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> But the part that came to me was the part where Dexter's health began to deteriorate. You just could not help but wonder if I would succeed, but in the end you will discover it. I thought that in the first joke they played, that Dexter was really dead, obviously he was not, silly. But when they play the third, something goes very wrong. Dexter does not laugh or show any kind of laughter. At that moment, the victim of his joke soon announced that poor Dexter had died. In that part I lost it. I rolled my eyes, and from that scene I was crying. You only have to. As the end approaches, you begin to understand the loss of Eric and then the film ends on a good note with the Dexters' shoe floating slowly down the river. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was excellent. It has laughter, adventure, emotion and sadness, etc. When you put that in a blender, you get an excellent one, you should watch the movie. Peter Horton has done a great job directing this film and I think it is undoubtedly one of his best. But for now, I'll try to find this movie on DVD, if it exists. Once again, a great movie that will take you to an exciting restaurant.
