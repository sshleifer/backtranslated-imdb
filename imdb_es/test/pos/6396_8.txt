My wife and children is a good and fun series that really shows the worries and problems that happen most in the best families. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle (dad) is a man who is always trying to stop his children from doing teen things like partying, drinking, loving or making love. When they do something wrong, he is there to correct them (by the way he loves to do serious penalties) <br /> <br /> Janet 'Jay' Kyle (mother) has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband . She understands that her children are teenagers and like to do "wrong" things, unlike what Michael does. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle 'Jr' is a dumb guy who believes in everything other people say. At the beginning of the series, he is a great guy and tries to be like his father, but lately, I do not know why, he becomes a very dumb guy and starts to be a troublesome guy. At the end of the series, he falls in love with Vanessa and becomes a father, or should I say, a foolish father who does not do anything right. <br /> <br /> Kady Kyle is a typical teenager who loves parties, kisses and drinking. She has many problems with her parents because they invade her privacy too much. She has a boyfriend named Tony who is Catholic and is afraid of everything, so we can not understand what makes him go out with him. I can remember an episode in which they are prepared to have sex, but Michael Kyle scares Tony by saying that sex is very dangerous and deadly, so he decides to take care of himself until he marries. <br /> <br /> I summarize that this is the best series of my life and I still see it every day after 3 years, so I recommend it to all of you, mainly teenagers.
