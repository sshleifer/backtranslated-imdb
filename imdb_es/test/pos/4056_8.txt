The first time I saw "Signs of Life" on PBS was an American Playhouse presentation. It is a wonderfully written set production with excellent performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an old naval builder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast, which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker, gives his characters a remarkable clarity and substance. <br /> <br /> The direction is subtle and effective. I have seen this movie several times over the years and would recommend it a lot. A beautiful piece of cinema.
