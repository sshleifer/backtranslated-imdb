This movie opened a lot of ground and, in general, receives much less credit than it deserves. It touches a subject that is always present in our daily life, but that is seen as a phenomenon so common that it does not deserve discussion. This phenomenon is that of the caregivers (whether doctors or, as in "Promise Rota", a high level social worker) who abuse their position to harm those who must protect. <br /> <br /> In Broken Promise, Patty Clawson and her family are abandoned by their parents; but they are soon picked up by the local police. Faced with the prospect of foster care, Patty begs a young social worker to keep her with her brothers and sisters. This social worker approaches a main member of another department, but his request is denied. <br /> <br /> Parcels are assigned to households to separate households, following the prevailing views of the day and ensuring a "clean break". But it is this event, the "broken promise" that gives the film its name, which causes the dramatic tension that will continue throughout the film. Angered by the apparent betrayal of the Young Social Worker, Patty Clawson flees from the foster home to which she has been sent. <br /> <br /> Faced with the difficult task of finding your family in a climate where the ideal is seen. a complete separation from the past; she does the only thing she can to find out his whereabouts and enters the office of the Chief Social Worker to steal the case file. <br /> <br /> Arrested shortly after discovering that he has become a dangerous enemy. Furious at the shame this little girl caused her and her department, the Chief Social Worker decides to use her power and authority to destroy her; something that legally is quite capable of doing. <br /> <br /> --------------- <br /> <br /> This issue, from the caregivers harm to Clients, is relatively taboo. Certainly, there has been very little discussion in the films, since few directors want to go the way that caregivers would cause harm. <br /> <br /> I think this movie plays a very important role in raising awareness. of this kind of thing. The case described is not only plausible, but has probably happened many times before to many other children around the world. This film is fundamental to changing public opinion in order to get rid of the laws that protect harmful people like the Main Social Worker in "Broken Promise". <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Broken Promise. It is especially suitable for social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors and other caregiving professions. It is an avoidance lesson that should be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> ----------- <br /> <br /> Regarding the performance in "Broken Promise". "Melissa Michaelsen plays an excellent role as Patty Clawson, especially in films like this credibility is critical.If the viewer did not identify with Patty's character, the whole message of the film would be in danger." It is unfortunate that Melissa still does not act on Today's films, since her performance in "Broken Promise" shows that she had an exceptional talent.
