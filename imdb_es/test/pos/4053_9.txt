As with so many modern movies from the United States, there must be a supernatural element in the plot, but if you let it pass, this is a story with a lot of charm and a kind heart encased in a crab shell. <br /> <br /> They present us with the scene of a city in an economically depressed area struggling to find something to be happy about. The character of Beau Bridges is really against an increasing family, a null bank balance and a brother-in-law who has sold himself to a large chain of businesses that he hates in secret, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose. . D'Onofrio finds that his rather shallow Bubba lifestyle is overwhelmed by having to take care of his "blessed" little brother, Joey, and is anxious to escape the chains of this town of Hick. His boss's business is closing (much against his will) due to the lack of new clients and he is harassed by his father's memories as the tension increases towards his own attempt at self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Joey, who seemed to personify the curse in their lives, is lost at sea, believed to be drowning, in a strange accident. Its miraculous restoration by the Portuguese trawlers whose ship they had just built and launched (perhaps as a symbol of an angelic crew), is the signal they have been waiting for and they all decide to give life one last shot of the dice. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful melancholic mood throughout this work that stood out for keeping our attention as brilliantly as "The Shipping News". There are also other parallels with later work, which leads one to suspect a touch of a new version. I like the "Signs of life" for its simpler, less ingenious story and the stellar performances of the actors who work in their craft instead of being seen as stars.
