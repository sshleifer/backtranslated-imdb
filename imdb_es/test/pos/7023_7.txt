Jennifer Gray seems the most unlikely of the romantic tracks and that is probably the reason why this beloved movie is a sure success. Everything is fine doing a version of Montagus and Capulets with sweeteners like the dance and the Jewish society of Schadenfreude. Tropes were thrown at the Jewish family, but there usually has to be an X Factor. <br /> <br /> Swayze probably makes this movie safe. his robust movement and post-Travolta temperament, but the teenager Penelope Pitstop conquers him and manages to conquer the dream of the impressionable market. The super (dated? Maybe 'immortalized') helps the soundtrack and, of course, the cunning of placing the film in a place away from everyday life delights the fantasy. 7/10
