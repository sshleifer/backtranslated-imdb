I loved this series, and I was very sad to see it work. Yes, it is Christian and traditionally also. It's about some difficult problems, as the other critic points out, but I think it depends on your point of view on these issues, and as a teenager who grew up and now as a mother, I was very happy to see a television series that was Clean and Well, frankly, wonderful! I, unlike the other critic, encouraged me to see how they dealt with the condom treatment. Instead of listening to the typical washing of the condoms, they showed that the son was really working to be chaste and applied it to his later relationships, which were pure and divine because of this, and much safer because of that (100%! ). <br /> <br /> After seeing this complete series, you feel extremely attached to all the characters of the family and outside it (once they settle down more permanently), and the moral values ​​they teach in each episode have no price. I thought that Touched by an Angel (made by the same producer) was cheesy here and there (although I liked it in general), but this series, in my opinion, was much better done, had better performance and was also more interesting. . It was good for the whole family and was interesting for the whole family, which was a great advantage. The family was not outstanding, they had their own faults, but in the long run they did the right thing and you saw them grow, change and fight like any real family. It was my favorite show at that time and it will always be near the top of my list, I hope it comes out on DVD!
