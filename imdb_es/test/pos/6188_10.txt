<br /> <br /> There's something about watching a movie in a good old movie theater that adds a huge appeal to each image. Fortunately, I was able to see at the Film Forum in New York City a couple of comedies by Ernst Lubitsch during his tribute of three weeks to the legendary director. The double feature I attended was a projection of Lubitsch's comedy in 1938, Bluebeard's Eighth Wife and the previous classic code Design for Living, none of which I had seen before. Everything I read about Design for Living praised the film, but I could not find a good review anywhere of Bluebeard's eighth wife. Leonard Maltin did not like it. The video also gave the comedy a low rating. Your IMDB score was not complementary. Pauline Kael (not a big surprise) criticized the film in its scathing critique. So, when I went to the city that day I was hoping to enjoy the Blue Beard Eighth Wife alone and I love the Design for Living completely. The Eighth wife of Bluebeard (shown for the first time) began, when the eccentrics that populate the cinema took their seats and the music of the thirties diminished. 'Adolph Zukor presents Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper in the Eighth Wife of Ernst Lubitsch Bluebeard', said the title card. Then the image opened with a hilarious scene: Cooper wants to buy a pair of pajama tops, but he does not want any part of the bottom part! He gets into a dispute with the employee, who seeks the help of his superiors, and it seems that there is no end to the discussion. Enter Claudette Colbert, one of the most beautiful, charming and talented personalities of the cinema of the thirties. 'I'll take the bottom', she kindly intercedes. And there you may have the best comedies of inflated threads, "a nice meeting." The movie maintained my interest beautifully. I found myself laughing almost constantly. When Colbert discovers, just before he takes a family portrait, that his future boyfriend has been married seven times, the whole theater became hysterical. When you negotiate money immediately after overcoming your commotion, the laughter (which has not yet ceased) intensifies. And Edward Everett Horton also drew some funny reactions from the script. When Cooper draws inspiration from Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, when disciplining his wife by slapping him, I could not control my laughter when she slapped him back. And the drunken scene with the scallions is one of the funniest comic scenes of Claudette Colbert. The best comedic moment of the film came when Colbert classified a boxer to "teach a lesson to her husband". In a pure and simple way, hit the wrong man, instead of putting your friend David Niven in a cold sleep. He wakes up when Cooper arrives. In order to cover up the situation, Colbert, in a moment of strong sensuality, brings her fist to Niven, asks: "Where did that man hit you? Here? Here? Here?" and then BAM! It hits again! The film was wonderful, from start to finish it was a perfect delight.I also loved Design for Living, although I dare say that I think that by pure laughter and entertainment, Bluebeard's Eighth Wife was the best It's a bit of a charm to see a vintage movie on the big screen, and in the presence of others laughing, one feels more comfortable doing it himself, maybe that's why I felt what I felt about the Octave. Bluebeard's wife.
