Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> The film adaptation of the Thomas Mann novel by Luchino Visconti is visually, if not philosophically, true to its origin (Britten's opera offers a more faithful reading of the struggles of the apolonies. Dionysians who consume the aged writer). Without a doubt, it is one of the most beautiful films ever made. <br /> <br /> In the Visconti version, the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story. Never has Venice been more beautiful and attractive, more decadent and more ephemeral. If you have read the novel, it is as if the descriptions of its pages come alive. Dirk Bogarde gives an outstanding performance as Gustav von Aschenbach. Although it has very little dialogue, it conveys the bitterness, the awakened passion and, finally, the unfortunate yearning of Aschenbach through facial expressions alone. Bjorn Andresen, the young actor who plays Tadzio, the beautiful object of Aschenbach's desire, was launched perfectly. He also plays the role with facial expressions and gestures. The character of Tadzio is fundamental to the story, so any actor in this role should be worthy of inspiring passion and desire. Visconti, with her incredible eye for beauty, knew exactly what she was doing. And changing Ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on Gustav Mahler, and then using the music of Mahler, especially the Adagietto of the 5th Symphony, was another brilliant hit. Although I had read Mann's story before the film, the music of Mahler and Death in Venice will always be intimately linked in my mind. Like the disturbing images that appear throughout the film, especially the last one of Ashenbach that dies on the beach while Tadzio walks slowly towards the sea. <br /> <br /> One day, this movie will be released in widescreen format on DVD and visual splendors completely restored for us.
