A more classic performance by Maniratnam and his team. You can be proud to show this film at all film festivals because it has everything you need to name it as "a classic of all time". The war and its impacts on Sri Lanka through the eyes of a ten year old girl is the film, but the scenes and circumstances surely not be expected. Madhavan is no wonder it is one of the best players in the country, you can always add beauty and unique identity for the role, and real courage it takes to be the father of three children when it is considered a child dreamed of a Glamorous personality in the industry. The music of AR Rahman makes the film special for lovers of melodies. Above all, the story and the way it is told make it the best movie of recent times.
