With a little wine, some friends and good humor, I had a great time watching this movie. I especially enjoyed the performance of Jilon Ghai (as "Randy"), which was a kick in the pants! His scenes with Charity Rahmer ("Michelle") were tremendously funny. I would not want it to come to me, but it was great to see "Randy" try to score with "Michelle" and even better to see the results! Of course, the girls in the movie are also very funny to watch. And, a friend of mine showed me the problem of PLAYBOY that had Pilar Lastra as the playmate of the month. She is definitely a looker. All in all, this movie fully fulfilled its purpose, which was to entertain us in a light and carefree way.
