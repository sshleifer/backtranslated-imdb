I love this movie ... it can make me laugh! = ^ _ ^ = What is a bit hard to do. This movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations of all time. It does not deform the characters like other movies. Everyone is in the character and they have a role to play! <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Buster and Babs going downstream after a flood (courtesy of Buster), Plucky going on a trip with Hamton (fun things), Elmyra running around torturing animals (like custom), Fifi is still in love with an autograph and Shirley and Fowlmouth go to the movies. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I did not like the Buster and Babs segmented that, although they had some remarkable dialogues and jokes. I have to say that the parts of Plucky and Hampton 'Vacation' were the best! Hamton's family is HILARIAN! I especially like Uncle Stinky. Fifi at the hotel was also very funny. I love the cameos of the actor during this scene. : D <br /> <br /> Probably the most famous part of this movie, again IMHO, is when Fowlmouth and Shirley are in the movies ... LOL! You have to see it to appreciate it! And when Hamton and Plucky go through the tunnel to make a wish ... :) <br /> <br /> Although this movie moved slowly during the Buster / Babs parts, the rest is pure gold! I rate this movie 8/10. Show this to your children one day ... or even to yourselves - LOOK AT THIS MOVIE! You will not regret.
