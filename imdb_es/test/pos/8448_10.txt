Once again, I have read all the comments posted here and I agree with the intelligent many, but I totally disagree with those who think that it was / is Hokum. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that nuclear is the only energy that we have left, unless our governments (federal and state) increase the subsidies thinking that homeowners will use photoelectric cells on their roofs. Many attractive and expensive homes in Southern Calfifornia are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy in the sun. I live in a loft, which is exposed to full sunlight on its roof all day. I barely use the air conditioning, I'm sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees colder. We have been blessed with the "dry" heat in this part of the country. I'm from the Gulf Coast of the USA. UU., So I know the humidity ....... <br /> <br /> That said, I found that "China Syndrome" is a compelling film about what COULD go. wrong, if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear plants. I think there are enough comments posted here to illustrate those who still fear like the plague: THEY ARE safe. TMI is still online ... <br /> <br /> Director James Bridges carefully guides this plot (by Mike Gray-T S Cook) to create suspense and for a very interesting film. All the roles were well interpreted: Jane Fonda ("Kimberly Wells"), Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell ") and producer Michael Douglas (" Richard Adams ") are excellent in their roles, as well as the rest of the cast. I also loved that there was no score, it was very interesting to glimpse the reality behind the scenes of the television industry, that should not be surprising, Dan Rather is currently suing CBS, and I hope he wins. Donald Trump says "he's a loser" Trump, who cares? "Tiberius1234" posted a very good comment here, I agree, it's my opinion that a "nuclear" evaporates, the spill is much better than living in a world that has been wasted, and becomes "Blade Runner" and / or "Solyent Green." Stay away from your video games for a couple of hours and watch this movie "dated" 't), and get a little education about nuclear energy, I recommend it to the whole family ...
