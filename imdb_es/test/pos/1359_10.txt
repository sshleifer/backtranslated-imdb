Someone says that this anime could be offensive to girls ... not really. Shameful situations are fun; The first time I saw this series was in the video store, the people around me started to laugh, no matter age or gender. A teacher said that to guarantee someone's attention in a book, the beginning should be entertaining and the end should not be obvious just by reading the last page. During the first minutes of the series, the child is hit by a car. During the last moments of the series, the same car appears. The episodes had a moving and fun ending, especially the last one. I do not regret buying these series.
