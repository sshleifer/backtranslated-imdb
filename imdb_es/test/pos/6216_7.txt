This educational show focused on emotions, interactions and relationships. It was produced at ABC's Detroit branch and syndicated in 90 markets across the country. Last week, Detroit Public TV had a 1-1 / 2 hour clip show as part of their engagement campaign. Wow, the memories that came back! While I was remembering the program, there were segments that I had forgotten but that I instantly remembered as soon as they started ("Hot Fudge HOLY MOLEY!", Detective Tomato and the pies on his face). <br /> <br /> For more information about the public television special, do a search for "Concha de atcha caliente con chocolate de chocolate"
