This is a movie that is much more enjoyable than its rating of 7 suggests. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, with much of the excesses and laziness of VALLEY polished a bit for the public of 1959. Like this last film, both are about three young people they are in the cinema. Fast track to success, although this time it is in the publishing world instead of in the entertainment industry (although one of the ladies of THE BEST OF TOTHING has the aspirations of Broadway). <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Hope Lange entering the company for her first day of work. She is assigned to the hard-as-nail boss, Joan Crawford, who appears in her first supporting role in decades. Despite how unpleasant Crawford seems, Lange is determined not to give up, to achieve it in this job. And, over time, she quickly climbs from secretary to editor. At the same time, her two new roommates also try to rise in rank, one through the stage and another through a relationship with a rich playboy. Like VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, they all have their ups and downs (mostly low), but by the end of the movie there is some hope that at least some of them will succeed, mistreated and bruised, however. <br /> <br /> In this film, men are mostly pigs. Stephen Boyd plays the only guy who seems decent, so, naturally, Hope Lange neglects him for a new ex-boyfriend. As for the guys played by veteran actor Brian Ahern and the rest, they're sexist scum and, finally, you understand how Crawford became so bitter and nasty. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all: adultery, premarital sex. , abortion, etc. and it is certainly NOT an artistic triumph. However, thanks to the excellent production values ​​and a juicy script, this is a pleasure to watch. Do not wait for Shakespeare!
