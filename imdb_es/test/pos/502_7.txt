Interesting twist in the vampire thread: fast, strong and in a bad mood. Despite my initial fears, Kris K carries his part reasonably well and Snipes aka Blade provides a formidable physical presence. Much blood, steel, silver, burning bodies and explosions provide a pleasant distraction of 110 minutes. If you like the black aspect of The Matrix, then Blade will attract you, Blade even has a sequence of "dodge the bullets".
