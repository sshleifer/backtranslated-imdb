I'm a Gone With The Wind fan, but I was disappointed that both the Gone With The Wind movie and Scarlett's and the mini-series were so different from the books. Gone With The Wind left so many things in the movie that were in the book and did the same with Scarlett. Both were good movies, but I really liked the two books more. Many characters were left out of Scarlett, and the ages of some characters do not seem to match the book. The timelines do not match either. Scarlett realizes that she is pregnant on the boat to Ireland in the book, but realizes when she is vomiting while she is in Savahanna. Also Sally is made to be an ugly woman like a monkey in the book and the film chose Jean Smart to play her, who obviously is not an ugly woman. In general, Scarlett is a good movie, and it helps anyone who has been disappointed by the way Gone With The Wind ended, to see what would have happened if Margaret Mitchell had lived to write a sequel.
