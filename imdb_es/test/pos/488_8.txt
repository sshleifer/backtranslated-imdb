The real case of an innocent chief of the First Nations (the Indian) by an official from the city of Winnipeg (the Cowboy) is the basis of this film for television. The real case caused its fair share of racial tension in Canada, a small-scale Martin Luther King affair. The injustice of First Nations people is becoming a staple of the Canadian film diet. What makes it worthwhile to watch this movie is the focus on the reactions of the family. The father played by Gordon Tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by Eric Schweig demands justice. The stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach (WINDTALKERS, SKINWALKERS) have minor appearances, almost a cameo. The future star Eric Schweig makes his mark on this film with a powerful performance. An honorable mention is for veteran actor Gary Chalk, who has recorded more than 100 films to his credit. His interpretation of the problematic soul, Inspector Dowson, was awarded a Gemini Award (the Canadian Emmy) along with Eric Schweig. Special effects (jump cuts, sleep sequences) are occasional and non-dominant. Combine this with a beautiful landscape of northern Canada and recent ongoing events involving police officers and First Nations people like the Neil Stonechild case, and have a very rewarding and relevant visual experience.
