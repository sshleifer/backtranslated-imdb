A team of tough NYPD cops led by the tough and tough Buddy Manucci (superbly played by the ever-excellent Roy Scheider) chase a group of disgusting mobsters involved in a network of kidnappings after one of them dies. The director Philip D'Antoni, the producer of "Bullet" and "The French Connection", creates a skilful and potent tone, blatantly amorous and emaciated, maintains a constant rhythm and organizes action scenes with considerable vigor. The exciting score of the Don Ellis music chain further increases the intensity of the runners' skill, while the rudimentary locations of the Big Apple and the rough and grainy cinematography of Urs Furrer enhance overall realism. In addition, the line of distinction that distinguishes police officers from criminals diffuses chillingly in this image: the titular squad uses harsh, brutal and morally dubious strong-arm tactics as a means to end the application of the law and certainly there is no honor code between the thugs and the thieves that populate the sordid urban area that is vividly represented in this film. The nice performances of Tony Lo Bianco as a worm, snitching Vito Lucia the Undertaker, Richard Lynch as the vicious psychopath of the Moon, Bill Hickman as the moon blood partner of Bo, Jerry Leon as the funky Mingo and Joe Spinell as parking assistant An extremely wild and thrilling carved mondo car chase of the heart in your throat qualifies as a definitive highlight. The climate shootout also delivers the moving goods. A true small winner.
