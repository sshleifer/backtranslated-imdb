I personally LOVE this movie in the middle of the Halloween series. I discovered, after seeing him with many friends, that you enjoy it completely or that you find it absolutely unbearable. Personally, I've seen it dozens of times and it never gets old. There is a great background story inside the film itself, and finally many different things are explained. It's a pretty short movie, about 90 minutes, but it's definitely an exciting journey. <br /> <br /> The form seems to be pretty brutal in this movie, but the acting is still there with the way it walks, stalks and kills. There are a lot of small and neat screen shots with Micheal popping up in the background, which adds a more spooky element to the movie.
