The young John Garfield performed well in 1939 "They Made Me a Criminal". Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield expresses his love for the mother, the rejection of alcohol and the clean lifestyle for the fans, including the cops, who eat it. Later in the evening, he is plowed and struggling with his bimbo while his manager, in the living room, shares the night. And the whiskey. <br /> <br /> A problem occurs when another pair arrives. The guy is a journalist and says he will expose Bradfield's fake life on the cover. The manager kills the reporter and he and the floozy leave. The murder discovered, the policemen, are later on the lookout for the now sleepy boxer whose car is driven by the manager with his ex-girlfriend, now Johnny's ex. A police chase ends with a fierce car accident. The manager and the girl are dead and unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> Johnny discovers that he is supposed to be a murderer. But he is also presumed dead. In search of advice from a lawyer, he entrusts the counselor with the key to a bank deposit box that keeps his only savings, $ 10,000. Later, the lawyer gives Johnny $ 250 and tells him that the balance is his fee for giving him professional advice: leave the city, fast and go far. (I would never charge a customer more than $ 5,000 for such a concise, concise and wise address). <br /> <br /> Johnny, now a freight train car jumping, conveniently ends up fainting on an Arizona ranch where he cares. Back to health by the beautiful Goldie West, Ann Sheridan, an excellent actress whose career was on the rise. Taking Jack Dorney as his nickname, the boxer loses some of his rough edges when he falls in love with Goldie. Becomes mentor and friend of - The Dead End Kids. Familiar screen characters for prewar viewers. <br /> <br /> An opportunity to earn money arises when an exhibition boxer appears challenging any fool to last several rounds in the ring with him. It is a natural temptation for Bradfield / Dorney, but there is a fly in the ointment. Who should appear, but the New York detective, Monty Phelan, who laughs at the apartment? He's been in the morgue for years because of a slight mistake early in his career that sent an innocent man to Old Sparky (we all make mistakes, right?) Phelan recognized Bradfield in a news photo and is there to see the fight and do the pinch. Claude Rains is the policeman who has endured the slights and mockery of his colleagues for years. <br /> <br /> What follows is predictable but it is well acted. I hope this is a main feature when it was launched; It's too good to classify as "B" second in a marquee. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley, better known as an outstanding choreographer, directed by "They Made Me a Criminal" and Max Steiner, one of the most prolific composers of Hollywood scores, wrote pleasant but not extraordinary music for the movie. <br /> <br /> Now available on Alpha Video DVD, the movie gave me back $ 4.99 and it gave me a lot of pleasure. I'll see it again. <br /> <br /> 8/10
