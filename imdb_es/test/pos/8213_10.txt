In the end!! Sandra Bullock is a beautiful woman, but I finally found a movie that will become an actress! Forget the predictable Keanu-forage of SPEED, forget about the foreseeable Kleenex-forage while you were sleeping - this puts you to the test! <br /> <br /> And she's great! A techno-feminist role that really works well on the screen, in a subject that is very close to the bone. The problems raised do not seem to be implausible at all and the whole experience, aided by an excellent cast of support, makes it a couple of rather disturbing hours. <br /> <br /> You can never enter another conversation. Again, in fact I'm getting very nervous writing this review ... eh ... goodbye!
