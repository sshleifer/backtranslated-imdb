Time does extraordinary things. He is the last judge. Time has given "Married To The Mob" an extra dose of freshness. There are no dead moments or cheap shots. It's more of a delight now than ever. Michelle Pfeiffer creates a mafia widow who is as far from a caricature as anything else she has ever done. A true original creation touching or insinuating the stereotype just to guide us through it, but Angela is quite unique. The legendary Dean Stockwell introduces us to a mafia boss who is as menacingly real as he is funny. And Matthew Modine? Why did I think then that I did not have chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was wrong. They are wonderful together. I was reminded, this time, to Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray of "Remember The Night" that I am writing this comment now to encourage you to visit or revisit this jewel of Jonathan Demme.
