There have been some harsh criticisms of Comanche Moon in IMDb. I think this is for three reasons. First, purists are disappointed that the miniseries is not exactly like the book. Second, it's not as good as the original Lonesome Dove. Finally, people like to complain about IMDb and the best movies in the world will have bad comments. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that no movie will be as good as the book. That's the way it is. Lonesome Dove was not as good as the novel on which it was based. In addition, Lonesome Dove's film had some things that were left aside and changed. This is how it will be with a cinematographic adaptation of anything. So it's a pointless argument when you look at Comanche Moon. <br /> <br /> I agree that it is not as good as the original Dove. But hey, nothing is. I know people who guide their lives for the lessons they learned from the Dove. If I was going to compare all the books I read, the movie I saw and the television I saw in Lonesome Dove; It would be perpetually unhappy. <br /> <br /> This is a television miniseries based on a prequel to Lonesome Dave (the novel) and the sequel to Dead Man Walk, and that's what you get. It's the best television I've seen in years. It's a fun game for Loneome Dove. We learn about the history of the Rangers we met and love in Dove. Zahn does an amazing job in the recreation of Gus McCrae. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli (sp?) Also perform excellent jobs such as creating characters that help complete the past of the Rangers and Newt. <br /> <br /> If it reappears, I promise you'll enjoy it. It's more than a disheveled reality show.
