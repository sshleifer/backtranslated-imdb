Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a small story that speaks of respect for the ocean, respect for young and old humans and respect for cultural differences. It's a new story of a little golden fish who wants to be a girl, instead of a retelling of the Disney Little Mermaid. Miyazaki has animated by hand, a capricious and magical film for young and young at heart. The film begins with a slow and wavy blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish and dozens of golden fish with children's faces. There is no need for narrative, the movement of the creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi tell the beginning. Launched last summer in Japan, Ponyo won the Academy Award in Japan for Best Animated Film and Best Score (Jezebel.com). The extravagant golden fish, Brunhild, leaves her ocean at home with a jellyfish. When it reaches the surface, it is caught in a fishing net full of other fish, garbage and mud. They push it to a bottle, which is taken to the shore, where Sosuke (voice of Frankie Jonas) of five years recovers it. The hand is cut to open the bottle to release the fish. Brunhild tests his blood, which heals Sosuke's wound, and sets his transformation in motion to a human, at the same time unbalances nature. Sosuke puts the small gold fish in a green bucket and calls it Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), which means soft and gelatinous. Sosuke's mother, Lisa (Tina Fey), allows her to take Ponyo to school, which is right next to the nursing home where she works. Lisa's madness driving along the picturesque winding road, through a dry dock, through the bustling fishing village, and up a tree-lined path to the nursing home is representative of Miyazaki's wonderful action sequence and perfectly illustrates the hectic morning of a father. Miyazaki has created another strong and independent female character in Lisa. Turning her into a loving, sensitive and modern mother for both Sosuke and Ponyo. Lisa's phone conversation with her husband about not coming home again, Kiochi (Matt Damon), because the boat he, the captains, must make another race, is the typical reaction of a wife. Later that night, Sosuke intercedes with a signal lamp to talk to his father when the ship passes by the cliff where his house is located. Lisa refuses to acknowledge Kiochi's apology and jumps and points out "Bug-off, Bug-off, Bug-off", it's a hilarious scene. But, when Sosuke takes the signal lamp and tells his father "Good luck, I love you", Lisa hugs him and tells him that he has a good heart, it is a very touching scene. <br /> <br /> My personal favorites are the grandmother-like old ladies of Miyazaki in a wheelchair in the nursing home, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). His exchange on the little golden fish of Sosuke is wonderful and recalls the dispute between the Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they climb a long flight of stairs in Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo's magical father, god of the sea, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), who resembles wizard Howl, arrives to take Ponyo to his home in the ocean. Fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to try to rebalance nature, but the magical little Ponyo escapes again, causing more discomfort in the process and causing a tsunami. Running on the backs of the giant dolphins to get to Sosuke, this little redhead reminds the audience of the stubborn and adventurous little Mei in My Neighbor Totoro. Ponyo is as adventurous and curious as Mei. When Fujimoto realizes what Ponyo has done, he calls Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett), the goddess of the ocean, to help with the situation. This wise and calm goddess arrives with a blue garment that never ends. She has a private conversation with Lisa about the future of young children, which helps the audience understand that the relationship of Sosuke and Ponyo is not of lovers, but of brothers and sisters. The simple and quiet end of life is still typical of Miyazaki films that leave the public full of hope.
