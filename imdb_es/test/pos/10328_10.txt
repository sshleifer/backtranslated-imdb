For those of you who have no idea what Bug Juice is, it was a reality show for children about real children living in a summer camp. Bug Juice is the show that inspired me to go to the camp. It was full of romance, friendships, fights, overcoming your fears and dealing with the difficulties of living away from home for 2 months. It was an amazing show that is no longer shown on t.v. Regularly, but it is amazing without equal. The show was never boring and always attracted my attention. It is really good for children who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it is like before they go. In addition, Disney did a very good job of choosing the camps to exhibit them because who wants to see a show that is in a camp for only a week. The duration of the camps was perfect for this show and the atmosphere they were in was fantastic. They were camps throughout the United States, which provided unique activities for campers. It was a really incredible show, without a script.
