I've wanted to see this for a while: I never thought I'd be seeing it in a wet Trafalgar Square, London with another 15,000 people and all with a new Pet Shop Boys score. <br /> <br /> Quickly, that experience specifically. A new output of PSB, seemed to suffer the same problem as the miniaturist Hugo Wolf when he wrote his opera Der Corregidor: the long structure was a chain of short strings, ie songs. PSB produced a more fluid and integrated score, although it was quite static on its own terms. Nor could they resist the song: a configuration of the subtitled text worked in this respect, an independent meditation on the action of the massacre of Odessa's footsteps during the action of that sequence itself was, dare I say, counterproductive. However, overall it was very exciting, which was surely what Eisenstein was trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It is a very exciting film with a more complex edition that takes the place of the acceleration of tension or action. In fact, the film, although it is beautifully filmed and acted passionately (it has a silent cinematic melodrama, but not in the excess of the Hollywood comic style) breathes through its careful editing of specific steps with a sense of the speed at which the audience will take them in. And there is also a great variety of perspectives; I had many cameras or the sequences in the port and the steps took a long time. <br /> <br /> Super film, which can be evaluated independently of the sound, since that would have been the final product conceived 8/10
