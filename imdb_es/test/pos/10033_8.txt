The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. It was never intended to be a serious story, but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds. Errol Flynn was never better, because this paper was designed for him. Olivia DeHavilland was never more beautiful. Arthur Kennedy never more villain. Anthony Quinn never more noble than Crazy Horse. He had a lot of humor and pathos and kept his interest at all times. The only historical aspect I found most blatantly inaccurate was the final "Last Stand" that occurred on the banks of the Little Big Horn. The film version was filmed in a desert without a river in sight. However, I still consider it a wonderful entertainment typical of Hollywood's golden age.
