You have to see it to believe it. Filmed in Hollywood on the fringe in the middle of the sordid, everything is worth 70 years, this low-cost film that really filled the theaters of the city center in its day. On the other hand, I bet you had a one week race. Actually, it's pretty hilarious. The acting is terrible, the direction does not exist, but the hair, the clothes, the rotten music before the disco and the general sordidness of the story are amazing. Sleazy, it's very sordid. Highly recommended (if you can find it)
