I enjoyed the movie and the fact that I was aiming quite high when dealing with sophisticated material. I watched the movie in a preview, and it was not ruined by any silly video box that ruined the ending. The performances were quite good, especially Andrew McCarthy in a more mature role. I also liked the look of the movie that gave it a mysterious and implacable air. I also enjoyed some of the "twists" in the plot, and I do not want to reveal too much in case the video boxes from other countries do not give it all! The script was a little exaggerated at times, but I appreciated the fact that the filmmakers were not afraid to challenge the audience with interesting and baffling questions about the role of faith in our world. And, although some might find the ending too open, I appreciated the fact that the film refused to tie everything with a bow. This is not how life works.
