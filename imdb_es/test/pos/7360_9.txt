I turned this on (cable) on a whim and they treated me with a surprise ... although very predictable, this movie turned out to be quite pleasurable ... not big stars but well directed and just plain fun. With all the exaggerated shit out there, it's very nice to get an unexpected surprise from time to time ... and this little movie fits perfectly. 9/10
