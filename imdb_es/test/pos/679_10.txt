Every time Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30s, 40s and 50s, she was guaranteed great entertainment even if the image was black and white. Ida was able to capture audiences and keep them captivated until the end of her photos. In this film, like Mrs. Helen Gordon, "High Sierra", '41 along with Robert Ryan, (Howard Wilton), "Golden Gloves", '40 keeps you guessing how the relationship is going to come out and how poor Mrs. Gordon can have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection. If you liked Ida Lupino, who could play the role of criminal in a women's prison and in an incarceration that was hated, this is the movie for you to enjoy. I really believe that Ida Lupino was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the film industry.
