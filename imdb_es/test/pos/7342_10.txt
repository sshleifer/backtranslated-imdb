Whatever you do, do not stop looking when you think the movie is over! Look for the first batch of credits or you will really miss something! We saw this movie at the Savanaah film festival and we thought it was the best of all. Dreya Weber is really a marvel, not only because of his performance, but because he can achieve it far from the ground. In the question and answer session, she said there were no wires or effects, so everything you see is really what she is looking for. Addie could not attend the festival because she was dancing with Madonna. She was excellent and, my gawd, so beautiful. I was surprised that the movie was so good with the crowd of blue-haired women, but there they are, Savannnah is not a backwater.
