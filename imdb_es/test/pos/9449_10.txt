This is a classic American movie in combination with comedy, romance and dream. You can say: 'There have already been many of this kind of movies. but just believe me, you will find that this is good because it is well directed, with scripts and reproduced. Amanda Bynes is simply amazing! She is humorous, cute and charming both on and off the screen. She is the real MAN! The message I get from him is to pursue your own fairy tale. what I mean by "fairy tale" is not that of prince and princess, but it indicates "faith". that is, it tells us that we must keep your faith, your dreams and things that make you regret your whole life if you do not. One of those movies that you can not miss in your life.
