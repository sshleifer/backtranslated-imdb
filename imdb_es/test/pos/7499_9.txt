The best screen performance ever made by George C. Scott. Chayefsky's script, the dialogue laden with irony, is almost perfect ('Where do you train your nurses, Dachau?'). Rigg is wonderful as the rescuer angel that saves Scott from doom, as is the entire cast. It is a hilarious and serious movie. It is a film of the time, the 60s, but it is not dated in any sense. What it is about, the chaos and irrationality of the system as opposed to the sanity of the individual, is timeless. And the monologue "We do not cure anything, we do not cure anything" (handed over, actually shouted, like no one else Scott could) with his references to cloning and other "wonders" of modern science, could have been written this morning. <Br /> <br />
