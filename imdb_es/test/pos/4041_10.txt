I know the girl who did the figure skating for the leading girl. Once he went out with my brother and he was always very kind! I also live in Cranbrook B.C, about 15 minutes from Fort Steele. Haha, I used to go on field trips when I was in elementary school. It was kind of weird to see him in the movie. I also had the opportunity when the film was being filmed to be an extra because there was a casting for them at the mall. But at that time I did not feel like going because I was not interested in acting. Now I would totally like to have done it. This was such an incredible movie that I bought it on Ebay. He never came out here (which is a bit weird since it was partially filmed here), so I was thrilled when he arrived. I really loved the story line and the poler bear was a bit cute. But if anyone has any questions about Fort Steele, just ask :)
