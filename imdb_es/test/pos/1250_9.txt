Truly a wonderful movie. Bruce Willis bestows his ever-outstanding romantic comedy power on this message film and the film brings hope to the losers that many of us know we are. A gift for all the middle-aged people whose past time seems to be full and yet empty: there is more in the next curve and it can be great, enriching and romantic. Leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past, and then take off on a favorite flight to your better future. If we could relive our youthful experiences, if we could really remember the events that shaped us, would not we find a special kind of freedom? See the movie, open the gift.
