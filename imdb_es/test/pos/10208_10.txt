Fritz Lang directed two great westerns: "Western Union" and "The Return of Frank James". Frank James' movie is the same as "Jesse James." "Western Union" is one of Randolph Scott's great westerns. I have never seen Robert Young in a western before; He is excellent as the telegraph clerk. This is the only movie I can think of that is about the opening of the telegraph company in the west. It is a high-level story about the telegraph in the west, a love story of triangles and about loyalty. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Dean Jagger, who did some westerns, plays the telegraph manager. Virginia Gilmore, who plays Mr. Jagger's sister, is the love interest in the movie. Ms. Gilmore had a short career in movies. She left films in 1952 and became a theater coach. She is mainly known as the first Mrs. Yul Brynner. It's great to see Slim Summerville in a movie with Mr. Scott again. They were in two other big movies: "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Jesse James."
