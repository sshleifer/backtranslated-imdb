Robin Williams is a national treasure, especially when he lets go and puts aside his sensible approach to drama. He manages to animate the usual restricted rhythm of Barry Levinson, and there are moments in this movie where he really shines. <br /> <br /> As the funny American president elected in "Man of the Year" Williams recaptures hilarity. and the indignation that used to be associated with him. What makes him so attractive is his humanity and sympathy. Here is a man who can lash out at his audience, but who really loves them too. His humor is like barbed wire, and yet it is cathartic. It is what makes it very attractive to people in the movie and in real life. <br /> <br /> Once again, Laura Linney plays an intelligent woman in distress. She is a fabulous and very talented performer, but I think she has fitted into a stereotype and unfortunately, it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable interpreter in this case. Walken practically runs his ungrateful paper, and the climate scene in the SNL sketch barely floats on the water. <br /> <br /> Enter for some fun moments, and those are priceless. Enjoy Williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this entertaining movie.
