This movie seems to have been overlooked by everyone. Someone should get it out on VHS and DVD. It's an excellent film and far superior to Brooke Shields, which was terrible. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons deserves more credit than he has now. It would be nice if all your movies were offered on VHS or DVD. Jean Simmons was, and still is, a very good actress. She certainly was a beauty. In fact, she is still a beauty. She has also done extremely well on TV. She is much better than many of today's actors.
