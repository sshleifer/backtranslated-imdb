This show is my guilty pleasure all the way !! The first time I tuned in with the Next Top Model of the United States, I expected to get bored and find it very stupid. I did not do This show is really fun seriously. I read in one of the other reviews that makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's best model. And so it does! Who does not love the glamor and emotion that comes with being a model? In ANTM you can see how it REALLY is. And who does not like to listen to girls who quarrel with each other and fight? Or enjoy throwing something at that Mrs. Janice? <br /> <br /> Give this a chance. Do not expect something smart or a show you can attend for a life lesson. Just enjoy it for what it is. Serious fun!
