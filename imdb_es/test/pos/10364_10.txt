In my work with the only national non-profit organization, Security On Campus, Inc. dedicated exclusively to the subject of campus crime prevention and student awareness, I too often see the kind of violence in the campus and the "cover-up" through the secret campus. Cortes portrayed in the film `Silencing Maria '. In fact, we receive numerous calls and requests for information every month from campus reporters, such as "Mary," who faces similar situations. <br /> <br /> Your description of a campus violation and the subsequent "Mary" crusade, Melissa Joan Hart, the victim's roommate and a student journalist, played very well, because justice was very well made and researched with precision. <br /> <br /> This was the first television movie I've seen that I truly felt reflected and covered all the various complex issues related to the way rapes and other violent crimes are dealt with on college and university campuses. our country. Although it would not be possible to address all these issues in depth in 2 hours, this film is closer than any other I've seen.
