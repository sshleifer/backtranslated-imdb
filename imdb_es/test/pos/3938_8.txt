I was very surprised to see that, unlike most documentaries, this was written, directed and produced by a film critic: Richard Schickel. Most of the time I know places where movie critics played an important role in the movies, the films turn out to be bombs (Rex Reed stars in "Myra Breckenridge" and Roger Ebert writes "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" are the best examples). However, in this case, the powers of the critics are used for good and not for evil, and the results are better (although this does not say much, since the films I have just mentioned are among the worst movies ever made ). <Br /> <br /> As for the documentary, it is narrated by Clint Eastwood (a very good choice) and manages to discuss his long career, from his silent days until his death in the early sixties. The only negative aspects, and they are slight, are that the film is very short (like most documentaries) and that Gary Cooper is a very little human being, you do not really learn much about his life. However, as a good description of his films, it works very well.
