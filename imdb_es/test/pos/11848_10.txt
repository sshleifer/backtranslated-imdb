I paid attention and enjoyed the rich capacity of expression of the main actress, Julianne Nicholson. I have no words to describe how much I loved it. All the actors and actresses played well. Especially I noticed the solid good character that has been consistent in foreseeing the future: Andy Richter, who played Carl. I think the idea of ​​showing a variety of friends and family with different opinions, and the various consultation meetings, is like the real world. Jay Mohr, who played Ed, the future husband, also had a very real behavior. But, I want to emphasize again the point of the repertoire of very rich expressions that Julianne Nicholson is capable of doing and, naturally, it was overwhelming for me. In fact, the subject that this film is about seems to me very important and touches very significant thoughts of many people. I have seen this movie several times and I have not got bored. It gets up again and again in my thoughts.
