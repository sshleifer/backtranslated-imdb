Bring Back The A-team was a special one-hour program on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom last year and presented by presenter and comedian Justin Lee Collins, the program sought to locate and reunite the cast members of the A -Team , for the first time on TV. This has been something that nobody has tried before. Well, not by anyone that I know, that is. <br /> <br /> Justin is a great presenter, and his eccentric personality and humorous jokes sparkled throughout this program. The attempts he makes to get to the cast members are very funny, but he was also very persistent and was anxious to accomplish this task, which is a merit for him, he would say. Anyway, it's great on television, whether it's presenting a show like this, or Friday Night Project with its co-author, Alan Carr. <br /> <br /> There were appearances and interviews with Dirk Benedict. - Faceman himself, Dwight Schultz, also known as Howling Mad Murdock, Marla Heasley, who played Tawnia Baker, Jack Ging, also known as General 'Bull' Full Bright, the creator of Team A, Stephen J Cannell and the great man, Mr T aka BA Baracus. It was fascinating to see and hear what they had to say about the program that became a worldwide success during the 80s, as they remember and relive the good and bad moments of the program: both during and behind the scenes. Unfortunately, it's not George Peppard, but, of course, it's already in heaven, it's understandable and quite strange that it's not Melinda, who played Amy. <br /> <br /> I just did not understand why he did not appear in the program. Okay, she was fired after 3 seasons or whatever, but she was the first and original female member of Team A, only that she was replaced by Tawnia de Marla, so it would have been great to see and hear her side of A The history of the team, in addition to the other cast members. <br /> <br /> In general, Bring Back The A-Team was a great documentary show style. Perhaps, this could have been further extended by means of which this could have been a six-part documentary. But nevertheless, this was a great effort on the part of JLC. Recommended
