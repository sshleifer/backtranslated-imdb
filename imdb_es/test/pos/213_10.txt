Two years after the success of 'Airplane', Jim Abrahams and Jerry & David Zucker created this brilliant comedy starring the great Leslie Nielsen as the detective 'Frank Drebin'. Also in the cast were Alan North as "Captain Ed Hocken", Ed Williams as "Ted Olsen" and William Duell as "Johnny The Shoe Shine Boy". 'Police squad!' He had cheeky jokes and smart visual gags playing in the background. Each episode would conclude with a simulation of a frame in which the characters in the frame remain completely immobile. One of the best 'freeze' sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a cup while standing still, causing the cup to overflow! The guest stars were eliminated in the initial titles, one of them included Georg Stanford Brown being crushed by a falling safe! Despite winning positive reviews and many criticisms, 'Squad!' It only lasted six episodes before being canceled. However, this did not mean the end, five years later, the program was transferred to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the 'Naked Gun' movies.
