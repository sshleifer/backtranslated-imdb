Do you want a movie that will take you somewhere? Well, this is a good choice. If you were a teenager in the era represented in this movie, the happy Motown day, or if you want to go back and see what your parents made so much noise, I suggest you take this movie and give it a watch. . At the risk of sounding cliche, you will laugh, cry, remember and remember. You will go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight. You will remember your best friends from school with affection. It's a good movie with a touch of anguish, pain and realism: misconceptions, losing friends, deciding what to do with your life. I think everyone, regardless of race, age, socio-economic status, can get something out of this movie and really enjoy it. So take a couple of hours of a lazy day and watch this movie; There are much worse ways to spend time.
