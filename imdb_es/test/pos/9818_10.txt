Ettore Scola's magisterial representation of this epic of heart deserves a much broader audience. He is a worthy successor to the risorgimento classics such as Senso de Vischonti and Il Gattopardo, as well as Vanina de Rosselini, Vanini. The 19th century is a fruitful source for Italian filmmakers. The period setting and the ornaments are beautifully done here, but the story is timeless and could happen in any period. What is so intriguing in this story is that the hero is trapped in a claustrophobic situation in which he finds himself the object of desire pursued and is quite powerless to free himself from the alarming circumstances. Giorgio (Giraudeau), handsome and insensitive, is frustrated by his inability to visit his lovely (Antonelli) married and charming, and falls prey to the dangerous passion of Fosca (D'Obici), the ugly and sickly daughter of his severe commander. (Girotti) The resulting anguish and the consequent tragedy that this unlikely pair suffers makes them understandable, regrettable and immensely sympathetic to the spectators. The star performance of Bernard Giraudeau will captivate and leave a lasting impression. Do not be surprised
