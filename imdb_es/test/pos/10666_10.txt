Much has been said about this film and its historical importance in the formation of the language of the film. If you are interested in the history of cinema, to really understand the innovations that Eisenstein brings to the medium, you can try to see Potemkin along with most of the films that have been made before (those of D.W. Griffith offer a good contrast). Eisenstein should not be allowed to be the sole theorist of the montage and that the principles of editing the montage would probably have been discovered at another time. However, even today, few directors have approached the skill with which Eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at a time so early in the evolution of the medium. <br /> <br /> If you're not interested in that kind of Thing, Potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving movies ever made. You should see it, buy it and take it to your chest.
