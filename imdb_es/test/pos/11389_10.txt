Altman and Scorsese have twisted sex into one of the best American movies of the last 20 years. Boogie Nights did not make a big fuss, and I still do not think he got the credit he deserves. The immediate clamor surrounding the movie ("Some porn movies with Marky Mark") was totally without merit. What Paul Thomas Anderson has created is no less than an impressive representation of the quest and subsequent loss of the American Dream (if such a thing still exists). <br /> <br /> For those of you who have been living in an In the box (or a confessional) for the last 8 years, Boogie Nights tells the literal story of the rise and fall of the young Eddie Adams (Wahlberg). Eddie is just a silly boy from Torrance, California, who wants something more from life. Her room is soaked with muscled, naive American. Your dreams are much bigger than your potential, but not as big as your ... special gift. His hot southern gentleman quickly catches the attention and eyebrows of the burgeoning and ubiquitous adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds as the Bear Dad of the movie) realizes the hidden talent of Eddie and decides to put it in a movie. <br /> <br /> Before you can say "deep throat", Eddie has changed. his name to Dirk Diggler and exposed his massive member to an open-eyed audience. Fame and fortune meet Dirk, as do a group of local pornographic celebrities. His friends and coworkers become his impromptu family, but soon it becomes a Sunday picnic like no other. As the 70s feel good, the 80s go crazy and are comfortable, and Dirk & Co. begins a dangerous setback. <br /> <br /> Anderson put everything he had into this glorious and moving epic. It sizzles and never burns. Not a single painting of this monumental image is wasted, and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after ELO fades from the soundtrack. See this immediately. And then see it again. <br /> <br /> And again.
