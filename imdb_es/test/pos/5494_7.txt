This is another of Eastwood's many films that mix intrigue, action and a lot of romance, along with "The Gauntlet", "Firefox", etc. Clint's performance range is now quite familiar. In this case, he is taciturn and a little outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the movie itself is somewhat surprising. is above average <br /> <br /> Clint is Frank, a Secret Service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, could not catch the bullet that killed JFK. Then he started drinking, which took his family to another place, and now he slowly advances in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovitch, who calls himself "Booth", who establishes a kind of biased relationship with him based on in his disillusioned and shared conviction. that everything has no meaning, except the impulse to escape sadness and predictability. Now, this is more of a set of risky attitudes for an artist like Clint to project, but he does it quite well, less robotic than usual. And it seems he carries with him, like a load of stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He has tried again halfway through the movie. He is hanging from the roof of a tall building, grabbing Booth's hand, and taking out his gun and pointing it at Booth, who asks him if he is really willing to shoot. If he does, of course, saves the president from an assassination attempt by a murderer trained by the CIA, but he does so at the cost of his own life. Booth tells him the situation while they shake hands in the air. And Clint even has a short speech, talking to Renee Russo, about his failure to save the president in Dallas. "If I had reacted quickly enough, I could have taken that picture ... and that would have been fine with me." He is minimized, but his voice drowns, his eyes moisten and his lips tremble. It is one of the few scenes in any of Clint's films that could be called "moving". We know from your new resolution that if I had another chance, this time I would take the bullet. (The irony is that he does not like the current president, who could? He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how they "forged a nation in the desert." Did not they do the same in Las Vegas?) <Br /> <br / > It is often said that a movie is as good as its villain. It is not true, nothing is so simple, but in this case you could argue its real value. The reptilian John Malkovitch with his Tartar eyes is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Talk about disillusioned. Okay, you can ruin it a bit, sniffing with disdain even as you connect two innocent hunters between the eyes, but it's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little to do. Fred Thompson, as the White House's top aide, is now back in politics, a relief for moviegoers. If Clint's range of performance is limited, Thompson is somewhat less. In each film he has been in, he carries the same solemn and unsatisfied expression, as if he were constantly plagued by some type of volcanic digestive disorder. <br /> <br /> Wolfgang Peterson's address is as good as it was on "Das Boot," which is pretty good. There is a lot of the usual polite criss-crossings in the final shooting. And when Clint and Russo fall into a passionate embrace in their hotel room and scurry towards the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson shows us his feet playfully along with a succession of objects that fall to the floor, not only the usual clothes but Handcuffs, pistols, pagers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wristwatches and other impedimenta. Interrupted, Clint lies on the bed and sighs: "Now I have to put all those things back on." <br /> <br /> Well written and worth seeing.
