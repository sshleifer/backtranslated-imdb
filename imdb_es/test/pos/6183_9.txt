The Lubitsch's Touch is more than ever in this movie. Humor at any time and very subtle. The plot is simple but very well directed by the director. The cut of the film is very intelligent and adds to the comic effect. A true piece of comedy that is not becoming so old for a 21st century spectator. Gary Cooper acted finely with the character, especially with Claudette Colbert, so smart and petty with this poor Michael in the movie. Avoid all the traps of your husband and take advantage of the situation to your advantage, very funny. And there's no problem, with Lubitsch, there's always a happy ending. A movie for men too confident with women. Do not let your girlfriend see this movie ...
