12/17/01 All I can do with this movie is improvise my impressions. They did not give me the "changes", I do not know the "score" and I'm not trained in the genre. Anyway, I always had trouble following the chord changes (trumpeter, you know), so I was pretty much limited to doing the basics "keep the melody in mind" and the freedom around that. What surprised me about this incredibly grumpy black and white blues piece was the knot it gave me in my head and heart when trying to figure out whether to go with the set or choose a path along the melody (story) . I guess He left with the melody as usual; I kept losing myself because of the changes, too deep, too long, probably in my head. Still, it was a gas trying to keep up. I admired the game of the actors with the theme and the story line. I did not see some things or many other things that seemed: I did not feel that the fair-skinned girl was "trying to get through" no matter how much she did not notice the color issue or tried to ignore it, at first: later she came back fighting. The young man with clear and melancholy skin (his most ridiculous noudling trumpet) was ambiguous, ambivalent, and, perhaps his best characteristic, at a distance. What, I thought after the shadow curtain closed on this provocative piece, is it the basis of something like this? Is it a way to find "reality" by setting a stage, populating it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and a theme? Is it more real or truthful than a well-designed script, without the benefit of editing and revising? Is it heroic, "more artistic" improvisation? More than a handmade work? Where is a greater or clearer truth: in the retrospective art / trade or in the manufacture and reform? Well, I'm still lost in this question. I loved the movie; I got lost in a cold blue foggy night, where I just had to go home and get my horn. Guess what? I exploded into a twelve-bar blues riff, tried and true, that I could not get away from the melody. The reality is too terrifying. Jaime says give them a 7 and more. I'm in a break.
