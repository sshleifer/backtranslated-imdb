I am very impressed with the performance in Comanche Moon. Before I started seeing this, I did not expect it to be as good as Lonesome Dove. I could not believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters. I was surprised at how well they played each role! This was in my opinion almost as good as Loneome Dove. It is difficult to compare any movie with Lonesome Dove. If you do not make that comparison, I give a thumbs up. It was very entertaining! I do not post many comments on this site, but I felt I had to express my opinion there. Amazing! I do not want to stop naming all the actors who were brilliant, because I would probably have to make a list of each of them. My favorite was Steve Zahn. He hit the nail in the head playing Captain Gus. His gestures were perfect.
