It ends with the statement that "the movie you just saw was an improvisation", for once it makes you feel like an idiot for thinking that an improvisation is a good movie, and surprised by the genius of Cassavetes ... once again . Of course, Cassavetes told a guy that it was not really an improvisation in itself, on his deathbed, so ... it's the story of a light-skinned black woman, Lelia, who happens to be white, and her family: another one that happens. white brother named Ben, and a black-black brother named Hughie. When she falls in love with a white imbecile named Tony, he feels unpleasantly surprised when he discovers that she is black and, from there, it is about the individual aspirations and shortcomings of the three main characters. Hughie is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a failure, Lelia is still desperately depressed by Tony, and Ben is agonizing and violent in general, with a desperate need for something that surprises him from his old patterns of existence. In general, I guess it's really about stasis against the change in human life. I suspect that Cassavetes had the plot sufficiently organized, and it was only the dialogue that was improvised. The dialogue itself is very unequal: sometimes someone says something memorable, sometimes it is uncomfortable. The surprising thing is the extension of the incarnation of the amateur actors of his characters. Cassavetes went through the acting class he was teaching at the time he decided to do Shadows, he whispered in the ears of the top ten students, and this was the result ... the guys who play Ben and Hughie are very good. At first I did not like Lelia, but as the film progresses, you see more and more, it is one of those actors that improves as tension and drama increase, not necessarily the best with a small talk. Shadows is hailed by many as the forerunner of the independent film movement (made in 1959) and is definitely recommended.
