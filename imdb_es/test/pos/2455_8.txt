This film has a very deep vision of the relationships between a mother who grew up in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. She and her son, who have just returned from Vietnam, collided on some very tense subjects. The relationship has no intimate connections and is an excellent accurate description of what it is to live with someone who is false and just looks at the surface of the problems. Kathy Bates does an excellent job portraying a woman of false faith who either does not realize her cruelty, is forgetful or simply does not want to be confronted. Jeremy's anger is never feared and leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about the love his parents have for him. This is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event that leads to despair.
