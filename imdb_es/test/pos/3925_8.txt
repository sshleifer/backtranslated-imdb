The theater of my university has just had a special screening last night of this movie. I have to say that I think everyone was impressed by how good this movie was. However, my roommate did not care, but anyway he does not like horror movies and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, do not be. I'm not exactly one of her admirers, but I have to be honest and say she was pretty good and that she has the best death scene. In general, all the actors were very good. I will not go into details for the plot since I'm sure you know. Undoubtedly, the characters are quite attractive and really interest you, especially the characters of Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray. We meet with them as rival brothers and we end up with them having to work together. Another advantage is that it does not have the elegant appearance of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and feels almost like a documentary instead of a music video (Do not get me wrong, I loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoyed Amityville). <br /> <br /> Now for the scenes of death. In most Slasher films, each time a character is stabbed or killed, the scene immediately cuts to another scene, but not to this one. When a character is about to die, he dies in a pretty horrible way. But the filmmakers do not stop there and add something extra each time for each victim. I will not say anything about the scenes of death and I will let you see them for yourself. <br /> <br /> Although this is a great slasher movie, it has the flaws of almost every slasher movie (explore a spooky house when you should not, get a ride with a suspicious character, split up and scream so the murderer can hear you). In addition, there is a somewhat stupid twist of the plot that was not necessary and that was not added to the film. You could say that it was just added at the last moment and if you took it out, it would not affect the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Basically, if you're a fan of horror movies, watch this movie. . You will not be disappointed. It has everything it takes to make it a great slasher movie, possibly the best of the year, although it's a bit early. The suspense feels and is sometimes a funny movie. If you hate horror movies, you probably like this one and if you're divided, I encourage you to try it.
