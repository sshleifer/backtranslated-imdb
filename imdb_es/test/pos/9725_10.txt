This is the best television series for children (and adults) of all time. John Hurt is a great actor, with many excellent performances for many years, but he was born to play the narrator. The scripts for almost all the episodes are excellent pieces of craftsmanship, and the productions cover the whole range of emotions, being alternately fun, sad, happy, exciting and always captivating. It is difficult to choose a better episode among so many excellent contenders, but "The Soldier and Death", with its timeless pathos, is unbeatable. It's a series to watch with your children, again and again.
