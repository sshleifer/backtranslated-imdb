Wonderful family movie that should be a staple at Christmas. It's a mystery to me why it is not. A true lost film that I found for the first time, blinking in my old 19 "black and white RCA, when the movie Million Dollar Movie was still in fashion on Channel 9 in New York City This fantasy directed by Rudolph Mate It should be located under everyone's Christmas tree, but it's never been posted on a home video ... It's a pity, I think I saw part of it at AMC a few years ago, before they removed many of their older films from the rotation. TCM should take over and play it at Easter or Christmas Eve Any movie with Santa Claus, Aunt Bee, the host Cupcake Lady and an actor with the name of King can not be bad Ann Blyth as "Sally" is an energy package During her school years, she rushes to the chapel to pray for St. Ann to help her and guide her confused and economically tied family, and then, after graduating, she places a statue of St. Ann on her own d At one point, O'Moyne's entire residence moved to another address. I think this was done to end a neighboring dispute between the O'Moynes and the neighbor coward. Blyth is cute as a button. Edmund Gwen can play lonely grandfather in his dream. In general, this is a satisfying cinematic experience.
