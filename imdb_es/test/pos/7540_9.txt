Tremendous fun as a movie and as an excuse to sit and play the game of 'oh, that's the name of whassis'. All the stars of the golden age of English movies seem to be in this and it was a joy to see them. And the greatest of all, Richard Wattis, was as tremendous as ever. <br /> <br /> Actually there is a plot that goes very well, there are also some splendid jokes and funny moments, but the key to the triumph of this film is its character. Alastair Sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six-foot Scotch and big bones could be the director of a boarding school for girls. George Cole, Beryl Reid and Irene Handl have their moments, but, with Alastair and Richard, the star of the show is Joyce Grenfell. She is absolutely unique and brings a smile every time she is on the screen ... her rolling ride and her plum accent done to perfection. <br /> <br /> And for those who play the game, that's the name of the chassis, you can even watch Arthur Mullard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle if you watch carefully.
