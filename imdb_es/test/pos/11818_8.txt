The issue of children with terminal illnesses is difficult and sad, but 'The Cure' successfully presents the idea that it does not have to be all pessimism and, if there is anything, children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are. To find peace before the end. It is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood. <br /> <br /> The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional teenager with a distant mother, who moves to a new area where his neighbor next door is located. Dexter, eleven years old, who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion. After their initial fears and ignorance about AIDS dissipated, Erik befriends Dexter and their almost fraternal friendship leads them to embark on a trip through the Mississippi to where they have heard of a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease. <br /> <br /> The talent of the two young leaders of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello, who play Erik and Dexter respectively, is exceptional. Brad was able to portray Erik's most difficult advantage without understanding the subtle infant innocence inherent in the character, while Joseph describes the feeling of vulnerability to Dexter's character, but injects just the right amount of enthusiasm and youthful enthusiasm to highlight that his illness It does not mean that he is still there. He is not a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven-year-old child. The couple's interactions create a sensation in the audience that these are two guys who are really close and who are good at the movie. Annabella Sciorra also offers a touching performance as Dexter's mother, Linda, who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship with Erik and, finally, becomes a surrogate mother figure to the other child. <br /> <br /> Set Against an excellent soundtrack, 'The Cure' is a very bittersweet film that manages to weave impeccably the story of childhood friendship that survives unwavering in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to the sappiness or unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that it is the adults who have problems with Dexter's AIDS status, while the children, even the "thugs", accept it as they would with any other. What is also very touching is how, despite Erik's street nature, he is the most naive in his determination to heal Dexter, while the younger boy has the disturbing feeling that he knows his fate, but the enthusiasm He is dragged by his best friend for healing. . <br /> <br /> I recommend 'The Cure', since it is rare to find a film that is both sad and stimulating.
