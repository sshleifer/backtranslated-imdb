Adapting his own novel "Cabal" for the screen, author / scriptwriter / director Clive Barker designed this wonderful story of horror and fantasy. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man who is suspected of being a serial killer. The police kill him in front of Midian, on the surface of a cemetery but in reality it is a refuge for monsters that have been rejected by society. When they claim Boone and make him one of their own, this causes repercussions for everyone, including Boone's sweet girlfriend (the very pretty Anne Bobby) and the dubious psychiatrist (the nicest David Cronenberg). <br /> <br /> "Nightbreed" shows the kind of wild and twisted imagination that I do not see in movies so often. On the one hand, Ralph McQuarrie, a veteran of conceptual art who has worked on films like the three initial entries in "Star Wars," helps Barker create excellent images for "Nightbreed," starting immediately with the opening credit sequence . The visual and makeup effects are elaborate, and the production design and cinematography are quite impressive. Barker and his team do a wonderful job creating this other world with compelling characters. It is a colorful and extravagant entertainment and it is a pleasure to enjoy it. And, of course, there is a strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and intolerance, not to mention the serious consequences that can result from a person's actions. <br /> <br /> Great supporting performances add to the fun. Cronenberg oozes a lot of malevolent intent and is a real gas like the bad doctor, while Charles Haid is a good antagonist of love of hate, a rather nasty police captain. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley, once again, is buried under a heavy make-up like the tired Lylesberg, and is solid as a rock. Hugh Ross is very funny as Narcisse, as Catherine Chevalier as Rachel (as an additional bonus, she discovers her breasts in a sequence). Simon Bamford, who played the "Butterball Cenobite" in the first two photos of "Hellraiser", appears here as well. There's even an interesting cameo from the 50s and 60s science fiction star, John Agar. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman provides another of his fantastic scores, and Barker constantly guides us through the intriguing story into a terrible apocalyptic confrontation. <Br /> <br /> "Nightbreed" is an excellent genre film that is worth taking a look at anyone who has not seen it. I give you a good recommendation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
