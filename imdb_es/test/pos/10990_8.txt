Being from the Buffalo area, I was well aware that the movie had read many articles in local publications. I was very impressed by the film, especially its intelligent plot, the performance and the local scenes. It is nice to see so many old and quality stars in the different roles. I feel that especially those of us over 50 years old will find the film excellent and you can leave the cinema with the feeling that your time was well spent.
