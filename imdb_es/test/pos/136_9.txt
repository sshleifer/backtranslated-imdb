I did not expect much due to the harsh criticism and, as a result, I enjoyed the movie a lot. The softer colors and the less impressive compositions of the shots that some of his previous films, in my opinion, allowed the narrative to take the focus. Although religious conflict in a vampire movie was commonplace, I felt that many of the other things were not. For example: <br /> <br /> how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her. <br /> <br /> love scenes very strong and well acted. <br /> <br /> the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer really separated them further. <br /> <br /> Their strong differences of what it means to be 'vampire' created by their previous life experiences. <br /> <br /> The lack of scores of other vampires that appear or are created through the movie. <br /> <br /> I have heard and read several things about 'tricks used in other movies'. Of course. However, I feel that the tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and I feel that it is doing well. I do not need a director to use new tricks. I prefer that the tricks used are used well and properly, which I think is the case with this movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend it.
