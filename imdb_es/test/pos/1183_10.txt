For people like me, who were born long after the 60s ended, we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts, of which "Hair" is one. This is undoubtedly a tour de force well done. One can have an idea of ​​what things were like for the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene, at least for me, is when the group crashes against the party of the rich. As for the final scene of the film, one could interpret it as the symbolic ending of everything that the 60s represented. <br /> <br /> But no matter how this film is interpreted, it is important to understand that despite that the 60s could have ended, the movements that typified them still exist in small enclaves. It is a moment that people will not soon forget. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is one that I definitely recommend. Milos Forman scored another excellent here, right between his two masterpieces "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Ragtime" (then why did he do a piece of shit like "The Man on the Moon" ?!). Starring John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.
