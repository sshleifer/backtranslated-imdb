I was lucky to see The Last Stop here, where I live in the Moving Pictures Film Festival (for those of you who do not know, the Moving Pictures Film Festival is a Canadian film tour made in Canada). Just before the movie started, they told me it was the world premiere and that I was about to get a distribution agreement in the United States, which added to my enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of horror movies. And yes, I love the Scream trilogy too. So when I discovered that Rose McGowan was making a movie about the Ten Indians, I knew that a gift was waiting for me. Rose McGowan was the most renowned actress and actress in the entire festival. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe it without revealing too much of the plot is that it is not like Scream. And it's certainly worth seeing. It is located in the middle of a snow storm (it was filmed in Vancouver, BC, Canada) in a motel at the top of the mountain, which increases the suspense. Rose McGowan presents a great performance as the girl next door (?!) Along with the rest of the cast. And as for what happens at the end, well, the only thing I will say is that you will never guess the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it probably will not reach the main American theaters. because the only creator of decent money is Rose McGowan. But if you have the opportunity to see it, I would recommend doing it. And if the worst is worse, there is always a video. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 9 out of 10.
