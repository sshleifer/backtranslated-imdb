When the episode was made and Eisenhower was broadcast, he was President. Kennedy was the elected president. <br /> <br /> As for the episode, it was a passable episode, although not a little serious. "The teacher" does not show much rank here, and everything seems a bit hasty (many episodes of the TZ seem not to coincide with the time interval, some seem to be crowded and rushed, some with little or nothing over the half hour , and some, of course, fit). I suppose you only expect a little more tension than to go back to some rooms and take drugs. But overall a decent episode. In fact, the "what if" motive of time travel is a nugget in itself and establishes the basic interest table. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, considering that there were many episodes of TZ not so good, and some much better.
