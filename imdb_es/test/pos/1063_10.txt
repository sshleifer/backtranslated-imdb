It's fun and fast, since one falsehood leads to another and another to an inevitable and surprising conclusion. The suspense separates this holiday movie from all the others. One wonders how the pieces will fit, both during the film and in the future. <br /> <br /> The actors of the characters laid the foundations and entertained us in the process. Sinkewicz (Frank Jenks) shows us what manipulation can achieve ... and, ultimately, how much manipulation can cost! Uncle Felix (SZ Sakall) evaluates each person for us as we try to protect "Lishka" (Barbara Stanwyck), and this helps us decide who we are going to encourage at the end. <br /> <br /> If I could reach a perfect world, imperfect people would probably have to go through a series of events like these. <br /> <br /> One obvious weakness is the false cry of a baby after he supposedly swallowed Uncle Felix's watch. I've heard the most authentic cry of a doll in a toy store. <br /> <br /> Look at it, and you will really feel like you've been somewhere!
