Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney), decided that the city is too busy and dangerous for their family, so they packed their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and his daughter (Tammy Lauren) and returned to a lake like the Rachel lived as a child. <br /> <br /> They say you can not go back home, but this is an ideal cottage with what at first seems like a Mayberry sensation. Later, the residence seems to be more like the people in Deliverance. Soon the bodies begin to appear and all seem suspicious, with the exception of some friendly faces. This does not prevent the family from enjoying running and playing in the forest. <br /> <br /> We find that they have to be super ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they are considered the antagonists. <br /> <br /> Can the ignorant youngster Stevie save his parents or his persecutor (s) put his foot on this? <br /> <br /> This movie is more than most parodies as interpreted with narrow faces. They could not have chosen better actors and Daryl Anderson was exceptionally spooky. An additional advantage is that they inform us what is happening before the characters find out, instead of taking a clue from the hat after the fact. Anyway, this fact for the television movie is good for some laughs.
