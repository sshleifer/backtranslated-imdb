Excellent story with supperb acting for the entire cast. The warmth and perception of who Joad represents moved off the screen and into the heart of this viewer. The frustration and tenacity of Mother Madalyn in her quest to do HIS work until her last breath was also performed with excellence by Barbara Hershey. The intertwining of the personalities of Joad and Mother Madalyn grew along the story line with breathtaking breath in the final scene.
