This movie is a good example of why the Shaw Brothers are among the best directors (probably the best in the Kung Fu category). The movie has a good rhythm, the story is excellent and intriguing, and although the humor is not in your face, it is nested within the interactions of the character. Once the story is accumulated, and the characters begin to assess the situation, the entire tower collapses into one of the best fighting scenes (the tiger, the crane and the Hung Gar crab are very present). There is even a scene that mocks Western social events of the eighteenth century and ends with an intelligent and entertaining struggle. The film ends with a sudden and cheesy moment, but if you are a fan of the Shaw Brothers, you will understand that cheese is only an ingredient, and not the main course of the film.
