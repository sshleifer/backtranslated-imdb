This was a great movie It was made with such a beautiful design, such symmetry. I love the way classical music relates to the classical art of earth, space and beyond. It was such a fluid and stimulating masterpiece. I loved the way monoliths never changed, although primates, land and space did. I loved what it was like, "Do you need me now?" The film expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, delicacy, kindness, courage and innocence. What more can you ask for from a mere movie? Maybe a movie complement. Any appreciator of 2001: A Space Odyssey will find that the 2010 film is the companion film of 2001. 2010 is more oriented to history than 2001.
