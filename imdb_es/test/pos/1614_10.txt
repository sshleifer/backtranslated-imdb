The first time I saw "Death in Venice" in 1971) about 15 years ago, I found it deeply moving and often I thought about it. When I saw him again a few days ago, I realized that he is close to the top of the great works of cinema. With almost no dialogue captivates the viewer with the beautiful cinematography, good acting and, above all, the music of Mahler without which the film simply could not exist. <br /> <br /> "Death in Venice" is an amazing Luchino Visconti adaptation of Thomas Mann's novel about a famous composer (in the novel he was a writer, but turning him into a composer in a movie was a great idea that works admirably) Gustav von Aschenbach (loosely based on Gustav Mahler) traveling to Venice In the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures. Her search for beauty and perfection seems to be complete when she sees a child of incredible divine beauty. Ashenbach (Dirk Bogard) follows the boy everywhere without trying to get close to him. The child, Tadzio, belonged to very rare creatures that possess an enigmatic and inconceivable power that captivates you, you love it, it conquers you and makes you its prisoner. Ashenbach became one of the prisoners of the fascinating enchantments of Tadzio. He became addicted to him; He fell in love with him. Was it a blessing or a curse for him? I think both. He died of an unattainable love, impossible but beautiful, whose object was perfection in itself. The last image Ashenbach caught in his eyes was the silhouette of the child, surrounded by the light of the sea and the golden sun. Nothing could compare with the beauty and charm of the scene, and take it with you to the grave is the death with which one can only dream. If he could, Ashenbach would probably have said: "I was able to witness one of the faces of perfection, I could not stand it, but I was chosen to learn that it exists here, in this world and I can die in peace now." because it happened to me. "<br /> <br /> Unforgettable music, Gustav Mahler's obsessive obsession of his Fifth Symphony found perfect use in a perfect movie, it reflects every emotion of a main character: sobs, longs, begs hope, and summarizes the idea that once you are blessed to meet beauty, you are doomed to die.It is possible that I can think of hundreds of movies that use classical music perfectly, but nothing compares to "Death in Venice. "I dare to say that Mahler's music IS his main character: it would change and sound differently according to what was happening on the screen.He sounded triumphant when Ashenbach returned to Venice, to what he thought would be his happiness, but it became his death, he sounded gloomy when he first entered Venice from the sea, you can hear so many different feelings in him: tenderness and adoration, confusion and self-loathing, adoration and mela ncol√≠a, but always: LOVE that gives the purest happiness and breaks hearts (literally). The film for a viewer is similar to what the child was for the aging composer / writer / artist. We are delighted and captivated by his power and beauty as much as Achenbach was by the boy's mysterious charm.
