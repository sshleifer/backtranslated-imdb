Will Smith is very attractive as the "Doctor in relationships", here to cure all the problems of their relationship. <br /> <br /> I was hoping this was a standard RomCom with little to amuse. I'm happy to report that I was wrong. Will Smith is charming and unexpectedly "cool" in this Andy Tennant vehicle. Surrounded by a large cast of support, an interesting story and fueled by an ingenious dialogue, I committed myself thoroughly. <br /> <br /> We find this cute, quirky and inspiring without being a preacher. <br /> <br /> Rate a 7.4 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
