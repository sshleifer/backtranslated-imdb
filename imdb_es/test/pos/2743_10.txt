This is an ingenious and charming adaptation of Dr. Seuss's book, brilliantly animated by the best UPA Academy Award. Special mention should be made of the excellent music and sound effects, which are an integral element to help make this a memorable and enjoyable cartoon. The later episodes of the series (of which there were four in all) were not really based on Dr. Seuss's original material, although everyone, except the last one, continued to use his familiar rhyming style. The three sequels were: the Symphony by Gerald McBoing Boing (1953); How now Boing Boing (1954); Gerald McBoing Boing in Planet Moo (1956), although he also appeared in a later episode of Mr Magoo.
