I've seen some of Fred Carpenter's movies on Showtime, Pay Per View and video / DVD and I enjoyed most of these movies, especially with a few beers (Carpenter knows how to entertain) "EDDIE MONROE" and "ASSASSINATED PROPERTY" are my Favorites I recently saw a promotional DVD of "EDDIE MONROE" and everything, from the cast to the history and the direction, everything worked without problems. (Doug Brown's musical score was sensational.) I enjoyed watching Frank Sivero ("Goodfellas", "New York, New York" and "The Wedding Singer"), he is an incredible and very underestimated actor. But I especially liked the performance of Paul Vario, who played Uncle Benny, I looked for his credits as an actor in the IMDb and I discovered that this was his first leading role. Where has this boy been? Give Fred Carpenter the credit for discovering Great New Talent, it's only a matter of time before you see this guy with Pacino and DeNiro. As I mentioned, Carpenter knows how to entertain and when he works with a limited budget, it's amazing what Carpenter can produce. (I read the VENT MAGAZINE interview and Carpenter never made a movie for more than $ 400,000.00 dollars). Before watching "EDDIE MONROE" I saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd" both great movies. "Eddie Monroe" took me to a surprised ending due to a very good script, good performances by the whole cast (Craig Morris is a movie star that is about to happen and the main actress Jessica Tsunis was in fashion.) Excellent cinematography , direction and musical score of Doug Brown. As I said recently I saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd", if I wrote a comment on those two films, I would be saying some of the same things that I said about "EDDIE MONROE", the only thing that Two very good movies do not have in common with "Eddie Monroe", it did not cost a few hundred grand. Great movie and I did not even drink a beer.
