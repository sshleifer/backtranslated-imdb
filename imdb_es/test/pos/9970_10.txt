It always impresses me when a director (and this case manager / scriptwriter) takes a part of the classic text, and makes it come alive. Of course, the text of Shakespeare can provoke goosebumps even when hammering with its own importance, but see a production in which true inventiveness makes the most wonderful words become more wonderful: the provision of context or nuances that do not They are in the directions of the stage is simply stunning. . There are many worrying things about the work. It is a racist game about racism, and that is still valid. I have never accepted Jessica's desertion of her father without an acceptable reason. I have never accepted the position of holy saints of righteousness proper to Christians. But, brilliantly, there is a text prologue that helps us understand the times and politics in which the story unfolds, and fortunately, much of Jessica's part is cut. <br /> <br /> The text is quite simplified with many passages cut out. But I just noticed a line that cut off the moment I expected to hear it, and was replaced by a look that said it all. This judicious and economic edition has given us an exciting film, not just a movie of the work. <br /> <br /> And, finally, there is a justification for why Antonio is so loyal and generous to those who do not deserve it and are not related. Bassanio: You can almost feel that Antonio's pulse starts to accelerate when he sees Bassanio go by in a gondola or visiting. But it's as subtle as that, no more. I was bewitched. <br /> <br /> There were many other highlights. I felt that the arguments during the trial were heartbreaking. And, the tests of the suitors are hilarious. <br /> <br /> Add all that to the glorious cinematography and costumes that resonated with the times, and you will understand why I can not wait to see them again. And again.
