It is a risky business to film such a luxurious production of "The Merchant of Venice". It could be a heavy piece of wood, or it could be ridiculous because of its excesses. This version is not any. While I'm not completely sold by Shylock very restricted Al Pancino, he gives a competent and honorable performance. Antonio de Jeremy Iron, is as always with his tortured, fascinating roles. Some of the minor roles seemed to be little by little in the spirit of boisterous fun, "Venician's own story of adventures of a child", but the central plot is advanced efficiently and sympathetically through the film. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the shots, the costumes and the interiors of the location were impressive, almost to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> One thing, which I do not want to comment on, is antisemetic. Content of the work. The film is as sympathetic to the predicament of the Jews as possible, while still portraying Shylock as the instrument of his own self-destruction. It is a sad commentary that four centuries later, the director of this film felt it necessary to comment on his nuanced vision before its premiere at the Toronto film festival. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie, and I look forward to several visits.
