Years ago, with "Ray of Light", Madonna managed to reach a truly amazing level of musical art and, since then, sometimes transcends even her own standards. This concert production, with its hypnotic edition, its incredible dance, its amazing lighting effects and its arrangements that induce trance, eliminates all previous efforts. The apparent ambition of Madonna, to achieve world peace through music and dance, may seem sinister to some or to her. But hell, someone has to do it! Thanks to its remarkable talent of all those involved in this production, "Confessions Tour Live from London" places it once again among the ten best artists working anywhere in the world in any medium.
