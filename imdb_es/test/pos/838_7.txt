There's a hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima (Meiko Kaji), female scorpion, and a dangerous group of thugs (including her sadistic pimp and her equally repellent lady), operating a prostitution network with an iron fist, does just that . . Hell has no fury like Scorpio, and a determined detective, Gondo (Mikio Narita), seeking revenge for beheading his arm after handcuffing her, will do whatever is necessary (... and that includes intimidating anyone who may know his whereabouts) to catch Nami. . Nami finds an ally in the prostitute Yuki (Yayoi Watanabe), who provides a temporary refuge. Yuki has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury during a job, and must take care of him (... in a disturbing revelation, in relation to incest, she also provides for his sexual needs!) .. she, in reality, keeps him locked in a room while I worked the streets! Meanwhile, Nami is the target of a vile neighbor once she finds a place of her own (... she works as a sewer), and he threatens to turn her into an authority (.. Nami was a fugitive convict, who fled a meter from The cops) if she does not provide sexual favors. His wife throws a tea kettle with boiling water all over his face and body, resulting in death, and the prostitution clan comes to Nami to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization. That's when Katsu (Reisen Lee), the pimp's lover and confidant, realizes that the one responsible for the loss of his loyal member is a former inmate of his, Scorpio. By submitting it with an injected liquid drug, placing it in a bird cage (!), Katsu adorns his imprisonment. What ultimately fuels Nami's wrath is watching a prostitute die outside her cell, the victim of a forced abortion, which bleeds to death. Finding a scalpel in his hand (... from the operating room), Nami will be freed from the cage and take advantage of each member of the clan responsible for the death of the hooker. The series of scalpel murders gives Gondo the opportunity to catch Nami, and he will trap her in the underground sewers beneath the city, but can he catch her or kill her? Especially if Yuki comes to his aid? <br /> <br /> Trust me when I tell you that there was no link to the director Shunya Ito or his film crew because FEMENEA THE PRISONER: BEAST STABLE is another perverse, deranged, and ultra violent entry in the series very entertaining Equipped with excellent production values ​​and a visually stylistic talent to capture all the madness imaginatively, Ito takes you well (... or he made me) to the twisted drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima is on the screen. When you have a sequence of credits of prolonged opening in which your anti-heroine is fleeing through the crowded streets of the city with the arm of a man handcuffed towards her, the spectator has to know what he is in! The incestuous secondary plot is simply weird (... and is rolled in a gentle way with the retarded brother making his sister cold and numb, with dead eyes looking forward!), And the complete sequence of the abortion is quite difficult to understand. But, the angle of abortion, as disturbing as it is, provides motivation for Nami's revenge ... despite Nami's imperfect forms and criminal nature, I would rather see her eliminate these cretins than the other way around. Interesting angle with Detective Gondo, too. Gondo is willing to break the rules, and becomes a force of nature towards anyone who gets in the way of capturing his mortal enemy. Her destiny at the end, when visiting another enemy of Nami, in an isolated cell, while she observes, perfectly encapsulates what makes these films so ridiculous and entertaining. Scalpel murders are a montage of collapsing debris, in several places the blades protrude from the flesh, and Nami leaves crime scenes highly motivated to erase the entire clan in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances. While the film is essentially an adventure of comics, there is a sadness that permeates, and few characters come out without flaws. I imagine that many will get away from this mockery because of the unrealistic nature of the FEMININE PRISONER: STABLE BESTICO (... specifically how Nami is able to escape capture again and again, achieving his revenge objectives, paying all those who they have offended it), but I saw it as a caricature of violent action, very similar to the movies of the 80s, and I enjoyed it for what it was. As always, this movie has some beautiful Asian actresses and some heavy colors. Meiko Kaji, almost always reserved / quiet, but cold looking at her enemies with violent intentions, is in good shape (... in more ways than one) and Reisen Lee, while her cross-eyed and disgusting adversary, flees with the image as a abominable enemy, perfectly realized, worthy of psychological torment (... when both are in prison, Nami's forms of torture are sweet). My favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot, but it is so wonderfully wrong: a dog discovers Gondo's broken and rotten arm, walking down a street and finally finds a resting place to chew!
