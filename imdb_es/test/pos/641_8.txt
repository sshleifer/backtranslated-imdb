A couple of years before SCREAM falsified the slasher / horror genre with intelligent and self-aware young people, knowing every trick in the book of what to do and what not to do in a precarious situation, a small film produced in Russia reaches the cinemas without any problem. Great pretensions. <br /> <br /> This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Starring a cast of strangers (except a brief cameo by Sir Alec Guinness, whose scenes were supposedly filmed eight years before the actual filming of this film), told the story of a silent makeup artist, Billie, who is working on a movie on location in Russia produced and directed by the boyfriend of his sister Andy. She does not realize that the set has been closed when she is going to recover her belongings and, without realizing it, stumbles upon a porn photo shoot that becomes extremely bloody. Overcome with horror, she alerts the murderers of her presence, a chase ensues, and she is finally rescued by Andy, who takes her home while they alert the police. The problem is that ... there is no body, there is no evidence that something like this has happened. Even so, a mysterious inspector seems to be on the side of Billie's story ... <br /> <br /> And saying more would be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is the kind of movie that demands a scrutiny of visualization similar to the most intricate and intelligent thriller because, just like it is a convoluted thriller, it is one that pays its dues to films like WAIT UNTIL DARK and the best of Hitchcock in his choice of cuts of camera, inexpressive humor, Americans who react in foreign countries where they have no power and suspense until it seems that something must be broken. Even if the story becomes too implausible due to the fact that the story suddenly becomes the focus of an even bigger conspiracy, the film manages not to trick the audience with cheap shots (for example, the sudden appearance of a person in the camera accompanied by a violent wave of blows) but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away. Very smart.
