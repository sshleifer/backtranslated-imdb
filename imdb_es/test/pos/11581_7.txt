I suppose it is quite an achievement to be able to present to a public a real queue about a frail man; A tail in which the protagonist will spend most of the film face up, in a bed and totally unable to move. And, nevertheless, the achievement is in the effectiveness of the film as a dramatic piece; as a memory of a real story and I suppose as an argument about why people should have the right to die if they wish. But the film is not a political statement and perhaps fortunately it moves away from too many scenes of debate, although it does include one for the sake of discussion anyway. In addition, this is one of those foreign language movies that presents its main character as a cripple who can not do anything but talk to the people around him and yet is able to look attractive and attractive anyway. <br /> <br /> So, instead of being an extroverted plot, the film is more of a sweet but timely dramatic piece about another person who wants something or looks for something; The only difference is that achieving this "goal" would mean the termination of someone's life and would be achieved by not physically going anywhere. Javier Bardem plays in real life the Galician Ramon Sampedro, an individual who at a much younger age dived into a water cleaning that was too shallow for such an activity. This left him in bed for the rest of his life and his desire to die is the focus of the film by Chilean director Alejandro Amenábar. We have seen so many movies in our lives in which the characters have certain "goals" or goals that one must meet before the film ends to provide a satisfying experience for the audience, but the change of pace in The Sea Inside is smooth; it does not imply young, energetic and attractive heroes who go out to fight in faraway places, but a real person after something that means a lot to them. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a strong policy, pro or against euthanasia, you may find yourself hoping that Ramón will get what he wants at the end anyway. The film sets its tone very early, and Ramón gives a speech about why he wants to die when he sees the members of his family, presenting the situation immediately and subject to the audience that sees him and may not know what it is about the movie. Interestingly, some of the family members are "anti" in what he wants, which could place any member of the audience who is very convinced of the subject in their respective shoes. But the purpose of this configuration is to tell the audience 'No, this is not a man after something that, by the way, has his whole family supporting him to the end'. Quite easily, the film could have taken a route in which the Sampedro family is compared to all the others, but some are Ramón's idea; some are too young to recognize what is really happening and others seem too distressed to have an opinion other than that they just want Ramon to stay a little longer, after all, they want it. <br /> <br /> The sea Inside there is a follow-up of a story that revolves around a kind of victim. Ramón is a quadriplegic and from his perspective we see things. This is something that can dissuade viewers or make the movie look strange, given that a film is presented to us from the point of view of a victim rather than an instigator or a main character in a movie that is always inducing the cause in The cause and effect drive. But this is not a criticism and is a credit to the director for providing such an approach in the effective way it is. The movie asks questions; Offer a stage to your audience. If you were in Ramón's position: what would you do, would you think, dream or talk? Consequently, the dreams about the lawyer Juila (Rueda) are not so much an opportunity for the pleasure of the audience as a small window to the escapist fantasies of a man of his situation. <br /> <br /> Julia's study intensifies Something later, when she begins to share certain similarities with Ramón and that is when she begins to have strokes that are the result of her own illness. This feature seems timely in the progression of their relationship and adds an additional connecting ingredient in addition to an already attractive friendship. This is because Julia feels the physical pain and restraint, not in the sense that she can not get up and walk, but I think she realizes the value of life given how emotionally bad she felt beforehand. While the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of euthanasia, it seems more like an Earth drama about a man in a situation where he is prepared to fight for what he wants, but he must do it verbally. It is comforting to see films like The Sea Inside, as it not only refers to the story and gives us an idea of ​​that, but, as an independent film, offers an emotional and attractive level.
