The original, The Man Who Knew Too Much, made Alfred Hitchcock acclaimed for the first time outside the United Kingdom. Of course, part of the reason for the acclaim was that people marveled at how Hitchcock with such a tight budget compared to the luxurious products of Hollywood was able to provide so much on the screen. The original movie was filmed in a studio. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason he chose this one of all his films to remake, Hitchcock now with an international reputation and a great Hollywood studio behind him (Paramount) decided to see what The man who knew too much would be as with a luxurious budget. This was filmed in Marrakech and London and has two big international names for box office. This was the third of four Hitchcock films by James Stewart and his only collaboration with Doris Day and his only Hitchcock movie. <br /> <br /> I wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance, she would fit into the profile of the main blonde women that Hitchcock preferred. Possibly because his healthy screen image was at odds with the sophistication that Hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. <br /> <br /> Doris does one of her best performances in The Man Who Knew Too Much. Her best scene is when her doctor, husband James Stewart, gives her a sedative before telling her that her son was kidnapped by an English couple who became friends with them in Morocco. Stewart and Day play wonderfully in that scene. But Doris, especially when she registers around four different emotions at the same time. <br /> <br /> Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and they meet the Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the English couple mentioned above, Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is stabbed in the back in a market in Marrakesh and whispers some words of agony to Stewart about a murder that will take place at the Albert Hall in London. His son is snatched away to ensure his silence. <br /> <br /> For the only time I can think of a successful song that came out of a Hitchcock movie. In fact, Doris plays a prominent singer who left the stage to be wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it well at the age of 9 years. He could not go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, he even competed with the fast-rising Elvis Presley that year. That Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song by beating titles like True Love from High Society and the song of Around the World in 80 Days. It became the main theme of Doris Day for the rest of her life and even then it should be if she wanted to come back. <br /> <br /> In fact, the song is pretty well integrated into the plot while Doris sings it at an embassy party. in the climax. <br /> <br /> Instead of doing it with mirrors, Hitchcock filmed the scene of the murder in the real Albert Hall and, as another critic said, it is not directed, it is choreographed. You will be hanging from your seats during that time. <br /> <br /> This was a remake that was worth it.
