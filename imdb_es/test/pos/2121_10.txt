I went to the "Grand Champion" Commitment preview today (Dallas / Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and a couple of other Texas cities). There are very few movies suitable for young children ... but this is it, and it's great. Although the plot is a little "Hokey" (also the name of the steer in the film), it is a wonderful story for children. And I enjoyed it, too. <br /> <br /> The film represents quite well the family life of West Texas Ranch, although a little exaggerated. The director / author Barry Tubb should do well, as he grew up in that environment. He called the movie his "love letter to Texas." <br /> <br /> Joey Lauren Adams plays Buddy's single mom (Jacob Fisher) and sister 'Blow' (Emma Roberts). Look at Emma Roberts (niece of Julia Roberts); She is very good and I think she will be in more movies. There are also appearances by Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, musicians George Strait, Charlie Robison, Robert Earl Keen, Joe Ely and rodeo legends Larry Mahan and Tuff Hedeman. <br /> <br /> If you have small children or just want to watch a movie to feel good, visit "Grand Champion" when it comes to your city (supposedly later this month). Everyone will enjoy it and they will feel good. <br /> <br /> I guess since I'm from West Texas, I might be a bit biased ... no, I'm impartial. The movie is excellent!
