Wallace and Gromit have been around for some time, but this was their first foray into the silver screen. Fans of the British television series, like me, were eager to see them and the movie did quite well in theaters. Much of the reason is that the movie is fun and quite original. In a world of CG films like SHREK and TOY STORY, this stop-motion movie is a good alternative to the trend in children's films, as well as being totally different from a cartoon. In addition, compared to the previous stop-motion movies (such as KING KONG and the Ray Harryhausen films as SINBAD), the quality and movement of the characters are light years better, they look very fluid, natural and more vivid. <Br /> <br /> In addition to the quality of the animation, this film also deserves congratulations on any other level. First, the voice actors do a great job. Secondly, the script is very simple but also very nice and nice, with a few double senses that should probably go beyond the heads of children. In the third place, they manage to make this not only a film for children, but also people of all ages, since the film is not saccharine nor is it aimed solely at young people. In particular, I was captivated by how incredibly cute the movie was, and especially the adorable bunnies. I especially liked the final credits, which made me very happy to stay to see the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that, unless you're a real fan in the mud, you'll enjoy this movie. It's fresh, fun and surprisingly smart. I hope we see a sequel, and this is saying something, since I usually hate the aftermath.
