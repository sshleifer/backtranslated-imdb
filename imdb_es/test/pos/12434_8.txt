"Game? Nicotine? Fisticuffs? We're moving in a downward spiral of iniquity!" So says the head of St. Swithen when inspecting the master's field in Nutbourne. Teachers and students of St. Swithen have been ordered to share facilities in Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during World War II. Then there is the teachers' library. "The Diary of Samuel Pepys? Abbreviated ... well, that's something we should be grateful for." What's here? Casanova's Memoirs, was not that the book that we caught Jessica James reading in the closet "Decameron Nights! Whatever this place may or may not be, it's not a place to bring carefully groomed girls!" <br /> <br /> Yes, the Ministry of Education has made a terrible mistake. for children, St. Swithen's is a school for girls, and what makes this one of the best British comedies after the Second World War, the director of Nutbourne is Wetherby Pond ... played by Alastair Sim, while the mistress principal of St. Swithen is Muriel Whitchurch ... played by Margaret Rutherford. <br /> <br /> "St. Swithen's? "Says the pond." Do not you want to say that yours is a school for boys and girls? "He asks one of the first girls." Only girls, "he says happily." Does this mean, sir? "Asks one. of Nutbourne's teachers, "that we should wait for 100 girls?" "It means that not only has the ministry been wrong to send a school here, but it is guilty of a frightening sexual aberration!" <br /> <br / Miss Margaret Rutherford's Miss Whitchurch, as positive and immobile as a battleship, intends to get the best out of her by taking Nutbourne energetically, if possible The pond of Alastair Sim is exasperated to his great bald head and is determined In the meantime, there are 100 girls and 170 small children to feed themselves and places to sleep (along with all their teachers.) The cooks and caregivers, fully dressed, come out. <br /> <br /> Miss Whitchurch and her daughters, however, are the height of cooking tasks a. "Come on, Angela," he tells a girl who is trying to stir something in a large pot, "have not you made porridge before?" "Yes, but nobody ever had to eat it." "That's a defeatist attitude, dear, stir it up well and do not cheat." <br /> <br /> Things are not going well when Pond discovers that four governors of a school he hopes to lead are arriving at any moment to see how well Nutbourne is leading. And Miss Whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new establishment, they told them, at the facility. The only solution? Miss Whitchurch and Pond, their teachers and their students, prepare a change of classes for a fraction of a second to give the allusion that Nutbourne has no girls and that St. Swithen's has no children. After the parents inspect a bedroom and go to a class, the girls in the bed bend over and the children who had been hiding jump into bed, just as the governors enter. Children are observed in rugby and, as soon as the governors turn their backs on them, the goal posts are removed, the lacrosse nets are placed and, at that moment, the parents walk to observe the girls. One of the parents sees her daughter in a science class, then, moments later, she sees her in a choir practice, and then, moments later ... "There's Angela again," she tells Miss Whitchurch . "Why?" She replies, pushing the parents to avoid the governors who come around the corner. "The child is quite ubiquitous." <br /> <br /> When we left Nutbourne, everything has been discovered. The students are circling. The teachers are stunned (except for two who are kissing). The Ministry of Education has just sent several more student buses. The parents are left speechless, but the governors are not. "We are waiting for an explanation," says one sharply. Pond holds his head and shudders. "Can not you see I'm trying to think of one?" <br /> <br /> The film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation to another, supported by a very funny script and two enormously comic performances by Rutherford and Sim. The great exasperation of Sim and the implacable determination of Rutherford are so good that it is a pity that this is the only film they have made together. Joyce Grenfell, like Gossage, the tall and clumsy St. Swithen sports teacher, gives them some competition. If you keep your eyes open, you'll also find some entertaining references in which director Frank Launder works, including a gong in Nutbourne that looks like a miniature version of J. Arthur Rank's, a faint echo of The Third Man's theme and a stolen shot of David Lean's Oliver Twist, except that this time the little boy holds up his bowl of oatmeal and says: "Please, sir, I do not want any more." <br /> <br /> Frank Launder and his partner, Sidney Gilliat, were responsible for some of the best films produced in Britain during the thirties, forties and fifties. They wrote, produced and directed, sometimes making one, sometimes the other. In one way or another, they were responsible for first-rate films such as Green for Danger (with a masterful performance of Sim), I See a Dark Stranger, The Lady Vanishes, Night Train to Munich, Wee Geordie, The Belles of St Trinian's, The Rake's Progress and many others. With the happiest days of your life, Launder wrote and directed while both produced. It is one of your best.
