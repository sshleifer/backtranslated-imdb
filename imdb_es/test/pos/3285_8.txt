This was a pretty good episode. Although not "Trapped in the Closet" or "Cartoon Wars", he had many things in his favor. The character of Al Gore and that "super cereal" as strange as hell was quite funny. But, the scene that made me love this episode was one, I'm sure everyone will agree that it was one of the best moments of Cartman / Kyle. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle, he will steal his gold (which, of course, is false!), And he approaches inches from his face. Suddenly, Kyle wakes up, and they have that crazy conversation in which Cartman tries to act like everything is completely fine. Cartman shit the treasure at the end, although predictable, it was quite fun.
