This movie had a clear Woody Allen feel about it, so if you're not a fan of dry humor, black humor or clumsy humor, you're likely to find something else to do. However, if it IS YES, this is peculiar, with some nice turns and a natural and fluid dialogue. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite attractive, not like a train crash from which you can not disconnect your eyes. but close I say it in the best possible way. The intrigues are many, the turns are enough to fully capture the senses and the characters are absolutely adorable. <br /> <br /> I had a great time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Rate an 8.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
