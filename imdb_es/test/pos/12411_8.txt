This "TFTD" episode of the season one ironically titled "Answer Me" is a pretty well done and memorable episode, and it has a surprising twist at the end. You have Jean Marsh on the hill and the actress of L.A. who moved to New York City for an audition and lives in an apartment that an old friend provided. Curiously, every night she keeps awake with a phone that rings from the apartment next door, but, curiously, the house where the phone is still ringing is vacant since the guests have been dead for many years. Finally, she has to give in, she should have just followed and not answered the phone without anyone at home, since it is bad to be wrapped in a phone with a life of its own! In general, a good episode, a strange one, although on a supernatural phone still has suspense and twists well at the end.
