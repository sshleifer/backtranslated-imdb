A train that holds union soldiers is carrying $ 300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who is there to see how he arrives at his destination, but is suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However, Bahunda burns the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out, he is killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and will soon be executed. A stranger disguised as a priest comes (who after Monetero's reward) and offers to save his life for half the gold. In return, Monetero gives him half of the medallion, but Clayton notices it and discovers that something is happening. Soon the three cross each other for gold, but also the bank's insurance company and the Monetero gang are watching, waiting for their chance to jump. <br /> <br /> Just observing the opening sequence, you will know that 'in search of a western spaghetti with an ironic style and the confidence to sprinkle many references (some well made) of other films (largely the trilogy of dollar) of its subgenus. The brilliant direction of director Enzo Castellari is extensive and light in its majority, but there is potential in many of his great showy pieces and his smooth rhythmic rhythm. In large part there are a lot of fights, fist fights (and a lot of acrobatic stunts) that take place, compared to ruthless shootouts. However, most of these tricks are very well done and are very nice, and when the weapons are burning, there is energy to burn. The traditional story stays close to the conventional details, but since there are many complicated and extravagant things, the spontaneous nature ensures that you are never sure how it will develop between the three. This leads to many moments of effective suspense, intelligent turns and many winks, winks. The humor within starch writing is quite cunning. The dynamic and light style of Giovanni Bergamini, and the driving music of Francesco De Masi, are favorable in the style of light and elegance. The performances are very well adapted and form a surprising relationship. The ironic and worn out turn of George Hilton is as solid as the strange ambiguous. Gilbert Roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable Mexican bandit Monetero. Edd Byrnes gives a balanced performance as Clayton, who holds up well. Kareen O'Hara does not have much to do, but he is a worthy spectator. Gerard Herter, Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Staccioli provide good support. <br /> <br /> A fun and dignified parody / tribute of spaghetti that throws one curve ball after another and many fruitful antics.
