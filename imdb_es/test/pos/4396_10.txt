My husband received the OBWAT DVD for Christmas and it was the best gift we received! We see it every time we need to laugh and until now we have seen it 12 times. The scenery of this movie is beautiful and the music is exceptional! We also buy the soundtrack and reproduce it in our vehicles and at home when I never need to be picked up and that is also daily. If someone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers, this movie is perfect! The characters are fun, charming and their facial expressions are too funny to describe. I'm a fan of George Clooney, but now I'm also a fan of Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete), and now I'm looking for him in other movies! You have to see this movie!
