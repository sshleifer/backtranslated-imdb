I just watched this movie and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it has all your attention, the performance is excellent, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good movie, really, about a great unconditional love. The character of Tom Wilkinson is a man who is not ready for the ordeal that is about to begin, but takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor offers a performance that makes you feel the anguish and the suffering of the character. The character of Emily Watson is very strong, and you just have to take a quick look and you understand everything. I will not say more because it is better for you to have to enter the story as it develops.
