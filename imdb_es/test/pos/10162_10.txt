Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and Jo McKenna (Doris Day) travel to Morocco to spend a vacation where they meet a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel GÃ©lin) on a bus. The next day this man is killed, but before he dies. he tells Ben a secret; a murder will be carried out in London. The thieves kidnap the couple's son, Hank (Christopher Olsen), making sure that Ben will not reveal his plan to anyone. The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) by Alfred Hitchcock is a very intense thriller. It's excellent, as it always is in Hitchcock movies. James Stewart is wonderful. Doris Day is a lovely person and actress and she can also show her talent for singing. The song Que Sera, Sera has an important part in the film. This movie is a movie with many classic scenes. In the final scenes at the Albert Hall, without dialogue, you can hardly blink. This movie is already fifty years old. Time has not diminished its power in any way.
