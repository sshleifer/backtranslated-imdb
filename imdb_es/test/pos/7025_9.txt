I did not understand what that line meant ... now I do it. I did not want to see Dirty Dancing either. I had rented it but I had never seen it, and today I did. And I thought it was a really fun and great movie that makes you want to get up and dance. It's okay, sometimes it was corny ... but it's still a great movie. I can not believe that Jennifer Gray was 27 years old in this movie, my friend and I thought she looked like 18 or 19 - 20 at the most. I guess this is attributed to his acting talent. And she really looked uncomfortable at times. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can tell he's in his thirties and looks a little old. However, it is still very good. I love the songs from the 80s, so it really caught my attention, and the love story (yes, I'm a romantic one) was wonderfully done. I enjoyed this movie very much. It exceeded my expectations!
