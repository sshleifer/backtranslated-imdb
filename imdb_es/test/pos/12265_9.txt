I'm sitting going through movie lists and I really do not see anything I want to see. My appetite keeps saying: "Something like TRANSMISSION NEWS". That is what I want. Something smart and fun, with ideas for adults and great acting and writing, and a style of direction that does not attract attention. This could well be Hurt's best performance (it's this or THE GREAT CHILL, in my opinion): as eccentric as it is, Hurt is smart, and playing an unintelligent person without making sure - wink wink - the audience knows - wink wink - - Hey, I'm not stupid ... well, it's okay to act there. Hunter is perfect, and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And you can read and sing at the same time!) Great, great work. <br /> <br />
