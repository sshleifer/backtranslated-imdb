I own this movie. Actually I am from the same city as the brothers directors. But that does not make the movie better. But, if one night you want to see something that is not serious and you do not have high expectations, I highly recommend Demon Summer. Yes, the lines are corny and the plot is corny. But it contains key elements of a comedy / horror. I just want to see some kids from a small town make a movie full of effects. And I say "bravo" to the Campell brothers. Now they are making more movies and continuing a long dream. Demon Summer was one of the films that will help you start a great career with a great future.
