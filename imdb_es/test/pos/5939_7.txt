This was essentially a new version of "Diagnosis Murder" minus Victoria Rowell, Scott Baio & Charlie Schlatter. Dick is playing a college professor who teaches Criminology 101 and can not even find his own class. Barry is now a private eye, not related to Dick. This allows Barry to shoot the boys who are away from him, what a policeman can not do. Barry still gets the girl at the end. Tracey Needham plays the girl. She is the main suspect and Dick and Barry believe that he is innocent and they prove it. That's all the spoiler you get. The ending is unexpected enough that you do not know it in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not take it seriously. Do not criticize it. Just sit down and enjoy Dick and Barry Van Dyke.
