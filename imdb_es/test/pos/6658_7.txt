Well, I expected, for all nominations to the exaggerated ones and to the Oscar, an epic drama about the civil war (and something with the "magnitude" of the "English patient" given by the same director). This movie does not have an epic stature, but it turns out that I was relieved that it was not. It is a love story in the midst of the horrors of war where young people are expelled to fight, deserters are tracked and killed, and women and children in the home have to fend for themselves while the men are gone . <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought that Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger were pretty decent and that they did not know much about Jude Law, it was also good. It seems that Rene Z. had the funniest part of the 3 tracks and was able to elegantly interpret a lively and feisty woman inside the house with a lot of aplomb. It was also good for me to see the actress, Kathy Baker ... someone's talent should be more recognized / recognized. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching this movie, I can not explain why. Really, but maybe because it's a slice of Americana. <br /> <br />
