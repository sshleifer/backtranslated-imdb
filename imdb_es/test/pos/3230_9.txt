Text taken from the 2001 Melbourne International Film Festival Guide. <br /> <br /> fuckland The title is a play on words based on Falkland's deliberate misstatement of the film's main actor, Fabian Stratas, a reference to the stage of the film and rather less than subtle Allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist. <br /> <br /> Fabian is an Argentine citizen, an amateur magician who pretends to be a tourist who visits the Falkland Islands shortly after his people are reopened. His master plan is to win the final fight by seducing and impregnating the local females, starting with the delicious Camilla, and in this way engendering an entire generation of Argentine media. Fuckland creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fish-eye perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic touch and intimacy. (ARGENTINA)
