This film was full of suspense and was well directed, the black and white effect made it a great mystery. Fay Emerson, (Hilda Fenchurch) who was married twice to the famous musician Skitch Henderson and also the son of Elliott Roosevelt, (the son of FDR) fell madly in love with Zachary Scott (Ronnie Mason / Marsh). Ronnie wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture, including Mona Freeman (Anne Fenchurch) and proposes marriage whenever she can. Rosemary DeCamp (Dr. Jane Silla) (famous television and radio actress in the 30s and 40s played the majority of small-town moms) warned women about the sick mind of Ronnie Mason and the abusive childhood she had when He grew up, which caused his love / hate relationship with women. Fay Emerson and Zachary Scott would have been great stars with more rewarding roles, but their lives were short in real life. This film is beyond criticism, it is a really great 1945 film for many generations to see and enjoy.
