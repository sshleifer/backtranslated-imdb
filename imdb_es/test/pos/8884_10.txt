Did you have it with who raised you since you were young? Do you just want him to leave your life? That woman is your mother. You should respect her, you should honor her, whether she is ill or well. But that at times, can be aggravating. Especially when she becomes very dominant. This is how Owen (Danny DeVito) had to deal with "Throw Momma Fron The Train". His mother (Anne Ramsey, 1929-88), is one of the worst. He does everything he can to be a writer, and she is anything but grateful. He calls it "awkward poop", "larda $$", and "fat" and "stupid". For his friend, Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) he has his own wife's problems, his ex-wife. She tries to discredit him. So, what did Owen do? Push it overboard. What does he do? Help to return the favor, get rid of Mrs. Lift! In the kitchen scene, I liked that Owen called Larry, "Cousin Patty." And Mom said: "You do not have a Patty Cousin!" and Owen yells "You lied to me!" and The Larry Cabongs with the pan. Then comes the fun part when they are on the train and they try to kill Momma Lift. That's frustrated, and she takes Larry out of the train. Well, everything going back to normal, the ex-wife lives, but mom kicked the bucket on her own. Maybe I should have seen the errors of their dominant forms. It's a funny movie, and the cast is great. A classic! 5 stars!
