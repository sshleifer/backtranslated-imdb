First of all: if you like watching movies, I recommend you DO NOT watch this one. Why? Afterwards, I will no longer appreciate any other film so easily ... <br /> <br /> I do not really want to generate excessive expectations, but it is almost terrifying how perfect, intense and beautiful this Einar work is. Gudmundsson is. When in most of the films there is at least one aspect that ruins everything, like good actors but horrible dialogues or a pleasant scene, but a low budget cinematography? "Angels of the Universe" there is nothing of this ambivalence. Everything really is just great, even (and not least) the soundtrack of the magnificent Sigur RÃ³s. <br /> <br /> In this story about Pall, a student who becomes schizophrenic after being abandoned by his girlfriend, especially the dialogues (and monologues) deserve attention: along with (and in contrast to) the plot that range from depressing and fatalistic to the opposite of comical and totally absurd. Moreover, often (with quotations from Hegel and Shakespeare) they have such poetic beauty that the film almost derives into a surrealistic sphere and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actors. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments already referred to another point: this movie is not a trivial entertainment to relax at night. Despite several comic reliefs in the middle, it is largely unsettling, partly cynical and bitter, and above all sad. a modern poetry about a life of madness with all its emptiness, anger and loneliness. <br /> <br /> Finally: When have you seen the movie? look at it again There are some great visual metaphors and allusions in them that you realize only when you look twice and relate them to the "moral of the story". And of course: read the book, it contains many more of the little funny stories in Entre and also makes you understand a little better some things in the movie.
