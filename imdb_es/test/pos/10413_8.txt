This was one of the best horror / suspense / fantasy shows of half an hour of the eighties, without a doubt. Granted, the show had a barely capable cast with every episode, and it stunk when it came to production values ​​(ie, sets), but damn it, I have to give it some credit for being brave with the arguments. I mean that the plot of each episode was nervous enough that even I, a hardened horror movie, a shock movie, and a 70s house fan, got a little sick and I got scared. Great show, just great, regardless of what the other reviewers have said here. My favorite episode was called "Bug House", yes, that was the title, I think. Anyway, I still get the wishes every time I think about it until today, almost 20 years after its premiere. Other programs like "Tales From The Darkside", "The Outer Limits" and (of course) "The Twilight Zone" were definitely better in terms of production values, but in my opinion they have nothing in regards to the plot. When compared to this sick little show! It definitely paved the way for the even more graphic classical cult phenomenon that was "Tales From The Crypt."
