This film is about a single mother who is happy and fortunate to the point that she is almost irresponsible, and her sensitive teenage daughter who is experiencing disturbances in adolescence. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is an attractive film from start to finish. Both Ann and Adele are well described from the beginning, so we can know how different their personalities are. The confrontations inevitably occur, and they present themselves in an attractive manner. I feel so attracted to your mood and your circumstances. It is as if you are living your life, feeling what you are feeling. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon offers another excellent performance in "Anywhere But Here". She is charismatic, happy, fortunate, hedonistic, warm and loving at the same time. I've always liked Susan Sarandon, and I think she's very underestimated. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere, but here" is a captivating emotional journey.
