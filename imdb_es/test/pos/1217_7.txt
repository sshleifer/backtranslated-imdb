The Hand of Death, also known as Countdown in Kung Fu (1976), is a very underrated initial work by director John Woo. The film stars Dorian Tan (Tan Tao-liang) and features Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and James Tien in important supporting roles. Many people believe, or have been led to believe by misleading advertising, that this is a Jackie Chan movie. This is not a Jackie Chan movie, Dorian Tan is the star, but Jackie offers one of her best (most serious) early performances. <br /> <br /> The Hand of Death is about a Shaolin disciple named Yunfei (Tan) who is sent on a mission to kill a Shaolin traitor named Shih Xiaofeng (Tien) and protect a revolutionary named Zhang Yi (Woo) Throughout his journey, Yunfei encounters a young woodcutter named Tan (Chan) and a disgraced sword fighter (Chang Chung) known as "the tramp". Both men have suffered at the hands of Shih and want revenge. The three team up to defeat Shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety. <br /> <br /> The action of the martial arts is above average under the direction of Sammo Hung. Dorian Tan uses his signature high kicks very effectively as the "kicks of eighteen styles of the North" along with some "boxing of the five styles of the South". Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan also offer excellent performances in martial arts. James Tien is not the best martial artist on Jade's screen, but he does an acceptable job. Some of the first fights are a little slow and seem too choreographed, but the final confrontations with Chan, Tan and Hung are very good. <br /> <br /> Director John Woo offers a great development of interesting characters in the film, which is refreshing. The photography of Leung Wing Kat is very elegant, unique and beautiful for a kung fu movie of this era. Music by Joseph Koo: a combination of flutes and orchestral pieces of "Shaft" style from the 70s is the best of kung fu cinema. The hand of death is not the usual kung fu comedy of Jackie and Sammo. Hand of Death is a serious and direct story aimed at revenge. <br /> <br /> Hand of Death, also known as Countdown in Kung Fu, is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre. The film is one of the best artistically of its time and a sample of the great things that come from Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. Hung's great choreography is screened here before his directorial debut and you can clearly see Chan's charisma and talent. <br /> <br /> Hand of Death is a solid and elegant old school kung fu movie and a brilliant early work by the legendary John Woo. <br /> <br /> Classification of Kung Fu gender 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Wanderer to Tan (referring to his new weapon): "The Little Eagle Wing God Lance". <br /> <br /> Tan: "Just a bauble".
