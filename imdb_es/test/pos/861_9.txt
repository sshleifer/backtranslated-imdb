I watched the film at the Hollywood Film Festival in October 2004. Mark Robertson took great risks in writing an extremely difficult part for his first film and it paid off in his release of Kelly Overton. I had a strong feeling that it was coming from the theater, so I looked for it here and ... surprise, I'm right. More Hollywood actors should follow their example, give up the expensive acting classes and return to the theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a trip like this. For all the great things I can say about the film and the director (and there are many), I just can not stop talking to people about Kelly Overton's masterful performance. We will see MUCH more of your work, without a doubt. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mark and Kelly for a daring movie. Take it to the theaters so I can take all the people I made to watch the movie as soon as possible.
