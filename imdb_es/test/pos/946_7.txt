Tumbling Doll of Flesh (also known as Niku daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) This was on my wish list for quite some time, and then I finally got a copy on Ebay a while ago. It has never been on DVD, and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R, with which I am quite satisfied. The movie is, I think, the most extreme example of porno torture, with an emphasis on pornography. A woman responds to an advertisement for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed. The porn is definitely real, with the annoying Japanese pixilation to try to hide the unconditional shots, without much success most of the time. After the porn movie is filmed and the actress is ready to leave, they hit her in the head with a baseball bat and take her back to the room and dismantle her savagely in slow shots, and in one of the most unpleasant scenes , the male porn The boy screws it with an open wound in his chest. This is after both legs have been cut, your arm and some other benefits. This film exceeds the guinea pig series by a long shot, in fact, they are not even close to realism, despite the cheap effects shown in this film. In fact, this is one of the best fake tobacco movies I've seen, if not the best. Now I must warn you that if you are not in these things, you must stay very far away. This movie is very strong, and with real sex, it is in a very sick, to some extent erotic way. And I want to say, in a very sick way. But wherever you are with this theme, this movie brings the products home, and I would definitely recommend you look for it. After reading about the movie, I was expecting something very strong, but it was much better than that.
