The warmest and most captivating film of its kind, Those lips, Those eyes, made me smile and cry when it reminded me of the work that is needed to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment. Hulce and Langella are excellent and the story seems to be written by itself. A brilliant script by David Shaber (one of my favorites! - see The Warriors and Nighthawks for more ...) and beautiful sets filmed in the place (I think) in the real summer theater in which the story unfolds. You can not see this movie and you do not want to leave everything and go to the theater! Please check this video if you can find it.
