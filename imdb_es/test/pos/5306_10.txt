Every time Hayao Miyazaki makes the "tri-fecta" (he writes, directs and animates a film) he makes a classic film for all ages. He has done it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo. <br /> <br /> The story is about a fish girl who is kept on a very tight leash with her younger sisters by her father, a bitter ex-human magician. called Fujimoto. The fish escapes from its father and mounts a jellyfish to the shore, where it is caught in a dredging operation and is trapped in a bottle. This underwater sequence must be one of the most elaborate animated scenes ever drawn and stands on its own as a reason to seek the theatrical premiere. Miyazaki, who shows no fear of having a busy scene, has outdone himself. There were literally hundreds of individually drawn sea creatures of every imaginable size, all moving at the same time. <br /> <br /> When the fish escapes from the dredging operation when it is still trapped in the bottle, a five-year-old boy named Sousuke sees it in the water and can break the bottle, saving it. As she is the result of her father's magic, she is also able to do magic and her father is actively trying to recover her. The boy calls the fish Ponyo. Just when Sousuke learns that Ponyo can speak, his father successfully recovers her. <br /> <br /> After a war of wills with her father, Ponyo manages to escape again with the ability to become human. He meets Sousuke again in the middle of a storm and the story continues from there in many interesting ways. There is a factor of tenderness in this film that rivals and supposedly exceeds that of Tonari no Totoro. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided outstanding musical support. <br /> <br /> The story itself is simple, like Miyazaki's films in general, and should appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers. Although I have not seen enough to be sure, the film does not seem to be one that keeps academics in long discussions as did Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi. However, this is the best entertainment movie to feel good. I gave the movie a score of ten out of ten.
