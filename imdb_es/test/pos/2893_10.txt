"Rush in Rio" is undoubtedly one of the most exciting DVDs I have bought. Although I am a Rush fan with a bias of almost 20 years, I found that this performance is impeccable. The music is heavy and clear (which sounds great on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the audience has a constant smile ... it's as if they could capture all the concerts I've been to. For any Rush fan, this DVD is a must; In any case, only to see the documentary "Boys in Brazil" (which reveals the travels of this personal band, quite isolated). For any fan other than Rush, this DVD is a nice concert. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians. We have strongly supported them for years. I've shown this DVD (or parts of it, anyway) to those who have never heard of Rush, or those who think that Rush is not good at all because they do not appeal to the pessimistic masses of rock (ie, sex, drugs). , etc.). and a drunken frenzy). The bottom line is that this DVD is worth every penny and more than the time to see it.
