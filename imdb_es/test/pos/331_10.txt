You do not have to be Tamil to appreciate this movie jewel. I do not know a word of Tamil and I saw this movie just because a friend recommended it to me. Understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite difficult but I could decipher the story because the main actors (and the actresses) got very excited. And the girl was really cute (it was not as irritating as the children's actors in most of the Hindi films). The story is really touching and congratulations to Mr. Ratnam for trying something different. The relationship between parents and their children is shown quite realistically (I could identify with the characters in the film). It was a movie that will stay in my heart forever and I would not. I hesitate to recommend it to my friends! Also the songs are out of this world! They were beautifully illustrated and with a lot of meaning. If only I could understand the correct meaning of the letter :(
