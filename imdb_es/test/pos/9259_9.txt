My favorite police series of all time becomes a movie for television. Works? Yes. Gee runs for mayor and is shot. The homicide "hall of fame" appears. Pembleton and almost all the policemen who have played in this series. A lot of flashbacks help you not to have seen the television series, but it also entertains fans. The last five minutes solve another murder and in the end two of the dead policemen appear. And a brief appearance from my favorite medical examiner, Juliana Cox. This is a good movie.
