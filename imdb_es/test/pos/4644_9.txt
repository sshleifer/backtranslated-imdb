This is basically a silly comedy, with a somewhat strange rhythm due to some dramatic elements. For Michael J. Fox and Paul Reubens, it was his first film (Fox had previously been in a short-lived television series and a television movie). <br /> <br /> Since the movie is basically a type of race / treasure hunt movie, such as "Cannonball Run", "It's a Mad Mad Mad World", or more recently "Rat Race", there's main characters. Instead, there are character groups, which divide screen time and allow tons of mini-plots. Usually, this type of movie is a way to put the maximum number of stars (or semi-stars) in a movie. <br /> <br /> This one has teams, one of which is the main team that Fox belongs to, who are the only characters to develop. Its plot is rather a stereotyped study of Disney, about a college kid who does not pay attention to his younger brother, whom he considers a lazy punk. As they are forced to form a team, together with the older brother's girlfriend, they are forced to work together. As this is the main plot, you get the most screen time. <br /> <br /> Some of the other silly plots stand out. The Blue Team is about a rich overweight boy whose father just wants him and his misfit friends to leave the house. They end up with a fantastic customized van that had a computer on board (in 1980!) To instantly solve the riddles, in addition to playing video games with the time saved! One member, Stephen Furst, went on to play Dr. Axelrod in "St. Elsewhere", and then was in "Babylon 5". I will also admit that I still laugh when Barf, while trying to decipher a word in Scrabble, says "Fagabefe?" This is much more fun than the "Qwyjibo" of Bart Simpson, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The other three teams have plots that are linked together. The green team is a group of frat boys, mostly beer jokes that culminate in a breakdown of one when the hunt leads to the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery. They have the opportunity to harass the red team, with two feminists and two fun-loving twins. The white team of nerds is led by Eddie Deezen, who was previously in "Grease", but went on to play a critical computer geek role in "Wargames" and then to Tim Conway's partner in some of the series "Dorf". <br /> <br /> If you grew up in the 80s, then there are some classic moments in the movie that bring back memories. The first video gallery, when they were great, is always an advantage in my mind. Find Paul Reubens and his quarter-firing guns. There is also a mini golf course and a discotheque with wheels. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually a good family movie simply because blasphemy is almost non-existent and the small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent. The strange rhythm thanks to the dramatic moments of the yellow team will make parents fall asleep while their children can laugh at the giant melons in Fat Burger (oh, do they really have a special melon source?) It must be that, right?)
