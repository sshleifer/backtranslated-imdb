This BBC version of a book by Agatha Christie shows the difficulties of following a book too closely. Christie's books tend to move at a smooth pace, sometimes even quiet, and "Evans" is one that certainly does. It also has a solid school of red herring to confuse the plot. This version is extremely faithful to the book, which results in a very slow and involved story. As a fan of Christie, I gave her 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to make her way through a relatively action-free story. I appreciate much more the hardening of the plots that the BBC did for their latest productions of Christie. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is a leisurely pleasure, highlighted by the breath of Francesca Annis, who brings considerable charisma. To his role and plays James Warwick very well.
