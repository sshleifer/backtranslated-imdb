This first Warner Brothers talkie "Son of the Gods" (1930) is about the racial intolerance that Anglo-Saxon Americans show towards the Chinese. Chinese Americans are treated as second-class citizens, and whites have nothing but contempt. <br /> <br /> The prolific playwright Bradley King based his screenplay on Rex Beach's novel about an impressionable young shaman, Sam Lee (Richard Barthelmess of "Only Angels Have Wings"), who experiences first-hand racial prejudice when The girls that their college classmates bring to a party reveal their racist feelings about Sam once they learn about their heritage. Sam goes to his father, Lee Ying (E. Alyn Warren of "Gone With The Wind"), who is a rich Chinese with offices not only in New York City but also in San Francisco. Sam feels deeply hurt by the racial insults and wants to leave New York and go where the Americans can not hurt him. His patient father warns him that racism is a fact of daily life and that the only solution to racism is tolerance. Sam has yet to learn this lesson. He refuses to take more money from his father and takes a boat to London, England, peeling potatoes while on board. <br /> <br /> During the trip, he meets a British playwright, Bathurst (Claude King of "Arrowsmith"), who needs help writing a play about the Chinese. Sam and he make friends and Sam provides cultural information about Asians. While they relax in France, Sam meets a beautiful young woman, Allana Wagner (Constance Bennett from "The Woman with Two Faces"), who falls madly in love with him. It seems that Allana and her rich father are on vacation in the same motel. Everyone at the motel knows that Sam is a Chinese except Allana. Sensible about his racial heritage, Sam keeps Allana open with his arms until she convinces him that nothing could change his opinion about him. They fall madly in love together. Allana's father drops the bomb on her when she reveals that Sam is a Chinese and all the memories of living in San Francisco and dealing with coolies flood Allana's mind. He enters the motel dining room and publicly whips Sam with a whip in front of a room full of spectators. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sam is terribly devastated by this invasion of events. He thought Allana loved him but she did not. At this time, Sam's father, Lee Ying, falls seriously ill and Ying's secretary of things, Eileen (Mildred Van Dorn of "Iron Man") sends Sam a telegram about Ying's disease. As expected, Sam rushes to New York to be next to his father. Since his public humiliation, Sam has vowed not to show any kindness to Anglo-Saxon Americans; Eileen is an Irish-Catholic and probably one of her few white friends. Lee Ying dies and Sam takes control of the business and practices his anti-white racism, until he learns that it was an Anglo-Saxon person that a San Francisco cop gave to Lee Ying and his wife. The police forgot about it until two kinds of busy white social workers wanted to get Sam away from the Yings. Sam learns of this revelation almost at the same time that Allana comes to New York and gets sick. During her illness, she pronounces her name repeatedly while she sleeps and her devoted father goes to see Sam and asks her to visit her to help her recover. Without knowing it, Allana, Sam visits her and she improves, but she does not remember his visit, simply a confused notion. Finally, Allana discovers the truth that Sam is not a Chinese and they get married and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> This Warner Brothers / First National Pictures Release, socially conscious, is frankly and bluntly confronted with the theme of the race for the first time. An hour or so before the revelation that Sam does not have Chinese blood running through his veins, it surprises both him and the audience. The reconciliation between Allana and Sam extends to credibility, despite their eternal and immortal love for each other. However, in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before, they end up in each other's arms. <br /> <br /> The capitulation on the subject of the race with the revelation that Sam is not The Chinese damage some of the moral power of the film. Incredibly, "Son of the Gods" is a Pre-Code movie that seems almost prudent; For example, Sam is an American, not Chinese! Constance Bennett offers a wonderful performance while beautifying petulant and she catches your attention when she whips Sam with her whip. Claude King is good as Bathurst, and E. Alyn Warren is convincing as Lee Ying. Interestingly, Warren made a career of portraying Asian characters. Richard Barthelmess is impeccable like Sam; He offers a very nuanced performance. Despite his age, "Son of the gods" is the son of a good movie.
