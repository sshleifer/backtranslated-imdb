Sony Pictures Classics, I'm watching you! Sony has the rights to Harry's records. You need to distribute the movie and radically increase the sales of your catalog! Anyway, this is a great study of a fascinating musician, unfortunately little known, full of great stories, better music, and could have been 3 hours more and I would have loved it even more. I saw him at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, where he played in a full house. They were driving people away at the door! I went to many of the Mods & Rockers festival films, and let me assure you that no other movie was about to run out, let alone reject people. Watch it at the movies, buy the DVD and make sure that some slow-growing company [* cough SONY cough *] detects it as soon as possible.
