I bought this DVD recently and I was totally surprised that Rush's songs sound the same as when I first heard them in 1980. The lineup of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart is so talented that I want to mention them. and again. <br /> <br /> Songs that I remember like Tom Sawyer, XYZ, The Big Money, The Trees, Freewill, Closer to Heart, 2112, Limelight and The Spirit of Radio and the 40000 plus. The fans sing and have fun big and I swear that more than half of the audience was less than 25 years old! <br /> <br /> The writers who reprimand Rush in regards to Rush fans like me, are a bunch of jealous fools who like to try rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in a taco. <br /> <br /> Rush does not wear makeup, uses spikes, synchronizes lips, uses lipstick, gets into trouble with the law and has a member of the band brag about how long they have been single. All they do is entertain! <br /> <br /> I give this DVD 100 of 100.
