I remember a program in which this obese lady used a pair of glasses that allowed her to talk to her. Needless to say, he could not eat his friends, so he died of hunger. Another episode had an accountant visiting an underground sewer and subway security branch. The accountant wanted to close the financing for the project. It turns out that the security branch did not have enough funds to fight against the cannibal creatures that lived in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html
