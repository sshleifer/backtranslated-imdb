A group of young adults is stranded in the back of the beyond, where the only place nearby is a museum filled with wax mannequins, and the only form of help is Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors). As night falls, children are chosen in record time. <br /> <br /> A strange and strange B movie that combines the chilling forest setup with the very realistic mannequin plot device (which makes it a good choice). update of the genre "bodies in the wax museum", it is an intense festival of commotion in the line of "The massacre of the chainsaw of Texas". (It should not be surprising, then, that TCSM art director Robert A. Burns repeats that duty here, and his eye for great stage decoration is always useful). The score of Pino Donaggios is chilling; Accompanied by the dark picture of Nicholas von Sternberg, he soaks the film in an oppressive atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The turns of the plot vary in the level of success; There was one that I saw coming a mile away, and one that really took me by surprise, and I felt much happier about it. One of the best moments is shared with us almost at the front, as the first victim is trapped in a room with objects that fly by their own will. The stopper is a large impalement with blood dripping from the end. <br /> <br /> Star Connors offers an attractive performance as our antagonist of the good home, while the youngest are cast stars, as expected. she can not act at the same level, although Jocelyn Jones is a nice lady and, without a doubt, attractive, who has enough appeal to qualify as a nice damsel in distress. Co-star Tanya Roberts (a brunette in this movie) is well supported. (If I had a problem with this movie, it's just that the victims are a bit stupid.) On the other hand, that does not make this very different from many horror movies of the '80s. The future notable names among the credits are future directors Ted Nicolaou, who was the editor here, Ron Underwood (who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with "Tremors") as an assistant director, and the veteran make-up artist Ve Neill , who has made many films and has won three Oscars since then. <br /> <br /> Although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, this is a surprise that newcomer director David Schmoeller delivers with conviction and enthusiasm. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
