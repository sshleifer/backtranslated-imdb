I liked this movie, not because Tom Selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and also had a semi-dramatized view of some of the problems that a BASEBALL player reaches at the end of his time in Major. League sports must face. I also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the small data on how games are played differently. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a good movie to watch on cable TV or rent in a cold winter. Night and see the "Dog Day" of summer and know that there are a few months left for spring training. A good movie for a baseball fan, as well as a good "DATE" movie? Trust me on that! *Wink*
