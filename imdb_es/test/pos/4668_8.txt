Especially after watching THE MATRIX RELOADED !! * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> After seeing the Matrix with all its ridiculous fantastic fantasy and robotics characters with their superpowers, it was refreshing to watch an action movie with real people in situations that implied a real risk. I cared for these people, and although some of the stunts seemed too much, it still made me feel like "it's possible" verses, "a stupid video game" (like Matrix) <br /> <br /> This movie is not a surgery cerebral, is very direct. Some things are predictable, like knowing that someone is going to be a finisher and that someone is going to die from the beginning. Quite obvious, but WHAT? The first 15 minutes configure our reason, our motive, our main objective. <br /> <br /> I like that Theron and Walhberg did not have makeup scenes. I'm glad you did not go there. They kept him on the SPECIALLY ADJUSTED GREEN dialogue. That boy IS FUN! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that I would buy when it comes out on DVD. It's fun, fast and entertaining. The only thing (and I think it is something important) is that we are really supporting the bad guys. This group of protaganistas is already on the wrong side of the law. It is not a good message for children: parents, please explain this. <br /> <br />
