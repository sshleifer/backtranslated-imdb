Sigrid Thornton (SeaChange) was apparently born to play the role of Philadelphia Gordon of Cato, in this story that is often compared to Margaret Mitchell's classic American Civil War Gone With the Wind. Waters (Heaven Tonight) is in his best role as well as his great love interest, and the two leading a wonderful Australian cast in this, possibly the best known and beloved Australian miniseries. It is <br /> <br /> an outstanding production in every way, although I do not try to see it all in one fell swoop, and it deserves to be remembered as a magnificent portrait of life in the pre-Federation of Australia. Score: 8/10
