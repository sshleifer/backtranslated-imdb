"Journey to the other side of the Sun" (also known as "Doppelganger") is an entertaining sci-fi offer in the style of Twilight Zone by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (the team behind Space: 1999, UFO, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL-5 and others). In the film, Roy Thinnes (from the TV show "Invaders") and Ian Hendry star the astronauts on a flight to a planet that shares an exact orbit of the earth, but on the opposite side of the sun; therefore, previously hidden from view An aggressive director of European space flights (exaggerated by the late Patrick Wymark) makes the flight fast and, after rigorous training, the astronauts are ready to leave. Thus begin the best sequences in the film, the launch, the flight and the landing on the "other" earth. The dazzling work on miniature rockets (by Derek Meddings) and an elegant and dreamy space flight (reminiscent of the best moments of "2001: A Space Odyssey") are highlights of the film. The landing on earth "doppelganger" is exciting and mysterious. After this, the Twilight Zone aspect of the movie begins; with a plot raised almost entirely from the classic episode of TZ, "The Parallel". Apart from that, the film is still solid science fiction, with some intriguing 'mirror world' things to chew on (reverse writing and left-handed handshakes, for example). Less successful are the scenes that represent a land of the mid-21st century; where all men wear turtlenecks and Nehru jackets and all women wear miniskirts. Some of the relationships with women in the film are very 'non-PC' by today's standards as well. And (in the most consistent flaw of most 20th century science fiction) computers, phones and other equipment are large, colorful and clumsy (to the right of Patrick McGoohan's "The Prisoner"). Nobody foresaw the era of the digital microprocessor! If one can accept these flaws in anticipation, the film is very interesting, with a solid performance of Thinnes as the astronaut in trouble. And with a nice nihilistic end of the style of the 60s and early 70s! For fans of retro science fiction (like me) this is a worthwhile "trip"!
