I love this movie. At first, I did not expect much from this movie since I did not hear anyone talking about it and it seemed like it was recorded on video shortly after it opened in theaters. I also did not think that David and Minnie would be a good couple on screen. (I expected a lot from screen couples since I saw "You Have Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) Personally, I think Joely Richardson should have played the role of Minnie and vice versa. I do not know, I just think that Joely should have stayed longer in the movie with David. They seemed perfect for each other. But he only realizes that in a movie, the girl next door always stays with the boy. :) (As in "While You Were Sleeping.") Although I was very wrong. This movie was fantastic !!! Everything was done brilliantly. Bonnie Hunt did a great job of management. The lines were perfect with the cracks wise everywhere. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING: ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡NOVELTIES !!! For example, at the beginning, Elizabeth and Bob talked about going to Italy, and in the end, Bob meets Grace in Italy. Sydney (the ape) doing hand in hand with Grace as she had with Elizabeth is also an example. <br /> <br /> *** NOTICE: SPOILERS END NOW !!! *** <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like about the movie was that it was a bit unrealistic. Well, I just do not think that a man can beat his wife in a year when she was the only woman he had ever been with in his life. One would think that he would isolate himself from the world for years before even leaving his house to talk to someone. Instead, he makes a blind date a year later and falls instantly * in love with a woman he has never seen in his life, but feels a connection to her. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a splendid movie. It made me cry two or three times, and it made me laugh countless times (the scene in the restaurant with Bob's delicate appointment for bottled water was very funny!). Definitely, it is at the height of excellent romantic comedies like "Has Have Mail", "Sliding Doors" and "While You Were Sleeping". <br /> <br /> RENT TODAY!
