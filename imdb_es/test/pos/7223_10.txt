ROMEO AND JULIET had been interpreted in many ways, but very few of the versions captured the essence of the work. The only ones I can think of that really nailed the spirit of the romance were WEST SIDE STORY and, believe it or not, TROMEO AND JULIET, by Troma Film. At first glance, this is another splashing party, and many would think that Shakespeare's classic bastardizes. However, the film has an honest feeling about it. Of course, updated to attract young people with a sick mind, but not without merit. Yes, frequent dismemberments, body piercings, car accidents, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and incest are in bad taste, but what harm is there when you have a love story as sweet as the base? As bad as most of the acting in this movie is (I mean, it's Troma, after all), the two prospects have a genuine chemistry, rather than the big-budget monstrosities TITANIC and STAR WARS EPISODE TWO. There is a lot of modernization, but much of the original text is intact, especially when Tromeo and Julieta are together. There is a great scene in which Juliet pronounces the famous "The farewell is such a sweet pity", and the tease quickly follows him, in the mid-nineties, in grunge fashion: "Yes, it totally sucks". I think it's really unfortunate that this film does not receive the recognition or the broad release it deserves. I hope that people who see this on the shelves of video stores will not be rejected by the rude of the movie, because they would miss a subversive experience.
