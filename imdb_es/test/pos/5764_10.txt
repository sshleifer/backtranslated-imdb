It may not be Oscar material, however, this was a very funny movie. I was always a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) and Richie (Mayall). "Bottom" and "Young Ones" were legendary television series, and it was about time they made a movie. Some of the things that they manage are brilliant, from the pencil to the back, to the rubber pants, and also the infamous line that Richie says when he falls and a candle that he has in his eye. He says to Eddie "Candle in the eye, Candle in the eye", and Eddie has been the simpleton he is, sticks the candle that he has in his eye. I can not forget when Eddie is on his motorcycle, and he needs to urinate ... It was a great comedy, which should not be taken seriously, but the film lacked a ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent comedy, full of laughs and many false green vomits. A 9/10. <br /> <br />
