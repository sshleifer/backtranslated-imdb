For once a barbie movie that is good. I'm 18 years old and I'm ashamed to say it, but I'm hooked on these movies. I hated Barbie when I was younger but the movies I love. Shiver is so cute and I have fallen in love with him. He is as cute as the polar bear and totally in love with Aiden. Oh man, I'm in love with Shiver. I love Annika's determination not to give up hope and eventually it works. I love this movie and I hope it's another good one. Barbie & Swan Lake is another brilliant movie. I would recommend this movie to children of all ages (even children) because the movie is very good and I am hard to please. Barbie and the magic of Pegasus is a film that is charming and exciting.
