I think this show was right in the money for me. I saw it on the plane, but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself so as not to tear the whole place. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane was very credible (a fantastic performance on both sides)! I loved how Diane Lane's daughter performed on the show as well. She demonstrated maturity and how it was transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could be in real life. <br /> <br /> I loved this show from beginning to end. Definitely recommended for romantic people out there!
