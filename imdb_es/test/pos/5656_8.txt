This is without a doubt the most frightful black and white war movie I've seen; In fact, the only Western director during this time who remotely approached his level of intensity and visceral power in his work was Samuel Fuller. By the way, I attended a retrospective of Kon Ichikawa at the National Film Theater in London in September 2002, but I was only able to capture part of his work between 1960 and 1973. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly so depressing as it is said to be however, it also shows pleasing touches of black humor everywhere: the "dead" man who wakes up to respond to an inquisitive soldier and quickly "dies" again, deliciously ironic shoe exchange sequence, a dying eccentric who tells the hungry hero what part of the body he should eat, etc. By the way, the script was written by a woman: Natto Wada, the director's own wife! <br /> <br /> Ichikawa is a versatile and prolific filmmaker whose reputation may not be as high as it was during his peak years (1956-65), but his direction here is often surprising: the surprising sequence prior to credits (the hero is violently reprimanded by his superior officer for being discharged from the hospital earlier than expected!), the death of a Japanese soldier at the hands of a Filipino woman armed with firearms, the bombing of a hospital (with the medical personnel fleeing to save themselves, leaving the wounded soldiers behind to leave the hut at their own limited pace), the automated march in the rain of disillusioned soldiers (which also involves the issue mentioned above with the shoes that, in reality , recalls a similar scene in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT [1930]), a hill full of soldiers' bodies trying to climb it, the end, etc. Surely one of the main assets of the film is the impressive cinematography of the relentless and desolate muddy landscape. <br /> <br /> The film is notorious for dealing with the taboo subject of cannibalism (almost 10 years before it became a staple of horror films), but Ichikawa's approach is not only subtle but also very effective: the meat is actually known as "monkey meat", while the hero is seen participating only once (and quickly spits the piece along with most of his decaying teeth!); conversely, when the weak subaltern soldier (played by Mickey Curtis who, in spite of his name, was an idol of Japanese pop of the time) indulges in rage, the ground nearby is sprinkled with blood. <br /> <br /> In the supplements, Ichikawa remembers that the main actress of the Eiji Funakoshi Method (whose performance is unforgettable, by the way) arrived at the set at the point of starvation, with the result that the production was seen forced to close for two weeks until he recovered! Donald Richie's perceptive interview favors the film's nihilism about the underlying patriotism behind such heartbreaking recent Hollywood food as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998). <br /> <br /> FIRES ON THE PLAIN is universally considered as one of the greatest efforts of the director and, of the several Ichikawa films that I have seen, the closest ones in spirit are THE BURMESE HARP (1956; of war directed by characters but with a spiritual tone, and which is also available on DVD from Criterion) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (1958), which was actually given a limited theatrical show locally, as part of a week of foreign films, a couple of years ago). Personally, I also have a special weakness for the surprisingly stylized color extravagance of the director, THE PERFORMANCE OF AN ACTOR (1963), which I actually captured twice in the NFT in 1999 and in the aforementioned 2002 retrospective.
