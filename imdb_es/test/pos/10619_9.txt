Prepare for the trip to Haneke's "La pianiste" ... The psychological illness of the main character, played beautifully by Huppert, exceeds any limit you can expect. The most surprising thing of all is that you start to feel compassion for the character Erika. Trash-Sexuality (without nude scenes), perversion, masochism, incestuous relationships ... Haneke gives us a raw food, heavy to digest; Sometimes, the only way to escape the extremism of some scenes is to start laughing at him. The "staging" may not be the most attractive part of the film, it has obvious Austro-Germanic notes, sometimes Scandinavian: static, long scenes, but never boring. The configuration of Vienna, the French language used, makes everything look like a European mix. The background of permanent Germanic music (Schubert) is beautifully chosen. Above all, both Cannes awards to the best actors are well deserved: one of the best performances of the year by one of the best French actresses in history.
