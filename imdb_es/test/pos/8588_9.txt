First, it is interesting to note that one of the users who commented on this film (from Belgium) had to add that Lumumba was "communist". If this user really saw the movie, the message was that he was not a communist but was pigeonholed (for nothing more than Belgium, the United States, the UN, etc.) as a "communist" leader for other people, corporations and countries. Political and economic gains. Even if one decides to accept that the film participates in the "revisionist history", it would be naive to suppose that Lumumba was a communist, especially of the country that "granted" the independence of the Congo, and since Lumumba was DEMOCRATICALLY elected to his seat as Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> About the movie ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most important and powerful films I've seen in a long time. Representing the struggles of the fighter for the freedom of Africa, and the struggles of the ELECTED Prime Minister as their first leader, Mr. Peck, does a fairly commendable job of bringing all the pieces together into one work. And this must have been quite a task. Due to the fact that most people outside the Congo and Belgium probably do not know the history of Lumumba and the Congo, outside some light coverage of African imperialism (hopefully) in one of their Secondary / secondary schools (or maybe university / college history classes, I had a great job for him. <br /> <br /> And to think that Oliver Stone's "JFK" took more than 3 hours, "Lumumba" lasts less 2 hours and it was one of the 115 most attractive minutes, since we found its desire not to commit itself with the western powers (to those responsible for the atrocities to its people, especially to Belgium), while trying to deal with the struggles of power within their own borders, apparently, even with some of their friends, it's surprising that man has lived as long as he does. <br /> <br /> This is something that SHOULD see for anyone interested in equality, Justice, humanity, history, politics and true freedom. . You will not be disappointed.
