One of the most lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed, a frontal attack on the most unpleasant way to do justice. The final sequence, with that parallelism between the crimes committed by Poncelet and his own execution, are excellent. <br /> <br /> No, what about the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon? It leaves you breathless, they are two giants and their performances reach the highest levels of emotion. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins made it clear that he is not only a good actor, he is also a good director. <Br /> <br /> * My rate: 9/10
