Do not Look in the basement is actually a very smart and thoughtful exploitation film that gets a bad reputation due to its cheap quality and poor performance. Sure, it's not a masterpiece for anyone, but it's a very funny little B movie with a lot to offer and even many spooky scenes that will stay in your head. <br /> <br /> As I said, the performance could have been much better, but that is the case with most of the exploitation, so I can not complain. The story is intelligent and has some great twists in the plot that will keep you guessing. I thought the blood was also very funny. There's only one thing that's great about old Gore movies because they did not have CGI at the time, so they had to configure everything themselves. See this for a good time!
