The first live action foray by Gerry Anderson in the way of a great movie that benefits from the incredible work of model FX and an excellent musical score by Barry Gray. Analog computers from reel to reel, in the distant year "2069" (I guess Anderson really wanted a safe date 100 years later!) They are great news, just like the fashions of the guru's jacket, but you could You can easily accuse 2001 of the same violations, but nobody could have foreseen some things as they develop. This movie was the springboard for the UFO series the following year, and in fact not only had the same people from FX, and the producers, but many of the actors in the cast were regulars in that program. <br /> <br /> It always comes out as a future of "alternative history" more than anything else: the rocket "similar to Apollo" used in the takeoff, it always seems that this is really another planet than the Earth. Given the plot of the "alternative land," one could assume that was the feeling they wanted. We end with an ending that raises more questions than answers. That because the "other earth" exists in every movement, event and thing that is said to be duplicated as it happens in both worlds. Because of that given, and the sun in between, the two versions of the same person (in this case, Glenn Ross, astronaut) can never be found. A complete accident discovered the planet in the first place when it is most likely that it has remained secret forever. <br /> <br /> Filmed mainly in Portugal with FX work in England, it's something every Gerry Anderson fan should have. I have the naked bones DVD of the image of a few years ago already exhausted, but one expects Universal to launch it again, maybe extras and even a comment by Gerry Anderson.
