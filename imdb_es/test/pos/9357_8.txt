After a man appears dead, a soldier becomes the prime suspect. Undoubtedly, the best film to present to three Roberts and all of them are in good shape. Young is the carefree pipe smoker investigating the murder, Mitchum is the worried friend of the murder suspect, and Ryan is a hot headed soldier with something to hide. Grahame has a brief but effective role as a fatal woman. The future Tarzan Barker has a small part as a soldier. This film touches on anti-Semitism, a theme that is also addressed in the "Agreement of Knights", winner of the Oscar for Best Film, which premiered the same year. It is strongly directed by Dmytryk, who creates an effective black cinema atmosphere.
