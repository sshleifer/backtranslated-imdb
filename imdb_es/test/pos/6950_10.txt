This is an incredibly convincing story, told with great simplicity and grace. The story itself is the object of the film, although the landscape is beautiful. The performance is underestimated, even in an extraordinary way, since the characters themselves are shown in all their eccentric simplicity. <br /> <br /> This work of art will probably not be appreciated by those who see the films "casually", without due attention. It takes work to be incorporated into the story, but once you get involved, the captivity is complete!
