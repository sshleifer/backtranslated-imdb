This is the first caricature of Pepe Le Pew and, in a way, is very similar to later ones, but in a few other strange ways it is not. While the object of Pepe's affections IS a cat, it seems strange that it is a BOY cat! All this problem occurs because a cat is tired of being mistreated by others and dresses like a skunk and tries to smell like a skunk to be left alone. Unfortunately, this attracts our hero, Pepe. Most of the action is quite typical until the end very funny and unexpected, and this actually makes it one of the best cartoons in the series. Excellent animation (although the style is different from the later examples), excellent writing and a good sense of humor make this a guardian.
