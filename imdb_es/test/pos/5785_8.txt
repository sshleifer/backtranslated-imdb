A really scary movie. Going through the outbursts of James Kunstler's speech, I was taken to recently formed web logs, such as Life After the Oil Crash (LATOC), Energy Bulletin and The Oil Drum, and the data behind the Hubbert's Peak theory. Like this film, LATOC and Kunstler paint a grim picture of death or death. I hope they are premature, but in mid-2005 the increase in gasoline prices, the rise in oil prices, the Chevron Will You Join Us campaign, BP becomes Beyond Petroleum and even T Boone Pickens gives credit to the idea that we are in or near a peak of oil production. <br /> <br /> After a thorough investigation of limited data, oil investment banker Matt Simmons suggested that the Saudis may not be able to increase production in their immense fields, but that they grow old. Given the increased demand (mainly from the United States and China), the Saudis have not responded with increased production, despite previous guarantees. The declared world production of 2000 and 2004 indicates that light and sweet crude has peaked. which means that refining will be more expensive. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be aimed at baby boomers, but younger people, our children, must also understand the implications of a low-energy future.
