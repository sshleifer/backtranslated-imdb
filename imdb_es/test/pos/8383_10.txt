I must admit that when I saw the preview of "Inglorious Basterds" I gave myself great expectations. THIS MOVIE WILL NOT BE LEFT LEFT. <br /> <br /> Rarely when I see a movie with such high expectations, have I met or exceeded those expectations? This movie did that and more. Even more rarely do I applaud at the end of a movie, this I did and everyone else in the theater. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I am a bit biased towards Quentin, I grew up with "Pulp Fiction." I saw it when I was 12 and it's still my favorite and influential movie. <br /> <br /> However, since then, Quentin has not lived up to its billing. His style was becoming a bit predictable rather than familiar, the quality honestly was not there (I never saw Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse). That's up to "Basterds without glory". What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the genre of war, a sensation of spaghetti western that could only be realized by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino is the man appointed by himself in this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So let's see the movie that I'm not going to give away. The writing was successful, a beautiful transition between using not one, but four different languages ​​in this movie. Not to mention that this film was created in the classic mold of Tarantino, excellent scenes of a rich meaningful dialogue and a sudden and powerful action. <br /> <br /> The performance was excellent! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, really. I do not say it often, but, honestly, the man should get one for this movie, he spoke all the languages ​​in this movie and he presented himself with such a surprising touch and aplomb. He stole the show in a movie that impressed everyone. <br /> <br /> I have no problem creating this movie, because this is the best movie I've seen all year, and probably all next year. . Frankly, the more I think about it, this movie can break my best movies of all time, and it's the best Quentin movie since "Pulp Fiction". Take it from me, watch this movie. I loved it, it does not do enough justice to this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw her yesterday and I'm still impressed. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for making this movie. You're back at the top, friend. I can not say enough for "Inglorious Basterds!"
