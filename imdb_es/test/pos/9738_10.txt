I originally saw the Gordon flash series on PBS, and I thought it was fun and amazing, I overlooked the special effects of rockets with flares and the big dragon monster with lobster claws. Who cares this is 1936 and it was a series. so every week they would show a new chapter, the hunter Crabbe played the flash Gordon 3 times, in the 3 series. Then, in 1939 he played the Buck Rogers, in 1933 he played with the reckless Tarzan. He was a very busy actor. the sexy Dale Arden. He fractured Shannon as a Zarkov teacher, and Charles Middleton played the villain without mercy. It makes Darth Vader look like a boyscout. The series were very close to Alex Raymond's comic strip. time, not to mention lightning guns and television. This stands out as the best series in history. The trip of the second part of Gordon to Mars is of 2 chapters more, the following flash that Gordon conquers of the universe is only of 12 chapters. mongo ..., hawk men, lion men, shark-m en.the characteristic version leaves out the scenes of men sharks. To see the full effect, you should see the complete series. I heard that George Lucas was inspired by Flash Gordon when he made Star Wars. Flash Gordon was from Universal Studios. And the music of the soundtrack is of many universal films like the girlfriend of Frankenstein, the werewolf. from London, the daughter of Dracula, etc. Even today, Gordon continues to delight young and old people.10 out of 10.
