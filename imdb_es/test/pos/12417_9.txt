Five minutes later, I began to feel how bad this looked, you have a completely heroic hero and his foolish friend of a fat man. I've seen everything before, of course. I was getting ready to get bored for a few hours. This is something that I have become used to ... we have not done it all. Then, after a few minutes of testosterone fueled by insults, the truck appeared. Well, the shooting techniques used to make it look fast were awkward, but who cares! That truck is incredible! Soon, however, that is removed again and we are back with the geek and his overweight friend. But now I am satisfied that at least it will not be too terrible. Then I'm surprised again and again by the cleverness of the movie. There are so many jokes at his expense, it is as if everyone in the world were involved in this, except the two. The mind behind makeup and effects was a genius, I swear. Believe me, if you're a man who misses many of the jokes in this movie, here's so much that only a girl can understand. <br /> <br /> Brother Bob is by far the best hill killer that can be found anywhere, the fact that he is sewn adds to the effect. Of course, there are some really dubious scientific data here, but it's not always like that. When our 'hero' is bleeding from the nose and using the blood to take his brother Bob to his death, now that's rubbish. There is no way that a nosebleed is so severe that it does not mean a cut artery or something like that. I'm using too much blood, but that's taking it too far. The incest jokes are a bit predictable but fun in spite of everything. And the way Brother Bob finds his end is more than classic. In general, the rules of this film really break with the melodramatic overexpression of the horror we enjoyed so much in 2003-2005. The end of this movement simply could not have been better. <br /> <br /> This is a definite duty that must be watched by anyone who likes their horror with various secondary orders of gore and attitude.
