The Aristocats is really charming, and is rated too low on IMDb. The songs are not as memorable as those of the Jungle Book, but they were not so bad. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence is the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful I think this is probably the most relaxing animation of Disney, and as another critic said, who does not love cats? Another great piece of animation was O 'Malley looking into the eyes of Duchess, since their romance was so believable though not obvious (something good). The plot (about a greedy butler and a fortune, reminds me of Bailey's Billions) was a bit unoriginal. , but it worked very well, and the script was fun, especially the fights between the kittens. They remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. My favorite scene was the pursuit of Edgar with the two dogs, who were always fighting over who was the leader. The voices were a delight, especially Phil Harris, whom I recognized from the Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor, from the rescuers. The secondary characters, namely Scat Cat, were also well made. In conclusion, a really nice movie, which is definitely underestimated. 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
