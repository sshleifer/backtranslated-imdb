I've been waiting since last October to see this movie! (It was supposed to be released in October 1998) and now I've finally seen it, I'm not disappointed. Bloody wonderful! Well, at first it was a bit slow, but once it started, it's very exciting. Robert Carlyle is so different from Gaz in 'The Full Monty' as it is from Begbie in 'Trainspotting') that is hard to recognize. ! And Johnny Lee Miller, who is no longer with his blonde hair Sick Boy from 'Trainspotting', plays his road gentleman with the right of humor and sensitivity that it is easy to see why Liv Tylers Rebecca falls in love with him. A great movie. As Hades would say in Disney's 'Hercules': "Two thumbs high!"
