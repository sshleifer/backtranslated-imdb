This documentary is not only one of the best documentaries I've seen, but also one of the most moving and beautiful films I've seen at the time. Follow the lives of two young Sudanese, Peter and Santino, as they try to make their way into American culture. Peter and Santino are friends at first, but gradually they move farther and farther away, as Peter goes to Kansas City and Santino stays in Houston ("a land called Houston"). The beauty of Santino is in his eyes. He takes people to his back, supports an apartment full of other Sudanese, pays the rent and does everything for the others. He is a calm patient. Peter takes care of himself, gets a high school education while playing basketball and making Christian friends. It seems that the director Megan Mylan did not know what she was getting into with the beauty of this story. Peter and Santino are incredible characters that move you. But the real strength in this film lies in its commentary on American society. You are not judging. It shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be for outsiders. I suggest you find this movie and look at America through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people. <br /> <br /> My note: 10/10
