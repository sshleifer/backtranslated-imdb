A group of obnoxious teenagers goes to an old funeral home for a Halloween party. They get trapped inside and are possessed by demons that have accidentally awakened. The possessed adolescents begin to kill the others and they seem to be led by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) who floats and speaks with a very deep voice. The remaining teenagers who have not yet been possessed are forced to fight the demons and try to escape from the house. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty decent horror movie with great special effects that includes Linnea Quigley (who has a couple of nude scenes as usual) taking out a boy's eyeballs and pushing a pencil tube of lips on her nipple. There is also a scene in which a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy who bites his tongue. This is a great movie to watch with a group of friends late at night while they eat pizza. However, the terrible performance and the atrocious dialogue almost ruined it. In general, I would give it a 7 out of 10.
