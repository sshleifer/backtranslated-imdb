Dark Harbor is a little whimsical excursion towards turbid and emotional waters that run extremely deep. Basically it is a 3-character piece, with a thin layer performance of the always brilliant Rickman, with Polly Walker and Norman Reedus (also excellent) forming the other two sides of this strange triangle. A perfect cable movie for the night, with a surprising ending to boot.
