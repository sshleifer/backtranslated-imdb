I realized this in Turner Classic just because it was precoded and it sounded interesting. When I began to look, I noticed that the "critique" gave him a star and a half on a scale of four stars. I started to look scared, even old movies can be bad movies, but I quickly became involved in the story and in the performance of Mary Astor as the business brain behind a simple sales success of a salesperson. It is not a really great movie, too predictable, but certainly better than the publicized one. And I would have liked to see Ricardo Cortez more as the man who appreciates Mary but who will not give up his rich wife. I recommend taking a look just to appreciate Astor and the long way we have traveled, baby.
