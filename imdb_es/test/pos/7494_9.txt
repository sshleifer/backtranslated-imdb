It's a very good movie, with some surprising twists, a good cast and a great script. Just a couple of stupid bits, like Rasta's hit scene (Is this guy a professional?), But that has already been said. The fact that he had only heard a man at work mention it before, and did not have many opinions or comments to follow, made it even more entertaining. This gets a higher score than perhaps some people think it deserves, but I have to take into account the low budget and the good effort of the cast. I dislike that some movies are made whose budget is equal to the GDP of a small country, with an exaggerated release, good reviews, a director and / or Oscar-winning actors, and become so disappointing, with sleepwalking actors through their roles . and an uninspired direction, with predictable tracings and a story with holes so big that Sandra Bullock could drive a bus loaded with bombs through it. (In my opinion, the examples are The Terminal, Castaway, Matrix: Revolutions) Additional points are awarded for the costume department that chooses excellent clothes for the cast, especially Paulina Porizcova, who wears a rubber dress in a scene, and a jacket with "c * nt" on the back in large letters in another! A sex scene that shows your tight ass and a good soundtrack are additional bonuses! And PLEASE, enough with Tarantino's comparisons, this did not remind me at all of a Tarantino movie ... and Tarantino borrows virtually all the ideas he's had from other movies! Even if that is your opinion, are we saying that once a certain movie or book is written or directed in a way, no one can reuse the same ideas? be realistic This movie has its own style.
