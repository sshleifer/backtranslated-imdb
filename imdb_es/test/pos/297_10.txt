Bright actors and brilliant image! I love the helicopter scene with the music at the beginning, it is so touching and at the same time real, but at the same time surreal. The Vietnam War was far from human and I think that these kinds of films have terrible human beings that can act in certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending a lot of money on effects. This is just an intelligent and direct film that takes you beyond your imagination. A film that really shows evil and hatred mixed with fear and destiny. How crazy is the world and the power of will and friendship, love and passion. A movie that must be seen and without any doubt the best war movie of all time! Many tried to copy, but there is still no movie that is as close as this one.
