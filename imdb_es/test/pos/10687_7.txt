This is the question that astronauts Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry ask themselves when they discover a parallel world of Earth always hidden on the farthest side of the Sun in this 1969 cult sci-fi melodrama, published here in America as EXTREME JOURNEY SIDE DOM. The plot of the film was designed by the British writers Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, the creators of television programs such as "UFO", "The Thunderbirds" and "Space 1999". It is extremely strange at times, betraying the influence of "The Twilight Zone" and even Stanley Kubrick's classic 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The visual effects work of Derek Meddings, who would also work later on SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, remains surprisingly well during the last three decades of special effects advances; and although they are not really at the same exalted level of the Kubrick film, they are very excellent. If you do not anticipate a STAR WARS movie and can overcome the occasionally trite dialogue, DOPPELGANGER is a good movie; It was good enough for me to classify it as '7' and consider it as an undiscovered sci-fi gem.
