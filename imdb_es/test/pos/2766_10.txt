Susie Q is a great romantic movie of graduation. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that at some point the Disney company can put this movie on DVD. I think it's great and a little hilarious. It's a bit sad when Susie Q dies in a car accident. At the beginning, at the beginning, you feel like crying or sobbing. But in the middle, when no one suspects Susie Q, it gets fun and surprising. There is a bit of mystery in this movie but not much. But still, I would recommend this movie to the whole family if you like comedy, mystery or romance movies. It's great! I think Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q is cute.
