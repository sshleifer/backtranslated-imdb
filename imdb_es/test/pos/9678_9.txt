I absolutely love this program !!!!!!!, it's basically the improved version of the simpsons by the foxes (cauu, let's be honest, the simpsons are very dry if you're over 9. It's political, irrational and irresistible ... Anyone who says he does not like it is lying: there is a character for each one Peter, Stewie and Quagmire are my favorites Peter because he is rude, nasty and just does not give a shit Stewie because of his amazing intelligence and how it hits you with something an adult would say when you least expect it, and the quagmire because one of the guilty pleasures is dirty jokes, there's also an episode for everyone, if you're the political type, there's Mr. Griffin going to Washington (SEASON 3 OF VOL.) If you like sex and body humor more, there is an impossible broadcast (SEASON 3 OF VOL.2) Or if you like any other kind of humor, it has nothing to do with Janet ( VOL.1 SEASON2) Basically, what I am What is happening is that when you look at this program, there is humor for everyone. GIGGITY GIGGO GOOOOO!
