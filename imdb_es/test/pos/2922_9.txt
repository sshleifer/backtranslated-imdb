It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a young man. Not only does it last a lifetime, but it inspires him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled "The Egyptian." The audience was amazed with the scenes, the costumes and the great performance of this film, so other films were soon useless. This is the story of a young Egyptian who stopped being a father shortly after birth. With such a doubtful beginning, it is not difficult to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions. The Sinuhe child, (Sin-oh-way) which means "He who is alone" (Edmund Purdom) grows into a man and continues to ask why, even when he graduates from The School Of Life to become a doctor. During his formative years, he acquires a lifelong friend named Kaptah brilliantly played by (Peter Ustinov), and Horemheb (Victor Mature) who breeds from a simple officer of the guard to the commander of the armies. His life offers everything from a rapid increase in social status to a condemned criminal, an outcast, a curious healer and, finally, to a station in life that never waited. The good performance corresponds to Jean Simmons as Merit, Michael Wilding as Akhnaton, Bella Darvi as the temptress, Nefer and John Carradine as a memorable grave robber. Tommy Rettig, plays Thoth, the son of the Egyptian. In his last years, 'He who is alone', finally discovers the answer he had been looking for all his life, which he bequeathed to his son, now in the care of his lifelong friend. Excellent movie ****
