Teen Deviyaan is a great movie. A very windy animator and a very modern film for his time in the sixties. The music and the songs are great, although Majrooh's lyrics have no meaning anywhere. Dev Anand is a tremendous star and, as always, he does justice to his role. Kalpana is sexy and Nanda is fine. Simi is also almost fine. The film has an excellent dialogue by Vrajendra Gaur, who wrote most of Dev Anand's films such as Mahal, Duniya, Warrant, Jaali Note, Manzil, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> It's a story about Dev who is attracted to three women. - Mod Kalpana, Simi and the homely Nanda. Eventually he opts for Nanda. The story is about OK, but it has been narrated in an exciting way, and the dialogue, the songs and the great Dev Anand are the highlights of the film. A must-see for all Dev Anand fans.
