An injured Fool standing alone to protect three innocent lives. A torturous woman planning a deadly plot. Racial tension Smart Indians <br /> <br /> These are things that we rarely saw in the TV series, but this movie adds them to the mix. While this is certainly a Lone Ranger movie, mix the formula just enough so that those who got tired of the series probably still enjoy it. Definitely recommended for any fan.
