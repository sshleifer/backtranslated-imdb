This movie was one of the best I've ever seen. Just the other day I remembered this movie for something on television. It came back to me like a dam flooded. I've never been more touched by a movie that is. After the movie ended, I could not stop crying for about 2 hours. No movie has moved me like that before. I was 15 years old at the time of the film and I have not seen it since then, but I hope I can find a copy to buy and see it whenever I want. If someone suggests that you watch this movie with them, go ... you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Peggy Fries
