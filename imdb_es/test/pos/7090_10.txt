Meryl Streep as Kate, a woman who is dying of cancer, plays her role admirably. No wonder she was willing to an Oscar. In part, she shows that caring for housewives is as important as her sisters in the business world. And the lesson she teaches about life's expectations and her lack of fulfillment as the relationship grows, that's the most important thing she teaches her daughter. We can expect too much from our partners. Keep in mind that there are many mistakes and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life. This is a grim film and the ending, although sad, shows the reconciliation between father and daughter. I give this one ten.
