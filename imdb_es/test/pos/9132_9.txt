I suppose Melville intended this film to be the definition of the genius; It has the great focus of the thrillers of the late 60s and early 70s: the same discreet peculiarity. LE CERCLE ROUGE, a bitter and fatalistic story, is also the playing field of Delon, Bourvil, Volonté and Montand in the definition of roles. <br /> <br /> Bourvil is a policeman who has three cats and a daily routine in his apartment. Delon is a bully. Montand is a sick and unsuccessful policeman. Volonté plays an escaped suspect. LE CERCLE ROUGE is, of course, well above a robbery movie; Melville uses his techniques, long detailed descriptions without words of each step of the robbery, etc. However, this particular action drama is much better than its other films, and it is very unlikely that they will be much better. The appearance of LE CERCLE ROUGE is very peculiar for Melville, very Melvillian. <br /> <br /> Delon was crisp and fresh; Bourvil brings his craft, and Montand makes perhaps the best role in this film; His performance has an unexpected warmth. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the characters are hardly drawn, no more than is strictly necessary, and they are people. Or masks; however, the portrait is inspired, economical but suggestive. <br /> <br /> Another movie that shows that Delon is a good actor, very good; and the fact that he is not a genius does not imply that he should be despised as a fourth-category actor. It's good, it can withstand the proximity of a Bourvil and Montand. <br /> <br /> Only ten years. Before LE CERCLE ROUGE, Melville was doing, towards the end of the 50s, a boring tasteless insipid noir pastiche (starring himself) and after only a decade, here he is, in top form, with this amazing action drama. Stylistically, it is a success. <br /> <br /> Before seeing LE CERCLE ROUGE, I was not a fan of Melvillian; Now I think I prefer to be one. <br /> <br /> LE CERCLE ROUGE is a drama, that is, an action drama, one of the most demanding genres. Melville scores.
