It is a completely successful example of a biographical film of the fifties. It has the young hero strong and handsome - well, he is not so young on the screen anymore; Magnificent, though improbable, Billy Wilder's address; an exciting fully orchestrated musical score of edifying scales and, when required, celestial strings by Franz Waxman; strong support players; an exciting story The stunning photograph of Hitchcock's favorite, Robert Burks; and a narration about a singular historical event. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Jimmy Stewart while Charles Lindbergh tries to sleep a bit at a Long Island hotel before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic, from New York to Paris. . And he can not sleep. <br /> <br /> The flight itself is full of flashbacks to Lindbergh's personal story and the purchase and construction of his only high-wing monoplane, The Spirit of St. Louis. St. Louis, Missouri, is the home of the association that sponsored the flight. (Even in 1927, the money spoke.) Anyway, the movie had to have multiple flashbacks and Stewart's narrative. What is the alternative? Looking at the units? Thirty-three hours of watching Jimmy Stewart sitting silently at the controls of his noisy plane while the days and nights come and go? I found the script and the awesome direction for your time. Unpleasant things, of course, are left out, so as not to present more ambiguity than the contemporary audience could handle. <br /> <br /> My bet is that the mob that surrounds Lindbergh in Le Bourget broke the plane into pieces to buy souvenirs. . And, of course, nothing about the pilot's relief tube, although it would have added more opportunities for humor. Some of the spectators today will find some corny incidents if they think too much about them. Overhead, Stewart converses with a friendly hitchhiker fly that, in his own calm and worried way, wakes him up landing on his cheek at a critical moment. Later, the St. Christopher medal that Father Hussman gave him hits lightly against the crystal glass of one of the instruments just as Stewart is desperately trying to land. Atheist Stewart is saved twice, once for a fly and once for God. <br /> <br /> But that does not matter. It is an awesome movie. The landing at Le Bourget, with an exhausted Stewart behind the joystick, confused by the searchlights, sweaty with fear and collapsed with fatigue, is really convincing. "I'm going to break this plane," he says to himself, and we can believe him. <br /> <br /> Flying in a plane is not like driving a car. There is no road with smooth curves that tell you where to go, nor lanes to provide guidance. You're busy every second. You should observe the instruments, check each end of the wing to see if they touch the horizon, the same as the nose of the plane, and constantly monitor up, down and to the sides to detect another type of traffic, although the latter would not have been a big problem for Lindbergh. I was alone on the ocean. <br /> <br /> Why? In one of the movie's most popular moments, Stewart and Murray Hamilton, two gypsy farmers of the 1920s, rest near their planes in a mid-western field. "What is it, what makes us love the flight so much?" Asks Hamilton. (There's no answer). Later, his financial supporters try to dissuade him from getting off the flight. Five other aviators have already died trying. "You do not understand, you have to," says a passionate Stewart. <br /> <br /> Well, that's not a great answer either. Why does it have to be done now and why is it for Lindbergh? Why not wait ten years and stop losing lives in the meantime? The answer, dear Socrates, is partly in our glands. The pilots are a peaceful and confident group, given to occasional jags of excitement. Your main problem may be an addiction to an internal surge of adrenaline. It's a joke. Some of my best friends are pilots. However, Lindbergh must have been a good boy. He deserved to be treated like a hero. Not only for the flight itself, but for his subsequent behavior: quiet, modest, a family man. We can easily forget his admiration for Hitler, as he more than made up for it by proving the Corsair fighters in the Pacific and advising the Navy on how to adjust the planes and get the best performance from them. <br /> <br /> See it if you have the opportunity. If nothing else, it's a history lesson told with visual splendor.
