I can not see how a movie of this quality only gets an average of 5.7 from the IMDb voters. It is a classic Australian production that resembles recent efforts like LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES, THE SUGAR FACTORY, OCCASIONAL GROSS LANGUAGE, RUSSIAN DOLL, PEOPLE SIGN, THE SECRET LIFE OF US, THE ESPAGNOLA, STRANGE PLANT, FRESH AIR, OUT OF THE WAR, MAKING TIME FOR PATSY CLINE, etc ..., as a 19-year-old college student (Newton, perhaps in his best role so far, on par with CHANGI) with a bored and overly religious mother receives the impact of his life when she decides to enroll in the same course as him, and before you think about ANOTHER GOOFY MOVIE, it is not, there is something really important here. Sure, it's a simplistic view of life in general and of art students in particular (but then they're pretty simplistic under all that mumbo jumbo philosophical, right?), And maybe the study of the character of Sinead Cusack is a Little confusing at times, but the movie is bright, fun and has some important messages. The main cast is fantastic: Cusack and Newton are wonderful, and Rose Byrne (also seen in THE GODDESS OF 1967) is so underestimated that it's not funny. She is a beautiful, fresh and confident actress who deserves all the accolades she receives. I gave my mother frank 8/10.
