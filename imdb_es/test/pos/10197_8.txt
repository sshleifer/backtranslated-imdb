As a fan of robocop, I've always loved this movie. I saw it when it first came out, and I finally bought it on DVD from Brazil, it was never released in the United States on DVD. I like the movie, but like everything else in this world, everyone has their opinion, they love it or they hate it. No matter what a movie does, someone will always say "why did not they do it differently?" In other words, you can not please everyone. If you love robocop, you will love this movie. For me, it is so unique that it is not cheesy, or silly like many low budget movies. This movie always kept me interested. I can see some scenes that Robocop borrowed from here, but tell me, what movies do not do that? Many films use other ideas from other films and, sometimes, change them. funny movie
