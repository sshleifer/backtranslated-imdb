This film is basically a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved. It is always interesting to see the history of the "other side" for a change. This film concentrates on a group of German soldiers who, after fighting in the North African campaign, are sent to Stalingrad, Russia, where one of the most notorious and bloody battles of the Second World War is being fought. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see the other side of this battle, since mainly, we always see the Germans simply as the "villains". In this movie, these 'villains' are given a humanitarian face and voice, and that makes you realize that the only real enemy in war is the war itself and not necessarily against those you're fighting against. At the beginning it's a bit difficult to concentrate on the movie because you always have in mind that the Germans are the evil villains. But, of course, you get used to it quickly and soon you adapt to the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to worry, and you care about them. <br /> <br /> The way this story is told is However, it is not the best. It is difficult to keep track of the story sometimes, as it jumps from one sequence and location to the other. The film is not always logical in its narration and presents too many sequences that are still too vague. It is also quite difficult to keep the characters separate and see who is who. It does not always make this film easy to see, but, on the other hand, there are many sequences and enough moments in this movie to be worthwhile and interesting, but not the most coherent. In that sense, Hollywood movies are always better than European films. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are high and present some scenarios and locations with good looks, although the film was not even filmed in Russia itself. It helps create a good wartime atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The character is mostly interesting, although maybe a little formulated. But I do not know, for some reason, the formula characters always work well in war movies and reinforce drama and realism. It also helps that they are being interpreted by well-chosen actors. All the actors are not the most well-known actors (Thomas Kretschmann was also at that time a quite unknown actor) but each one of them fits well in his role and gives his characters a unique face and personality. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not the best or most consistent drama of World War II, but it is definitely worth seeing, due to its original focus on the German side of the Battle of Stalingrad and its good values ​​of production. <br /> <br /> 7/10
