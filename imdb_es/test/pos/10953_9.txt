Slow but intelligent movement. It happens to you as if you lived it. Full of ideas that provoke ideas, art, career and be cool. What struck me most were the ideas about rock and roll lifestyles. <br /> <br /> all the performances were improvised, I'll say it again ALL THE PERFORMANCES THAT WERE IMPROVED seems like a trick, but it does not make these characters real and that they are like some of the ones that you would be left with. This is also surprising when you think about how strong the character is in this movie. From the beginning, in the sequence of the title, it is immediately established that Ben is an outcast by the way he moves through the crowd. <br /> <br /> It's okay, it breaks down like this if you're a person who lives the jazz / rocker lifestyle. you will like it if your intelligent and understood is a great cinema of total shit, you will love it and if both of you, then it could be your favorite <br /> <br />, but if you are not one of these, you will probably think it is boring and say you do not follow "a line" and write a review like Ben_Cheshire
