A good story, well acted with twists of unexpected character, for example. the vicious murderous gangster Bryan Brown teaching his macrame son. Although it is successful as an action drama in which you expect the good boy (Ledger) and his gilrfriend to succeed, he also has a hilarious ironic black humor, for example. the bank robbers who become "winners" of the radio competition and its reaction, the revenge of the entrepreneur, etc. It's worth seeing them.
