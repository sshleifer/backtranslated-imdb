People must learn to see what is on the screen. This is a great movie that is based on a slow and careful compilation of details that serve to establish the personalities of these two men. The passivity of Yusuf (Emin Toprak), the cousin of the country, is well described by his fear of talking to women. You have at least three opportunities to start a conversation with a young woman and lose them all. He has many decades of singleness ahead, and maybe also unemployment. <br /> <br /> Mahmut is a different case. He left the small city working very hard (we imagine), and his resentment of the lazy as Yusuf is palpable (leaves crumbs on the expensive carpet, the slobber!). We are shown a group of friends who talk about Tarkovsky, among other things, and we note that Mahmut feels repentance, but only a slight regret, that his work has become commercial over the years. The gap between the cousins ​​widens more and more. The theme of the mousetrap is wonderfully vivid, revealing Yusuf's compassion and confusion and solving Mahmut's cold-blooded problems. <br /> <br /> I remembered two classic films of men going crazy: Chabrol's cousins ​​(the rich guy with Hitler pretensions played by Brialy is always in my mind) and Kiss of the Spider Woman (William Hurt can not understand why everyone is so bad). Nuri Bilge Ceylan takes his place among the dozen important directors who are now active. I only hope that in the future I trust the collaborators, instead of directing, writing and filming their own films.
