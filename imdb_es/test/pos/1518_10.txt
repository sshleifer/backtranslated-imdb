Simply beautiful. One of the best minds ... umm ... screws --- in existence. Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the fullest in this story of a children's book writer who ... maybe? - He has written a subversive section. Moscow could learn some things from the techniques of torture in this film. They could also do worse than hiring Alan Rickman. Five out of five stars, and currently (1-20-2000) # 2 in my 100 best movies on the all-time list.
