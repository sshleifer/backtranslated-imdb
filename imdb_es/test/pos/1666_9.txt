I heard that they were going to remake this French classic in 2007, and I see that it is in development for 2011. This will be a shame, since Hollywood expelled the writer / director Jules Dassin because of the infamous blacklist. They should not have the right to redo any of their movies. <br /> <br /> I love the "caper" and "film noir" movies, and this combines the best of both. <br /> <br /> Tony (Jean Servais) comes out after making a nick, and after he hits his old girlfriend (Marie Sabouret), plans a great score with his friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Jo (Carl MÃ¶hner), what makes this a great flick adventure is the attention to detail in planning the theft. You see it reflected in George Clooney Vegas capers. Nothing is left to chance. <br /> <br /> The caper goes very well, but Grutter (Marcel Lupovici) sends his sons, Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset to find Tony and the gang. After blowing it with Mario, they kidnap Jo's son. Many bullets fly before it ends. <br /> <br /> A great movie by a great director. The standard by which other caper movies are measured.
