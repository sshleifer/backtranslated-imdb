Akin's award-winning film, Head-On / Gegen die Wand, described the chaotic world of a self-destructive but dynamic Turkish-German rocker called Cahit (Birol Ünel). This documentary is a branch of Head-On and explores the range of music that can be found in Istanbul today if it were as energetic and curious as the avant-garde German musician Alexander Hacke of the group Einstuerzende Neubauten (who organized the soundtrack and made some of music for Head-On) and was assisted by a film crew and Turkish speakers provided by director Akin. You get everything from rap to the most traditional Turkish classical song, with rock, Kurdish music and Turkish pop in between. It is a world as chaotic and open as that of Cahit, one where East is East and West is West but the two, in some way, meet. <br /> <br /> Like Istanbul itself, which sits on the border between Europe and Asia and brings the two worlds together while maintaining sui generis, this is a mix that includes Turkish pop, traditional Turkish songs, Kurdish laments , jazz musicians from Rome and a group of street musicians (Siyasiyabend), animated and extravagant takes of the street life of Istanbul. , and some speak in camera about synthesis and some personal and musical history of singers and musicians. Working at the Grand Hotel in London in the Beyoglu district of Istanbul, where Cahit stayed at the end of Head-On while looking for his beloved, Hacke toured the city with the team and the team, interviewing people and recording their music. <br /> <br /> Did it start with a bit of strong rock by the "neo-psychedelic" band Baba Zula? these are musicians with whom he linked as he assembled the score of Head-On and he represents the absent bass player here, and by the Turkish rappers (including the brave woman)? therefore, some old people leave the theater early and miss the predominantly melodious and easy to listen sounds that make up most of the film. (The narrative excesses of Head-On were periodically moderated by musical interludes conducted by a traditional Turkish orchestra sitting outdoors on the other side of the Bosphorus). Hacke gives us the opportunity to meet and listen to the interpretations of some of the best known live Turkish singers, including Müzeyyen Senar, a lady of about eighty, whose old and elegant musicians remember the way in which the great Egyptian singer Umm Kulsoum used to perform . Hacke gets Orhan Gencebay, the composer and composer of films, to make a striking solo on the long-neck oud in which he has written all his songs, and convinces the now elusive great Sezen Aksu. To make a special presentation of one of his most famous songs, "Memory of Istanbul". This is a coup d'etat, and so is the lament of a beautiful Kurdish singer Aynar recorded in a bathroom whose acoustics are spectacular, if only they could turn off the heat. The faces of singer and musician are filled with sweat. There is also a young Canadian, Brenna MacCrimmon, fluent in Turkish, who sings traditional Turkish songs with expression and fervor. The sound mix is ​​of high quality throughout. One would like to see a sequel; many great examples of Turkish folk and classical music have necessarily been left aside. <br /> <br /> Movie released in the summer of 2005 and shown at festivals in 2005 and 2006. Inaugurated at the Angelika Film Center in New York City on June 9. 2006.
