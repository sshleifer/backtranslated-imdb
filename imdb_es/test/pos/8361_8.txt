Like many episodes of the Twilight Zone, one of my favorite parts of this was the open social commentary that Serling is making with the story. As in the case of a recent episode "The Howling Man", I recalled my old suspicion that, for example, if Jesus was going to come to earth to take his followers to heaven, he would be judged immediately as insane and probably thrown . in an asylum. Our main character in this episode encounters a similar problem when we tried to convince the Americans of the 1860s that he is from the future and that President Lincoln is about to be killed. The episode mistakenly states that this means that some parts of the past can be changed, while others can not, but it is a fun time to travel. <br /> <br /> Of course, we do not know for sure if History could be changed with time travel, because time travel has never been achieved and, unfortunately, never will be. But it seems logical to me that, if you could physically place yourself in a time of the past, you could physically prevent something from happening, as long as you did not hold yourself like a madman screaming about murders. <br /> <One of the consistently interesting things about time travel movies and television shows, in my opinion, is the method by which time travel takes place. There's really no method here, our main character is having a conversation about time travel in an elegant gentleman's club and then walking outside and dissolving from the early 1960s to the mid-1860s, but not it matters So far, the penumbra area has not impressed me because of its complex sets or high production values. <br /> <br /> Russell Johnson plays the role of Peter Corrigan, the time traveler, and upon discovering that he has somehow been transported back to the exact day of Lincoln's murder, he manages to get him into the jail, but fortunately for him, John Wilkes Booth, for some reason, was simply at the police station and listened to the frantic Corrigan trying to describe the murder. that Booth was planning for that night. <br /> <br /> Booth requests custody of Corrigan for some psychiatric experiments, and the police officer sees nothing wrong with giving custody to this guy. After all, I had a business card, how bad could it be? <br /> <br /> The program seems to suggest that you can change people's lives by slightly altering events in the past through time travel, and while I am not willing to accept that time travel include such limitations, it's still a fun episode that really makes you think, which is one of my favorite qualities of good shows in the twilight zone ...
