Here is a science fiction from the 50s much less known with a different touch. A son of atomic investigators is kidnapped and held for a rescue of the Father's atomic secrets. <br /> <br /> This is an atomic sci-fi thriller very close with great production values ​​and an above-average performance, even from children. The atomic city actually has a movie feel, unlike many other science fiction films of this era that resembled more of an episode of a television show. <br /> <br /> The atomic city was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay: how many other 50 science fiction can promote a Nomination to the Academy Award? <br /> <br /> Great pace, close address and an excellent location to shoot in the "real" Atomic City of Los Alamos New Mexico makes hunting worthwhile. The impression of collectors in circulation is a transfer higher than the average and makes it a great double feature with atomic man. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
