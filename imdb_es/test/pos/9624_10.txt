This was the first kung fu movie I've seen. The dubbing is not the best but much better than some I had seen. The plot is much better than some that are made today. Sometimes it's bloody, but that's what gives it that special impulse. The Academy award material is not. But if you like to see fights and a decent background story, this is for you!
