One of the best and most inspiring movies about a different culture that I've seen in years. Tragic and moving It's worth the watch. maybe a few times. We all know how brutal kids can be. I know from my own experience and that of my brothers when they were children, and this movie hit the nail in the head. perfectly! The operation of Kite is incredible and I need to investigate about the validity of that event. Even though it is done in CGI it is still amazing and very interesting. maneuvering a kite like that with a single rope seems impossible but they make it believable. Anyway, this movie has many twists and turns, I'm sure many, probably are easy to understand, but they hit me before I could. What makes a great movie for me! When you discover the full movie in the first 10 minutes, you screw it up. but he does it so softly that it's hard to guess even when it happens ... I'm a guy and I do not mind saying that the tears were flowing at more than one point in this movie.
