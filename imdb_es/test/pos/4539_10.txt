This is one of my favorite movies of all time. How pathetic do you say? Well, it is. But Chris is incredibly, incredibly funny. His innocent brilliance comes out in this movie more than in any of his other films. Look at the two scenes of the motel, when Spade is trapped with the zipper down, and the other: "JUST FOR THE LOVE OF GOD !!!"
