Coppola early with a sublime cast that most people could never see (a pity). There are some wonderful things in this: the best performance of Shirley Knight (an underestimated actress), a road trip in the late 1960s, James Caan very restrained and moving, Robert Duvall in a role in which he was born to play ( nervous, lonely, motorcycle, and a moving script with F. Coppola behind the wheel. <br /> <br /> If this had been done five years AFTER by someone, it would have been a success (both for timing). modes, I recommend it to all people who do not need explosions in outer space and bad jokes or a budget of a billion dollars to sit for a few hours and see how a story unfolds. Give it a chance if you can find it!
