The mystery and its solution was a great black feat. However, I have some questions, maybe I was not paying enough attention. <br /> <br /> Who killed the neighbor and why? Who killed the replacement girl and why? <br /> <br /> And some small objections, they should have shown the stop at the hotel for the change. Not that they should have shown the switch, but they should have taught Jim and the girl that went to the hotel, Jim going to the bathroom, going out and the barman told him that his girlfriend was going to the car without him. <Br /> <br /> Then, Jim returned to the car and saw the woman asleep, and the little girl in her backseat. <br /> <br /> This would have given the viewer a sporting opportunity to discover the solution. <br /> <br /> Although I would like to have recorded it, I would like to see it again.
