The three shorts included in this compilation issued in 1959 are Chaplin classics, there is nothing wrong with it and there is nothing to criticize either. Chaplin's score for these films and the added frame as bridge sections between the shorts are also well made. The problem with this compilation is minor, but annoying. The shorts have been printed elastic to fit the 24 p. The speed of contemporary films, while the shorts themselves were filmed at 20 frames. The result is a sudden movement that does not seem very attractive, and yet, this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at that time, it is simply not excusable that the current version of the DVD is not restored, the movies they look dirty as they did in 1959 and still print in stretch. There are separate restored versions of these available classics, even on DVD, and it would not be a problem to restore the image, but unfortunately this has not been done. <br /> <br /> A small dispute has taken a lot of space in my article, but I repeat a small objection, I should not detract from the experience, although it subtracted a point from my rating. The shorts are still worth '10'.
