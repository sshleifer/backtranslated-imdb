The Stepford Children, besides being very good for the television movie, show the very disturbing result of indoctrination. It is quite a statement about how to be made to act within the limits of what is considered a "good" behavior can destroy what makes a person unique and individual. I think this is a movie that parents who want to keep a bit of the idea that the homeless inside the hearts and minds of young people should watch with their children and discuss what the movie is saying. I do not know if that was the intention of this film, but I have always thought that it is one of the best cinematographic devices against the desire that children conform to an unreal and dominant pretension of what is in the best interest of anyone who does not be it the children themselves. I hope someday to see this movie on DVD. I'm at the exit door ... waiting.
