Garlin did a great job. Good concept well executed, and well produced. It came as a very sincere story. As a fan of "Curb Your Enthusiasm", where Jeff was practically the role of heterosexual man, I loved the depth he brought to this role in a simple but effective representation. <br /> <br /> Much of the humor was discreet and subtle, and was inspired by what I really liked, instead of being slapstick or over explained. And there were some small surprises and nice turns. The cartoons of the convenience stores were delightful. <br /> <br /> When I say it's a wonderful "little" movie, I do not mean budget or quality. It is simple, intimate and handmade. Tell a highly credible everyday story. Relax and go see it. Let me bathe you, and you'll feel good for doing it.
