This is one of my favorite books and I remember seeing this series and loving it immensely. Unfortunately, I have never seen it repeated nor have I been able to record on DVD, but it had such a great impact that I have never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> The main characters were perfect for the roles, especially the charming Bryan Brown and Although the scenes in Australia were not totally in line with the book, at least they were there, unlike the film version with Virginia McKenna, who missed that part completely. <br /> <br /> I agree that Gordon Jackson's Strachan character is completely different from the book but still excellent. For your information, "MOLEY75" "Strawn" is the Gaelic pronunciation of "Strachan".
