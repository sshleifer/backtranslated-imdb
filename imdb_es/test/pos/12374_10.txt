This movie is a masterpiece to put it simply. Especially the double exposure made by cameraman Julius Jaenzon. It is cleverly done even with the standards to which we are accustomed today, seventy-eight years later. Viktor Sjöström, the director, also plays the main character, David Holm. On New Year's Eve, he dies in a fight, and legend says that the first one to die in the new year, will have to work as a collector of souls in the form of a transparent ghost. Each year a new soul collector is named. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the alcoholic, David Holm, rises from his dead body (as if the soul left his earthly body) in the cemetery of the church. (where the fight was held) is a real prize for an eye in love with cinema. Also when the present collector of souls arrives with his horse and his carriage, it is a beautiful but also terrifying scene. David Holm recognizes this soul collector as a drinking friend of the previous life. Now it's your turn to take charge. Like Scrooge in Dickens' story "A Christmas Tale," David is shown what his life and actions have brought to the people around him. <br /> <br /> The film is about the danger of drug abuse, in this case alcohol. It is based on a book by Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf. Viktor Sjöström filmed some of his books, but this is the one that has the best result, maybe because this is the most filmic of them. <br /> <br />
