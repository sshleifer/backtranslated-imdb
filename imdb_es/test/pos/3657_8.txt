Hari Om deals with an impossible love between a French tourist and the auto-rickshaw driver who agrees to take her to a date with her indifferent boyfriend. A kind of third world road movie, which moves from the exuberant reverie to the crazy comedy, is distinguished by the star performance of Vijay Raaz, who has become one of the busiest actors in India after his appearance as an event organizer at the Monz√≥n de Mira Nair wedding. <br /> <br /> In an interview, Raaz shows that he has not been affected by his success, responding in a very careful and thoughtful way to the questions. He discovered love for acting and joined a major theater company while he was in college, but for someone with such formal training he is surprisingly inarticulate about his craft. He speaks of honesty and purity as the sources of his focus, and the clarity of his desire to communicate something authentic to the audience is clear. On the screen, Raaz conveys emotional integrity and dramatic security that elevates his characterization to an extraordinary level, and Director Bharatbala has directed and directed it perfectly. He has a wonderfully expressive face in which the camera delights; the close-ups of that face are as convincing as the photos of Camille Natta, who is as beautiful as the French Isa.
