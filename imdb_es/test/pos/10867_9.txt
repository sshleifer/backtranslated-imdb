This film gives Daniel Wu the opportunity to make a great action movie, but I really find that the character of Emil Chow is really great, brave but determined to correct mistakes. Also, the main terrorist, makes me think about his revolution, makes me wonder if he is doing this for better or for worse. <br /> <br /> A movie that tells us about Todd, an amnestic terrorist tricked as an undercover until he learns who he really is. The consequences that he makes of his terrorist family, give him the option of redemption. <br /> <br /> Purple Storm was one of the best I've seen this year. The film really stands out when it is full of tremendous action scenes prepared by Stephen Tung Wai, who won the best action sequences at the Hong Kong Awards. (9/10)
