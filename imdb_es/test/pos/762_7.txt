I thought it was going to be a terrible movie, honestly, I mean, Rupert Grint, RON, acting in a different Harry Potter movie, it was really hard to imagine. But when the movie started, it showed that this guy has talent, I mean, is he the best actor in the HP trio? As a reference, have you seen Emma Watson trying to act? Or what about Daniel's performance? Both lack experience even though they have performed in a million Harry Potter movies. Ben, his character is a very shy boy, unable to show his true feelings about everything, his contempt for his ruling mother and resentful anger towards his father who can not step forward and face his unfaithful wife. Julie Walters was absolutely brilliant! His interpretation of an old retired actress who tries to live with the shadow of his past, while trying to remember the sonnets of Shakespeare is absolutely wonderful! In addition, it seems that many young people are wasted in religious acts without meaning.
