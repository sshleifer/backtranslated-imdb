I do not understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2 / 10? It really is great, very fun. I would highly recommend this movie to all of you, adults, teens and especially children! <br /> <br /> The story is about a 14-year-old boy who always lies, at home and at school. One day he had his homework to write a 1000 word story. But he did not, so the teacher told him to write it and gave it to him in 3 hours, or he would have to go to summer school. Yes, he wrote it at 2:45. "Big fat liar", I think it was a story about himself. On the way to school, he hit a limousine of a famous Hollywood producer and took him. But the boy forgot the story in the limousine. He told his parents and the teacher, but of course, they did not believe him. And the producer of the film, took the story of the boy as his new movie, "Big fat liar." When the boy saw the movie trailer, he told his parents that he had written it, but they did not believe it. So, he and his friend had to go to L.A to prove one thing: the truth is never overrated. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this great movie, you will not be disappointed. Do not trust the rate of 5.2 / 10, it must be 9/10! Believe me! <br /> <br /> P / S: I'm sorry, my English is not good enough to make a better comment!
