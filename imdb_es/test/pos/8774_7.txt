In general, this is an entertaining and strange movie. Do not try to make sense of it. There are more holes in the story than a computer could follow, but Robert Cummings and a cast of supporting characters are fun to watch in this "Fugitive" story. <br /> <br /> Unlike the popular television After the 1993 movie, this fugitive is not looking for a man with one arm, but a Nazi two-armed saboteur named "Frank Fry". Cummings ("Barry Kane") is blamed when a defense plant explodes in Los Angeles and starts looking for the man who made it (Fry) to clear his name. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. Then, Priscilla Lane ("Pat Martin") enters the story, and begins to get stuck a bit with a little dialogue. Director Alfred Hitchcock often did that with his female characters, to the point that I wonder if he had any idea how the woman talked. Lane's character here was a bit lame. <br /> <br /> Actually, the villains played by Otto Kruger ("Charles Tobin") and Norman Lloyd ("Frank Fry") were the best, in my opinion ... .. just fascinating. Kruger's acting and dialogue were especially good. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie but saw the well-known "North By Northwest" by Hitchcock, you will laugh at the end and really enjoy it. Instead of a climatic scene in Mount Rushmore, here we have a memorable last 10 minutes in the State of Liberty. As usual, the angles of the Hitchcock camera are excellent and fun to watch.
