Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously. Built on the frame of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds leaves the elongated training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to plunge into action immediately. In the process, Tarantino corrects one of the main shortcomings of The Dirty Dozen by giving the bad guys time to remind us how bad the Nazis were. Nazis with more time on screen end up becoming the most completely human characters of the film, which, ironically, makes them worse monsters. <br /> <br /> However, Tarantino is also able to give us an image. of the entire war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also glimpsing the world of French and German civilians, both collaborators and Resistance. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that any tarantino The movie will have a fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino made the decision that the French characters spoke in French and the Germans in German, beyond adding a level of authenticity , Tarantino also made sure in some way that his dialogue in French was so sharp, funny and intelligent. as your dialogue in English. <br /> <br /> In this case, during the opening sequence, the Colonel of the SS "Jewish Hunter" Nazi Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) is interrogating the French milk farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a family of Jews. While subtly pressing LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After swallowing it avidly, Landa congratulates LaPadite for her daughters and her cows, "à votre famille et à vos vaches, je dis bravo". The problem is that in French "vache" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If she is reprimanded for this vulgar word game, Landa could quite convincingly say that she does not understand French enough to have said it that way, but Landa says it that way and says it as a threat. And LaPadite understands its meaning very well. <br /> <br /> It is a really subtle work of interpretation and wordplay that many audiences would never grasp, or at least could understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The movie is rich with that kind of detail. All the dialogue in French and English is chosen with the same attention to detail and, although I can not swear to the German, I suspect that it shows a similar level of trade. <br /> <br /> Inglorious Basterds opens with the phrase "Once upon a time ... in France occupied by the Nazis". Personally, this reminds me of the opening of every book and movie of Asterix, another comic fantasy in a France occupied by war. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is pretty funny in some places, although the movie also becomes very serious. <br /> <br /> In its most serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first victims of war are compassion and the ability to relax. As in almost all the long sequences of the film, Tarantino finds a new way to create a cruel tension at almost unbearable levels. <br /> <br /> Tarantino also reminds us that the film is dangerous, even flammable and that its power deserves respect. . <br /> <br /> If you can see this movie like I did in a theater full of expert fans who understand all the jokes, you'll see this masterful film the way it was meant to be seen. If you're not so lucky, all you'll see is a great great movie that offers a dark and fun punch.
