I caught this movie on television yesterday. I had some curiosity about it, since it was directed by Emilio Estevez and starring him and his real life father, Martin Sheen. I love watching a movie about a father-son relationship that involves a real-life father and son. Naturally, there is an instant chemistry between Sheen and Est√©vez, and their scenes of conflict are even more intense, knowing that they are actually related. Of course, it helps that both of them are fabulous actors. I've seen Martin Sheen in intense roles before, but I think this is Emilio's most intense role, as I mainly remember him from the "Mighty Ducks" series, and he really impressed me. Talent really runs in that family. And Kathy Bates steals the film in a performance worthy of an Oscar. She tugged at my heart with every word of dialogue. Kimberly Williams, the beautiful actress of the films of "The father of the bride", is also very good and has remained among a group of talented veteran actors. <br /> <br /> The film is a little scenic, with a dialogue that is obviously ready for the stage, but that did not bother me. This is not meant to be an action movie; This is a study of the character. And for a movie that is based on a play, it never becomes too claustrophobic. When Emilio's character, Jeremy, recalls his days in Vietnam, we actually see how his heartrending memories come to life. <br /> <br /> The film is extremely powerful and realistic, without being sentimental. In the end, he hoped that all the conflicts would be solved and that the family would become a lady of history, but it was not like that. The end made me cry, without resorting to the standard Hollywood melodrama. That proves that reality is much more exciting than anything that Hollywood can evoke. <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for a beautiful and powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will leave you breathless ... look at this underestimated gem. Hopefully, someday Martin and Emilio will join Charlie, and everyone will make a great movie together. <br /> <br /> My score: 9 (out of 10)
