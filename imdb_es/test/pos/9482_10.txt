From the first drum beat of "We're Gonna Groove" to the last guitar hit of "Whole Lotta Love", this two-DVD set could be one of the best music DVDs ever seen since finally the Beatles anthology was published at the beginning of this year. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this DVD is that on Disc 1, you can find a concert and many television appearances. For example, the entire Royal Albert Hall concert is on the DVD, as well as some of the best performances of the band's last concert at Knebworth. <br /> <br /> At the Royal Albert Hall concert, for example, the band had a lot of room to improvise. Jimmy Page's guitar solos make "Dazed And Confused" a huge rock ballad instead of the relaxed blues song that was on Led Zeppelin I. Next, on a DVD 2, there's a promotional video The hit song Led Zeppelin III "Song of the immigrant". One of Zeppelin's toughest songs, the video is as vague as a Pre-MTV video was, but it shows Jimmy Page's great guitar power, as it was taken from a live performance. Once the video ends, we are treated, in transition, with a brief picture of the fans filling the seats at Madison Square Garden. The following are performances that were supposed to be part of "The Song Remains The Same", but they did not make the cut. Excellent riffs were present such as those of the songs "Black Dog" and "The Ocean". <br /> <br /> After Madison's performances, they treat us with Earl's Court. Most Led Zeppelin IV material was played here, as the most popular song that Zeppelin recorded, "Stairway to Heaven." It's brilliant as always, even more than version IV. <br /> <br /> Finally, to finish with more than 5 hours of live material, it is the final concert of Led Zeppelin in Knebworth in August of 1979. As a spectator watches this, they have to admit that the voice of Robert Plant is getting deeper and deeper of all the screams he made in the past, and it is evident here. In songs like "Kashmir" and "In The Evening", Plant does not have his old vocal impulse, however, in "Whole Lotta Love", he returns for one more song. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the best musical DVDs ever released, just next to the great boxed game "Beatles Anthology" that was released in early 2003. The sound, both 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital, like the Beatles DVD, gives you the feeling of being on stage with the artists, standing next to them, as you would feel on the Beatles DVD when they get stuck in the studio. Although The Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different bands, however, each one received different DVDs. Although this set comes only on two discs compared to the set of five Beatles albums, it still feels very full for the viewer after having gone through all that content. It is also a pleasure to watch again and again, not only because of the quality of the sound, but because of the great energy on the stage when Robert Plant starts singing. <br /> <br /> A brilliant Atlantic effort.
