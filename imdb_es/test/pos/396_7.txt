This is another good western, which I enjoyed. It is not an epic or anything, but it is good for what it is. It is about 3 fur hunters, led by a man named Jed, who is crude and uncivilized. Jed and his two friends find themselves as explorers of a fort that is the only thing that stands between them and the Indian gang, who resent the Americans in their land and want to get it back. That is the essence of history. What follows is action, emotion. even a little humor, and a forbidden romance. One of Jed's friends, Gus, reminded me a lot of the character of Quint (played by Robert Shaw) in the movie Jaws. both have that crisp and abrupt behavior. If you are a fan of the west, you should find many things that you like about this particular post. I think it deserves a 7/10
