Who will love my children has changed my heart, made me cry until the end, what I cried most was when the family had to say goodbye to the baby, I cried more with that and each time they adopted a child I cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother, it was sad for them to lose their mother, I felt sorry for the child with epilepsy, I was glad that he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. For me, that boy that I thought was the special because he was going to a house. I feel that I am special because I am in a world with Aspergers Syndrome and sometimes when I feel bad, sometimes I like to cry. I really enjoyed this movie, 10 out of 10. A real story, very good. Another movie that would bring tears to your eyes, I think it should be on Tuesday with Morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)
