Incredibly hilarious Italian Rootsploitation of the mid-70s with a lot of non-consensual S & M, lesbian sex, free racial cruelty, etc ... Few cinematic redeeming qualities, except the pretty good song with "African" music and flute. Brilliant example of dialogue: <br /> <br /> Owner of the white slave (for White Plantation Manager): "You're so stupid, I bet you forgot to interrogate that midwife!" <Br /> <br /> White Plantation Manager: "I not only questioned her, but I also did it so well, she died before I could get any response from her!" <br /> <br /> All black actors are 70 years old, and say "yes, massa" with a high-pitched voice. The protagonist has sex with everyone in the plantation. 10 stars for tailor fans without flavor.
