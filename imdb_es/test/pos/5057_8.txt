This movie was an amazing tribute to anyone who has gone through this type of pain and suffering. The performance was not the best, I admit, but I was passionate about his message, sending people to jails without even a lawyer or some kind of trial is cruel and unusual. They even had a damn trial for Saddam, so why do not all terrorist suspects have some kind of fair or justified trial or why were they labeled in the first place? I'm leaving the movie, but I think it's worth writing about this sick and twisted idea that the government has. The way the film tells the story and the background story was a great mystery. The whole movie was trying to connect the daughter to the plot and in the end it became very evident. There is no doubt that the direction was incredible, but the only thing I did not like was that there was not so much emphasis on the interest of the character of Reese Witherspoon and in the struggle for the ideal that she had, many jumps. Otherwise, it was really quite entertaining and, above all, he kept my attention and interest during the two hours he played.
