When I first saw this program that appeared on Australian television in the late 1990s, I ignored it thinking that I was only capitalizing on Kevin Costner's film 'Bodyguard'. But then I caught an episode and wish I had seen it from the beginning. The partnership between Sean Pertwee and Louise Lombard was so well performed and the structure of each episode was extremely entertaining. It was not an exaggerated television program that can be said to have spent most of its energy making things explode so that they could put that video on the commercial to attract the audience and then not deliver on any other level. The show delved into the lives of the two main characters and that's what made it interesting. The stories of each episode are also well written with interesting guest stars who were good actors. And, of course, there was a lot of action and intrigue that is always good. But what was great was that there was humor, and that flowed naturally from the characters, it did not seem devised. It was British, but in a good way, and if this program was made in the United States, it would undoubtedly be on DVD. I do not know why the British television production companies are not interested in launching this program on DVD. It was a great show and it deserves a DVD release.
