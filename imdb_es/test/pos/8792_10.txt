I love this movie! I love all the characters and I can see them again <br /> <br /> and again ... and I used to listen to the soundtrack over and over again. <br /> <br /> Although I've seen it about two years after it was made and I've never been as young as Jip and company, I can understand them and I love their stories. And if someone thinks that this movie is crap, I do not agree and I say that it is <br /> <br /> full of positive energy, friendship and love ... and full of youth! <br /> <br /> the weekend has landed ... enjoy it!
