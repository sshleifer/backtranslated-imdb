I would like to present the following error. <br /> <br /> During the bridge scene, soldiers are seen roaming the river, asking to be taken away and trying to escape. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and try to get on board carrying suitcases. Soldiers are not issued nor carry suitcases to a combat zone. They have duffel bags, packages and padlocks, but no suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of place. Also, if you look closely, you will see that the suitcase is floating on the water. This is probably a very good indication that it is empty, otherwise it would sink.
