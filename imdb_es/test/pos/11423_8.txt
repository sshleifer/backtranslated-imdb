Stan as a bullfighter, and a good one, is a surprise. Generally surpassed by Oliver Hardy, this silent short allows him to take the initiative, and the protagonism. <br /> <br /> One can only conclude that his character "Rhubarb Vaselino" was a parody of Rudolph Valentino's many films. of this era. <br /> <br /> Get ready to laugh at some of the dialogue and watch the special effects. <br /> <br /> I saw it on DVD in one volume. Collection 1 and 2.
