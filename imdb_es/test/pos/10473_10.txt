I can not think of any film that best captures the concept of grace, in a theological sense. The well-intentioned religiosity of a small congregation, which went awry after the death of their leader, robs them of what they preach: grace. The expensive gift of a humble Parisian culinary genius returns the call to love, and humiliates an elderly general worried that he has wasted his life. OPTIONS is a central theme, as is grace. At the same time, it is recognized that artistic gifts have a powerful and transcendent role in everyday life and in the life to come. Impossible to improve or ignore. This is a movie that changes the lives of those who listen to your message.
