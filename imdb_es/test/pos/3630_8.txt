The duke is a very silly movie: a dog that becomes a duke! But it's a very funny movie. It has some of those cheesy jokes that many children's films have, but (fortunately!) They are not jokes of bodily function, as so many movies of animals feel obliged to have! Mostly, they are dogs, dogs and people. . . good people The 'good guys' are nice and attractive. The 'bad guys' are ridiculous and, of course, the joke of many jokes. But there is something worthy in this film, because although it is silly, it is not for all the cheap laughs like "Alone at home" and others. <br /> <br /> Crocket, Simon and Copper do an excellent job playing Black and Tan Coonhound "Hubert", who becomes the duke after his beloved owner, a true duke, dies. For the most part, they only act like dogs, not 'talking', or as human emotions and attitudes. However, they do stereotyped poodles and Hubert falls in love with her, just because he is a poodle. Come on! These are dogs: they have a different vision of beauty. <br /> <br /> In general, charming, fun and enjoyable.
