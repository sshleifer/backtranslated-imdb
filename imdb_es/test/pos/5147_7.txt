This surrealistic and absurd movie is the first movie I've seen of Swedish cult director Roy Andersson. He is a veteran filmmaker who made a living making commercial films, directing only four feature films in the last forty years. This background shows: the film looks like a collection of 50 artistic commercials of 2 minutes. There is no story that interconnects these vignettes, although some characters appear in more than one vignette (however, there is a theme everywhere: the absurdity of modern life). Some of the gestures in the film (making actors appear in light white makeup) are more irritating than illuminating. Some of the parodies amount to very little (a man is not sure which row to be in?). However, other parodies are better. The best is that of the rock girl who dreams that she is going on a honeymoon with her rock guitarist girlfriend in a house that lights something similar to a train (you have to see it to get it). A film that is worth seeing, even if the comparisons made by some film critics with great filmmakers like Keaton, Tati and Kaurismaki seem exaggerated: Andersson lacks the vision of them and the lack of a story that interconnects the vignettes is fatal for the pretension of this film to be a masterpiece.
