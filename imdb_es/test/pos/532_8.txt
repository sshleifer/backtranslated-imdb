I'm sorry, but "Star Wars Episode 1" did not do justice to Natalie Portman's talent (and her undeniable tenderness). She was completely underutilized like Queen Amidala, and when they used her, her makeup was terribly terrible. For "Anywhere But Here," she sheds her hideous makeup and acts normally. And not only can it act well, it looks good doing it. I'm a little older than her (she's only 18), and I have little or no chance of knowing her, but hey, a man is allowed to dream, right? <br /> <br /> Although Susan Sarandon does it. It takes a good turn in this movie, the film belongs entirely to Portman. I have been an observer of Portman since "Beautiful Girls" (where I was younger, but just as cute). There are important things for her in the future, I can see it.
