To tell the truth, I went to see this movie just because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. People may not agree, but he also has good performances in bad and good films. I had not seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see if she is a good actress. So, this is what I think: <br /> <br /> The movie is good (however, I have not read the novel). Some moments were really exciting and ... unexpected. In total you will find the plot quite simple. So the only thing that could save the film, that (an experienced viewer will know that from the beginning) would end tragically or happily, was the performance of Cage and Crus. And it was great, great, great! In the last part of the film, I even liked a very broad accent of the actress (Spanish, but for those who do not speak Greek it's fine, and even looks like a Greek girl). In general, the film is very nice and has a lot of irony (the fans of classical music will surely have fun in some moments :) <br /> <br /> I give it 9/10. You should see it!
