The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides everything you can expect from Agatha Christie and, of course, from Poirot. It is set in a country house one weekend. As always, all the guests are suspicious and it is up to Poirot to discover the truth. With films like this, it's always better not to give too much, so I'll stop here. What I loved in the "hole" is that it is an old-fashioned mystery. When Poirot arrives, everyone is around the body, for example. Everyone seems to be the culprit. There is a suspicious aspect and the atmosphere is perfect for the story. <br /> <br /> You can expect a wonderful moment by giving guesses about who did it and how and why, and maybe in the end you will be surprised. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and had a very pleasant experience. <br /> <br /> The actors are all very good. As a note of curiosity, Edward Hardwicke, who played Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes. Nice to see you after a few years. Suchet is amazing, as always and fortunately is on the screen most of the time. <br /> <br /> I discovered who was the killer, but still it is not predictable and it is also very credible. <br /> <br /> So in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasure. <br /> <br />
