We will never see this film broadcast by HBO in the near future, in any case. If someone finds it in some way in a video store, simply take it before someone else does, because I doubt it will ever be published again. <br /> <br /> An incredible and timely film about the first attack on the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993 and how the government agencies in charge of identifying and preventing terrorists from harming and harming US citizens and the American property fell completely at work and, unknowingly, allowed it to happen. <br /> <br /> The bone cooled off, since we all now know that the terrorists who were arrested at the end of the movie would not be the end of our nightmare that resurfaced on September 11, 2001. <br /> < The film brought to light all that went wrong in 1992-93 that allowed that first tragedy to happen in the WTC. It still took another eight years to realize that we should have learned from that first WTC attack to be more attentive and prepared to avoid the second and much more devastating assault on the World Trade Center. I found this movie more difficult to watch after the events of 9/11 and then the video of the 9/11 attacks. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is not to see it alone. The ending in itself is as powerful as it is prophetic that would leave you in a state of shock to know what we know today and possibly the need to have someone who is with you, but not watching the movie, to seek medical attention.
