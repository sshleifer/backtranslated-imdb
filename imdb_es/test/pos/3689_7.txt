"Unconditional love" begins with great promise. As directed by P. J. Hogan, the film works very well until the last third of the film, when it falls flat on its face. The screen game that Mr. Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse wrote showed a lot of possibilities that vanished in the end. It seems that the artistic team behind the film had high hopes that it would play differently. The reality is that this is a movie that looks in different directions on how to take it to a resolution that ultimately fails. Do not get me wrong, the film is tremendously attractive and will resonate with a large part of your general public. <br /> <br /> Based on the strong cast, we decided to take a look. The tremendously talented Kathy Bates is the perfect choice to play Grace Beasley, the woman who finds at the beginning of the film that all is not well in their marriage. Ms. Bates is an excellent actress who deserves much better, even when her character is not helped by what the authors have her do in the film. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett is always reliable in delivery. His role, like the lover of the late Victor Fox, is well written, that is, until Dirk is lured to Chicago to look for Victor's killer. It is strange and it defies all the rules of logic. Dirk does not seem to be able to hurt a fly, much less hunt down a killer with the help of Grace and his daughter-in-law, the incredibly funny one, Maudey. This little woman, Maudey, is one of the best things in the movie. She is shameless and says it as she sees it. Peter Sarsgaard, one of the best actors working in movies these days, has nothing to do with the image; He is totally lost. Dan Aykroyd has nothing to do either. We see it at the beginning and at the end of the film and its Max does not make sense. It seems he wants changes in his life and in his marriage, only to return to Grace without any explanation, all things forgiven. <br /> <br /> English actors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better chance as the hysterical Nola. Jonathan Pryce is seen throughout the film as a ghost singing soft songs. Julie Andrews makes a fun contribution in a couple of scenes that are priceless. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the television show presented by Sally Jesse Raphael is off and does not add anything to the movie. The best part is listening to Kathy Bates singing. What a beautiful voice she has! In fact, Ms. Bates is the best excuse to stay until the end.
