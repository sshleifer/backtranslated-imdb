I really like this movie. It's not very entertaining, but it's a party with strange and impressive images. There is no dialogue, only some background sounds and noises. If you like something completely different and original, and you enjoy the dark and strange ... then you may like this work of art. Ik seems like a movie made with the first camera ever made, in a time when strange beings similar to human beings live and perform their strange habits. God killed himself with a knife and gave birth to Mother Earth. Mother Earth was impregnated with the semen of God after an act of fellatio and gave birth to a son "Flesh in the bone". What follows are inhumane acts of ritual torture, rape and murder for purposes we do not know ... or not?
