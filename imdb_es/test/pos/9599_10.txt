I am not a football fan in any way, but I saw it with a friend, since there was nothing else in the box at that time (thank God). We not only laughed from beginning to end, but, about a week later, in the pub, when we started talking about it, we made a good show with an uncontrollable laugh. Is there really that inclined tone? I have released my email here, so if someone finds out about your future availability or repeats it on TV, let me know. Definitely the funniest thing I've seen on TV! The leek king was good too! another classic tim healy
