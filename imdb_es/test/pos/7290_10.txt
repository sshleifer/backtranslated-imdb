"Here On Earth" is an amazing and beautiful romantic story about Samantha who has problems with children and health problems. As her love for her current boyfriend, Jasper, fades, her love for Kelley blossoms like a new spring flower. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very moving, very warm, very romantic and moving. I enjoyed every part of this movie ... and that's pretty weird! I recommend this movie to all movie lovers! This is a movie that you do not want to miss !!! : D <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you are a very sentimental person who cries easily while watching movies, BRING TEXTILES !! On the other hand, it was a really good movie !!! Very romantic ... and surprisingly good !!! : D <br /> <br />
