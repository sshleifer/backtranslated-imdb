William Haines unleashes this story of an impetuous cadet who thinks that West Point will really be something now that he has arrived. Haines' fantastic comic performance by Haines was his trademark, one that made him a box office star from 1928 to 1932 and one of MGM's biggest stars. Joan Crawford and William Bakewell are also fine. And while this story may seem trivial now, this was a huge success, putting Haines and Crawford into a college football history (a national fad during the 1920s). After Haines takes his big mouth off once too often and is almost rejected by his fellow cadets, it becomes a wonderful performance as he swallows his pride and gets into the big game against the Navy. Even with a broken arm, he wins the game for the Army and regains his place in West Point. It is easy to see in this film and in Show People (with the always underestimated Marion Davies) why Billy Haines was a great star of the time. It needs and deserves to be remembered!
