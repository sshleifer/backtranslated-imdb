SPOILER ALERT !!! <br /> <br /> You can listen to Wong Kar-wai's films as a radio game: invisible vibrations between the characters, the rooms where they stay, the rhythm that drives them, the attraction and the aversion - The band of sound reproduces the entire spectrum of the atmosphere. Most of the dialogue is not important. <br /> <br /> The narrative is similar to a childish loving look at a beautiful woman and a sad man whose sorrows are remarkable, but helpless. "In The Mood For Love" is told from a child's perspective, but the child never appears as a narrator. The aesthetics of the film is developed through an extreme dramaturgy of light and color, severe cuts, an almost documentary camera and a complex and discreet sound. <br /> <br /> The genius of Nat King Cole's use "Maybe, maybe, Maybe", whose mysterious power grows the more often it is repeated and the melancholic waltz helps in the graceful choreography of the two protagonists. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dresses is bright, perfect for the handsome and elegant Tony Leung. The public assumes an affair between them, but Wong only sees a sad resignation. The two potential lovers are spinning around each other like satellites, knowing that they will never share the same orbit. You want them to meet each other. They will not do it and the emotional power of their sexual relationship without love makes the film immensely fascinating. <br /> <br /> It's about lost luck and unspoken love. In all of Wong's films these are the leitmotives. Love, either too early or too late to take the one and not the other person. The longing of the characters that is never satisfied, their loneliness, the duel and the luck they experience when it is too late.
