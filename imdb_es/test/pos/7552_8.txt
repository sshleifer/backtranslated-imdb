Four Friends is one of those movies you go to without any expectation, just to find yourself in a loop. Somehow, you file it, but then you listen to the song "Georgia On My Mind" by Ray Charles, and the images and the vague feelings begin to blink on the edge of your consciousness, and then you remember this crazy movie that made you laugh and He cries, almost at the same time. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so memorable? First, at least for the people who lived it all, because it captures very well the tenor of the times: their frustrated hopes, their successes, their sincerity and, above all, the emotional roller coaster that leads to a moving nostalgia. And then, the performance is so incredible. Danilow, all anguish and passion, Georgia, as difficult to grasp as the will of the wave ... but charming, however, and Louis, the roommate for disabled with charm to forgive whoever attacks life with gusto and takes every moment with an ironic smile, because he knows very well that it could be the last. <br /> <br /> How long has it been since you saw a movie that made you worry about the people in the story? Even if they were far from perfect? The film presents people whose options are not necessarily recommended, but the film is never moralized, it only allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety ... even the minor characters have a well-defined personality and a history that is why that this movie seems so real, even when some of the actions and reactions may seem exaggerated ... because that's the way life is, when you think about it. And why this film engages you with a complexity that is defined by character. Truly a surprising and satisfying experience.
