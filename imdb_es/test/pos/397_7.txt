One of the darkest of Anthony Mann's westerns, The Last Frontier was also his only Western cavalry (apart from a brief episode in Winchester '73), although he naturally focuses on outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a celebration. fordiana of camaraderie and camaraderie. shared ideals Located not in your beloved high country, but in the hills and forests, it is a much more cynical view of the life of the border, in many ways its Fort Apache without the need to preserve the legend: this outpost is formed by misfits, failures, cowards and the strange and competent officer ignored by his superiors, misdirected, while the Civil War has priority and all the best that the army has to offer. <br /> <br /> Victor Mature and James Whitmore are free hunters who find civilization crawling on top of them when they are freed from their skins and packhorses by a local tribe aggravated by the incursion of the Cavalry into their territory. Instead of blaming the Indians for their losses, they decide that it is the army's fault to build the fort and they decide to demand compensation, ending up joining their ranks as explorers. But despite the efforts of the friendly and competent interim commander of Guy Madison to bring Mature to the 19th century and make him fit to wear the uniform, the arrival of the humiliated Colonel of Robert Preston eager to take revenge on the tribe that expelled him from your own outpost ?? and Mad's awkward infatuation with the Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft, a blank list too big to do much with the role of a woman who is tired of being saved by men who think they know what's best for her). Soon we will conduct the affairs towards a much darker territory. It is not long before some of the soldiers are planning to kill each other, both sides try to incite their subordinates to do the deed for them: it is not surprising that in a mature moment discard the blue coat that has so coveted with disgust , screaming "I would have died for this, but it's just a dirty dirty blue cloth!" The Stallone of his time, Mature was one of those actors who could surprise him with the excellent and strange interpretation here and there when combined with the part right and the right director This is not one of his best days, despite having his most complex part, perverse enough as a simple man, well intentioned but drunk, violent, uneducated and with a subtle lust for life , almost childish, the part seems designed considering Burt Lancaster, with some similarities to his character in The Kentuckian, but the Colonel in the style of Acab by Robert Preston is claram the best role, determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a single and disastrous suicidal combat of the Civil War by launching another useless suicide campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of of the promotion council. In his obsession to redeem his career, he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption, driven both by his sense of shame at the compassion of his wife and by the promotion of former classmates that he considers his inferiors. It is beyond salvation, but there is still a recognizable human being there and one who is not entirely without a sense of integrity. Does he genuinely admire Madison's courage to make a futile attempt to have Preston's orders revoked by his superiors? Even though he is fatigued. <br /> <br /> Like his hero, the film is a bit rough (and has one of the most surreal and joyful songs of all westerns), but that only tends to make it more interesting, and there are many of Mann's typically elegant camera movements and games in perspective, while the configuration of the border is convincingly harsh and primitive. Unfortunately, the deficiencies of the first CinemaScope lenses are very evident in the Columbia DVD, with the image often dark (2.55: 1 CinemaScope required a lot of additional lighting and the first Scope films show a lot of evidence and errors) and granulated.
