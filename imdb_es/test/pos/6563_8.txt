Wow ... I just watched this movie on the Sundance channel, and it's really weird. I may not be a film expert, but it's probably the strangest movie I've ever seen as an average movie fan. <br /> <br /> Whoever came up with it had a great imagination. I'm a bit of a fan of Japanese dramas, and there are often dramas actors in the movies ... (Matsushima Nanako, for example, the protagonist of Ringu, is one of the main stars of the drama). But it seems that this is so. The first film for the portraitists of Kirie and Shuichi. I must say that if they are really debuting here, they do a pretty good job. <br /> <br /> Kirie was a very nice character, I thought it was easy to relate to her. She was kind and good-hearted, maybe not the most popular girl, but nicer than some of the other girls who seek attention. She was also pretty in a classic way. I hope she makes more movies, but it's been a couple of years, so maybe she does not have such plans. <br /> <br /> The ending was strange. I'm not going to give anything away, but the rest of the bizarreness of the movie was somewhat embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Very strange movie, but very imaginative and unique. I would recommend it to fans of Japanese horror, although I warn you, it's much stranger than Ringu. <br /> <br /> However, I would give a 7.5 out of 10, for originality, imagination. , good characterization, acting above average and simply intriguing.
