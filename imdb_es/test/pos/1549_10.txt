In the 60s, this bleak study of Joy, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to the career of Ken Loach, who became one of the most distinguished and respected British filmmakers of all time. By then I knew very little about Brecht, politics or the reality of the less privileged, and I was quite impressed by the aesthetics of the film, its free style, its austere color cinematography and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also very surprised to find that Terence Stamp (who had become a celebrity, thanks to "Billy Budd", "The Collector" and "Modesty Blaise") had so little screen time. Although 20th Century Fox distributed "Poor Cow" in Panama, Loach did not stay in conventional cinema (which this movie is almost not) and I lost contact with his films. I just found out about your successes, "Kes", "Family Life", "Black Jack". Until I got up to date in the 80's. The beautiful title song by Donovan, by the way, is available in his anthology "Troubadour".
