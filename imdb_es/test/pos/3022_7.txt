After having seen enough movies, there are very few things that do not remind you of other movies. However, this was an observable but somewhat disturbing movie. I had to turn it off once in a while and come back to it later. As "Silence of the Lambs" presents the search for a serial killer who has kidnapped someone and confined her to his chamber of horrors. As "Flatliners", the main character explores a world of dreams through an experimental procedure. The surrealism of the sequences of dreams is what this film does, since one finds the characters in a situation and a landscape in which literally anything can happen. And beyond this continuity and "sense" are not necessary, which also makes it a filmmaker's dream. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seems a bit strange is the fact that, in the end, one expects hope. The redemption of the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons. You really feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man, but clearly the innocence of the child can not be separated from the horrible actions of man. The focus changes as it must save man to save his victim.
