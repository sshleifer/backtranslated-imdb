It was a fascinating story waiting to be told. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY take us into the trials and tribulations of a group of top-level American scientists who did a great job during World War II: hitting everyone else with the atomic bomb. Isolated in a tightly guarded New Mexico complex, the brain slowly converts the idea of ​​the ambitious concept into an immense reality. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is one of those movies that requires your special attention. It is a film of a really thinking person, not only from the scientific aspect of the development of a seemingly impossible weapon, but also the moral implications of contributing to kill on a massive scale. The characters are constantly divided between that reality and their duty of war as Americans. However, the film never preaches, leaving us free to admire the enormity of the internal turmoil that these men face. The performances also deserve special mention. Paul Newman offers one of his great and simple performances as the general of Pattonesque in charge of delivering the great definitive baton for the Allied Forces. <br /> <br /> Where FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY lose much of their traction is unnecessary romantic component Dwight Schultz as leader of the scientific team struggles with his affections for his family and his relentless obsession with his great project. Director Roland Joffe apparently felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story, but the romantic nuances serve mainly as a distraction. Furthermore, it is the interaction between scientists and their military hierarchy that gives us the best insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult not to recommend FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY. It is a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face on one of the most intriguing stories in human history.
