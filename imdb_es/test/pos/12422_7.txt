Two boys from the city drive through Hicksville, USA. UU., When a rusty monster suddenly appears and tries repeatedly to get off the road. After picking up a mysterious blond hitchhiker, they stop at a truck stop full of redneck amputees, one of whom warns them of the 'demon out there'. But they do not listen. Big mistake! "Monster Man" by Michael Davis mixes comedy with horror surprisingly well. The movie takes a lot of "Duel", "The Blair Witch Project", "Jeepers Creepers" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". The story is pretty silly, but there is enough blood and violence to keep the fans of the splash happy. I especially enjoyed the performance of Justin Urich, who offers the film his relief comedy. Still missing the complete lack of suspense. It is difficult to forgive. This is an opportunity, if you have time to lose.7 out of 10. Did I mention that Aimee Brooks is sexy?
