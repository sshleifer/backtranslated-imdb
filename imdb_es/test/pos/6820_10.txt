The Youth In Us is a perfect gem. I saw this impressive short film at this year's Sundance Festival. The story took me on a deeply transformative journey. The direction of Joshua Leonard, the performance of Kelli Garner and Lukas Haas, the art direction, the cinematography, the score, each element was true to the bone. One can only hope that this exquisite and atrocious film is the prelude to a great work of this talented director. <br /> <br /> Just as a short film is shown before a film at Sundance, commercial cinemas used a similar format in the past. It would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces such as The Youth In Us could reach a wider audience. wide in this way.
