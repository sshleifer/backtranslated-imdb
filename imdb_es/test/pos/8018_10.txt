While "The Jackal" [remake of the excellent "Day of the Jackal"] has a better aesthetic [and a loaded budget], this film encloses the real person of "Carlos" ... <br /> <br /> Quinn stands out when the naval officer got ready to pose as Wiley's jackal to get him out of hiding and, at the hands of Kingsley and Sutherland, turns to do it. Risking his family, his career and everything he believes, he assumes the task, although unintentionally. <br /> <br /> Saying more would spoil it ... this is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 Niro ~ Stars [of 4]
