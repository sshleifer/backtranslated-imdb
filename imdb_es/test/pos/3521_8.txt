Ignore the bad reviews here, this movie is amazing! "Just Before Dawn" is an excellent example of what can be done in a movie with a minimum budget if you have a dedicated team, a decent script and a great idea for a movie. It is fun. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it much more than most of the other slavers of the '80s because the killer is unique. "Wrong turn" started this movie with something fierce! There is a lot of blood and fears. My girlfriend got scared and she sees almost everything with me and she does not flinch. He has that chill. <br /> <br /> I would say that "Just Before Dawn" is the best slasher of the early 80's. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
