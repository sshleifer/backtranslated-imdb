This is a great Italian movie about sharks, probably not a full action type of shark movie, but it has a great story about a Native American in the form of a killer shark that attacks a small beach community. The movie has real scenes of real sharks and some do not, but how they did it is pretty good. The cast is not so brilliant to act in this shark movie, but it looks better acting in other Italian shark movies (eg, cruel jaws, last shark) show some bad acting, but most of the Italian shark movies they are good, which means that they vote better as the best shark movie in Italy, some scenes in this film show the violence / blood that makes this film good and shows it, so let's say this is the best movie for all fans of shark movies.
