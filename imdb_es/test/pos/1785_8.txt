Well, I am afraid that my review of this special will not pay much attention to the observations that I made to the others before me, but I literally observed it, during a PBS membership campaign, and frankly, I am very excited to say nothing. To really appreciate the enigma that is Barbra Streisand, you have to look back before the movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon of the mid 60's. When television was still a young medium, there was a form of entertainment very prominent in the air that today is nothing more than a memory: the musical variety. Some musical shows were weekly series, but others were special at one time, which usually showed the special talent of the individual artist. This is where we get the first and uninhibited Streisand. She had already been a guest artist on other variety shows such as Garry Moore, Ed Sullivan, and got a big hit on a single tandem appearance with the woman who would pass him the extraordinary belter baton: Judy Garland. In 1966, COLOR ME BARBRA introduced Barbra Streisand in color (hence the title), but copied the format of its first special a year before, almost on the letter. In 3 different acts, we get an abstract Streisand (in an art museum that works out of the usual schedule and that sometimes becomes a work of art), a comic Streisand who works with an audience that already adores in a studio circus (populated with many fuzzy and furry animals) and, best of all, a Streisand singer in mini-concert format just-- well, frankly, just doing it. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that she still had the film debut of FUNNY GIRL, and that she became a composer, director and political activist. Here, she is barely 24 years old, doing extraordinary things because, as she explains in her own introduction to the camera, "we did not know we could not, so we did it". The sequence of the art museum was filmed in Philadelphia over a weekend immediately after the museum closed to the public on Saturday night, and apparently was made with only one camera in color. However, there are cuts, dissolutions and tracking shots in abundance, which result in a rather spectacular peak moment: the modern, slightly beatnik flavor, "Gotta Move". After getting lost in modern abstracts, the jazz club bongos begin, with Streisand emerging in a psychedelic dress and gleaming eye makeup, making the catchy staccato melody with almost androgynous sex appeal. It is not until Act 3, believe it or not, that the moment is equaled or enhanced by another feat: in the sequence of the concert, in a white dress and pearl earrings, Streisand recites the torch "Any place where my hat hangs is my home, "breaking the final notes and revealing one of those weather belts that makes you scream like a girl, even if you're 44 ... and a boy. Simply the old big television. Check it out.
