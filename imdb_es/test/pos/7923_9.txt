ALEXANDER NEVSKY is nothing less than a great movie on a large scale. The film opens a window to a world and a culture that most Americans will never know. And much has been said and written in relation to the slightly veiled patriotism of the film in the face of the impending war with the German Nazis. <br /> <br /> According to US standards UU The script is short in words and large in images and action. And while the action can become tedious, the images are often impressive. The address is incredible. <br /> <br /> On another note, fans of Ralph Bakshi's animation may notice that he stole many of his images for WIZARDS directly from a copy of ALEXANDER NEVSKY.
