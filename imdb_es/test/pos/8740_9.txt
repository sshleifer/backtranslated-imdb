This movie has not been kept fresh in the minds of moviegoers, and it's a real shame. His ingenious adaptation to the script should have earned Oscar nominations for the great screenwriter I.A.L. The adaptation of Diamond and the impeccable performance of Ingrid Bergman. It must have been an honor for Goldie Hawn at such a young age to work with Bergman, looking more than a decade younger than his 54 years, fifty-four! When it is on the screen, it blinks positively. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that may appear dated at the beginning, but it actually made me wish it was close during the sixties. Hawn's fashions are as sticky as Bergman's are elegant. (That's a minor flaw: is not her character a little too original for a girl who still lives with her sister? But, again, would we have Ingrid in another way?) And who would not want to hang out in a The nightclub called The Slipped Disc? <br /> <br /> The best compliment I can make to this movie is that it somehow made me feel nostalgic for a decade that I never saw, and that left me with a lot of enthusiasm. Speaking of wanting more, I wonder what would have become of sexy cast actor Rick Lenz. (He looks like Griffin Dunne in this movie). This was his film debut, and I do not see any other important role in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn, she has done a lot since then, it's easy not to be impressed, but neither can I imagine any other actor in the role. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is based on a play, the delivery line may seem a bit tiered, but it did not inhibit my enjoyment at all. In fact, I'm surprised at how funny he is after more than thirty-five years. Because this film represents a bygone era, it has slipped unfairly from the conscience of moviegoers. It is more linked to the films of the era that preceded it than to those that followed. But do not let that stop you from enjoying the delights it has to offer. Grade A
