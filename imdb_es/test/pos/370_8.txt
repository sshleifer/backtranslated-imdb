In my endless quest to see as many quality films as possible in my life, I came across this movie by cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before this, and I never felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received. I always felt it was good, not excellent (from what I've seen) This was the best of his films that I've seen so far. Robert Walker is absolutely chilling, his performance leads to the movie where Hitchcock wanted him to be. Even an average performance here damages the product in general. My favorite scene was his obsession with taking the lighter from the sewer (however, how does he make his arm go down there?) Bruno is a pretty convincing character, but I also loved the performance of Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara. The rest of the Morton family, as well as Guy, were a bit dry and boring, but she added some flash to the movie, as well as having some of the best lines in the script. <br /> <br /> Finally, in any suspense movie, you will live and die for your end. This one contains water, unlike a couple of other Hitchcock movies that I've seen. I really was not sure how it would end, which kept me on the edge as I watched and waited.
