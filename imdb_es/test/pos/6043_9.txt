Misfit recruits Owens' private skills for the skills of instructor Sgt Moore (Jack Webb). No explosions or bloodshed or soundtrack of hip or sex. It is established in the training camp of the USMC Parris Island S.C. and the majority of the cast are real marines. Memorable phrases abound and the closing credit "dedicated to ..." is intense. With such strong masculine and feminine characters, this film could not be made in today's delicate world.
