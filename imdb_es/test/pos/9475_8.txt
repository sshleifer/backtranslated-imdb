This is James Cagney's first movie that I've really seen. I've never been interested in his films before because I thought I would not like anything in that cinema style and because I've heard that most of Cagney's films are the same. I have to say that I liked it a lot. By today's standards for movies, it was not special, but I found it surprisingly entertaining. Cagney did not look like a tough guy, but he played the part very well.
