This movie is synonymous with entertainment. It's the funniest movie I've seen in my life. The lines, the acting. And the clothes, wow, we talk about 70: s. If you ever see this little gem, buy it. It was worth every penny. By the way, the opening song is awesome. If anyone knows where I can find it. Please, send me an email.
