I loved this, but I am a child of the 80's. I loved Rainbow Bright all my childhood. I do not know if the little ones these days would be very interested in the show, mine was not. (But that's fine, I bought it for myself anyway, I just brought the little one so that the guy at the check-out would not see me funny). I love non-violent drama and colorful scenery. It just reminds me of a simpler moment before the cartoons had more violence than our local news can legally show. :) Although I can be a bit biased on the subject. After all, I was Rainbow Bright 6 years in a row for Halloween ........ I wonder if they will make a Rainbow Bright costume for adults. Hahaha
