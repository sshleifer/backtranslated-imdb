Both Disney and Bill Paxton did a good job of conveying a story based on facts. You do not have to like the game of golf to appreciate the story of a man's struggle to overcome difficulties. It could have been based on any sport or simply on any other situation that involves competition, although this one is only related to golf. The only problem I have with the story is that I would have liked to see a little more in depth in each of the main characters, especially. Mr. Ouimet. Mr. Francis Ouimet is a typical young man of his time, the century of America, where the "class lines" are well delineated and for anyone who deigns to try to rise above their "class" position. I did some historical research and my biggest question was answered, to my satisfaction. Although the circumstances are a little different from those portrayed in the film, I came away with a sense of content. I enjoyed this movie a lot, I think you will too.
