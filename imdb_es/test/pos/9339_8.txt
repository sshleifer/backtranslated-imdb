I do not particularly care about Michael Jackson. Apart from being a pedophile, I really do not like his music, with the exception of some songs from his historical album, THRILLER. This is one of them. I like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos that have been made. <br /> <br /> This was directed by John Landis, best known to horror fans as director of AN American WEREWOLF IN London. This music video is not so much a music video, but more or less, a short horror movie. M.J. and his date is in a werewolf movie. When they leave the film, they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies, when Michael Jackson makes his famous "Thriller" dance. <br /> <br /> You know, this is a pretty good song with good synthesized rhythms. This and "Beat It" are probably the only two songs of Michael Jackson that I can tolerate again and again. Especially I love Vincent Price's cameo as the narrator. His distinctive voice is perfect for a horror-themed music video. Even if you do not like M.J.'s music, you need to watch this video at least once. By the way, he was good before becoming a spooky white woman with a fake nose.
