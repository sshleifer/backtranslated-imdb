Television movies generally do not get as much recognition or credit as great movies, and it's usually for good reason, but HBO's 1996 movie The Late Shift is easily one of the best television movies in history. Based on Bill Carter's revealing book, The Late Shift is about the handling of NBC night show presenters, David Letterman and Jay Leno, when it came to filling the vacant Tonight Show that Johnny Carson once had. We see what happens in front of the camera: author Bill Carter, director Betty Thomas and HBO show us what happened when the cameras went out. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we can never know for sure what really happened. when it was time for Johnny Carson to be replaced by Letterman or Leno, but The Late Shift offers us a possible interesting reality. While it is a very well made movie, The Late Shift also does a very good job of portraying all sides equally, although you wonder if the movie makes Letterman and Leno too kind to the boys; Especially Leno, who seems a little too holy. <br /> <br /> The performances are also very good. In a highly deserved Golden Globe winning performance, Kathy Bates plays Leno's extremely aggressive manager, Helen Kushnick, who, according to Carter and the book / movie, was very problematic for the studio and Leno (the real Kushnick really pleased Bill Carter for defamation on this cover)!). John Michael Higgins breaks with his usual concerts to get small extravagant comedy pieces and offers an excellent performance as David Letterman, which gives an excellent impression of Letterman but also creates a dimensional and relatable character. Daniel Roebuck performs well as Leno, but does not live up to some of the other talents in the film. Roebuck probably did the best that anyone could have done, it only looks good every time someone tries to make an impression or representation of Leno. . Bob Balaban (a squirrelly Warren Littlefield), Treat Williams (a magician similar to Michael Ovitz), and Ed Begley Jr. (a pompous Rod Perth) also provide memorable supporting performances. <br /> <br /> The Late Change is certainly one of the best movies for television that I have seen in my life. I guess if you have not seen David Letterman or Jay Leno, The Late Shift might not be for them, but it's an interesting movie for those who get into politics at night, something that recently has raised its ugly head once again with 2009. -10 Conan / Leno / NBC debacle.
