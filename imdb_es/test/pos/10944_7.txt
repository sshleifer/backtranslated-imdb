Well do not expect anything deep and meaningful. Most of the fight scenes are pretty decent. The two main ladies are very attractive, but their lack of HK action fund shows sometimes. Maybe the end lacks something, but I enjoyed it a lot. The cheesy humor probably will not attract anyone who has not seen a lot of HK movies, but if you bother with that kind of thing and have a couple of hours to complete something meaningless, you could do much worse. . (Okay, I could do better, but .......) <br /> <br /> Certainly on a par with most Hollywood action moves. <br /> <br /> 7/10
