An unfortunate reality of post-Soviet Russia was that the welfare of the people did not change much since Soviet times. As we see in "Window to Paris," most people remain as depressed as ever, while being encouraged to go after the money. <br /> <br /> Then, everything changes for the music teacher Nikolai Chizhov (Sergei Dontsov) after He finds a window that leads to Paris. He and his friends are naturally quite amazed at what they find. This movie has one of the funniest discussions of Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf that I've heard. So watch this movie. I'm sure you'll love it It is a kind of precursor of "Being John Malkovich".
