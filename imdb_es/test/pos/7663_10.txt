I can never understand why people take the time to review movies they have not fully understood. I know that people will read scathing critiques in these pages of this film, and prevent them from looking for copies of this rather forgotten style of the late 1920s, but in the 1932 movie, which should probably be called "indecent", since that is the name in the main titles. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy, better known as a comic actress in innumerable refined roles, is wicked in all of them. She was a real dramatic actress, something she did not know before watching this movie, which precedes all her famous roles. She is thrilling and moving here, two things that she never was before the elegant and refined William Powell. I'm still quite shocked at how good it was. <br /> <br /> Becky Sharp (1935), the first Technicolor feature of three strips, is more familiar, but this one is much better artistically and an adaptation. It is also very moving as an expression of a movie style that was about to die. You can not trust my word, you must see it.
