How can someone DARE say something BAD about this movie? Sorry, Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier every time you watch it. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this, I cried for laughing so hard. Everything is fun. <br /> <br /> While "Robin Hood: Men In Tights" is not my favorite comedy (that place is taken by "Real Genius"), it occupies a place in my book. So go see it! If you do not spend all your time laughing, at least you'll spend all your time drooling over Cary Elwes.
