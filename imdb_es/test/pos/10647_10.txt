Based on the real events of 1905, the silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN refers to a Russian imperial ship in which the abominable conditions lead to a riot. Surprised by the conditions of the ship, the citizens of the port city of Odessa gather to support the mutineers, and consequently find themselves at the mercy of the imperial forces, who attack the civilian supporters with savage force. <br /> <br /> POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences. Surprisingly, each of these sequences manages to surpass the previous one, and the film actually strengthens as it progresses from the riot to the demonstration of the citizens and the massacre on the steps of Odessa, the latter is among the most famous sequences of the whole history of cinema. Filming in large part where the real events really happened, director Eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he constructs, not only from sequence to sequence, but from moment to moment within each sequence, some of the most memorable images ever committed to the film. <br /> <br /> Describing POTEMKIN as a great movie is something like an understatement. It is absolutely essential, an absolute necessity for anyone seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema in its brightest form, often imitated, rarely equaled, never surpassed. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
