North and South is a miniseries of the "golden age" of the television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time of extensive and extensive epics with high production values ​​and many stellar cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the elements less like the soap opera and the general sense of the story. <br /> <br /> James Read and Patrick Swayze offer excellent results. performances - especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as a kind of emotional anchor amidst the often melodramatic story. The series also contains works of first level of Kirstie Alley, Wendy Kilbourne, Hal Holbrook, Lewis Smith, Genie Francis, Georg Stanford Brown and others. The costumes, the shooting, the sets and the music are also first class. <br /> <br /> Do not take it as a history lesson, but take it for what it is: a large-format, well-made epic. from a bygone era. Book 2, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but I would recommend that viewers omit Book 3, which came out 8 years after Book 2 and was not as good as the first two parts. However, books 1 and 2 are classic, even with their most soapy elements, and worth seeing.
