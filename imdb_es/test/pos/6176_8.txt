This is a brilliant and luxurious Czech film from the father and son team of Sverak, which deals with two Czech pilots fleeing to England to help the RAF in the Battle of Britain, but who also fight for a woman (the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). It presents some excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes. probably the best of all and much better than Pearl Harbor or even the movie Battle of Britain, and a number of interesting general topics such as love, war, romance, camaraderie, loss and servitude. In addition, the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (although here it became easier with the great unconditional Anna Massey). <br /> <br /> The film has some great little reasons, like the RAF's famous target shooting device. , shown in everything and at a point well reflected in the black vinyl record, spinning around (music is another theme of the movie, of course). In addition, all the traditional icons of English life: dimpled beer glasses (unlike the postwar straight glasses used in Pearl Harbor), tea in a nice porcelain tea set in an English rural garden (although it is taken in the Czech Republic?), The pet dog, a vintage bottle of HP sauce, even a dart board! <br /> <br /> Of course, the airfield and the surrounding countryside is ridiculously different from anywhere in the south of England, although virtuous aerial sequences make up for it. This, showing Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always synonymous with the south of England and the Battle of Britain. But best of all is the sensational musical score by Ondrej Soukup, as good as Hans Zimmer's, but all within the tradition of the late and excellent Ron Goodwin, who won the original film of the Battle of Britain among other classic films of the English War. There is even a small cameo paper for ??? apparently ?? The famous Czech musician and actor (and Kevin Kline lookalike) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays on the piano the title's main theme, Dark Blue Sky. Excellent! <br /> <br /> It also has some small but fun Freudian devices, like always showing an inflated condom that floats on the roof every time Karel (the hot but bright Krystof Hadek) is trapped in the airfield while his rival love and fellow pilot Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is with Susan. <br /> <br /> Another great English actor in this movie! Charles Dance, of course, is fine as Wing Commander Bentley. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended and worth seeing / hiring? get the DVD with special features (things like the way they created the dog fights and stuff). It is probably the only movie that combines subtitles with characters that speak English, German, French and Czech at the same time.
