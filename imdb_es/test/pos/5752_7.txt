I can not see how some people can not find this movie funny. I saw the end of it on Sky Movies. In 2001 I thought I would do it for the DVD since then I laughed at my balls with lines like Rik Mayalls laugh "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA" and Eddies "Hello night goalie" when they never get any general call, I think this movie is very funny.
