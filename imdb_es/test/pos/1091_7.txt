Nana Patekar proves once again that he is the best actor working in Bombay, without a doubt. His recent films involved shouting his lines that do not bode well for the trained theater actor. One wonders why his praise is not always given during the awards season. <br /> <br /> "Shakti-The Power" was one of his films that was a total disappointment along with Kohram (a lost opportunity to create screen magic with Amitabh Bachchan). <br /> <br /> But Patekar exudes a cool calm in this film playing a policeman on a kind of social justice journey. By getting rid of the Bombay streets of the underworld in fake encounters, the Patekars character takes control of the screen (and the attention of the viewers) and never abandons. The editing has a narrow rhythm and there are no annoying songs that distract from the story. <br /> <br /> In the same vein as the modern cult classic "Company", the film is well acted, directed and should have a long lifespan on DVD. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes that you will see Nana and the main villain talking in their shelter at sea will surely be part of the classics of Hindi cinema. You will not be disappointed with this movie of cops and thieves.
