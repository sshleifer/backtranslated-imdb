As far as I'm concerned, this film noir had two totally different things unlike the film noirs that I'm used to seeing: 1 - the stage is Paris, France; 2: there is a 28 minute scene without dialogue. <br /> <br /> Both make this film a little bit unique, at least for fans of English-language film noir. Actually, an American, Jules Dussain, filmed the film, so it is not completely a European film. Initially, I was disappointed after seeing the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I got bored. However, once that silent segment began: the real robbery (you know what it is about), the movie increased considerably and improved more and more. <br /> <br /> In fact, I thought about the best part of The story was what happened after the robbery. The best aspect of the whole movie was cinematography. This is what makes the album worthwhile. It is an excellent black film photography and a real travel notebook for those of us who have never seen Paris ... and this is Paris in the mid-1950s. There are many streets and buildings in Paris soaked with rain that seem to me fascinating In fact, there were many more of those big shots of London in the much better known film, The Third Man. <br /> <br /> The main actor here, Jean Servais, I think his name is, is also interesting to watch. Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton, and that sums it up perfectly. A warning for those who do not expect profanity or nudity in a classic movie. This is France, not the United States, so here is a bit of both. I appreciate the DVD that offers the option of subtitles or a dubbed version, too.
