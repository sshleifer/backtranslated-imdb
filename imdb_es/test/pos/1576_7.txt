I just finished this incredibly crazy thing and, although I can not say it, it was as good as I had exaggerated thinking it was still an effective brain and pretty nasty deformed and misogyny fed the garbage of J. His story tells of a poor girl who is looking her sister who ends up being raped and drugged by the Yakuza bastards, and the helpful doctor who tries to avenge her, doing it in a strange and frightening way after a similar attack of rape and drug addiction. Ah, yes, and there is also some direct sex, unfortunately it's all a soft core, according to the disapproval of the Japanese below the nudity of the belt, but the pixilation is minimal, in fact, it is only really remarkable in a hilarious blowjob scene. Although the writer / director Kazuo "Gaira" Komizu fails to create an especially convincing story, this is at least something rather reckless, from the beginning he plunged into the dirt pit with a rather disturbing violation (made worse by the fact that the girl looks a bit young, although I'm pretty sure she was of age). In addition, for the most part it is a very professional aspect, perhaps not elegant, but it has a certain style and the content is handled reasonably well, with particular congratulations for avoiding to a large extent having to use a lot of pixilation. Most things are based on sex or rape for about two-thirds of the execution time and it's quite visible if you move at such a pace, it gets a bit numb after a while, but the ladies are easy to see and Sometimes they are quite hard. The music, by YÃ´ichi Takahashi, is occasionally effective, although it is not a key part of the show in some points that complements the action clearly, at least enough for me to notice. More important are the effects, by Nobuaki Koga, who have an impressive splash hit when they appear, aided by the lunatic nature of climate scams. Things even come to an end that affects curiously, sure that it is not a cry or anything, but for a movie at the level of most of its execution time is relatively moving. In general, this is quite a fun diversion for garbage fans, especially those with a taste for Japanese rapey adventures. I really could have done it with a longer and more gore vengeance section, maybe also more than one point / brain, but hey, he kept me watching and is pretty well provided with memorable wtf moments. So if you dig this kind of degenerate garbage, it's probably worth it, maybe you do not expect the second coming.
