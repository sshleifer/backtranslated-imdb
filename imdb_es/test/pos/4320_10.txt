* Could contain spoilers, read only after watching the last episode of season 2 * Think about it. The boys from the north pole? Center of the Earth? Are you looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: "Did we miss it again?" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole island is a trap. Established by his dad. She found out and is looking for her Desmond. How else can you know what to look for? <br /> <br /> So basically it's an island in a magnetic shield. All this is false. All the signs are there. False beards, false doors, fake medicines, false observation stations, with false air axes that lead to nothing. It's a de facto project, and because of the final scene at the end of Season 2, I know it has to do with Desmond, his girl and his father (and probably Libby, she's weird, maybe it has something to do with the plane crash, OK, now I'm moving away). <br /> <br /> Also in this episode, Henry Gail tells Michael to go to some coordinates and he will find his rescue. This is probably a kind of door in the magnetic shield. "Once you're gone, there's no turning back." <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty obvious, despite the many questions I still have and I hope to get answers for next season. If you remember what we have learned in season 1 and 2, I am sure we will get many answers in season 3. <br /> <br /> I can not wait. <br /> <br /> Can anyone agree with this theory? We hope to hear from you...
