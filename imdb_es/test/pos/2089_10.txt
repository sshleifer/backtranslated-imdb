A great movie. Each moment masterfully directed by Toyoda and his crew. The actors offer credible performances in everything. The images are disturbing, beautiful and, at times, disturbingly beautiful shots of the landscapes of the Japanese city and country. The sounds, courtesy of the Japanese band 'Dig', are never as nervous as one would expect from a band soundtracks It is strangely atmospheric and adapts well to the scenes in which they are found. <br /> <br /> In short, they worked perfectly ... Well, if they had to do justice to the story, perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted. <br /> <br /> The true greatness of 9 Souls is compelling story. The prison break film may be something of a genre lost these days, and the road trip movie loses its appeal because of the way the world is getting smaller. But this story easily mixes something new for those two genres. <br /> <br /> A 9 convicts are given freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their places in society. Will society accept them? Are they truly free from their dark pasts? and can they stay together long enough to stay alive and discover it? <br /> <br /> Each convict has an interesting story. Their crimes are as varied as their apparent destiny. A sense of brotherhood between them keeps the story in a dramatic place and provides hilariously comical situations. And because of the nature of their background, violence is always something that is waiting to happen. <br /> <br /> After all that, all I can say is give a clock.
