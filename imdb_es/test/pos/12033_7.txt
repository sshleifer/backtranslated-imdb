I found parts of this movie quite slow, especially the first part; The second part seemed to go much faster, but it is not entirely clear to me why one part was faster than the other. Somehow I managed to find it nice. The performance was good, the writing was good (but vulgar). There was also another good side: it was easier to understand than to say, the Godfather's films. Did you know who was on which side, etc. In general, the movie was not bad at all.
