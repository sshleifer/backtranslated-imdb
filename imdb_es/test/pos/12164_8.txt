I had never read much (I have not even seen pictures of) the six-man British comedy group The Crazy Gang, but my positive experiences with his contemporaries Will Hay and Arthur Askey - and especially the praise of Graham Greene from THE FROZEN LIMITS (" The funniest English image ever produced ... can support a comparison with SAFETY LAST and THE GENERAL "). He made me jump with the Red R2 DVDs and his subsequent movie GASBAGS (1941, see below). that were released earlier this year with virtually no fanfare. <br /> <br /> A British-made western is a rarity, but a parody of Western British is even rarer (CARRY ON COWBOY [1965] was still about 25 years old). By the way, returning to the silent classics mentioned by Greene, the film seems more indebted to me with THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and WAY OUT WEST (1937). In addition, it also plays as a variation of the fairy tale "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (which had just been immortalized on the screen through Walt Disney's animated masterpiece) and where the seventh member is played by the comedian and frequent Will Hay. role of Moore Marriott; The gang actually calls the beautiful heroine Eileen Bell by that name, and there's even a funny sequence with the six of them getting ready to go to bed and whistling the dwarf song from the Disney movie! <br /> <br /> Six comedians (three series of comedy duos: Flanagan & Allen, Nervo & Knox, and Naughton & Gold) may be the largest such group in the film, although not all of their personalities emerge here. : my favorites were the great Bud Flanagan (who looks a little like Jim Backus), the straight man Chesney Allen and the musky, shrilly Knox teddy; however, the bald Charlie Naughton often took the spotlight, as he is the only one in which others always seemed to bother. Even so, it is Marriott who steals the film from his first scene, where he manages to pass himself off as all the officials of the ruined theater of a ghost town! a very young Bernard Lee is also notable as the villain of the piece. <br /> <br /> The Ore routine between Flanagan and Allen actually anticipates Abbott and the famous "Who's First?" (The film, in fact, depends on a lot of puns for its humor (it does not necessarily travel, especially at this juncture.) However, there are several fun sequences throughout, some of which even brought tears to my eyes: the opening scene in which a band of creditors angered the gang, they dress like Indians once they reach the Yukon, the gang's trick to make everyone rich with the same piece of gold; they pass for the Marriott of somnambulism to confuse the villains (a gag that owes its origin to the hilarious sequence of the mirror of Marx Bros. in DUCK SOUP [1933]), the theatrical sketch that mocks the melodramas, the surreal moment when, pursued by the villains, one of the gang members climbs a ladder that is part of the landscape painted in the theater, and especially towards the end, when a group of mounted policemen gallops very slowly to the rescue of the gang (ap to be incited by the Ranger hero becoming more impatient). <br /> <br /> The thin soundtrack and the frenetic nature of the gags themselves sometimes made it difficult for me to get all the jokes; the subtitles would certainly have been welcome in this case. The Crazy Gang only made five films, with the first two also well considered, OKAY FOR SOUND (1937) and ALF'S BUTTON AFLOAT (1938), and a much later meeting (although Allen, at this time, retired due to ill health and replaced by Eddie Gray) called LIFE IS A CIRCUS (1960, directed by Val Guest who, incidentally, co-wrote the two gang movies I bought, as well as some of the Hay and Askey vehicles mentioned above).
