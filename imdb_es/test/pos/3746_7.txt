Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) have just finished celebrating their commitment announcement in France with family and friends, when they receive a letter asking them to visit an ancestral castle located in Scotland. Reportedly, Gerald's uncle has become ill and has asked Gerald, the only heir, to be present. Gerald goes to Scotland, leaving behind his future girlfriend. A few weeks go by and it does not come back. Concerned, Kitty sends telegrams but receives no response from her fianc√©. Four more weeks passed and, finally, Kitty received a strange response from Gerald, canceling the engagement and telling her to continue with her life. Not ready to give up her relationship and look for answers, Kitty gets on a plane and decides to visit Gerald. Accompanying her on the trip is her sensible aunt Edith (Katherine Emery, best known for her starring role in the classic cooler of ISLA DE LOS MUERTOS). When Kitty and Edith arrive at MacTeam's property, they immediately suspect that something strange is happening. For starters, Gerald seems to have aged twenty years in a matter of weeks. Secondly, this kind, once pleasant and charming, has become a complete imbecile who repeatedly demands that they leave the castle and never return. When Edith suffers a slight cold, Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there and try to get to the bottom of things. <br /> <br /> Why is Gerald so cold and cruel to the woman he was? about to get married? Why is Gerald so opposed to having company? Why do the house rules state that guests must be locked inside their rooms at night? Why are guests prohibited from entering certain areas of the estate, such as Gerald's bedroom and a large maze of hedges in the back? And what makes those strange dragging noises every night? These are just some of the questions posed by MAZE. The movie really does a good job of building mystery and intrigue. You are really interested in what is happening and patiently await the resolution to explain the strange events that are happening. And then it happens ... I definitely do not want to ruin the end of this movie because it's better that you do not know, but it gives one of the most incredible and surprisingly strange twists I've seen in any movie. . In a way, it's wonderfully ridiculous, but it also takes a pretty solid b / w mystery and sends it straight to Z-grade Schlock territory. And yet, this ending seems so out of place, you probably do not forget it. once you see it <br /> <br /> Despite the ending (or maybe even partially due to the end), I really enjoyed this. strange bird It is extremely noisy and slow during the duration of the execution time, but it managed to maintain my interest at all times. Director William Cameron Menzies (who became the much more famous INVADERS FROM MARS the same year) is best known as a two-time Oscar-winning art director and his designs here are also very interesting. Sometimes there is a sensation of almost silent film, with works of models for some of the exteriors, some painted backgrounds and poorly decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As with any good castle ensemble, there are also secret passages and long stairs. This also includes some rubber bats on strings for a good measure. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are a bit stiff and clumsy, but I liked most of the cast. Hurst is one of those dark and mostly unknown actresses who, unfortunately, never seemed to capture despite being beautiful and talented. Emery, who also works as a narrator when framing shots at the beginning and end of the film, is decent enough as the aunt too polite and cautious. My favorite, however, was Michael Pate, the sinister silver-haired servant who makes this zombie walk in a hilariously upright way every time he climbs the stairs. Also on board in smaller roles are Hillary Brooke (who played the lead role in the mystery of Sherlock Holmes THE WOMAN IN GREEN) and Lilian Bond (THE OLD DARK HOUSE OF WHALE). Of course, Carlson also starred in IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and some other horror movies, so you have a pretty decent cast for fans of the genre. I say take a look!
