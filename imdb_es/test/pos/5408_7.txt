As I watched "Imaginary Heroes," it occurred to me that any writer trying to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing a child or two on the first reel as a way to get their characters to open up and reveal themselves. There must be something in this story, since it seems that all the other family dramas that appear in the pike scene use this device in one way or another ("Paradise" and "Moonlight Mile" are just two of the most recent examples that emerge Immediately In the mind, although one could reach a golden old man like "Who fears Virginia Woolf?" to make the point too.It is not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to explore. It's just that, as with any subject, it can be so overused that it becomes just another cliché of the movie, a bit of convenient narrative shorthand to roll the ball and give the characters something with what to deal with for the rest of the time we spend with them. <br /> <br /> The last of these works is "Imaginary Heroes", a film that is inspired by one of the oldest examples and, perhaps, best known of the "family that faces to the death of a children's genre, the winner of the Academy Award "Ordinary People". Like the characters from that previous film, the Travis seem to be, on the surface, the ideal suburban family, until, one fateful day, their eldest son, Matt, who is the athlete of the "golden child" and, so much, the apple of his father's eye is killed without explanation (a small difference is that the son of "ordinary people" dies as a result of an accident, not a suicide). It is the younger brother of Matt, Tim, who ends up finding the body and assumes the role of protagonist in the film. Each of the remaining members of the family faces the tragedy in its own way. Matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, moves away more and more from the father who has practically ignored him throughout his life and begins to resort to drugs for relief. Ben, the father, is involved in feelings of remorse and guilt, getting away from his job as much as his family. His wife, Sandy, is the most complex character in the film, a free-spirited child of the 60s who feels strangely drifting in the role of mother and wife, as he suffers a marriage basically without love in the sterile suburbs. He spends most of his time after the tragedy trying to reconnect with his past of smoking marijuana. <br /> <br /> As written and directed by Dan Harris, "Imaginary Heroes" emerges as a tremendously unequal movie. For each scene that feels real and authentic, there is another that appears as arbitrary and inauthentic. Sometimes, one has the feeling that Harris would like to include in his script all the possible situations of life, an admirable goal, perhaps, but one that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process. Instead of identifying with the characters and being trapped in their difficult situation, we often find ourselves thinking: "Oh, come now, what's next?" For teens, suicide is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot topics covered in this movie; The script also touches on drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life threatening illnesses and even involuntary incest of homosexuals. It is this "anything but the kitchen sink" mentality that steals much of the credibility that the movie needs to really worry us. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that "Imaginary Heroes" is a bad movie or not rewarded. Much of what you have to say about family relationships and values ​​in the 21st century is insightful, original, clear and profound. The main credit for its success is due to the actors, Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, who offer incisive and sensitive performances in their respective roles. It is they who triumph over narrative excesses to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts. In addition, Harris, in his direction, achieves a truly melancholic tone at all times, but which is often complemented by some much needed flashes of daring dark comedy. <br /> <br /> "Imaginary heroes" may appear out of focus and derivative at times, but their excellent performances and subtle mood swings make it a movie worth watching.
