The hospital is a film that was made before its time. This film, produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who gave us the Oscar-winning film, "Network," is about overworked staff, lack of incompetence and bureaucratic corruption in a large conglomerate hospital in Manhattan. George C. Scott, in an excellent performance as chief doctor, is taken to alcoholism and a death wish, while trying to recover from a divorce, expelling his son from home, and worst of all, a medical center where La Corruption and incompetence have priority over the care and healing of the sick and wounded. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott endorses the film, and viewers will be surprised what they see in this medical establishment. You can feel the "pain" (pun) of what this hospital has done to it. The vivid images of the incompetence of this hospital are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you can find yourself laughing and deeply disturbed from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> If only the film had stayed with that premise in a style of documentary style. As it begins, this image would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a secondary plot of Scott in love with the daughter of a senile patient. The patient has been murdering people in the hospital. This is where the credibility of the image becomes tense. The romantic scenes of dialogue add nothing to the image, and the mental patient, posing as a doctor, seemed totally incredible. A simple call for security and verification of records should have prevented the senile patient from committing the murders. It takes almost the entire film, before the security people enter the film to get the patient out of the hospital. I could not see A PERSON doing so much damage, even as corrupt as this hospital. <br /> <br /> In addition, George C Scott's character is "overworked" (another intentional pun) because the script has too many things going on right away. For example, within a 20 minute period, you can have up to 20 different doctors charged and deny what they should have done or not done. With the nurses and aids, it's the same story. Someone's record was misread, someone received the wrong medication and died, the doctor operated on the wrong patient, and another doctor did the same, blaming a third nurse who was not on duty because the second nurse who was supposed to admit the Patient was on his coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle and dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption that the spectator receives. <br /> <br /> This repetition of medical ineptitude is unforgettable. However, the secondary plot of murder is a distraction rather than an aid to this film. When the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and Scott's reactions to this, you're stuck on the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the crazy patient's daughter force the film into a kind of mystery "Who did it?" Scenario that seriously harms the quality of the film. When the crazy patient is revealing how he committed the murders, I asked myself the following: Why did the producers need the sub-plot of the crazy patient "find the murderer"? I think the only point in which Scott's character had a relationship with the senile patient's daughter, was to give someone to communicate with. The hospital should have kept its biting accusation from the medical profession by eliminating scenes of love interest and crazy patients. He should have focused on the incompetent B.S within his walls more frequently. At a time when this movie could have been phenomenal, the stories of the secondary plot make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been.
