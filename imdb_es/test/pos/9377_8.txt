As a general rule, there are few things more discouraging than Hollywood's attempts to be brave. By mixing caution with the hard hand, "message films" are patted on the back to dare to address major problems. CROSSFIRE is not completely free of this stain; It includes a sermon on the nature of meaningless hate that is shamefully obvious, assuming a level of naivete in your audience that is depressing to contemplate. As early as 1947, it was a great thing for a movie to announce that anti-Semitism existed and that it was bad. (It was unthinkable, of course, for Hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the film was based - its victim was homosexual). However, thanks to good writing and excellent performance, CROSSFIRE remains a persuasive examination of what we would now call a hate crime. <br /> <br /> Postwar unrest was one of the main components of black cinema, and CROSSFIRE deals with it directly. The film is set in Washington, DC, between soldiers who are still in uniform but inactive, and spend their days playing poker and bars. Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), an intelligent and kind Jew, explains that the end of the war has created a vacuum: all the energy that was used to hate and fight the enemy is now out of focus and bottled. Samuels encounters three soldiers in a bar: the sensitive Mitchell, who is close to a nervous breakdown, the weak Floyd Bowers and Montgomery, a tall and domineering bully who despicably a young Tennessee soldier like a stupid mound of hills. The three soldiers end up in Samuels' apartment, where drunken Monty becomes increasingly abusive and calls his host "Jewish boy." Samuels is beaten to death, and Mitchell disappears, becoming the prime suspect in the murder. <br /> <br /> Unraveling the crime is Detective Finlay (Robert Young), dry and according to the book, and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows that Mitchell is incapable of killing . Among the pieces of the puzzle are Ginny (Gloria Grahame), a nightclub hostess who met Mitchell and gave her the key to her apartment, and Floyd (Steve Brodie), who as a witness to the crime is scared terrified in a room of seedy rooms. While there is no real "suspense", the story is still exciting, and the trap set for the killer is extremely intelligent. <br /> <br /> The strong black atmosphere prevents the film from feeling didactic or intimidating. Cinematography is a game of amazing shadows, with dark shadows and harsh lights, rooms often illuminated by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke. The fatigue of the world is as widespread as black enlightenment. "Nothing interests me," says Finlay in a low voice; "Not at all," is Ginny's toast at the nightclub. Gloria Grahame, the model of black femininity, almost steals the film with its two scenes. Silver blonde, jaded and caustic, is the B girl par excellence, poisoned by the "stinking gin mill" where she works ("for laughter," she says bitterly), her sweet face puckers when Mitchell tells her to remind him than his wife Occasionally, a melancholy kindness pokes through his defensive shell, like when he dances with Mitchell in a deserted courtyard, and then offers to cook spaghetti in his apartment. When he goes there, he meets a sleepy man with a wrinkled face (Paul Kelly) who seems to fluff Ginny, and whose conversation is a dense layer of lies and false confessions. Gloria takes the wife of Mitchell's good girl off the screen in a scene where they ask her to give Mitchell an alibi. Slender and fragile in her bathrobe, with her delicacy as a child, she allows us to see how often Ginny has been insulted and dismissed as a vagabond. <br /> <br /> Robert Young is an indescribable actor, and he has no chance against Mitchum's charisma, but he does a good job of keeping his pipe-smoking character loaded with delivering the serious message of the film , this side of the pomp. Mitchum, meanwhile, gets a great dialogue, but not enough to do it; Even so, even when you're doing nothing but resting in a corner, you can not take your eyes off him. The third Robert, Ryan, creates a totally shadowed and frighteningly compelling portrait of an ignorant and unstable fanatic; we see his false cordiality, his intimidation, his resentment towards anyone with advantages, his "Am I right or am I right?" presumption; the ease with which he hits people's labels and the satisfaction he gets when he despises them. <br /> <br /> The CROSSFIRE message seems cautious and is dated now, although not as much as the GENTLEMAN AGREEMENT of the same year. Finlay's speech about intolerant police goes back a hundred years to a white victim case, reminding us that Irish Catholics were once persecuted; Then it could be people from Tennessee, he says, or men who wear striped ties. Or maybe the blacks, the Japanese, the homosexuals or the communists? The script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problem. He sweetens his message by making the Jewish victim holy, as if his innocence was not enough; and he worries about exonerating the military, when a superior officer declares that the army is ashamed of men like Montgomery and emphasizes that Samuels served with honor in the war. Still, it took some guts to represent, immediately after World War II, an American who could have been happier in the Nazi army, and the basic premise of the film is still valid. If Monty were alive today, he would have left on September 12, 2001 and would have beaten a Sikh.
