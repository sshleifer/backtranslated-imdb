Gary Busey did a splendid job playing rock and roll legend Buddy Holly (1936-59). He has an image of spitting at man. Being a garage band in the 50s is very different from today. Having a group of three is usually simple in those days. I bet Buddy Holly (Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, at that time it was just a quiet rural town. His parents were Christians, although his mother was a strong supporter of his son's work. That's one of the reasons why he did not act like Elvis. He stuck to his kindest ways. That really makes it good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. They hated rock-and-roll, that made Holly go out big time. Getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge for Holly and her friends. He went on tour with Sam Cooke, went to the famous Apollo, which the African-American audience accepted quickly, I liked that! And Sam Cooke made sure that Holly and his band received some service. That is what I call tolerance. It's sad that he, Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson interrupted their musical career due to a plane crash in 1959, at least their memories will last in our hearts. I do not know what mistakes are in the movie, the only thing that matters to me is that Buddy Holly overcame the obstacles of music and politics at that time, and the music is almost perfect. For Gary Busey, he was perfect on paper, and also in making music. GOD BLESS YOU GARY BUSEY! 5 STARS!
