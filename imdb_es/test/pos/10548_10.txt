This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's one of those movies where I know all the lines, but I can still see them several times without losing interest. I always throw myself into this movie if I go on vacation or if I do not want to go to the gym, just seeing Nikki's beautiful body will give me the motivation I need. It's an easy-to-see movie that always keeps me smiling, but I know it will not be a cup of tea for everyone, but if you like me, you love movies that are wonderfully shot and have comedy, romance and an interesting plot, you'll love it. It's full of great characters and Ben and Nikki are beautiful, so anyone can look at something attractive. LOWER LINE ...... YOU HAVE TO PAY IT! One day I saw him on television by chance and I loved having to go out and track him, which took me a while and I could see him every day. MY FATHER THE HERO I LOVE YOU !!!
