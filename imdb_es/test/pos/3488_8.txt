A Formula For Murder is not a known Giallo, but that does not mean it is not very good. The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind the cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film premiered at the end of the Giallo cycle, but is more than resistant to many of the films that were released in the "golden" period in the early seventies. Despite the lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly because of the competent way in which it mixes the scenes of death in the style of Argento with some really surprising plot twists and a lot of well-defined characters. The movie, perhaps, is not as exciting as many other films of the genre; but this is more than compensated for by the safe way in which the central situation is transmitted to the audience, and the tension resulting from that. The plot begins by showing a fake priest raping a young girl named Joanna, before pushing her down a flight of stairs. Then we advanced several years and now the girl is a woman, who unfortunately is in a wheelchair. She is being trained for a sports event by Craig; A man who also has romantic designs in it. However, his proposal was not received with enthusiasm by Joanna's personal assistant, who also has romantic designs on it. <br /> <br /> The film presents a halfway plot twist that constitutes the backbone of the film, and while it is not exactly logical; It's good to see and imply that an interesting movie is waiting for you. Director Alberto de Martino clearly is not afraid to show some scandalous bloody scenes, and the best of which in this film shows a priest being beaten to death by a shovel - and personally I would not hesitate to name that sequence as one of my Giallo's favorite murder scenes! The plot may be a bit irregular at times, but in general the action is very good. The director spends what seems like an eternity at the conclusion of the film; but it is absolutely full of tension, and the way it develops is good, since it takes advantage of all the points of the plot that have preceded it. The musical score, taken from Fulci's The New York Ripper, also works well in this film and, breaking with Giallo's tradition, Martino's film also features some pretty good performances by cult veteran David Warbeck and Christina Nagy, in his only feature film role. In general, this film is not one of the easiest to find Giallo; but it is worth tracking it and it is recommended to fans of this type of movies.
