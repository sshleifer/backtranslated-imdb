I should say that this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge has an eye to see things that no one would notice, therefore, Office Space. Hemakes makes a statement about the encumbrance of society and that the survival of the fittest is a simple dream impossible in 500 years. That pop culture and mass marketing by rich companies tend to dominate the day. Yes, there is a lot of humor in him and it is to make the story move and find out. But the genuine frustration in the face of Private Joe Bowers is priceless and, in some cases, we can all relate to him at some point in our lives. <br /> <br /> If you do not enjoy the humor, look at it from a different point of view and look at it again. I had a hard time seeing it twice to really appreciate this movie for what it is, and after having seen it twice, I am going to read a book now.
