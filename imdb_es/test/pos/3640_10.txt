This film, based on a true story by Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best movies I've seen about race relations in South Africa; A very good lesson in the history of the riots of the 1980s in South Africa. I put it on the scale of American History X insofar as it describes how a young man can be seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the "certain" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine about race to justify an injustice. <br /> <br /> It is a strong message of forgiveness and redemption, it is one of the few currently in the movies. The violence is well done to show the seriousness of Gerrit's crimes and the greatness of his transformation. <br /> <br /> A word about Jan Ellis who played Gerrit Wolfaardt. It takes you through the darkness of Gerrit's beginnings to his enlightened transformation. He went to some dark places as an actor and should be congratulated for his performance. <br /> <br /> Another outstanding performance was that of Mpho Lovinga, who plays Moses Moremi, a victim of Gerrit's crimes. He was able to get out of some places of pain that really touched you when you saw his performance. <br /> <br /> Very good movie to show the teenagers.
