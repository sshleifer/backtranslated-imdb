The kind of "small" movie in which the studios used to excel, but which they rarely do. A kind of "soul" version of the best known "The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells". Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and soul music aficionado, who is obsessed with the idea of ​​reuniting the members of a classic soul group, and the film follows his exploits and those of the group members; a cast that includes genuine musical talent such as Isaac Hayes, as well as acting fans Taurean Blacque, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas. It does not pretend to be an epic in any way, this is nevertheless a piece of solid gold.
