It was a very well written film, and the actors had a very exquisite way of representing the whole character. but when the movie came to an end, I felt like there was more, but they forgot to put it on the DVD. Maybe they are planning to do a sequel ... well, even if they do not, it's a good movie and a good rental, but even a better purchase.
