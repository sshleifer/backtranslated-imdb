This production was quite a surprise for me. I love the dark movies of the 30s, but I was not prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. If, by chance, you are not convinced in the first half, wait for the end. Of course, you should consider blatant racism as purely topical. A fascinating viewing experience, but I think THE CAT'S PAW is not yet available on video / DVD. Look at your PBS lists!
