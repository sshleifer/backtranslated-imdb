"The planet" is an amazing piece of making movies. For just Â£ 8,000, Stirton Production has turned out to be one of the most original sci-fi movies for a long time. <br /> <br /> Starring Mike Mitchell, a film that presents a great variety of special effects, strong. Storytelling and well-planned action. From the opening spatial battle, to the end of blows, everything about this film appears well above your budget. <br /> <br /> To begin with special effects, although it is certainly not the standard of "Revenge Of The Sith", the likes of Babylon 5 and Farscape are at a level, if not superior. And for a price cut too. The detail and movement are excellent, and capture the imagination from the beginning. The design of everything, ships, weapons, entities is unsurpassed. The imagination and creativity involved are a real surprise for a movie of this budget. <br /> <br /> Another surprise was the strength of the story and the arc that is needed. There are some twists and turns, most of which are well written in the script, are surprising and well executed. I was surprised that, two years ago and he imagined for the first time 15 years ago, how relevant some aspects of history are to today's society. With events around the world, there may be some resonance with the length at which the mercenaries are forced to go to survive. <br /> <br /> Even the effects of the sounds are perfect, just like atmospheric music. The use of light and costumes add to the professional appearance. Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen looks like a desolate and lonely place. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie seems 10, if not 100, multiplied by the budget spent, and that is testimony of a creative team and worker of people, from The director, to the cast, to the effects through of the producer and sound equipment. Wonderful effort, I recommend you put your hand on a copy as soon as possible
