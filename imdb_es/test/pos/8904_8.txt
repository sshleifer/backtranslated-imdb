... but I laughed. Much. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Ast√©rix et les Vikings' in a public screening during the World Cup. The sound was terrible, it was too bright to see the screen correctly, but I still had a lot of fun. The names of some of the characters made me roll on the floor: Smsix, Abba, Vikea ... All not very clever, but in the good Asterix tradition. Some very good jokes, but also some that not all seemed to capture. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like were the voices of Asterix and Obelix, at least in the German version. The voice actors are very well known around here, which was the only reason they were cast, really. They do not fit at all with the characters. <br /> <br /> In general, a good way to spend some time (and if it's free, as in my case, all the best) and have a couple of laughs 8 out of 10.
