I really can not see why people do not like this movie. I found it very entertaining (of course, the fact that it is starring the beautiful Laura Fraser is an advantage). When I heard it for the first time, I thought it would be in the line of a "strange science" with the paper reversed and, for a certain extent, this is true, however, there is a turn that I did not see coming. After having seen the trailer on the DVD (which I had not seen before watching the movie), I saw that the "spin" is shown on the trailer. Very strange. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, the comparison of "Weird Science" adjusts less and less, and I think this is the best of the two films. Certainly, there are some scenes that do not work beautifully, but are composed by the enthusiasm of the young cast. <br /> <br /> In summary, I suggest that this is a good example of a science fiction. -fi girls movie, and I do not think I've seen many of them!
