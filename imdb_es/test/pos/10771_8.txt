Sonny Chiba, as everyone knows, is man. In this film, he portrays Mas Oyama (1923-1994), a true martial artist who fought with more than 50 bulls with his own hands and won (an interesting guy looks at him). Anyway, Chiba only kills a bull in the movie, but it's a memorable scene and, as the notes say, right next to the zombie scene. shark in Zombie. The film also offers a lot of close combat and a decent plan to start, although I do not think that everything is true. This film is the first of the Oyama trilogy made by Chiba and is recommended for fans of martial arts action. Finally, three small pieces ordered; part of the opening theme was used in Kill Bill Volume 1, Oyama himself appears in the opening sequences, and that's because he trained Chiba in real life for five years!
