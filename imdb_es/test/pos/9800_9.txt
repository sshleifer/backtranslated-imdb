The first time I saw this movie was like a younger child. My sister had told me and I thought it would be more like a movie for children. However, it remains to be an incredible movie too. It is true that the subject behind the film is wrong, but it is also true that this movie will never stop touching your heart. <br /> <br /> I was only 6 years old when I saw it for the first time and yesterday, 7 years later, I saw it again. . For the first time in a long time. Even after I knew how it ended, I knew I had seen him a billion, a billion times I cried like a tiny baby. When I saw it a few years ago, I finally had the idea and the seriousness of the film. So I stopped looking at him for a while. But yesterday I did not change the channel, I saw it. In the end I was amazed at how much it still made me laugh, cry, think and, above all, return to believe in the merics. I have not believed in a long time and this movie took me out of my shell and opened my heart. This movie was not only shocking. I was also very impressed by the actors. Especially Bobby. So if you want to see this movie for the first time, I suggest seeing it alone. With the tissues. And be ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent side and the side that still has hope. This film moved me when I was only 6 years old, and even in this moment of trying to discover who I am, this movie helped me to realize what I do not want and still want to be in life.
