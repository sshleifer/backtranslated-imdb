What is there to say about this movie? This movie is simply beautiful. A true feast for the eyes. In the same way that the game set the standard for 3D role-playing games 7 years ago, this movie sets the standard for future CG movies. Many of you have seen the breakthroughs and the amazing details in each frame, and let me tell you that this movie does not disappoint. You can really see the fibers in Cloud's sweater vest. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. The film contains several reorganized tracks of the game that the fans will undoubtedly recognize and appreciate. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the film is its history. It's not exactly a bad story, but this story is aimed exclusively at people who have played the game. Spectators for the first time may feel lost at times, or may not notice the importance of certain events. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you have never played the game because what we have here is a special movie Watch it and enjoy the beautiful show.
