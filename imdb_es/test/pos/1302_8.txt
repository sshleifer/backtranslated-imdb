It's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the leadership of the man of the mouth, this has a solid performance of both the male protagonists and the female protagonist and, although the story is a little long and a bit of clichÃ©, you can not avoid that you like. br /> <br /> I think the story was a bit hasty in the end, but extending it would have made the story even longer. Superior to other romantic comedies like 100 days with Mr. Arrogant, and possibly with my tutor friend. <br /> <br /> It would be an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as good as My cheeky girl, but still good. .
