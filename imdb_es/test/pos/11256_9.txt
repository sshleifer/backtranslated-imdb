This movie was incredible. I've never seen a movie before that has taken me to the harsh reality of drug use like this. There is no glamor, no layer of sugar, no glorification of heroin. This film shows the real struggles, the pain and the loss that people go through when they try this medicine. Good movie, decent and emotionally full performance, and a great story. A lot of clock! <br /> <br />
