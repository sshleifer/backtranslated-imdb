This film focused on a young woman who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life. It made me think of other films like "Song of Bernadette" and "Francis of Assisi" and has a strong influence of the Catholic faith in the film. Ann Blyth is very charming as a first, the student of the Catholic school and then as a young woman who buys a statue of Saint Anne (which is the name of the street where I live, by the way) and makes many prayers for the saint. Intercession every time problems arise in your life. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea of ​​Andy Griffith's show) and Edmund Gwenn (of Miracle on 34th Street) play relatives of her. A local priest of mine used to say that my sister looked like Ann Blyth and that both have the same name and middle name. A good family movie that came from a time when life was a little simpler.
