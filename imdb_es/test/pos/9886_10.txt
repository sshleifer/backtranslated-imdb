I saw the premiere of this movie during the Phoenix Film Festival in 2005 and I was very impressed with the ability of the Director, Jeff Hare, who showed himself by presenting this timely theme on the screen. The cast of characters combined perfectly and allowed us to examine the subject of an old man who wanted to die on "his own terms" in a very warm and humorous way. Peter Falk was brilliant when Morris and the support group of family members and friends were chosen perfectly in their roles. The interaction of family, friends and strangers with Morris created a realistic vision of how families approach the aging problem of their parents and their desire to die with dignity. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is apparently a film about a Jewish actor and his family, it is really a film about all families. The jokes that the family and Morris break during this game through the life of a "Force of Nature" are fresh and realistic. Child rivalries, successes and failures of adults and hope for children are an integral part of this script. While many will question how you can make the subject of suicide "humorous", I thought the treatment was logical and timely. If you are not afraid to shed some tears or laugh at the jokes of a family struggling with this problem, YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> The film was awarded "Best Film" in the Phoenix Festival film.
