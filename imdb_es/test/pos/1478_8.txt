I rate this quite high only because of Sam Elliott. I could have done it without female nudity, but I felt in the middle of almost any nonsense to see Sam show his stuff. He is capable of spitting marvelously cynical wits, many of which I agree with, and it is a joy to see him in a role where he really arrives at emote instead of just standing frowning and looking manly as he can be. My boyfriend thought that this movie is similar to a movie in which Ed Harris had a Hispanic partner (in the police sense of the term!) Who was a little anxious to prove his worth. You can draw your own conclusions in that regard, but if you like Sam, you will like this. You could say that I am partial, but who is not it in some way? I would buy this on DVD in a heartbeat!
