'The English Patient' by Anthony Minghella is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grand and impressive in scale, and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. At the 1997 Academy Awards, the film was the owner of the night, taking home nine awards of twelve nominations, the most decisive cleaning sweep since Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on the winning novel of the 1992 Booker Prize by Canadian author Michael Ondaatje. name, 'The English Patient' is a poignant meditation on life, love and loss, which traces the story of a man burned by criticism after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> During the war, a man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the burning remains of a crashed plane. With his face marked beyond recognition, and with the man apparently suffering from amnesia, he is supposed to be an allied soldier, and he is simply known as "the English patient." After the war, in the hills of Italy's mines, a kind nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), who apparently has lost everyone close to her, remains in a ruined monastery to take care of the dying man. Over time, she learns more and more about her "English patient", which in reality is revealed to be a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Instead of losing his memory in the plane crash, we learned that this scarred man may have chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to heal from the tragic memories of his past love. Through numerous flashbacks, we learn about the ancient feats of Almásy in the Sahara desert, and his romantic relationship with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> It's certainly easy to see why 'The English Patient' was so successful at the Oscars. It is such a beautiful film, combining the tranquil beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Film director John Seale captures the landscape perfectly; not since the magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' by David Lean has a movie that shows the desert with such beauty and grandeur, making particularly good use of the aerial shots from Almásy's plane. Even in the most intimate moments of the film, the excellent use of close-ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene, together, of course, with the brilliant performances of all the cast members. <br /> <br /> For a long time my favorite actor, 'The English Patient' could contain the best performance of Ralph Fiennes, and, considering his story, includes films like 'Schindler's List' and 'The Constant Gardener', this It is not a complement that should be taken lightly. His Count Laszlo de Almásy is initially a very sympathetic character, but, as we learn more about his past, his pleasant qualities are eroded by his less admirable tendencies towards others. "The property" is an important theme of the film. When Katherine asks him what he hates most, Almásy responds with "Property, Owning, When you leave, you must forget me." However, as the relationship progresses, and Katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him, Almásy reveals a touch of arrogance, insisting that her love for her somehow entitles her to have her whenever she wants: "I want to touch you. the things that are mine, that belong to me. " <br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar for her performance here, is excellent as Hana, the lonely nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies they have always had. Damage to those who are close to her. After a while of caring for Almásy alone, he was joined by a dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his thumbs during the war, and who suspects that Almásy was the one who betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also establishes a tentative romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), a diffuser of Indian bombs in the British Army. However, due to her past history, Hana fears that getting involved with Kip will condemn him to death, especially considering his very dangerous line of work. <br /> <br /> At 160 minutes long, 'The English Patient' Wonderfully conjures up memories of the classic romantic epics of yesteryear, successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The end of the film is heartbreaking and sad, but also edifying in its own way. While some romantic relationships are condemned from the beginning, others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. However, in all cases, it is always better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all.
