I think it's the kind of movie you love or hate, and I'm really not the type to go to for artistic films. My mother rented "mullhuland DR" the other night and I almost ran out of the room, ha. But I love this movie. <br /> <br /> We recorded "The Beat" one night when we just let the tape run and we got a great movie like that by accident. I kept that tape and saw it a lot. I finally got the VHS to add to my collection. I've seen it many times and in a moment I copied the poems. I even tried to preform a scene for my high school drama class. She had said that we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words. She refused to let me do it. If I could bother my drama teacher, it has to be good :) Honestly, she never treated me the same after that. <br /> <br /> I liked the performance, it came out very true and honest. It was not clean and polished, but it was better than that. I was true to life, how someone would really behave and show emotions, not how Hollywood does it. It was a great performance, especially Rex's. <br /> <br /> The story was original. Not only the characters are attracted to their world but you too. It is not that your typical person encounters the children of the city and saves them through a film of knowledge. Just worry and friendship makes things a little better. <br /> <br /> The only thing is that even in the 80s there was more violence with weapons and less simple things like the throwing of rocks, but that little innocence did not damage this. movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must see. You will love it or you will hate it, but in any case it has an impact and that is a good movie that you will remember and talk about later.
