A friend of mine asked, "Does not one have to be pro-euthanasia to like this movie? Is it a mistake of the film to infer that most quadriplegics want to end their lives?" Interesting questions <br /> <br /> As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in The Sea Inside. He thinks that Ramón Sampedro also addressed this in the film. It is he who wants to die. It is he who fights for his right to decide his death. He speaks for himself and not for other quadriplegics. Although his pioneering work, depending on one's perspective, may be beneficial or detrimental to the quadriplegies along the way, his main objective is personal. But one thing that makes this film (my opinion anyway), is that it forces viewers to ask us the inferential questions that my friend has formulated so succinctly. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing of The Sea Inside, I walked home in a conflicting blur. I struggled to reconcile myself with this exasperating notion; Why would Ramón want to die? Given the love, care and sacrifices that the people around him have unconditionally covered over Ramón, why did he cling obstinately to his painful decision? Then, on my second visit, a thought shared between Ramón and the lawyer entered my conscience. He launched a revealing observation: "... total dependence occurs at the expense of privacy." Most human beings crave such intimacy. Of course, how much we value those "needs" depends to a large extent on the individual. <br /> <br /> As a person with a sensitivity of family prejudice, I strongly empathized with the caregivers in this film. Why can not Javier consider the sacrifice and love of his family and friends? Are you blind to all this? I would think not. The miracle of The Sea Inside, therefore, is its insightful description of a very humanistic war pull. When we face the guardianship of a healthy but disabled loved one, who has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intention to die, what is the right thing to do? To care for and keep this loved one alive, against his will, is a pious gesture? Is the value of our love shown? Or does it simply appease our "selfish" fears of irreplaceable losses? With so much understanding given to caregivers, would not their charges be invalid, by submitting to total dependence on others to survive, an act of sacrifice overlooked? Rhetorical or not, how much is "dignity" worth to an individual? Is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege or a right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their final decisions in life (as in death)? A torrent of questions that the film could have asked, answers to which I am not in a position to provide. <br /> <br /> In our eagerness to demarcate intellectually the merits of pro-life or pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of ​​grays that is enveloping the most intimately affected people, the caregivers and those who they take care The Sea Inside, therefore, tried to present the dynamic of delicate but complex relationships between them. Intuitively, this movie understands one thing; that the nature of "sacrifice" is never unilateral. In this battle, we must try not to win arguments, but watch carefully and, hopefully, determine who is the "strongest" part to make that sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The Sea Inside is an instructive film. He opened my eyes to things I do not want to see. And for that, I'm grateful.
