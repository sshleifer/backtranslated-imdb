I just watched the movie, through Netflix. I was intrigued by the way the movie was described, but in the end, it was better. I moved in many different directions while watching this movie. He was full of pain, hate, anger, bitterness, pain and finally relief. Looking at the accused youth would break your heart and convince you that they had the wrong person. The sufficiency of the police makes him cry, because just as Rodney King's hit brought to light, the brutality of the police, this film reveals the total lack of moral fiber in these policemen. And the fact that they beat this boy and they got away with it, it just makes you more angry. <br /> <br /> But, I must tell you that I fell in love with the lawyer, Mc Guinness. One of my favorite phrases, when he was telling us what a hole is in the police ... The policeman told him, to continue, to suck that rod of cancer. Mc Guinness told the policeman ... "I always smoke a cigarette before sex ..." I was telling him I was going to fuck him up "<br /> <br /> I have a new respect for the law in this country .
