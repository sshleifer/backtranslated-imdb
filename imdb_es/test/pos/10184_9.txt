I saw the second part of this beautiful piece of time on a ship sometime in the nineteenth century. Golding's book should be responsible for some of the excellent dialogues, but everything else was good too! I especially liked the way they created the period and the feeling of being so good on the boat. For me, this had a sense of integrity that I know I can not express in words ... Maybe it was the way in which the technical and historical details about navigation were mixed in the eighteen hundreds of history without dirtying it. above. Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. It is not often that a miniseries sends me to the "zone", but this one did.
