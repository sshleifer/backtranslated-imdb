I'm not sure where to start with this. In short, it was a disappointing movie. After having taught the novel, I knew it would be a difficult story to turn it into a movie. The film has a couple of interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach) but it does not represent the debate about the art that basically shapes the novel. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I was expecting an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen years old, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, whereas in the film he reeks of sexuality and is a mockery. He is an accomplice of Aschenbach, always looks at him, almost provocatively. In the book, it is Aschenbach who steals glances at the child. As for Aschenbach, I imagined something closer to the professor turned clown in The Blue Angel (based on a story about Thomas Mann's brother, Heinrich) who is forty years old with hardly any gray hair. To be fair, I think Dirk Bogarde did a good job, but either someone else should have done that, or should have made him look older at the beginning. <br /> <br /> I know that the discovery of homosexuality is important for the story, but the film minimizes the talk about art and the duality between the Apollonian and the Dyonisian inspirations and focuses on Tchenzio's obsession with Aschenbach and It does not justify that. I liked the fact that Mahler's music was used, because in the end it inspired Mann to write his story. I'm not sure that turning Aschenbach into a musician was a particularly good move. Or the creation of Alfred, which I do not remember in the book. <br /> <br /> And one thing that really caught my attention was the sound and how it did not match the actors' lips. I was wondering if it was bent because I expected it to be in Italian. But then I remembered that every Italian movie I've seen has this problem. It just bothers me because these directors (Fellini is the other person I'm thinking of) are supposed to personify perfection in Italian cinema, and here are their characters laughing without sound, then you hear a noise that does not correspond to their faces. (I'm thinking about the scenes in which Aschenbach almost collapses and starts to laugh - this scene could / should have been the strongest, but instead it was annoying).
