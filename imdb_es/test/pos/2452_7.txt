It is not for those addicted to adrenaline, etc. It's a good movie, after the war, a psychic problem, from the other point of view. <br /> <br /> Emilio Est√©vez is great as a young man, persecuted by the demons of the Vietnam War, causing problems in the family. <br /> <br /> Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to the problem of how to deal with the past, with whom <br /> <br /> The character of Emilion Estevez seems unable to deal, and the character of Martin Sheen does not want to deal with the. <br /> <br /> The protective mother looks at this problem with a warm and open heart, but with a closed mind for the obvious reasons.
