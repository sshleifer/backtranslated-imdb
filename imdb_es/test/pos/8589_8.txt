Good Movie, the performance was excellent, especially on the part of Eriq Ebouaney (Lumumba) and very well directed. <br /> <br /> It also shows how Lumumba was cornered by the Belgians, USA. UU And the United Nations, and how they called it a "communist" to scare people like they did with all true honest African leaders like Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others. It shows how Western countries preach democracy while they have something else in mind. It is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality. <br /> <br /> Show how Lumumba could not control his people, yes, they were his people, but before blaming him, was he getting enough if any of the people he named in his government as Mobutu ? Or your colleague had other things in mind, to discover go and see the movie! Without a doubt, Mobutu did, he continued looting the country for the next 35 years, before he was overthrown and fled the country. He died a billionaire. <br /> <br /> Some flaws: There was very little explanation of how the man (Lumumba) got up in the first place. There should also be more explanations about the country, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly known as Zaire when it was under Mobutu. There should be an explanation of why he (Lumumba) could not keep the second largest country in Africa in one piece. And also what was happening with Tshombe and Katanga. Just head in if you are going to watch the movie. Tshombe controlled the Katanga region, which (if I'm not mistaken) is the world's number one copper producer. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good movie to watch. . You will learn something new about Africa, its leaders and its people, and you will probably open your eyes to why this continent is plagued by wars.
