When Patricia Newell is attacked after witnessing the murder of her cousin, Detective Carrella searches the city for her murderer. Identifying the murderer after intense persecution, Patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country. For Carrella the case is closed ... or is "Blood Relatives" is a masterpiece overlooked. Donald Sutherland plays a cop and it's nice to see Donald Pleasance in a small role as a child molester. The conclusion is quite disturbing. Still, "Blood Relatives" is more of a mystery than a horror movie, so Gore fans will be disappointed. A must for fans of old-fashioned mystery movies. 9 out of 10.
