The first time I saw this in demand. Or on TV. I'm not really sure. But this has to be my favorite movie of all time! I mean, this movie has blood, gore, laughter and chills throughout the movie. I recently ordered "Monster Man" from Amazon and I've been watching "Monster Man" since I got it. Trust me, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. The comment on the DVD is very funny. They also said something about "Monster Man 2" during the comment. Let's hope they do "Monster Man 2"! If you have the opportunity, rent the movie or buy it. You will absolutely love it! This is the best movie that came out in 2003. <br /> <br /> 10/10
