"Robin Hood: Men in Tights" has not received any kind of respect. It was hilarious! Cary Elwes was excellent as the "Prince of Thieves", and David Chappelle, Amy Yasbeck, Patrick Stewart, Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield as Blinkin did good works. I will never understand the hostility towards "Robin Hood: Men in Tights", but I do know a great comedy when I see it. <br /> <br /> "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" receives a beating of ****.
