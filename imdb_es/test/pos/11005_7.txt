I think Gerard's comments on the document hit the nail on the head. Interesting movie, but very long. Definitely, it is the antithesis of the new school of striking, sexy documents in the style of Moore. There is no narrator, there are no facts or complementary information intertwined, and there are no other tricks. What you see is what you get: a glimpse into the disappearing world of the salt men of Tibet. As a big fan of the documents, I was surprised how much I lost attention with this movie, due to the length and lack of dialogue. However, in the end I would recommend it if the subject seems interesting to you. It is beautifully filmed, informative and presents a valuable (and closed) window to the way of life of Tibetan salt men (and women :): all the important attributes of a good doc. But putting in a big cup of coffee, will help.
