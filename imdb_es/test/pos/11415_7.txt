While I was reading all the complaints about this movie before I saw it, I was still interested in the preview. I do not know if it was because I was expecting a bomb or what, but I really enjoyed the movie. I was not scared until the second half of the movie, but even so it was not bad at all. I think most of the scenes and the false alarms were realistic, although a bit coincident, but it was necessary to advance the story. I think the house and the surrounding area is the perfect setting for this type of movie, it's beautiful and huge, but then the same qualities that are attractive become terrifying. I also think that the lighting arrangement worked extremely well because not only did they light up on entering, but there was no way to keep them lit, so the house remained in darkness outside the small section where Jill was. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Jill, I thought that her part had performed quite well, at first it was not so believable, but after some phone calls it was fine. In fact, the scenes in which she is afraid act perfectly. And, finally, someone got the right poker fire. I can not say how many times, when I hear a noise in my house, I took over Fire Poker, and it was a nice touch for her to do the same, even though she forgets an idiot when she needs it most. <Br /> <br /> When it comes to the holes in the plot, the film is not perfect, but almost all the holes can be explained, and part of the mystery is how it got ... exactly, how long was it? looking at it? How did he come out to kill his friend? And when exactly did the gardener die? In general, I enjoyed it and I was surprised at how fast it was. It caught my attention and I wanted to see how it ended, although the end was very short and left a bad taste in my mouth. My only complaint, aside from the end, was the lack of character development. They could have added ten minutes with her and her friends or something to make us feel worse for her situation, to give us an idea of ​​her personality and to give us an idea of ​​how she will handle the situation (for example, the scene where she debates whether to return for the children, it seems that at the beginning there is a missing scene that said that she only cared for herself or something like that.
