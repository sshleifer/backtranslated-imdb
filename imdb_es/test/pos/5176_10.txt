The BIG NEWS is that this movie is AVAILABLE on DVD from http://treasureflix.com for all those who wish to own it, as well as on video. It's good news because it's one of my favorite movies! <Br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in the 80s and it is mandatory to see it on vacation. Living in the small commercial city called Tewkesbury, picturesque and with its own traditions, recreations and traditions, we are also a cozy and close community. Now we are also facing big housing developments that threaten to destroy the Community and you can see why I love this movie. First of all, and most importantly, NOT MANY snowfalls !!! Then there is the beautiful legend of the Christmas tree and also the Christian outcome, as the whole community coughs up the money to help the destitute farmer save his farm and stay in the community. The evil developers, only after they send the money, the whole town is committed to helping protect what they have, which is very special. I love the way the whole community sends its message to Santa through the post office that the hero does not understand. He and his daughter have a long journey to make after the death of the wife and mother of the family. (There is a likely candidate for this) - even a sleigh ride and most comforting of all is that the taxi driver, whose engine is broken, mysteriously receives a new one on Christmas morning and no one had designed it! There is a charming moment where Denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. Great soft film for all that Christmas is really.
