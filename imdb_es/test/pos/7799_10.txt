The movie Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the top 5 of the intelligent comedy movies ever made in Bollywood, maybe even in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> When the movie premiered, I was 8 years old and I heard it was a failure, but I never understood until now why it was a failure ... but let me tell you something ... this movie would have more money selling cassette tapes and DVDs and showing them on television movie channels than any successful movie in theaters. This movie has been shown countless times on movie channels and I think even now public love and TV producers keep repeating the movie over and over again. Personally, I've seen the whole movie more than 80 -100 times and I still love it ... <br /> <br /> Aamir khan's performance as Amar and Salman khan as Prem is amazing, but I especially liked the performance of Aamir Khan as an intelligent street kid ... his dialogues in the movie are hilarious ... the story is simple and he says how it goes ..... <br /> <br /> Amar and Prem are poor, lazy and they come from a poor family of tailors and the father of Amars is a barber. Then, both receive the news that the daughter of a millionaire from London will come to India to find a suitable combination ... both Amar and Prem believe that this is a brilliant opportunity to become super rich ... therefore, both go to woo Raveena Tandon .. (the daughter of the millionaires) ...... on their trip, both hate each other and try to trick the other to marry Raveena ..... the scenes of comedy meanwhile they are so funny that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach when laughing ....... and then there is Uncle Raveenas (the brother of a millionaire) Teja who wants revenge on Raveenas' father ..... since he is bankrupt and the father of Raveenas is a millionaire ... his plans include the kidnapping of Raveena to blackmail the father of Raveenas by which he hires 2 butlers ..... < br /> <br /> but later we found out that there is a twist in the movie (see the movie for know) ........ then there is Shakti Kapoor as a Gogo crime master who is also incredibly fu nny ...... <br /> <br /> What struck me most were the dialogues of the film, which has become a legend of all kinds ... Aamir Khan uses his "aaila" brilliantly and Salman goes as "OOima" ........ and for Gogo there is "Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain for Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi for Gogo Aa Jaega "... every scene is so funny ...... <br /> <br /> I especially liked the one in which Aamir khan and Salman went to Raveena's Tile and the two go to the Moon with the money "scream" in a bag ... that scene is very funny ... <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie .. This is a movie that I would recommend to have a DVD and you will never regret it. ......
