I was really satisfied when I played this game. The graphics were something new. The missions were great. However, I felt that I wanted more of this game. For a James Bond game it's pretty good but not as good as its other games. It would be great if they could do a 360Rake for it. It would be much better then. This could be because I'm in games like Resident Evil, Dead Rising and that kind of games. So it could be better, but it was good to play. One thing I absolutely hated about this game was Natalya! I was irritating dying all the time and I could not run either. I recommend this game for those who like FPS games more than me.7 / 10 STARS
