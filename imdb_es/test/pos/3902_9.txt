Co-written by William H. Macy of, possibly, the best and most difficult to find novel by Donald E. Westlake, "A Travesty". * Very faithful to the story, the film stars Macy as an unfortunate man who gets too far from his head after trying to cover up an accidental death. Costars Adam Arkin and James Cromwell in good supporting roles. The strength of the film lies in the intricate plot after twisting and in the performance, in particular by Macy, who routinely and charmingly breaks the 4th wall here and gets away with it at all times. A good story with a lot of dark humor, this committed me enough to have seen it three times in the week since it came out. Prepare to put aside your critical faculties and issue a noisy "bipartisan".
