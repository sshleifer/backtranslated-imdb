... The reason why I like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has. It's a great movie for summer camp, so jokes are not malicious in a lasting way that makes a character the permanent target of ridicule. They make jokes, but you have the feeling that the respective guys in the fall could look back and laugh, having been foolish enough to fall in love with them, and without being too corny, it's really nice that everyone is still friends. The end! <br /> <br /> It's a special special bonus when the master of ceremonies of all these jolly japes is Bill Murray. For me, he is still considered the god of comedy without equal when he has the opportunity to free himself. No one is better at generating a sense of extravagant anarchy without hurting anyone. The tone of the whole movie has the same style as its protagonist, set with a large opening scene that shows how Murray prepares for the day. Everything is silly, yes, but more important than behaving like an adult is having a lot of kind fun. "Meatballs" promises that and, ultimately, offers a nutritious watch.
