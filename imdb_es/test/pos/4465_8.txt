With a title apparently more suitable for a Looney Tunes piece than for a spooky giallo, "Do not Torture a Duckling" (1972) is, however, a Grade A thriller by horror master Lucio Fulci. In this, someone has been strangulating preadolescent children in a rural town in southern Italy and, typical of these gialli, there are many suspects. There's Barbara Bouchet (Patrizia), who looks more carefree than you've ever seen her, a rich girl who hides behind a drug scandal; Florinda Bolkan (Martiara), the local epileptic vilu woman; her boyfriend of witchcraft; Giuseppe, the local idiot; the priest with a sweet face; His mother stern and so on. The film presents some pieces of unusually violent scenes, including a whipping chain of one of the main characters in a cemetery (one of the most realistic and bloody sequences I've seen in my life) and an ingenious dukeout when the killer is finally revealed . The outbursts of violence in the film compensate for the fact that there is no fear or suspense to speak of. Still, this giallo fascinates, with its unusual rural background, the disturbing murders of children, the strange characters and the strange score of Riz Ortolani. The film has been beautifully photographed in what I presume is Monte Sant'Angelo, near the Adriatic in southern Italy (at least, thanks to the city police in closing credits). And although subtitling would have made this sleek-looking DVD work even better (American jargon does not convince in this Italian rural setting), Anchor Bay should be thanked for another job well done. Oh ... that title ALWAYS makes perfect sense, too!
