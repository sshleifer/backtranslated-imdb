Behind the nostalgic music, we see a child getting off a train. He arrives from Yugoslavia to meet his father, a man he has not seen in a decade. At the train station, we meet the man. He never smiles. <br /> <br /> Therefore, we started our journey to "Four Friends", the powerful and amazing film by Arthur Penn. You can ask why I started my review that way. Well, that's the way the video box describes the movie. You may have discovered that the film will be the story of the child who will try to get along with this man without emotion and, finally, will take off his cover and expose the friendliness. <br /> <br /> Well, if I bought that, I have a bridge that I want to sell you. You see, modern Hollywood would make that movie. Penn has always been a stranger and has never resorted to the typical clich√© narration. He always tells interesting stories about people (his credits include "Bonnie and Clyde", "The Chase", "Alice's Restaurant" and the underestimated "Mickey One") and "Four Friends" is no exception. <br /> <br /> A typical Hollywood movie would focus on the boy named Danilo. But Steve Tesich's script only focuses on that for about 4 minutes and then leaves it. We meet the adult Danilo, played by Craig Wasson (whom you can recognize from "Body Double" and "Nightmare on Elm Street 3") and his friends, Tom, David and the passionate Georgia. The film takes us through the sixties. Now in a minor movie, events would receive attention. But in "Four friends", these events happen, but Penn and Tesich are more concerned with the study of the character than the plot and I think the movie is better that way. We know the events; We do not need to insist on them again. <br /> <br /> I know I have not described much of the plot, but I do not know if you can describe "Four friends". It is not one of those "high concept" films that can be described in a single sentence. It is a film of many moods and textures. It is also a genuinely emotional experience. The last twenty minutes of this movie moved me to tears. I'm not ashamed to admit it. Rarely does a movie have such power that it can reduce me to tears. The acting is first class, especially by Craig Wasson, who seems to be one of the most underutilized actors working today. This is such a difficult emotional performance and Wasson does it. I should have received an Oscar for this. Another great performance is by Jodi Thelen, who has an even more difficult role than Wasson. But she handles it extremely well and gives Georgia a certain dignity that most Hollywood actresses would not (they would be too scared to try, they would be more concerned with image than with a great performance; that. ). She also deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> "Four friends" did not get much push in 1981. Maybe people simply did not have the emotional capacity to handle it. And the clueless executives could not put pressure on him like another "American Graffiti" (he lacks the touch of "Four friends"). So they let him die. Pity, because this is one of the best movies of the 1980s, a decade in which more and more garbage was created and a great art like this had no home. I ask you to give this film a chance. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
