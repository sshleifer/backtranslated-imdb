I LOVED this movie because Bobbie Phillips CAN REALLY FIGHT! I always hate when actors are not credible in action parts. It was great to see it, without offending, but a WOMAN who can skillfully perform martial arts and fights. If you compare this with most action movies with females, you will DEFINITELY see what I mean. You do not have to cut the shots with someone who can fight and it flows better. I was very impressed. I hope there is more!
