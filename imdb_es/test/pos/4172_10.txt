Symbolism in abundance, great melodies, this film crushed the expectations of its target audience "that will soon cease to be." These monkees and the members of the group selected naturally, witnessed a subtle but in their face, they say goodbye to each other. The message becomes a reality today, the cage that escapes and the bridge that wants to jump, are the disappointments of the next generations, there will always be new children in the block that will replace those who are freed from the chains. The film can be frustrating at times, because the themes that the film attacks are so clearly separated from the American way of life, a thinking and reasoning person can not stop looking at his own reflection in the scenes of Head, and not only questions his personality . Reasons to continue with the madness of the daily life of the Americans, but the reasons of those who want it to continue for the sake of madness. The final scene, similar to the chivalrous audacity of the caged tiger of Don Quixote to go out to battle, represents how illusory and impossible most dreams are.
