This is one of the few movies that I was recommended as absolutely brilliant, that's really it. If you give this movie a low note of what you really missed the point. You could describe Fosca as a manipulator, but if it is really serious, he gets sick when the love of the one who is sure does not receive an answer. But what would you do when you are sure that the other loves you and is "just" rejected by the fact that you are ugly? Would not you fight for that? At least I think it's better to fight for it than to die in bitterness. And it reminds me of the fact that I, as a man, react at first sight completely to the physical ugliness of Fosca and do not look any more to the person who is or can be. This film confronts me with very solemn questions about respect, trust, feeling of manipulation, etc. How can I know if someone is manipulating me or is simply trying everything to make contact? What I think is the most outstanding feature in this film is that Ettore Scola made it absolutely believable that Giorgio fell in love with Fosca.
