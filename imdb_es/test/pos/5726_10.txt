The Elegant Documentary - <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie ... if you are a student of egocentric physics. This much less than one percent (tiny fraction) of the population may find that this program simply tells them what they have already learned and already know. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie! - If you are one of the great majority of people who belong to 99% of the population that does not study or already has a good knowledge of the theories of physics, including relativity, quantum, chain and theory M. < br /> <br /> What a brilliantly designed documentary. Starting with some useful historical background, you will be led step by step through an elegant universe of pure magic, and dimensions beyond. I have always had a great appreciation of mathematics. This movie can easily give you an idea of ​​what an exquisitely beautiful language math is without letting you feel like you are about to fail in qualifying. <br /> <br /> The show is repetitive at times, since the original format was a Mini series divided into three shows. Therefore, it makes sense to give us small reminders of the principles that are presented. I found this immensely useful as it reminded me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our own existence. <br /> <br /> We are all (and everything around us) is vibrational energy With a natural tendency towards harmony. This movie can blow your mind, or at least help you understand that the universe is much larger than what we see around us (even with the Hubble telescope) and much smaller than the protons and neutrons within the atoms we learned in high school. The M theory has many magnificent magnitudes of 'possibility'. <br /> <br /> It seemed so fitting that all this elegance should, by its very nature, move (by admission of the many bright scientists they present) out of the realm of science and into the realm of Philosophy. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be religious to feel that this movie has brought you one step closer to God. <br /> <br /> Bravo Brian Greene. Well done indeed. <br /> <br /> P.S. If you are interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the Universe and would like more information about the "possibilities" that quantum mechanics can bring mixed with spirituality (of all things), I recommend that you also see " What the hell ?! - Down the rabbit hole. " Yes, I know they make some silly mistakes by suggesting that a Shaman can not see a boat if he has not seen it before (my eyes process the reflections of light very well, I see things every day that I have never seen before) and the cells Brain cells are cells in the body that do not actually divide. But if you can overcome these small obstacles and leave the things you do not like and cling to the ones you do, there are many things that I like about this movie. <br /> <br /> Then watch "The Secret" (2006 documentary on The Law of Attraction - search for the IMDb title "tt0846789"). This information could change your life deeply, forever. If you search more thoroughly, you may even find that the Universe is speaking to us with thought (if you listen to it), and some are, and that is really incredible. There is a modern day Jesus / Mohammad / Buddha (those, among others, that history suggests they have communicated with the nonphysical) alive today and she lives in Texas. I know some of you know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> I do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition, but I have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the Universe as I am now.
