Two years after '¡Avión!' took off, Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker chose one of their stars, Leslie Nielsen, in this hilarious television series, a glorious takeoff of old US detective programs like 'Dragnet'. Nielsen played Frank Drebin, the US response to 'Inspector Clouseau'. He had the same style of humor as 'Airplane!'; Smart visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities and recurring characters like Johnny, the boy who shined shoes and seems to know everything about everything. The guest stars (including William Shatner!) Were murdered in the opening credits. 'Police Squad' was the first American comedy from 'Batman' that lacks a hint of laughter. Many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were made, but I think it was correct. The concept could never have sustained a full 24-episode race. Five years later, 'Police Squad' made a successful transfer to the big screen, when the first 'Naked Gun' trilogy was released. Jim, Jerry, David and Leslie had the last laugh.
