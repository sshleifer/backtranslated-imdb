Finally, a gangster movie that is worth seeing! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily must be nominated for her role as a mortal and murderous woman! <br /> <br /> This movie flies like a bird, just a fast pace without stopping Gangster Mayhem! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily is so beautiful and bad in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to discover that Faye Dunaway is still alive! The cast of this movie is so adjusted to their roles. <br /> <br /> A really great soundtrack accompanies you and drags you to the Spanish soul of this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is original and poetic. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of substance and never rests. <br /> <br /> The Spanish Fire gang has just turned everything on the screen. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa is a joy to watch and a Star movie. <br /> <br /> Sit back and enjoy the trip.
