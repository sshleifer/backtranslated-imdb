Simply ingenious enough to be plausible and still a lot of fun, this is a pure part of the 1970s (even cops need a lot of haircuts!). Shot in London and its environs, the plot of the ex-American convict who tries to go in a straight line is sent as an electrician to a bank in Mayfair, and then receives the screws of the crime lord David Niven and is plotting the crime. The century is well managed. <br /> <br /> I liked its simplicity and even its innocence, it goes back to a time when Caper films in which only that, a caper, and violence was not part of the deal. . <br /> <br /> In general, you could do much worse than see this: it has enough twists and turns to give it some strength and a cast that obviously had fun doing it. <br /> <br /> Well done and observable.
