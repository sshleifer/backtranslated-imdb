I discovered that this is an entertaining account of the challenges an independent filmmaker might encounter (something I never thought of). The film managed to keep my interest all the time and I actually laughed out loud more than once! I'm not a filmmaker, so I do not know anything about technology, but even though it was well edited and flowed smoothly telling the story. As a disclaimer, I contributed to this effort after providing music for the soundtrack, but I was not involved in the creation of this film and I could not tell him anything about Repo Man, except that I remembered seeing it a long time ago when I'm not really a fan of science fiction). I enjoyed the comparisons of the movie made from punk rock records to punk rock music. My wife accompanied me to see the movie and she did not know anything about it and we had a great time.
