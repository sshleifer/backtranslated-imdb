I tell you that although it is funny how many boastful words are in this one, I am sure that the amount of swear words and swear words would probably count to around 200 because, according to the last time I heard, I heard the most words of swear an episode of South Park has 165 counts of the word s ** t, but apart from that, it is very funny because in it there are words of joy and also pedophiles that shoot in the head. Watch this for your own survival and look for a mention of cartmans The father and also the annoying voice of Chris Hanssseeeen and also Kyle have to save Cartman from the pedophiles (the capture of a predator show is also on the data line) and They track down a peado and when they got there, the peado "shot".
