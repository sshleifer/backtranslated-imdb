Let's face it, many of the bad movies are made all the time. For those people who work in the cinema, probably have invested much time and effort in many of these plots, less the wonders. Sometimes, and this is my opinion, the important thing for us is the fact of simply making the film. To tell a story, (no matter how simple and unrealistic). In addition, the collaborative process is a key feature that is unique to film and theater. To carry out a production of any caliber, the talents of a variable number of people are required, according to their scale, to give life to their history. The most intriguing part of American Movie, however, is not the movie that is being filmed. It is the filmmaker himself, as a character in his own life, who demands our attention. None of them serves as a model for the filmmakers we know and work with. But, I will argue, they are archetypes of small parts of us that try to be part of this cult activity of independent cinema. (Okay, a very small part of us) These are the people who live under the rocks of their own lives and who, by chance, get trapped by the romance of cinema. This brings me to my next argument. American Movie captures the raw spirit of independent filmmaking. Bad stories told about digital film (nowadays) with careless effects and horrible performances, because it is the best thing you can do with a budget of a couple of thousand dollars instead of a multi-million dollar study budget per day . That's the difference between low-level low LOW productions and studio productions. The independent filmmaker only wants to create a linear or even non-linear story to film the best he can with the money he is investing in himself and the resources that surround him to see a finished product on his TV. Robust individualism materializes in every form of art. It seems to me that this film is a brilliant document of truth for many filmmakers. And no, I'm not full of myself. Man, these people are hilarious. Their problems seem hilarious, their characteristics are hilarious. The best line of the film: "It's fine! ... It's good! ... There's something to live for! ... Jesus told me!" He said a million times for a funny old man. The hat went to Tom Beach. Chicago Rules.
