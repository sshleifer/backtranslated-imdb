Andaz Apna Apna is, by far, my second favorite comedy of all time, being Namak Halal (although technically it was a drama). The story is nothing innovative, but the complications that are added make it incredible. Aamir Khan is a total caricature. Just watch their expressions in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He is incredibly good at comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the tenuous of the two characters. The sounds he makes are almost as funny as the faces of Aamir. Raveena and Karisma fulfill their purpose, but they are not surprising at all. The real choice of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless children of poor parents. They do not believe in hard work and just want to get rich in the easiest way. So both have the idea of ​​wooing the daughter of a rich man (Paresh Rawal) (Raveena Tandon) who comes to India to find a husband. So Amar and Prem meet on the trip and join to scare away the hundreds of other men who are trying to marry this girl. When they are successful, they now have to get rid of each other. Somehow, both enter the house of Raveena, Love as an injured guy and Prem as his doctor. From now on they try to expel each other. But things get complicated when Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls in love with Prem and pursues him. And the evil twin brother of the rich man (Rawal also) tries to get rid of the heiress and his father so that he inherits the money and sends his two most confident but clumsy fools to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you do not want to miss. Look at it! Will be worth. I even have the DVD, it's so good. And if you like this movie, I would also recommend Gol Maal if you have not seen it yet. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).
