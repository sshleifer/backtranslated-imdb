An impressive look at the ocean and life in it. <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> The work of the camera was absolutely phenomenal. All shots are made perfectly. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see all the different animals that I would have never imagined. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough has the perfect voice of the narrator. Nobody could have done better. <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> There were one or two different times when there was a reference to the Earth had 1 million years (I hold a different belief). <br /> <br /> In general, a television series that anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.
