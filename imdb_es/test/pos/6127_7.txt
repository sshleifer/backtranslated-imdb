A very strange movie, disturbing but intriguing. I do not think he needed to see what a human being can do with his ass, and I doubt he'll ever want to see it again. That said, there's a lot to be had, just as Divine did in Jayne Mansfield's classic walk in "The Girl Can not Help You" and put pieces of meat between her legs in a grocery store. A great feeling is a lot like a Russ Meyer movie. In general, bad acting, with the notable exception of the divine.
