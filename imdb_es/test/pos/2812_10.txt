Gerald McRaney, (Dave Morgan), "War crimes", '01 TV series, was like a father to Tiffani Thiessen, (Jennifer Gallagher), "A kiss before lying", '03, who experiences a very bad situation in his life and caused Jennifer to retire with people and young men. Dave Morgan tries desperately to get her out of the house and manages to introduce Jennifer to Chris (Gallagher), who falls madly in love with her at their first meeting. In almost one or two appointments later, Chris asks Jennifer if she will marry him and she agrees. It is not long after the wedding that things start to happen, Chris is in the Navy and does not like to work in submarines and things start to happen to the girls in the neighborhood. This is an excellent movie for television and sometimes it makes you wonder if the boy or girl I want as Soul Mate is the perfect PERSON!
