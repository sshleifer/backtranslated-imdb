Yes, it's not a great cinematographic achievement, but Toy Soldiers is a fun and entertaining movie. The young cast does a great job with the dramatic and comedic aspects of the story, and I particularly liked Shawn Phelan as Derek / "Yogurt". I've seen it many times over the years, and I'll probably see it many more. Just do not think too much and you will love it, enjoy it!
