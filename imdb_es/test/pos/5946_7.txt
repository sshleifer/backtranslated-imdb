A very funny simulation with great attention to detail: the appearance of the spy movies of the 1960s and the way in which the action was carried out at the time. The fight sequence in the hotel room was a hoot and the casting was perfect with a Peter Lorre lookalike added to the mix of villains. A great advantage: Jean Dujardin is sexy and the scene in which he is tied shirtless was a highlight. Also, his eyebrows deserve some kind of recognition for doing a great job. <br /> <br /> Aside from that: the people who were behind me at the movies kept panting after every turn of the plot as if they were watching a "real" spy thriller. <br /> <br /> Before the movie began, a "Get Smart" trailer was screened. The preview made the film seem embarrassingly wrong with attempts to incorporate the jokes and jokes of the television series. It looks like a bomb and a great contrast to the comparatively sublime jokes and banter of OSS 117, although, of course, OSS had its share of flaws. The overall tone of OSS, however, was not an insult to the intelligence of the audience, and the material did not feel as if it had been "stunned". I had the clear impression that if I had understood the language, I would have picked up more jokes, and one in particular (the gag of the gun) was mishandled in the interpretation of the subtitles.
