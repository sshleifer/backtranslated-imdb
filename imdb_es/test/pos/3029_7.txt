This film is definitely a case of style over substance, but the style is good and certainly more than unique in itself to make "The Cell" a memorable and above average movie. <br /> <br /> "The Cell" is beautifully looking with stunning outfits, costumes and makeup. Yes, it's really a sweet eye to see everything. The film has some perfectly "dreamy" sequences that are certainly strange but also very beautiful and imaginative. This film is a perfect blend of an artistic film and a typical Hollywood thriller, which can be accessed by the two fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty far fetched and it is not. It always makes sense. Because of that, the movie is not always nice and enjoyable to watch, but as I mentioned earlier, the style compensates for this. The style makes you keep watching until the end and provides the best moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as the serial killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really underused as an actor and this film shows his talent once again. I'm not particularly happy about Jennifer Lopez's casting. I know he can act in some of his films, but he really was not suitable to play the main character in this movie. His character was not strong enough and was eclipsed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Even so, I felt that Vince Vaughn was also a mistake in this movie. It did not fit well enough with the paper and no, I do not say it because I'm used to seeing it only in comedies these days. The rest of the cast is good and still gives the film a certain degree of credibility. <br /> <br /> Howard Shore's musical score was also surprisingly good and was something like "Se7en" as sometimes. It adjusted well to the movie and gave the scene some extra humor and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It is far from being a perfect film and the concept is very broad and not always handled in the right way. Still, "The Cell" is a movie that can be seen perfectly and maybe even a must, due to its style, originality and creativity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
