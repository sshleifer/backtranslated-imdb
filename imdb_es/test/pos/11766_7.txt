It is not your ordinary movie, but a good one. Billy Bob is very funny in this movie, the way he talks, what he says, etc. I was surprised when I saw it, because I thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more than that. He had a very good story, great characters and a good balance. <br /> <br /> Favorite part: Probably when Billy Bob is running with his robe shooting at the rippers
