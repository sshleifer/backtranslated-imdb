This movie is not as bad as some say it is in fact, I think it's more enjoyable than the original. Maybe that's why some people hate it so much because they do not want to admit it's a good movie (not excellent). <br /> <br /> Most, if not all, were made by CGI, which did not matter to me. In all because it was a nice movie. Phil Buckman - (Chris) was, in my opinion, the best guy in the movie. Julie Delpy was quite attractive. He brought sensuality to the movie. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of jokes in the movie that I thought were good. This movie is in my collection, but the original is not because I do not like it as much as it is. I did not get bored when I saw this movie, it kept watching me unlike some horror movies that I could mention as oh say = driller killer & suspiria (dario argento's movie), to name just two. <br /> <br /> This is a good werewolf movie that should be in people's collection if they like werewolf movies, maybe get the original at some point. I only have one complaint and that is Phil Buckman - (Chris) should have been more than him, but other than that, the movie was fine. <br /> <br /> rating for this movie 8/10 a werewolf well The movie is not the worst there is. <br /> <br />
