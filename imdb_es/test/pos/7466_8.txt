I had the honor tonight to see a screening of the movie "These Girls" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. Upon entering the film, I knew very little about it and I simply took a chance because the plot of the film seemed interesting. So when I entered the theater just a few hours ago, I wondered what the final verdict would be with the thumbs up or down. <br /> <br /> "These girls" is the story of the three best friends of a small town. Keira (Caroline Dhavernas) is the ringleader who basically does not know what to do with her life after high school, but her father pushes her to go to college, which is something she does not want to do. Lisa (Holly Lewis) will be going to a Christian school after the summer. And finally, Glory (Amanda Walsh) who plans to spend her summer taking care of children. But this summer is going to be special, since everyone blackmails Keith Clark (David Boreanaz), the older hunk sexy for the care of children. Funny times and lots of laughter ensue? <br /> <br /> I usually do not like movies like "These Girls" but there's something in this movie that I really liked. I think the quality that I liked the most was that it seemed quite realistic. Three girls who want to explore their sexuality choose a handsome man who allows them to have sex with him only to then be blackmailed by them. It's a pretty funny story about growth, friendship and sex, but even though it sounds pretty corny, I see that most of this movie happens in real life. <br /> <br /> The theme here is probably the main reason why this movie did not have a premiere in the United States. All the girls in this movie are supposed to be under 18, and if I remember correctly, two of them are 17 and one is 16. Now in the United States, although sexual relations between minors occur on a daily basis, many companies of production or financial will not finance a Film like this because of the sexual content. This information was really confirmed by the director John Hazlett himself in the question and answer session after the movie. What bothers me is that the sex scenes in this movie are not graphic and the nudity is less. Not to mention that all the actresses in this film are more than 18 years old in real life. Go figure. <br /> <br /> What the film does best is that it provides a lot of laughs and very strong characters. I liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a "Now and then" feature. The jokes were funny because they were written intelligently, not because they were dirty or exaggerated. Everything seemed to flow very well, both comedy and drama. The script was very strong. <br /> <br /> The performance was very good for the most part. I thought the three girls were great. Caroline Dhavernas, who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time, "Wonderfalls" was simply great; as well as Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh, who also did a good job. David Boreanaz did a good job and it looked like he was having fun while filming most of the scenes. The boy played a pot head, so it was funny to see him play that role. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of meeting John Hazlett tonight, who seemed to be a very nice guy and was very grateful for the comments made about the film. I'm surprised that this movie has not gone anywhere. I think with a little marketing behind, I could have taken off. Unfortunately, it will be one of these DVD movies that so few will have the pleasure of seeing. I think that with the small budget with which Mr. Hazlett had to work, the film turned out well and I think he did a good job directing this little gem. <br /> <br /> For someone who normally hates teen sexual comedies, I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this movie. The development of the character and the ingenious script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and have fun. This is a good comedy because it has heart and spirit. I know I'll make sure to buy this movie when it's released on DVD on May 16, 2006. If you're a fan of adulthood stories, teen sex comedies or romantic comedies, make sure you watch this movie because it's one of the funniest movies of its kind that will premiere in years. <br /> <br /> The final score of MovieManMenzel for "These Girls" is 8/10.
