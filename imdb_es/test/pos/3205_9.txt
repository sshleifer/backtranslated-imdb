I really like this show. It has drama, romance and comedy, all in one. I am 28 years old and I am a married mother, so I can identify with the experiences of Lorelei and Rory in the program. Lately I've been watching most of the replays on Family Channel, so I'm not aware of what's happening now. I think women would like this show more than men, but I know some men will enjoy it! I really like it, that lasts an hour and does not mean, since the time seems to fly by when I'm watching it! Give it a chance if you've never seen the show! However, I think that Lorelei and Luke are my favorite characters in the show, mainly because of the way they are together. How is it possible that you have not seen anything (or take so long to see it, I suppose I should say)? <br /> <br /> Happy viewing!
