"It's funny that your worst nightmare always seems so far away!" <br /> <br /> Dark Habour characters, a married couple (Alan Rickman and Polly Hunter) and a bum (Norman Reedus), are sliding into a game full of hidden sexual energy and betrayal. The tempting ruptures of now and then increase tensions and give a lot of space for interpretations. Good acting and a story that, if you do not use the brain, will leave you confused. You have to see it at least twice. The force itself lies in its unconventionality and in Alan Rickman, of course. Those who love him will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's not a typical prime time movie but it's well done!
