My introduction to a lifelong love of Shakespeare. My brother was 5 years old and I did not have 7 when I broadcast WTTW Chicago An Age of Kings. It became a family ritual to see, including repetitions. Like an autumn series, my father used to buy us a rare treat for the great west: the pomegranates; and my mother would make popcorn on the stove. Wonderful performance by actors whose names mean nothing to me at that moment (although I will never forget the young and sharp Sean Connery as Hotspur), but now! And they published the scripts in pocket edition so that we could follow and discover the language. I managed to memorize most of Richard III about that. What a pleasure to see it on DVD! Highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with Shakespeare or English history.
