This Norwegian movie begins with a man jumping on the subway, apparently committing suicide. But the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus to a desert. He meets a man and is sent to a mysterious city, where he starts working in a modern and aseptic office as an accountant. Co-workers look good, if you take care of yourself, you will soon find a girlfriend, however, the city seems completely strange, since the food has no flavor, alcohol does not get you drunk, and there are no children around. Is this a dream or is he in paradise or in hell? While at times, movies are seen as an extended episode of The Twilight Zone (even at ninety minutes, the movie seems a bit long), it's quite provocative. The best scenes are those in which exaggeration is minimal, such as when people engage in banal conversations about interior decoration and refuse to discuss deeper issues. I always thought that there was something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies, in the way they try to repress the basic impulses of human nature. And this movie is better when it critically criticizes this lifestyle. Unfortunately, the film ends a long time, and the director does not seem to know how to finish it, but most of the execution time is worth seeing.
