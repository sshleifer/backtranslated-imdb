Some movies simply fade away, but Tourist Trap has withstood the test of time and has justifiably become a cult favorite. Although it is not completely original, it is very much due to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it is sustained with a sense of humor, truly spooky moments, a brilliant score by Pino Donaggio and the fun performances of Chuck Connors and the cast. Do not let the PG rating keep you away, this movie proves that you do not need blood or free nudity in all horror movies to make it entertaining. These elements are usually used to cover the lack of emotion in a movie. Here, the scares are deserved and effective. Also, only Chuck Connors could bring a scene where he has to share soup with a mannequin. A classic scene by the way. Now, more accessible on widescreen DVD, this movie is a must for fans of the horror food of the 70s.
