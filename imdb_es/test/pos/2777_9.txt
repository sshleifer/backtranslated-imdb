Although it is not the most technically advanced film I have seen, this was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours. The main characters are sweet and you really like them, and you feel something when Susie Q. has to leave, but she feels good again when she returns as Maggie. <br /> <br /> Lots of dialogue of values, and an invented plot-line, but above all, a lot of fun.
