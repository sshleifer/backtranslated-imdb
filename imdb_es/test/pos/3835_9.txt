When the Romulans come, they will not carry gifts; No, they bring with them war, war and conquest. As everyone familiar with this episode knows, it's a cut from the war movie "The Enemy Below" of the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a warship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer and a German submarine) engaged in lethal war games, they are two starships in outer space. In the history of Trek, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought in the Romulan Wars. After approximately 5 years of conflict, a stalemate provoked a treaty and the institution of the Neutral Zone, a boundary between us and the Romulan Empire. Now, on this stellar date, the treaty seems to be broken, as our outposts are being attacked and destroyed by some weapon of immense power. Yes, the Romulans are back, trying out their new war toy, and Kirk must now earn his pay: he must make decisions that could affect this sector of the galaxy, like discovering how to avoid a ... oh, I do not know .. an interstellar war, maybe? <br /> <br /> I think what makes this episode so effective is that it does not get away from the somber aspects of the war, as you would expect from a simple television episode of the sixties, especially an episode of a science Fiction show. Everything is very tense and moving, like the best war movies, like when Kirk sits down with his key officers for what amounts to a council of war. The writers and the actors are not joking around here: all this is preparation for a frightful conflict, possibly the beginning of another year-long battlefield. In the final analysis, Kirk's objective is to keep this battlefield only for the two ships, but even then it is an effort plagued by dangers and possible casualties. In fact, I think this episode holds the record for boat casualties at the end. Right at the beginning of the episode, we see the devastation that this battle can produce, in that position supposedly well protected. Then, start the cat-and-mouse war games between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship, it's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen. Of course, if you do not like war movies, you should look for other things to admire in this episode. <br /> <br /> What raises this episode even more is the revelation of what and who The Romulans are ... it's a kind of electric shock. Now we have even more conflicts between the crew on the bridge of the Company: the war tends to bring out the worst in some people. Due to the still unpleasant attitudes about race in this future, the tension is further increased: Kirk has his hands busy in this. I suppose the only weakness of the story is the convenience of setting aside the question of fanaticism in the conclusion. On the Romulan side, actor Lenard makes his first appearance in the Trek universe as the Romulan commander; It's great on paper, the other side of Captain Kirk or Captain Pike, choose your option, similar to Spock more than a little. Surprisingly, his character is not hungry for war, as expected, another revelation for this episode. The actor would return to this universe as Sarek, Spock's father, so it is nothing if it is not versatile. It is also revealing how the first appearance of characters like the Romulans is usually their best shot, as it is here. They appeared in "The Enterprise Incident" below.
