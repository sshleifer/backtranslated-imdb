What can I say? The little boy inside has always had a great affection for the following ... giant robots, giant monsters and a megalomaniac lead villain who cackles, and this movie offers all aspects. As an adult, it's easy to point out the many flaws in this movie and say that it's really just a bunch of episodes taken from a children's television series. Despite all this, I find the ending very touching and the content surprisingly adult in its nature. Tremendous fun although a little pointless at times.
