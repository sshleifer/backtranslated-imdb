This was a big surprise to me. I had never heard of this movie when I first saw it, and the title really points to something more than a great terrorist / hostage situation in a high school. Toy Soldiers has the best of its time of the early 90's, where action movies were cheerful and very enjoyable. The action is good, the plot is interesting and very above, the bad guy is a one-dimensional hate asshole (which is great), Louis Gossett Jr. is in it, it's just a movie to feel good that I enjoyed a lot. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong with this one if you like the action. I give it a solid score of 8/10.
