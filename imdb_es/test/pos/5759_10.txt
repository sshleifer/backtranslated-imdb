I've been a fan of Rik Mayall and Ade Edmednson since I can remember the climate of their youth or below. And I just have to say that I have never laughed so much in my whole life !!! Guest house paradiso is bloody brilliant! I know it will not be a cup of tea for everyone (with vomit, comedy, violence and rude language), but do not look at it if it's not yours. It's not like no one knows what sick and twisted things happen to Rik and Ade when they're working together! I think it's unfair that this film has received such critical reviews because, and I do not think it's the only one that thinks this, this movie is 10 out of 10! :)
