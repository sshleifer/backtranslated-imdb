This is a wonderful movie ... it's funny, dark, moving, stimulating, innocently naughty and generally entertaining. I do not know I've seen anything like it before ... "The Rapture", or maybe one of "Todd Solondz's black comedies" or even the recent movie "Teeth" come to mind ... but those are all small gems and unpleasant "Franklins", despite the darkness around the edges, manages to have a completely sincere and pure heart. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to "Low Down Dirty Shame" by John Waters, only that this film differs in that. It actually HAS a story, and also something to say, beyond the youthful message of Waters. " Sex is not dirty (giggle, nudge-nudge) ". A conservative and repressed family undergoes a drastic change as a result of a car accident and suddenly it is not so conservative ... in fact, they are finally really happy, probably the only people in their city (or maybe the whole world)) Who. Talking about why this is the case would spoil the movie; In short, everyone should see it, although, of course, only people who are already selling what is the optimistic and hopeful philosophy of the film would always do so. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, only this side of realistic enough to prevent the procedures from becoming too heavy ... Teresa Willis offers an especially memorable and courageous performance as a tense mother who emerges as a butterfly when it is released. Both she and Robertson Dean deserve congratulations for their sincere and sincere performances (not to mention the frequent and extensive nudity and sex scenes); they turn what could have been a salacious joke that involves a "deviant sexual practice" into a moving, credible and endearing moment. Aviva as a daughter is an outstanding and someone to look at, perfectly capturing the attitude, anguish and speech patterns of a girl her age. Vince Pavia as the brother "himbo" with a secret is attractive and functional, although his story and how everyone reacts is more rewarding than his real performance. Mari Blackwell, as the best conflicted friend of Franklin's mother, is incredibly cold, confused and even compassionate in a role that could have topped the top. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film looks fantastic, all bright and broad colors. -planes open ... it seems that it could have been filmed in high definition ... if so, the line has become very thin, it looks a lot like the movie. There is a lot of talk and much philosophical talk, which becomes a bit of a preacher (even more, I imagine it to a viewer who does not agree with the policy of the film), but this film says many things that have to be said. If only people would not be afraid to listen and think. The arguments that take place are intelligent and well thought out, above all refusing to demonize religious or non-religious parties. <br /> <br /> The ending is on the ambiguous side, I found a bit of disappointment in some way ... I think it would have worked better if the author (like Jay Floyd, since he produced, wrote and directed) given a more viable outcome, some kind of solution, but, again, there probably is not one when it comes to facing people with different beliefs among themselves. Anyway, it was a moving and memorable final image that left me speechless, a success. Meanwhile, I am very happy that Mr. Floyd has made this film and I hope to share it with as many people as possible. Check it out.
