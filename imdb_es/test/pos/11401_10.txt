The elegant and convincing version of Paul Thomas Anderson in the porn industry of the 70s follows Eddie Adams, also known as Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), during six years of sex, drugs and disco. His chance to meet porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) begins his career as one of the best adult actors of the time. Dirk's character is based on real-life porn actor John Holmes, who, like Dirk, was famous for being extremely "well-endowed". This is where Dirk finds initial success. <br /> <br /> The main themes in Boogie Nights are the obvious ones related to a film of this genre; Pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. Boogie Nights deals with the issue of pornography with some control. It is not overrated and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when they appear on the screen. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, cocaine is abused enormously, and the setting of the film, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of the drug at that time, which the film perfectly captures. However, Boogie Nights does not promote cocaine, as there are some scenes that involve addiction and overdose. For example, at Jack's party, they find a girl who has recently suffered a graphic overdose; Blood flows from his nose and begins an unconscious attack. The film, before these scenes, has been quite optimistic and funny, but from this point prefigures the darkness that will occur. <br /> <br /> The musical scenes are brilliantly executed, from disco scenes with a magnificent scene to a Dirk from the bottom out singing terribly in his new musical career. The soundtrack is also excellent, with melodies from The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and the unforgettable sound experience. The outstanding scene in the whole movie is reduced to music; Dirk, Redd Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) visit the house of drug dealer Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina) to earn money quickly selling fake drugs, but Sister Christian of Night Ranger, who plays in the fund It increases the intensity of the scene incredibly, which shows that music can bring much more depth to the scene. Boogie Nights is full of that kind of scenes, which makes the movie even more fantastic. <br /> <br /> The outstanding performance in Boogie Nights is Burt Reynolds as the enigmatic, but in a bad mood, film director. In the scene in which he attacks a young boy for heating up his films, it is a total shock to the audience, because before this point he has been quite calm and happy. Other notable performances are Julianne Moore, Heather Graham as the beautiful Rollergirl, John C. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg, who offers the performance of his career. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original movie, which uses Themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way. Anderson's approach has been to completely capture these characters at a time when nothing seemed to go wrong, or at least until the 80s. From that moment, things became very dark and all the characters' signs and recognizable situations of the first part of the film disappeared. However, this does not reduce the high level of attractive entertainment that this film offers. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights was not a blockbuster, earning only Â£ 2 million in theaters in the UK. But this is not a matter of the film or the director. Anderson recognizes quality, not popularity, which is evident in his other three films, Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a simple parable full of excellent and variable situations, because at the end of this film you will realize that Boogie Nights is a simple morality story, but it will remain in your mind days after watching. that. Boogie Nights is both striking, hilarious, devastating and outstanding both visually and aurally.
