Look, we've rated this 10 in entertainment value. It's a safe comedy, not an epic like The Lord of the Rings or Gone with the Wind. Even for comedy, particularly these days, it's a 10. <br /> <br /> It's not a long movie, it moves quickly and easily. Kelsey Grammar in his own home is this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel submarine, facing the US Nuclear Navy. UU In a war game, designed to see if terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defenses. (a little ironic this plot ... pre 911) Do not take this topic seriously because it is mainly laughs from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is the second in command (as "Frank Burns") and attracts a lot of laughs. Everyone else is perfect for their parts too. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern. <br /> <br /> It seems simple and simple, you have 90 minutes and you need to laugh or pick me up and you are not rude (there is some language and innuendo) and then lease it. Or we bought it (we did it) and we enjoyed it! I would like you to do a part 2!
