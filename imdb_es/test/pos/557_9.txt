The direction of Wayne Wang may be the ingredient that made this film so much more impressive to me than "Slums of Beverly Hills," which covers very similar terrain. The interaction between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is fascinating. Real chemistry there. This movie managed to get me into the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me into depressed frustration. The character of Susan Sarandon hits all the nerves that a narcissistic father is capable of playing in an insecure teenager. She manages to do this incredibly without seeming florid or sadistically intentional madness. And, Natalie Portman deflects every attack on her character's ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent and codependent child, unaffected by the presumed cynicism of Natasha Lyonne's character in "Slums of Beverly Hills." The character of Portman is a teenager with dignity under stress, an unusual creature in modern movies. The film reaches a very satisfactory resolution without trying too hard. I recommend this movie to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained.
