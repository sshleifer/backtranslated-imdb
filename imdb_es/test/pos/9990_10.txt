Oh my God, what a story! This movie is very good and it had to be God who made this happen! You did an incredible job. The acting was really good, sure you chose the right actors. This movie is so good that I'm really glad you did this because if you had not done it, I would never have known about this story because I'm not a big golf fan and I think it's a bit boring, so thank you. I really enjoyed it and that's why I gave the film a 10 \ 10. I liked Shia Labouf, it was also perfect for the role of Fransis Quimet. I hope that most of the things that you put there were also true. Oh, and some parts were fun and others, I was really happy.
