After 10 years, it can finally be said that our Belgian Action Star is back again. Personally, I found that this is even better than Wake Of Death, which makes it his best movie in ... 10 years !! Well, it's not like his most outstanding years as Timecop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or even his best effort to date: Hard Target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors John Woo). The Action is Well, the story is exciting, the dialogue is quite fun, this is better than expected. The bad guys are awesome as in Hard Target, and the fight scenes are "old school". Real fans know what to expect. I must say that I resigned, but Van Damme finally returned. More, please....
