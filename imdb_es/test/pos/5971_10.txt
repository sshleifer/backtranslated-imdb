If you have an opportunity, see this Russian (how should I call it: gems, masterpieces, hidden treasures?), War movies like this, or The sunrises here are quiet, or Proverka na dorogah ... And, just after that , to see again the American war films, or the international productions, those with the allies and the Germans, etc. Or, worse, watch the Italian war movies. Everything from the west will seem superficial, artificial, ridiculous, compared to Russian films. I am incredibly surprised by the quality of the aforementioned Russian war films that I can not find the words to praise their superiority over the Anglo-Saxon war movies.
