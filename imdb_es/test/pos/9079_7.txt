Someone I know said there was a movie called "flatliners" that was probably on my street. I was told about this movie after seeing the final destination 2 and see the additional function about the experience close to the deth. <br /> <br /> I bought the flatliners DVD at the modest price of 5 pounds. I came home and I saw it. And I could not help but smile and feel good wondering how this movie had not been before in my life. The film is about a group of medical students trying to see how they feel after a near-death experience. But then the sins return to reality and can harm them physically. <br /> <br /> Acting Kevin Bacon and Keifer Sutherland is great, as you would expect from the couple. And Joel Schmacheur made this a great movie like he did with lost children. <br /> <br /> This is an avant-garde and elegant thriller designed to please any movie fan.
