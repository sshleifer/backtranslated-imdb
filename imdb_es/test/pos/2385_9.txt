I am a Talent Manager. It's been 15 years. I have discovered a wonderful talent. They have been in Cinema, Commericals, Braodway and Television. In my opinion, Eddie Monroe was a wonderful cast. I love seeing the capacity of real people. Not just a name. The actors in this movie were very natural and credible. This movie entertained me a lot. I love a movie with a few twists. I also enjoy when the puzzle is solved at the end of the movie. I would still like to know what happened with the large sum of money (when you see the movie you will understand what I am saying). Do all gangsters look real? I would like to see this movie on the big screen. The images were filmed very well. The landscape of New York was that of New York that I know. Have a Happy 2006 and that this film reaches the awards.
