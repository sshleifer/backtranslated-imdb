I think Josh Duhamel is great! The rest of the show is fun to watch, but I think it's the handsome and sexy Josh Duhamel that makes the show "Las Vegas" really fun to watch. In the days of "Magnum" I loved Tom Selleck, I thought he was the sexiest man on the face of the earth! A hunk in a television program is an obligation for women to enjoy watching something, especially for innocuous entertainment purposes! I would have done anything to "Make an appointment with Tad Hamilton"! Josh Duhamel is amazing and I will always be happy with him! Josh is definitely a HUNK !! And I will see "Las Vegas" all the time, Josh Duhamel is a great reason why too!
