I must admit that this is one of the unpublished films of Cameron DÃ­az and I was also surprised that she had an important role, but she was not the protagonist. It moved me a lot because I can really identify the pain of the loss of a loved one since I have experienced it closely. <br /> <br /> Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were very good at their interpretation of The protagonist Phoebe and I must also give them to casting actors to find two actresses who look so much like I really thought they were sisters (in real life). This is one of those movies that Cameron did for the sake of acting and not for the billing of the stars. He looked at the part of the beautiful and rebellious hippie who wants to change the world, although sometimes he comes out as a rebel without cause. <Br /> <br /> Coming from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength is her older sister Faith, little Phoebe is understandably very upset when the faith goes to Europe. As she grows up, she goes in search of her sister and gradually becomes disillusioned with the truth about her sister and falls in love with her sister's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Great history and equally excellent location shooting in Europe. I will watch again
