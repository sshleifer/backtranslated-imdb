I can not believe how many excellent actors can be in a program. It's realism and good acting that makes it look real. This has to be the best comedy that has been created to this day and I love Seinfeld and Everyone Loves Ramond. It's just fabulous and it seems everyone in my family agrees. That is not an isolated opinion of mine. The whole world seems to talk about different incidents and try to recreate them. I take my hat off to the crew. Some shows have an actor who does the whole show. This comedy plot has a lot of (8) of them. That is what makes it so incredible. Some people pray for health, wealth or fame. I pray that the show never ends. Sicerely John. LKHUBBLE2@talkamerica.net
