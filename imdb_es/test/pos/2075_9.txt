If you want to see Shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this version of the BBC. In fact, it is too long at four and a half hours, but the performance of Jacoby as Hamlet and that of Patrick Stewart as Claudio is worth it. <br /> <br /> It never ceases to amaze me how clear "Hamlet" is when you see it in its length and order set by the Bard. Each film version of "Hamlet" has changed its structure. Olivier concentrated on Hamlet's indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacoby is able to bring all these aspects of Hamlet's character together with the help of the complete Shakespeare script. <br /> <br /> Why does not Hamlet kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says: "I am very proud, vengeful, ambitious ..." Hamlet is extremely annoyed, not only for the death of his father (and the alleged murder), or the marriage of his mother with his uncle, but also, and about all, because Claudius has usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet. He is furious with his mother for having married Claudius (there are no known marriages between royal relatives, it is done for political reasons), but their marriage solidified Claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself. He is, therefore, powerless to do anything about it. And this is true even after he hears the cry of vengeance from his father's ghost. He can not simply kill the King or lose the throne by doing so. He must "reveal" the king's secret and here is the tragedy! At the moment Hamlet succeeds in showing Claudius' guilt in public, he has the opportunity to kill him and he does not. WHY? He wants EVERYTHING! He wants revenge, the throne And the damnation of Claudius's soul in hell. Hamlet is surpassed in classic tragic form. Your own HUBRIS is your downfall. He kills Polonius thinking it's Claudius and the rest of the play goes back to the final deaths of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet himself.
