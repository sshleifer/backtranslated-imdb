I agree with another critic, this is a film so devastating, that it will be difficult to see it again soon, although only for its quality, it deserves to be seen repeatedly. The complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematography and the magnificent direction make this film worth the emotional price of seeing it. <br /> <br /> There is a scene, of the two partisans who crawl through the snow to escape a patrol, which is Maybe, by pure physicality, the most incredible performance I've seen. In fact, although it is not episodic, history flows, this is a film of memorable scenes. They are passing rations among the partisans, the snow scenes, the scene of the farm in ruins, the meetings in the houses, the interrogation, the scene of the "basement", the "ascent". They all stand out like jewels on a necklace. <br /> <br /> For me, religiosity is not manifest. Frankly, I do not think I would have been allowed in a Soviet movie. I see this as an existential parable about the value of life. Here is a story where the hero, and he is a true hero, becomes the villain, and the weakest becomes the strongest. Is this a mystical process or dictated by circumstances? There is a transfiguration, but does it come from within or from outside? You must watch the movie to understand the problems, since they can not be discussed without revealing too much of the story. I can not say enough about the performance. It is difficult for me to choose which of the potential clients affects the most. I am not familiar with the Soviet film of the 70s and I am not familiar with any of the actors, but they are all excellent. I also point out how the director Larisa Shepitko uses the children. They remind me of the children angels of Giotto. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of confusion at the end. Apparently there is a previous relationship between the soldier Sotnikov and the interrogator Portnov, but this is hanging. And the final scene is a bit ambiguous. But compared to the total experience, these are issues. This is a movie that will mark you for life.
