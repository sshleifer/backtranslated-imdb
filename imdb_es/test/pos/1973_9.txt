I loved this movie, but again I'm a big fan of Cronenberg. If you have not seen a David Cronenberg movie, this is not a good place to start. The scanners, The Fly, Rabid would be a place to start and then work up to Videodrome before checking this. This is undoubtedly one of the best and takes the phenomena of the interactive game one step further. <br /> <br /> In this game, players connect a biological engineering game keyboard through a connector inserted in their spinal cord and enter the game. directly through your nervous system. It is very difficult to tell you more without revealing the story and plot, but suffice it to say that this is a game you will not forget. It's full of Cronenberg's slender body works, the dark omen scenario, all populated by a great cast that includes Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law and Willem Dafoe, who take the situation they're very serious about. These people will do what they can to discover the game and then win. Like other films of his, there is no shortage of imagination or parts where you sink into the seat, but as a self-accident you do not look away. If you liked any of the films mentioned above, then by all means go and get this one.
