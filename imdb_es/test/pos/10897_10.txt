GoldenEye is a masterpiece. The story is amazingly represented, the characters are beautifully animated and the weapons are incredible. The story is very interesting, even when you complete each mission, to get more levels you have to overcome them in a higher difficulty. And the multiplayer mode is so tyte. You choose the weapons you want to play with, then you play. Me and all three of my friends, along with my brother, we always play Goldeneye. If you do not have this game, I suggest you buy it.
