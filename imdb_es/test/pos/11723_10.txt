While it was great at Boogie Nights, I think this was the best performance of Burt Reynolds. He is also a great director and has made a hard and violent movie that does not stop (the death of a 12th caliber prostitute) and is an excellent detective story with some great actors (Brian Keith, Bernie Casey, etc.) and an outstanding jazz soundtrack. 10 out of 10
