Those reviewers who have complained that this film lacks plausibility or that it has construction problems, are missing the point. This is a wonderful camping romance, with a lot of play, gypsies! Dance, gypsies! The music, which sends exotic love stories and celebrates them. Buttoned Ray Milland makes a funny weave for a Dietrich with black hair, worn scarves and tons of jewelry. The character's enthusiasm for feeding and caring for Milland is more like the good German hausfrau. Dietrich was off the set than his modest vampire roles. When censorship is in effect, it is clear that they share a caravan only in Platonic terms, with Milland fighting against Dietrich's advances with a remarkable determination for a heterosexual bachelor who could be killed at any time. Her only excuse is that she smells, so maybe an annoying and annoying English can be discouraged. <br /> <br /> In the small role of Milland's young partner on his secret mission, Bruce Lester adds a note from the camp of a different type. At first we are told that he, the hero, adores Milland and, from fact, rather it deceives him. When, after they separate, he meets Milland, now transformed into a brown-skinned gypsy with a shirt open to the waist, his brilliant appreciation of the disguise suggests that not only Dietrich is romantically in love with Milland. <br /> <br /> Despite the wonderfully unlikely characters and the sequence of events, Milland's growing love for Dietrich and his acceptance of the nonrational aspects of life is quite moving. And when, only on his last night before he escapes, he says that each of them now contains half of the other, the two have become one, and then the darkness falls, I think we can assume that the censor decided Give them a break. ! One mistake: At first, Milland, who is supposed to be English, refers to a lieutenant who uses American pronunciation. (The English say "leftenant"). Since Milland was British, he should have said it that way because American filmmakers feared that the British style would distract and confuse the American public.
