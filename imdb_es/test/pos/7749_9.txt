This show is great. "Haruhai Suzumiya" is not only a very well written anime program, but it also reflects things like Philosophy, Science Fiction and a bit of religion. It is funny in some points and "cute" (for lack of a better term) in others. Actually, this may affect my lack of experience with Japanese anime shows, but it is one of the best of its kind I've seen. <br /> <br /> Mainly I have to give credit to the writers. I have not seen so bright areas of imagination in a television show since the original Star Trek. I hope that the writers continue adding new strange characters and provide more information about the already great characters that have been added. <br /> <br /> 9/10
