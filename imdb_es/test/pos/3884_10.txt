Jeff Garlin's movie is full of heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, your screen character is hilarious; but, in addition, we can see the warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film tells the dreams of love, success and weight loss of your character, it will attract anyone who dreams of a better life. The cast of support brings the frustrations and joys of your life to the screen in fun and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship and intent once again that life has disappointed us are themes. The use of music is creative and adds to the many pleasures of this film. Any fan of Jeff Garlin's television appearances should see it!
