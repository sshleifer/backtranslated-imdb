At first, the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a joke, just for the fun of Stan Lee. I expected nothing more than an animated and poor-quality version of Barb Wire with low production values, much like the little pieces of junk you see in Adult Swim for short-term entertainment, but you can never take them seriously. I was wrong! <br /> <br /> Stripperella has even better production values ​​than similar Marvel Toons. The animation is very good and it seems that they took this series very seriously and gave it a great effort to make it a professional production as possible. <br /> <br /> The humor is also good, in the sexy, suggestive and sordid side. It's very similar if not exactly like the Simpsons style. You can find clichés and a lot of predictable humor, but it's still fun. If this were working today, I would probably see it regularly. It is surprisingly one of the best drawings ever made.
