What can I say about this movie that will not give you any preconceived ideas when you see it? Very little. The plot has to do with the return of a teenager's hospital after it broke up. What follows after that is the movie. It is one of the most spooky movies of recent years. Everything about the movie is slightly off-center and makes you feel bad after the movie is over. It is not a perfect movie. The film has problems in its final half hour, which makes a story already confusing, even more confusing. (If you have read some other comments here on IMDb and elsewhere, you will know that you have spent a lot of time trying to unlock what is really happening) I'm not sure what I really think about this movie beyond the fact that it scared me and it bothered me in the way that the best-known horror films have had. If you like horror, and do not mind not having everything clearly outlined, I suggest you try it, as it is very likely to make your skin go bad.
