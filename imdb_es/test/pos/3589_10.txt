This is without a doubt the most amazing and amazing documentary I've ever seen! The images shown are absolutely stunning and amazing. On top of that, it's a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this catches you and does not let you loose until the end. You will be so hooked and fascinated by what you are seeing that you will forget you are at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I highly recommend picking it up! With all the evil and death in this world, this documentary series gives us proof that life is beautiful and worth saving and preserving.
