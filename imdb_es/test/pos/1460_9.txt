There are only a few movies that can be called 'must see' and SHEPHERED is one of those movies. In many ways, it was ahead of its time (and it can be said that it was a source of inspiration for several well-known films). Copied by many, matched by none, this is truly a great movie. <br /> <br /> The story is complex but develops itself as a tense but often amusing thriller and a highly stimulating exploration of the nature of humanity. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns. C. Thomas Howell is a "pastor" who protects the population from various religious leaders by killing unfit members of society. The whole idea made me think about our society. It's really a brilliant social commentary, which is more than I can say of certain recent blockbuster action / science fiction hits. MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS did not make us feel that a real innovation was actually taking place, only the effects of boring video games. But SHEPHERD also qualifies on the action scale ... <br /> <br /> Not once does this movie allow the viewer to catch their breath. Peter Hayman proves to be one of the few directors of genius action. We are talking about 100%, high grade, fighting with kung fu at home! It was excellent. Really good special effects, shooting, noir-futuristic cyber-punk noir style? The movie really has its own elements. <br /> <br /> When you talk about SHEPHERD, it's impossible not to mention the style you have. The vision of this city is really impressive. Remember images of Tim Burton's memorable Gotham vision in BATMAN. And these places are photographed by Graeme Mears with a degree of skill that embarrasses Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall. Even the special effects proved to be amazing. Undoubtedly, the scenes in which combats take place are points of reference throughout the cinema. This movie is an impressive visual exhibition ballet. <br /> <br /> Even so, at the base of all this, there is an interesting story, carried out by a strong cast. The performance (especially Rowdy Piper) and the plot are excellent, and are excellently directed. In contrast to a lot of futuristic movies made with a strong artificial taste, the characters are believable and the dialogue is natural and full of wit. I'm always proud to see a great movie like SHEPHERD. It's a shame that he has not received a good distribution and has not done anything at the box office. It is a rarity that is worth looking for. This movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times more great for having seen it!
