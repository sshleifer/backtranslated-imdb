I loved this movie, what a flash. Rupert and Julie are great together, since Rupert faces almost poker versus Julie's animation, which worked well. Laura did a good job as a dominant mother. Of course, Julie is wonderful as always. While this film will keep you laughing most of the time, it also has a soulful side, as it unravels the secrets of the main characters' lives. It is interesting that it has been titled Driving Lessons, as this could lead you to believe that this is the main feature of the film, that it is not directly as if it could be seen as "Ben", finally, in the driver's seat in his own life. Like most things that are fun in life, there is always a sad side and there are some poignant moments in this movie. Very nice movie and worth seeing.
