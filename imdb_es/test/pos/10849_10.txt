When I rented this movie, I almost expected it to be a low budget movie, with one less Indy plot, but I thought I would try. I started to see Part 1 and I could not get away until it ended 3 hours later. It was, by far, one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. From the writing to the direction of the performances, I laughed, cried and sang through the passage rite of Nan Astley from innocence to adulthood. Rachael Stirling is great in this movie. I had never heard of it before, but now I will always remember the vulnerability and the strength I felt in its performance. She, Keeley Hawes and Jodhi May are incredible, as they guide you through the emotional turbulence that most feel when dealing with an alternative form of sexuality. The fact that the film is set in the 1890s not only educates the audience about homosexuality in that period, but makes a statement about our current society. You must see this movie and, probably like me, you will make a trip to the store to add it to your collection.
