Moviegoers often say that great movies should have 3 memorable scenes <br /> <br /> to be considered really cool. Transmission news does not have <br /> <br /> three, they have twice that. This movie is very well written by <br /> <br /> James Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been better <br /> <br />. I love this movie for many reasons. It's great because <br /> <br /> makes you laugh and makes you cry. Albert Brooks has several great lines <br /> <br /> and many unforgettable scenes: # 1 (laughed) "I can <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> sing and I'm singing while I read" with Midnight Train a <br /> <br /> Georgia playing in the background. # 2 (he laughed). He told the character of William Hurt that "you really missed Nookie's cover", <br /> <br /> after seeing Hurt's report on the rape. # 3 (Cried) When Aaron <br /> <br /> (A. Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and that she <br /> <br /> can not end up with Hurt's character because he represents <br /> <br /> everything related to journalism that Jayne finds debatable. Finally, # 4 (laughed) who can forget the scene in which Aaron <br /> <br /> anchors the news of the weekend ... hilarious. This movie should have won an Oscar! It has everything I love in movies <br /> <br />, great acting, intelligent script and even a cameo by Jack Nicholson <br /> <br />!
