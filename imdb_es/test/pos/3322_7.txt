This hard-working girl is going to hell. Soap is a candidate for the time capsule, courtesy of its immaculate physical production, dress of the 50s (look at all those bows and pearls), the creamy theme song Johnny Mathis and the sexual attitudes so daring (for its time) . Rona Jaffe's novel, on which the film was based, continues to be published again, and a few years ago, Vanity Fair dedicated an article to this delightful film. Take a look at the new DVD transfer and you will know why. <br /> <br /> The three tracks, Hope Lange, Diane Baker and Suzy Parker, echo the girls of "How to Marry a Millionaire" or Carrie Bradshaw and her friends from "Sex in the City". "The Gentlewomen singers go out on a revelry ..." Their romantic adventures and sexual entanglements are things of the passion of paperback books: empty calories of candy corn, without nutrition, impossible to resist to eat sandwiches. Lange is genuinely poignant in her neo-Grace Kelly style, Baker is properly weak and idealistic as a shy virgin who runs out of breath for a (whistling) ch. It helps that the cad be played by Robert Evans, the mogul of the movie that made snoring and grunting and that has surely led many innocent lambs to slaughter in his Beverly Hills room. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker is fascinating in the first half of the movie, all cheerful security and wise comments. She highlights her things with the touch of the fashion icon she had in the 50s. Unfortunately, it is not up to where the film sends her: in madness and obsession. But she exudes glamor and faire salvation and her acting is at least adequate. One wonders why the critics hated her, practically expelled her from the movies a few years later. Perhaps a distant attitude on the part of a beautiful woman is too much to bear. Ali McGraw's career went down a generation later and, when you think about it, Ali McGraw and Suzy Parker were basically the same actress. <br /> <br /> The only major flaw in the movie is a weak ending. In the end, it almost collapses into a romantic swoon, instead of reaching a melodramatic ending, like Jerry Wald's other famous telenovela, "Peyton Place," in which Lana Turner cried and gritted her teeth during a rape. judgment. Here, Hope Lange roams the sidewalk of New York, with corpulent places, eternally hanging (but now, of course, sober) Stephen Boyd and just walk together ... towards the sunset, it is supposed. Otherwise, this is practically the definition of a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, there is also Joan Crawford, breathing all the young girls' fire and smoking cigarettes while she whispers to her married mistress in the place. phone. And the titles are made in intense pink, with letters in the shape of a ribbon reminiscent of the advertisements of the department stores of the late 50's. Do not miss it
