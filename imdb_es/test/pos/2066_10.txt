Definitely a movie for people who only ask to entertain themselves and who do not think too much about their films. <br /> <br /> A lot of action, a lot of excellent dialogue (for example, it's fun to quote), a bit of intrigue and things that explode everywhere. Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent, but not bloody. The fact that the female part was the competent action leader is a pleasant change. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie more than a dozen times and I still enjoy it enough to put it back into my rotation of favorite movies every 3 or 4 months. At first, I rented the movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the film, but I was involved in the events related to Samantha's search to recover her memory and I have never looked back. <br /> <br /> Suspend disbelief for once, take yourself a little less seriously, you may really have fun!
