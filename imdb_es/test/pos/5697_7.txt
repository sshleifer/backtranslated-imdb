<br /> <br /> As I am a teenager, I have about one hundred years of movies to catch up. I try to see a mix of classics, mainstream, art-house and other films. The decade of the 70s is one of the most important decades for films: it is when classic and common movies become antisocial messages and behaviors. It became something that nobody had seen before. What basically shows a decade under the influence is how important all The Graduate films about Star Wars are. <br /> <br /> Richard LaGravenese and the late Ted Demme are the main interviewers in this documentary, interviewing such people as Dennis Hopper, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Jon Voight, among others, on how those few years changed the cinema forever. It is a very professional and polished documentary, and it is even financed by the films of the IFC. However, as this is very professional, I think they could at least eliminate the noise of someone behind the camera laughing. For me, that took me a lot of how clean and orderly everything was. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is a very interesting documentary about the cinema of the people who do it. Of course, they are not criticizing their own movies or anything like that, but they are showing honesty in what they thought about the movies and what they wanted to say. I do not know much about the movie (but I want to get involved as an adult), so I feel that someone like me, this movie is a great asset. I've seen quite a few movies that they mentioned, like Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but a little more information about those films was very informative. <br /> <br /> The main reason, however, I did not. 't love Influence is, as cleverly as it was edited, it seemed to take your time at the beginning and be quite relaxed, therefore, you did not have enough time to get to everything you wanted to show. They piled into Star Wars and Jaws in the final minutes, when they were two of the most important. It seemed that they tried too hard to show a lot of clips, and that's fine, but some of them were not important, like an extensive one on the Net. <br /> <br /> In general, the Influence is very fascinating, informative documentary that it helped me, at least, to learn more about a second "golden age" in American cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rating R per language, and Images of sexuality, violence and drug use.
