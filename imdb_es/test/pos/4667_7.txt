Italian work requires hours of light and no experience is required. This is a great afternoon and good afternoon at the movies. The plot is good, but the real reproduction of the plot is very simple and does not require any thought process. They are car chases, explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating "the bad boy" played by Edward Norton. For Norton, it seems that he is happy to portray exactly the same characters as in his previous films, such as "The Score". Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts. Warning: if you have seen the trailer, then you have seen the movie. If you are looking for entertainment at affordable prices, then you need The Italian Job.
