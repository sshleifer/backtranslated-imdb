Boogie Nights is one of the best movies of the 90s and I would dare say that it should be in the top 250 of IMDb. I can understand why many will not like it, because of the subject. Personally, however, I feel like many do, judging by the acclaim received by the viewers and critics of this film, that it is a first level film. <br /> <br /> The direction and the acting in this film surpass the good ones and reach the level of brilliance. It is not a scene in this movie that is not surprising. The individual characters approach and touch you. Since this is a movie about the porn industry, one could not imagine that sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity, but they are. The address is among the best I've seen, and I've seen many movies. <br /> <br /> The film is not about the story of a particular individual, it is about many. It is a study of characters. about people who have many layers for them and that perhaps in an industry most would find strange, but who still dream of the same dreams and have bad and good for them. Boogie Nights takes you to its story from the beginning, and although the movie is long (I think almost 3 hours), you honestly do not even realize it. And when it's over, you do not want to ... <br /> <br /> it's not easy to impress, which means there are not many movies that you give a rating of 10 out of 10 but this is a Beyond Study of multiple characters, is the use of music in the film. Never, in all my years of watching movies, watching music tell a story, just like in this movie. There was such impeccability, you know it's not something you go to see every day. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynold's performance was perhaps the best thing I've ever seen, and Mark Wahlberg is amazing (I'm surprised there are still people who say he does not act well.) I do not know how anyone who sees this could think that), but the person who really surprised me was Heather Grahem (Rollergirl) who is absolutely fantastic in her role, particularly the only memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in the limousine, towards the end. <br /> <br /> Again, I repeat to other IMDb critics when saying that this movie is not for everyone. But I still think that this was first class. 10 out of 10
