With all the shots, the blood horror movies that have appeared at the last moment, "Saw, Hostal, Saw 2, The Hills have eyes" Yes, they have their place, do not get me wrong! I went to see "When a stranger calls" with my friend the other night! Why? Because it's a remake of the 1979 classic, which at that time was excellent and scared those who know everyone! I did not know what to expect. However I was pleasantly surprised! It was a movie made of humor, atmosphere, suspense! Because it reminds people, what you can not see, what you think you see, what you can not hear or what you think you hear, it is much more frightening than what you do. If you like movies with humor, chills, suspense and atmosphere. You'll love it! It brought him back to the roots of the original Halloween. Thumb up, a solid 8.5 out of 10 Remember, folks, it's well done! Is not perfect! It's creepy, not bloody, it's creepy, not bloody! It was nice to see a movie like this. Our minds have been conditioned and distorted by the brightness and value of today's horror movies, we forget what is really scary.
