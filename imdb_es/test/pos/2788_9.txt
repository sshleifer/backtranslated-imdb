As a former Erasmus student, I really enjoyed this movie. It was so realistic and fun. It really picked up the spirit that exists among Erasmus students. I hope that many other students also follow this experience. However, I wonder if this movie is so interesting to watch for people without international experience. But at least one of my friends who has never been to Erasmus also enjoyed it a lot. I give 9 of 10.
