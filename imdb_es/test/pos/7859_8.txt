This super spooky melodrama of southern gothism stars Clint Eastwood as a Confederate officer wounded in the Civil War who was admitted to a rural school for girls and regained health. There is a strange clash of genres, with the supposedly "dangerous" man falling prey to a group of seemingly harmless women, who prove to be as brutal as the men who fight each other on the battle fronts. This is a classic story about the spider and the fly, but here is a solitary fly and a lot of spiders. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page plays the headmistress of the school, and offers a characteristically sensational performance. Page was trained as a theater actress, and it shows in all her performances. No matter what role he played, he was always 100% committed and never left out. So it's here, with this lethal spinster, who takes her sexual repression on this defenseless man. Each of the other girls responds to him also in a particular way. The two most prominent are the dirty girl who can not wait to throw herself at him, and the virginal girl (played by who else, but the educated Elizabeth Hartman?) Who acts as if she fell in a faint if someone were like that. as much as he said the word "penis" to her. The schematic story of Madonna and the bitch would seem hard-line if the movie did not keep you so off-center and so unsure of what was going to happen next. <br /> <br /> The most memorable scene in history. The film for me happened when the group of women performed an amputation of Eastwood's leg, which has been infected with gangrene. Once again, the allusion of the spider and the fly is clear: they hobble it to make it more difficult for him to escape from his net. <br /> <br /> A classic cooler. It is not a great movie, but a morbidly entertaining one. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
