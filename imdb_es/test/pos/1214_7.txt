This was a very good PPV, but like Wrestlemania XX, some 14 years later, the WWE packed so many games, some of the games were useless. I will not go through all the games on the card because it would take forever to do so. <br /> <br /> However, the highlights include the HUGE pop for Demolition that won the belts of Haku's team and Andre the Giant. The first mixed-label bout with Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri against Dusty Rhodes and the late Sapphire and the first clash between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan. <br /> <br /> Some matches were a complete waste of time. Like The Bolsheviks vs. The Hart Foundation only lasted about 40 seconds, Koko B Ware vs. Rick Martel was short and Big Bossman vs. Akeem was too short. <br /> <br /> Mr Perfect vs. Brutus Beefcake and Ted DiBiase vs. Jake 'The Snake' Roberts was really good. <br /> <br /> General Grade - B
