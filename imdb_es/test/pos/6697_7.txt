A mix of Alien and Ghost Busters? <br /> <br /> It starts very promising, then it becomes almost boring. <br /> <br /> LifeForce contains some incredible special effects that you could make in the mid 80's. The story is intriguing, but in the end it becomes quite lacking in brightness. It was rated R due to nudity, sex and blood. The ethereal and wild (nude) beauty of Mathilda May is very evident throughout the entire film. A strange movie and it costs a lot for when it was made. <br /> <br /> This could have been a bigger classic with a better script, but unfortunately it was not a great success, I think it actually failed quite a lot. <br /> <br /> So, something went wrong with this, but even so, it's very entertaining.
