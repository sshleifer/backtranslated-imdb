What follows from this image will only grow as time goes by. Better than any of the nominees for the best film in 97 and rewards repeated visits. I've seen it three times now, so I know it. Anderson was compared to some of the great American directors (Altman, Scorcese, Tarantino) and may have these influences, but it is likely that, after a few more films, he is considered part of that short list. <br /> <br /> One last note: "Amber Waves" by Julianne Moore will resound in the memory long after other characters from the movie of the 90s have vanished. The best performance of the year -in any of the four categories.
