I was on vacation there when my host suggested that we attend this B movie festival in Breda. I resisted, since I had not been to the trip to sit in a cinema, but I must admit that I do not regret a second of this (especially with the contribution of Stephen Malkmus). It probably helped me that I had no idea what to expect. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST begins as a typical costume drama. We have a young medical student who is going to help a doctor whose city is being destroyed by a crazy plague (which in some way involves exploding heads). On the way, he stops to visit his boyfriend and his father throws him out of the property. Traveling, he finds a girl lying on the road, another victim of the plague, and takes her to the doctor. Yawn, I thought. Everything seemed quite predictable. <br /> <br /> And then everything went crazy and suddenly it became a completely different movie. Tom Savini looks like Dracula, the characters begin to travel to the "other side" of reality, and the dialogue becomes more and more fun. <br /> <br /> And just when I thought it had adapted to a rhythm, the image changes. Again, becoming really dark and bizarre. I will not spoil it for the viewers for the first time, but there is an amazing sequence about hollow people, many conversations about the abuse of religion by society and some bloody effects. And did I mention Stephen Malkmus? This is not a perfect movie (in case you have not noticed its appearance in a B-Movie festival), but it's worth the time for the adventurous spectators. Great images, a great soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. The acting is a little crazy sometimes, but I think that's the point. <br /> <br /> It was funny that I had to go to Breda to find an American photo that resembled a British horror movie. You imagine that one ...
