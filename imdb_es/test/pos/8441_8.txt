Large corporations vs. Consciousness Doing good. It seems that we are witnessing events (both real life and reels) of this type all the time and most of the time greed wins by using all the necessary (dirty) media and the truth is suppressed. At least in this film, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) made his points understand and paid dearly. We have seen several more such films in recent years, the most memorable of which was 'The Insider', where Russell Crowe played a scientist from the tobacco industry who tried to whistle saying that the industry had added more nicotine in cigarettes . make addicted smokers. There was also this reporter-protagonist angle in which the reporter is looking for the scoop of his dreams and the protagonist is faced with this moral dilemma in which he has to choose between righteousness and sustenance and, sometimes, his life. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda played reporter Kimberly Wells perfectly. She plays a reporter who wants to look for serious news while her bosses value her more as a "Sweet Eyes". She and her team (the cameraman played by post-'Coma 'Michael Douglas, who is also the producer of the film) witnessed an accident at a nuclear power plant while they were visiting. Cameraman Michael Douglas, furtively / illegally, takes pictures of that event on a tape, despite being an area without a photograph and takes it out of the station. The station refuses to transmit it and informs the corporation that owns the nuclear station. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Chief Engineer Jack Godell starts his own investigation and discovers many irregularities in the equipment that is being used for the reactor. This starts all the dirty politics of corruption and greed. <br /> <br /> This is a good thriller and it managed to create a lot of tension in the audience until the end and the funny thing was that there was no background score. To suggest all the moments of fear. Now that's great and unusual in movies. The performances were good and I love Jack Lemmon. We mainly know him for his comedic roles, but he is equally good at dramatic roles. I give this movie an 8/10.
