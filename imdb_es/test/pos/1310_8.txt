I had never heard of Mishima before watching this movie and, although some parts are a bit tedious, I am still attracted to see it when it is repeated in the box. At the beginning of the film, we are told of a famous Japanese writer who behaves like a madman and commits seppuku in public. As the film progresses, it gently introduces itself into the twisted logic of Mishima's mind. The stages of his life are presented in four chapters. Each chapter in itself is a mix of two contrasting narratives, the first continues the story with scenes from Mishima's life and appears in black and white. The second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel, which are represented as a play and are recorded in bright colors. There is a different novel staged in each chapter. Between each chapter, the narrative returns to the present, as Mishima advances towards his eventual ritual suicide. This means that drama and tension are maintained until the end. <br /> <br /> I suspect that many people will find this movie boring, pretentious and artistic. I respect it, this is not a movie for people who want action and a solid plot. If, on the other hand, you are the kind of person who enjoys the opportunity to penetrate the mind, a strange man while watching the story of his life told in a collage of beautiful images with music by Philip Glass, you will love it. I loved. <br /> <br />
