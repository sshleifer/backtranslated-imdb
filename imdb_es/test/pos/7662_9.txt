Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) is a peasant from the country who comes to the city in search of love. She met a man who told her about an astrologer who will show her the stars. This is a journey of souls ... Eliza is put to the test, can she realize her true love when she sees it or not? Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) is a construction worker who tries to find himself in his native heritage. They show different ways of seeing things. Meanwhile, Eliza is still looking for love and Tommy is trying to protect the reserve in which his grandmother lives. This is a twisted story of looking beyond the obvious and finding beauty in simple everyday things. The style is artistic and full of symbolism. The psychedelic style of the camera can scare the average viewer, but the deeper message and the interesting frames make it worthwhile to watch this movie. It is a film that explores the underworld of strange, unhappy and devastated individuals. This moves away from the road but it's worth seeing!
