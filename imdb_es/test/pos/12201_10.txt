Now I've seen the whole first season and I can say that I have not enjoyed a show of this norm in a long time, it's great to see a show like this in the pipeline and I hope there are many in the way that the season finale was the the best bar I can not wait for season 2 as far as I'm concerned, things can only improve, like the way Milles will continue to change, Rick will recover his family and how they will get off the roof of the church acting at this level , it is easy to see why the program is a great success among people, as long as people do programs like this, I will keep watching, I think it is difficult now to have an original idea, since many programs have covered a wide range of topics to see. One as original as this is refreshing.
