(Some Spoilers) It took Bruce Campbell 19 years to finally put his masterpiece "The Man with the Brain That Screams" on the screen. But Campbell had to alter his story because, due to financial problems, it took place in Sofia, Bulgaria, where he initially did not want to be filmed in Los Angeles, California. <br /> <br /> In the film, Burce Campbell plays the United States. The pharmacist tycoon Willian Cole, who travels along with his spoiled wife Jackie, Antoinette Byron, to the former Communist Republic of Bulgaria. It is there that William wants to help finance Bulgaria's almost non-existent public transport system. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate for William to get involved with the gypsy woman Tatoya, Tamara Gorski, and her ex-boyfriend Yegor, Valdimir Kolev. , a former taxi driver of the KGB. The two, William and Yegor, without knowing it, will end up destroying their brains, inside William's skull, due to Tatoya's jealousy and revenge. <br /> <br /> After Tatoya murders William and Yegor, their bodies are handed over to mad scientist Dr. Ivan Ivanowitch Ivanov, Stacy Keach, by his loyal assistant Pavel, Ted Raimi, to experiment with their brains. Dr. Ivanov has this theory that two heads are better than one. And now with the material, William & Yegor, available to him, Dr. Ivanov will finally prove it. What Dr. Ivanov will sadly discover is that by joining the two heads or brains, their brain waves will overlap and cause them not only to work badly, but to turn against each other. <br /> <br /> William with Yegor's right lobe fused with his damaged brain seeks Tatoya and makes him pay for the damage she caused to him and Yegor. Yegor, on the other hand, is stuck in William's head, and his likes and dislikes, both in food and drink, are totally opposite to his own. This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains that fight for control of William's body! <br /> <br /> Things get even more complicated when Jackie discovers that Tatoya murdered her husband William and confronted her in the dangerous and high-crime section of Bravoda called Gypsy Town and ends up being murdered herself. Returned to Dr. Ivanov by his assistant Pavel, he is determined, with no body available, to plant Jackie's brain inside an experimental robot in which Pavel has been working. The operation is a great success, but the only drawback is that Jackie, with her brain inside the robot, has to recharge her brain every few hours. Or, just like a real brain that lacks oxygen, it will die along with the robot's batteries. <br /> <br /> Combination of screw-shaped comedy from the 1930s and horror movie with William and Yegor going around the Bulgarian city of Bravoda Trying to find Tatoya and make him pay, with his life, the sad state of existence in which he put them both. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** It's Dr. Ivanov who, in fact, saves the day by discovering how to prevent the two brains from fighting, and thus cooperate with each other! This he does instead of fusing the brains. Dr. Ivanov keeps them independent by implanting a neutralizing cell wall between the two gray matter globes that do not cooperate.
