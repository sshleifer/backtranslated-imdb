"I have fought against death, it is the most exciting contest you can imagine, it takes place in an impalpable gray, with nothing underneath, without anything around, without spectators, without clamor, without glory, without the great desire for victory, without The great fear of defeat, in an atmosphere sick with lukewarm skepticism, without believing much in your own right and much less in that of your adversary.If that is the form of supreme wisdom, then life is a bigger enigma than some of us, think it is. " Marlow in "Heart of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad <br /> <br /> It is difficult to make the subject of death lyrical in any work of art. However, films have made bold attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is included as part of the cycle of all living beings, and can be chosen instead of legislating. "Elegido" is the operative word for Alejandro Amenabar's Sea Inside, based on the real story of the Galician navigator Ramon Sampedro. It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice, covered with love, poetry and friendship. If it sounds like Barbarian Invasions (2003), in which a cancerous professor says goodbye to his friends and lifelong loves before he takes his own life, then he's right. In fact, Sea is better because it spends more intimate time with the protagonist before leaving, a remarkable feat with none of those moments in the most boring or uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem as Ramon has expressive eyes and a dominant voice for the romantic tetraplegic, a combination of a realistic realist and a poetic sufiter. Belen Rueda plays the lawyer Julia, who becomes an imaginary lover of Ramon, increasing in brightness as his life degenerates with a disease. In addition to the now almost telenovela, Lola Duenas is Rosa, a blue-collar visitor who initially tries to dissuade Ramon from seeking death, but quickly falls in love with him. Talk about romantic disability? This guy has incredible luck to attract substantial women and can not move a finger. But he can talk, testing the last argument about what women want: the love that speaks, not only does it. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from mentioning the great movie now for an Oscar that presents euthanasia as its climax. so as not to spoil the experience for the first time. Suffice it to say that both films manage to open both sides of a controversial issue without forcing a specific point of view. Religious law has the right to complain that the previous film and the barbarian invasions celebrate suicide; he has no right to accuse the beautifully balanced sea within it. <br /> <br /> "A life in this condition has no dignity," says Ramon. The irony is that he drives with a supreme dignity that makes anyone question his determination to end his life. "The Sea Inside" is a formidable entry in the 2004 Oscar nominations for the best foreign language film.
