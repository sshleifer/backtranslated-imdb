I recently attended Sundance, as I have often done in previous years, and I enjoyed the small pleasures of the little nervous indies, the excess of dark comedies and the portrayals of now predictable dysfunction. But then I saw 'Northfork' by Mark and Michael Polish and I remembered why I fell in love with the movies in the first place. 'Northfork' goes through the screen with visionary audacity and goes back to the seminal work of Terence Malick and the existential landscapes of Antonioni. It is an impossible movie to explain easily, which is one of its many strengths. Suffice it to say that it is a fairytale for adults with many levels of meaning carefully layered. It rekindled my imagination and projected an imposing shadow over all the other films I saw this year. It is a meticulous craft work and a writing sophistication that is not seen in most American films. I plan to see this movie again several times when it comes to my neighborhood theater. Because it is a magical and mysterious piece, a disturbing work where one can roam the plains of Montana in search of the angels and the very nature of heaven and earth. The cast plays this luminescent piece with surprising conviction, especially James Woods and Nick Nolte, who remind us of the courage and audacity shown throughout their careers. Maybe 'Northfork' will help us find a new wave of American cinema where excellence in handicrafts and writing become more the norm than the exception. Look at it when it comes to you and take your friends so that the questions are many and the thoughts and feelings stimulated by watching 'Northfork' will awaken the memories of a great movie that was once seen in your past and that I now hope will return with the advent of the Polish Brothers.
