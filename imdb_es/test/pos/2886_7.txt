This is a great concert that presents the best songs of the band's 30-year career. Lee, Lifeson and Peart were animated and entertained on stage and presented a great show. Having said that, I believe that the audio recording was unsuccessful in the mixing console and / or through the microphone process. However, this is not the children's fault. They even mentioned that the show was set up at the last minute, so the band and their team obviously did what they could. They just should not have put on the show for public consumption. Neil's trap sounds distant and Geddy's bass has good harmonic content, but it has no end in the background !! They should have attended this concert and hoped for a better time. Just buy this DVD if you're a Rushian hardcore. The quality is missing in the audio department.
