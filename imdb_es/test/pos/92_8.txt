I suppose this movie would get excellent reviews in Canada, especially in Quebec. This is because Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and Canadians from Montreal were like gods in Canada for decades. As Americans, the closest we have of them are the New York Yankees. If you are a fan, then they are the biggest and most winning team in history. If you are not a fan, then they are Satan's team! Well, at least that's how I grew up in Washington, DC with respect to the Dallas Cowboys. So I'm pretty sure that when this movie appeared in the north, everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction: their national sport and the closest they have to a national team in the NHL. <br /> <br /> Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it starts and the main character talks about growing around Ottawa and encouraging the Canadians AND Maurice "the Rocket" Richard. However, when his mother accidentally bought him a T-shirt from the Toronto Maple Leafs and forced him to wear it, I immediately knew how horrible and embarrassing it would be for a child. This ability to connect with the character, although he lives in a distant land, is what made this a very special short film. The way the other children treated him and his conversation with God in the end make this a charming nostalgic movie. Very smart and memorable.
