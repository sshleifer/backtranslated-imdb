The way I found out about this movie was when I saw American Foot 2, at the beginning I had a trailer for Ali G indahouse, I watched the trailer and it forced me to buy the DVD, it seemed incredibly fun! So the next day, I went to my local store and picked it up for Â£ 3.99 (Bargain!). The film is about Ali G, who is a "gangster" of the great crew of the western bands, and his rivals are the great crew of the eastern blots. Ali has a group of children "Cub Scout" where he teaches them how to survive in the "ghetto" by teaching them how to swear and steal cars, after Ali discovers that the government is stopping the money that comes to the leisure center where Ali teaches. the children, he runs for the MP for the spots and overthrows another MP in his attempts to get rid of the leisure center to make room for an airport in Staines. Throughout the film there is laughter in abundance when Ali gets on some crazy things! Borat also makes an appearance for a few seconds in the film, this is a must-see for all Sacha Baron Cohen fans!
