Joe is the movie about the dark side of the force of the 1960s in the United States, and Susan Sarandon had nice tits. This movie scared me so much when I saw her in the theater, that I never liked Peter Boyle until the young Frankenstein and I was still quite distrustful of him even after that comedy. Looking back from today's experience, this film seems current again to be direct and to the point of half the approval of the electorate of John McCain's "Joe The Plumber" and his fear of electing a Black man as President of the United States in the coming weeks. . A black Prez would be seen as a sweet revenge of the "niggers" but forced to bring fire back to many minds, if not to the streets, this time by Joe's enthusiasts. Then, the spirit of Joe in the film resuscitated in the Joe The Plumber campaign! However, I love being American and being terrified by the fact that they illustrate what, ironically, Gregory Peck said our civilized law is also: "a living reality that breathes!" God help us.
