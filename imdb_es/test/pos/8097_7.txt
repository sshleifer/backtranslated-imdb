This must have been one of Chaplin's most ambitious projects; He casts virtually everything from visual sketches and blackout comedy sketches to social relevance, romance, even some violence. The mix is ​​challenging and intriguing, and the film has many fun and witty sequences (like Chaplin's and four other types who try to avoid finding a coin that orders self-sacrifice), but the ingredients do not always fit. , and the mix (and tone) seem a bit inharmonic. As for the famous final speech, although undoubtedly honest, today it also seems a little naive, with its allusions to "a better world where man will overcome his hatred and brutality, and his soul will fly". Great performances by Jack Oakie and the beautiful Paulette Goddard. (***)
