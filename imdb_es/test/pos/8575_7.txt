I wanted to love this movie. Everything seemed to be in place for a nice movie, if not innovative. It was set in the south of France, beautiful and recognizable actors led the cast, and I really admired the vibrant African costumes, proverbs and music. Despite all this, I did not love it. The movies are supposed to convey their meaning in the first visualization, but "Secret Laughter" does not do that. Nimi and Matthew, played by Long and Firth (both have played romantic tracks before and should have known better), radiate as much warmth and passion as dried fish. I used the 'dry fish' deliberately, because it was one of the few, very few, strong lines and moments dotted throughout the film. Another winner was when Nimi catches Matthew snooping in his apartment. Find a book of his with his first name written and say: "Your name is Nimi. I never knew." Then he insists that she call him by his first name. I watched this scene with attention as Matthew asked Nimi over and over again to "say my name", realizing that until then, they were always called by their last names. I thought that this was a turning point for the film, and I expected it to improve. He did not. Why does Nimi and Matthew always seem to be ten steps away, even in that "say my name" scene? What does Nimi's Matthew like, apart from its obvious beauty? And why does a sensible woman like Nimi fall in love with a comic book writer who considers her marriage something that can be put on hold when a beautiful exotic "adventure" presents itself? And I would like to add that it was a bit difficult for me to be behind a romance based on adultery. Yes, Jenny is a vicious harpy, but if she were in her shoes, but it would probably match her Cruella tactics to keep my husband from getting distracted. Believe it The story alludes to Nimi's painful past, but never fully explores it. Some critics say that Firth seemed a bit uncomfortable here, and I agree. For the sake of kindness, the actor convened a more palpable longing and passion as the snob of the early nineteenth century, Mr. Darcy (and while wearing those horrible pants)! As for Long, who shone in 'Love Jones', there were times when she seemed to focus more on her accent than on playing her character. Even so, there were many moments ?? The scene 'I gave my name' between them? when she was in total control and she was really well. However, 'Secret Laughter' does not stop having its redeeming qualities, and I discovered that it grew in me with more visits. Nene was well represented as supportive and well-intentioned, even if she does not fully understand Nimi's attraction for Matthew. I loved it when Nene confronted Mama Fola in those scenes of dueling proverbs. My husband liked it, and generally he is the first to sigh and throw insults on the screen if he does not like what is happening. He even laughed at the scene when Sammy asked Matthew some very frank questions about sex. So there you have it. "The secret laughter" was good enough to entertain a curmudgeon declared as my husband, but a film aficionado like me will need more than one visit to appreciate what the director and the writer were trying to convey.
