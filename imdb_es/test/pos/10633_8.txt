Erika Kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. At the beginning of the movie, we see her coming home late. When her older mother protests, Erika becomes enraged and attacks the older woman mercilessly. Erika, as it turns out, is a music teacher of some renown at the conservatory where she teaches. The next time we see her, she is the model of composure, but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young student because she feels he is wasting time and hers. The same happens with the insecure Anna, a talented girl that Erika hates, perhaps because she sees in the girl a promise that she is not willing to promote. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, we watch Erika enter an entertainment area and go to one of the cabins where pornographic material is displayed. Erika is paralyzed while observing the things that are being done on the screen. On another occasion, Erika arrives at a drive-in where there is a movie in progress. His attention is directed towards a parked car in which two lovers perform a sexual act. The camera persists to Erika while it is lost in the dream when seeing what the two lovers do, until it surprises the young person who is inside the car. Erika runs away horrified that they have discovered her. <br /> <br /> When a wealthy couple invites Erika to perform at a recital in her opulent home, she meets an anxious young man, Walter, who is related to the hosts. Walter is immediately taken with Erika's performance; The young man is a talented pianist. His enthusiasm for congratulating Erika is met with skepticism on his part. Walter decides to audition for Erika's master class, and is accepted. <br /> <br /> Thus begins the search for Erika's Walter, who is surprised when he realizes what the young man's motives really are. In turn, Erika begins to fantasize with Walter in a way that only her mind could, imagining what she would like him to do when, and if, they come together. Walter was discouraged by the letter that Erika wrote to him, detailing the sexual acts that are disgusting to the young man. <br /> <br /> The end of the film reminded us of the last sequence of Mr. Haneke's current "Cache". . They take us to a concert hall where Erika will perform. She is seen lurking in the lobby looking for the arrival of Walter, who enters the hall without realizing it. Erika's expression towards the camera reveals much more of her state of mind in the last minutes of the film. While fleeing the lobby area after inflicting a wound, the camera leaves and focuses on the facade of the building that seems to remain on the screen for a long time. <br /> <br /> "La Pianiste" is a personal matter. Triumph for Isabelle Huppert. This magnificent actress makes one of her best appearances on the screen, guided by the sure hand of Michael Haneke, one of the most interesting directors working today. Ms. Huppert works with economic gestures, however, she projects much of her soul while burning the screen with her Erika. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast works wonders under the guidance of the director. Annie Girardot, always excellent, is perfect as Erika's mother. She seems to be the key to everything that went wrong with her daughter. There is a hint of incest that is played with subtlety in the context of the film. Benoit Magimel is perfectly chosen as Walter. This young actor does a wonderful job in the film as a young man, so in love with a woman possessed by demons, that he will never be able to chase her away or make her love him in a normal way. <Br /> <br /> Michael Haneke's films are always disturbing to watch, but they offer many rewards because he dares to go where other men do not. The magnificent music heard in the film is mainly by Schubert and Schumann, two composers who are Erika's favorites. The film is greatly helped by the cinematography of Christian Berger.
