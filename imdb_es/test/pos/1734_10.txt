I love the new Who fans who call it, excellent. They have the right to that opinion, but the new series has not yet reached that point, it is coming. It is definitely good. <br /> <br /> First the good things. The special effects are obviously better almost 20 years after the last episode of Doctor Who "Battlefield" was aired. <br /> <br /> One thing that the BBC has always liked is Doctor Who (except when they tried to cancel in the 70's and 80's). However, the anticipation and pressure were excellent, but I think the new series has passed the test. It's good, it's still not excellent because it has its flaws. Some of the "Dalek" stories were very poor. I guess it was written in a couple of minutes by an idiot who never bothered to redo Dalek's character or never bothered to watch the previous series. <br /> <br /> "Aliens in London" was, by far, the best episode. So far, a new story about Aliens has begun that has lasted several episodes, including "Boomtown". <br /> <br /> Now, the other bad things, the partner, Rose, Billie Piper, are not great. Actually, it's quite annoying, but like Dr. Who, a teenage girl had to be finally chosen and she got the part. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is quite respectable, he has begun to capture his niche. He tried to play the character, and then the funny guy always lost the correct hit line, but he took it much more seriously and it shows. <br /> <br /> Continuity: there are some problems that did not resolve well, Paul Mcgann was still the doctor before this, but they did not reject it. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, although the series in general is pretty good, I have not missed an episode and it never gets boring, so I recommend any Doctor Who fan to see it and see the new Doctor series Quien.
