The work is intelligently constructed (begins with the doorman, Rainbow) and lets the audience see how the background unfolds through their eyes. The film follows the work with great fidelity, working, no doubt, on the simple premise that it can not be improved. Now add a lot of actors of excellent characters, and the result is a resounding triumph. A definite must visit.
