While I understood that this program is too weird to please everyone, I do not understand where all of these negative reviews come from, and I am more surprised by the negative reviews it received from movie fans. I liked it and I was hooked from the first episode I saw. Although it is a little messy, Kuzco was put in school. And it seems to be the high school instead of the university. But I guess he's only eighteen, is not it like he's too old to be educated? And has not royalty always got the best possible education for them? So "Kuzco has to graduate, or he will not become emperor," does not sound too strange to me. And I guess his education was neglected before, that's why now he has to be educated.
