This is a movie that will make your day happy, for sure. Kermit the Frog, is just a common frog in its swamp, when a talent agent comes up and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs to be in the movie (laughs). Along the way, Kermit encounters Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Gonzo and his chicken Camilla, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. But also behind Kermit is the owner of a chain of restaurants, Doc Hoppers French Fried Frog Legs. In spite of everything, Kermit and the Muppets arrive in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended for everyone, young and old. <br /> <br /> It has some wonderful musical numbers, like "The Rainbow Connection," I'm going back there someday "and" Movin 'Along Along. "The Muppets also use many forms of transportation in this film. a bicycle, Fozzie drives a Studebaker and another car, Gonzo flies with a pack of helium balloons (which is one of my favorite moments, by the way), and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets finally spend the rest of the way on the bus from Electric Mayhem (Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Janice, Scooter, and Animal), they met with them in the desert after Fozzie's car breaks down. <br /> <br /> Even some Sesame Street Muppets do appearances (for example, Big Bird is walking down the road, on the way to New York to enter public television.) The end is also a very comforting moment, each created by the Muppet is in the final scene, ng with a final repeat of "Arc connection iris. "<br /> <br /> But those poor Muppets worked very hard on their set of movies, then everything collapses and the camera explodes into a huge ball of sparks. You would think that everything is ruined and destroyed, but the rainbow appears shining through the ceiling at the end, and everything sums up the magic of this movie, and you know that everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10/10. Look at it and you will love the fun and sadness of this movie.
