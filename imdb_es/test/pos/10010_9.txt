The first time I saw this movie in IFC. Which is a great network by the way to watch underground movies. I saw this movie and I thought it was going to be a pure drama and a story that does not contain water. But it was really worth watching. The main character is in such a rude way, and you hate to see him deny help, but it does not matter what you can not hate. His devotion to the Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the impotence he feels. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the movie is also great. Sometimes, you feel that you can see what you see, feel what you feel in some situations. This movie does not leave you wanting to know more, or do not like a gap in the plot. There are no gaps (in my opinion). I've always been a fan of foreign films, especially now that movies are doing so badly in the United States. I really enjoy the foreign stages because I feel that it can take you on a trip and, sometimes, understand a different culture. This movie made me all those things and more. Please, watch this movie and if you are new to foreign films, this is a great start.
