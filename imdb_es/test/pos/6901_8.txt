When people argue about how they "do not do them the way they used to," then simply point them to this comical, entertaining, and picturesque-looking horror of writer and director Glenn McQuaid. <br /> <br /> It is a tale of graverobbers (played by Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden) that end up unearthing more than just silent and immobile corpses. After the initial impact of this, they soon realize that they can really change the situation in their favor. And that is just what they are trying to do. Of course, it seems that things may not have worked as planned, since poor Arthur (Monaghan) is actually telling his story to a priest (Ron Perlman) before being taken to the gallows. <br /> <br /> Regarding the details of his filmography, McQuaid seems to have taken the center of his first short film and expanded it into this feature-length effort, which is not bad. Fessenden returns and is doing well, Monaghan is one of those guys who can still like him while he deals with the nefarious business of stealing the dead and with other favorites of the genre like Perlman and Angus Scrimm in the scene of this film. Lots of fun for fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> It also benefits from a unique and favorable design and appearance, sometimes moving from EC Comic style panels to live action (to the Creepshow) and always somehow I feel quite Authentic in his feeling of hammer horror. Maybe everything is covered with a lot of dry ice, but that's not important. Everything that was done to capture everything in the movie, works. It works well. <br /> <br /> I may not have any real fear, but this film has a big streak of black humor and definitely soaks every minute of its execution time in macabre material that should please all those who have the patience to the horror that is a little calmer and feels as if it could have been done in the days of Hammer. <br /> <br /> Look at this if you like: The flesh and the demons, The doctor and the demons, A program of fright.
