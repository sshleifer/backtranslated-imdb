"One Crazy Summer" is the funniest and most crazy movie (not necessarily the best one), I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Just when a crazy scene is made, another one emerges. It never lets you rest. Only one thing after another. The soundtrack is great. The songs are the correct ones for the scenes. <br /> <br /> It's also a clean movie. Little of what is dirty. <br /> <br /> Of course, it has the story of the guys who would not trust their lunch money, take on a challenge and conquer the people with the most resources. Who would want to see it if they failed? There is a serious side, in which parents and children are not up to the dreams of others. One should always have an open mind, and weigh all the options. This applies to both parents and children. In "One Crazy Summer", the parents are wrong. This is not always the case.
