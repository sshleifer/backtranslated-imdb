Latter Days for me was a very moving film, which showed how difficult and disrespectful the gay community is. The film alienates true passion and really explores the feelings of these two characters, the film has a great compassion for the gay community, since it really speaks for the gay man / woman. Personally, I think it is time for the homosexual community of all religions no longer to be ashamed, just for being beautiful there. The movie was very revealing to me, since I could not believe how anti-gay this world really is. Even in schools, if a child does not like something, they will call it "gay". I really hope that more films like this one will be made, and that not only will they be labeled as a "Gay" movie, but as a love story, since I believe gay directors should defend themselves and tell their story through their eyes.
