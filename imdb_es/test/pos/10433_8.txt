Many sex comedy movies for teenagers come and go without much fanfare, however, from time to time a movie can appear that is honest, fun, entertaining AND memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special film that has found its place and has withstood the test of time by combining the four ingredients. This film follows three friends (Gary, Rick and David "The Big Apple") adventures in the world of sex for the first time and true love. On the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow the romantic and desperate Gary (the main character) in his quest to conquer the girl of his dreams, which takes him down an uncertain path with an unexpected turn at the end. If you have not yet had the chance to see this movie, take a look ... splash with many memorable songs from the 80s throughout the film so that things move at a uniform rate. L.A.V. It is truly an original film, a rarity among films of its genre.
