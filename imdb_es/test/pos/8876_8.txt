Just thinking about the movie, I laugh at myself. Anne Ramsey plays an unforgettable role as "Mom", probably the most unpleasant but hilarious matriarch ever captured in the movie. Danny Devito and Billy Crystal make a fabulous duo, bringing a real warmth to the movie. Although it is not extremely complex, the cute story attracts your attention and keeps you laughing all the way. It's a fun comedy to lighten things up, and even entertain the kids. I give my full recommendation.
