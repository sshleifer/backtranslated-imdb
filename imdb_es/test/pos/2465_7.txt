Emilio Estévez directed a good movie, who would think it? I sat down in two previous films directed by Estevez: "Wisdom" (with his girlfriend Demi Moore) and "Men at work" (with his brother Charlie Sheen). They are terrible movies, badly performed, directed, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor but lousy as a director. I turned this on with pure curiosity: it has a great cast and I had nothing else to do. Damn if he did not stop me. <br /> <br /> It's about Estévez returning home from Vietnam permanently marked by what happened there. His parents (Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen) and his sister (Kimberly Williams) try to contact him but can not. Something in Vietnam has affected him deeply ... and is about to explode ... <br /> <br /> A little more, but it's still very good. Much of the material is familiar, but the cast is so good that it makes it look new. Estevez is good, Sheen is great (and Estevez's real life father), Williams is moving and Bates is extraordinary: trying to keep the family together. Everything leads to a powerful ending that REALLY surprised me. <br /> <br /> It's worth catching. <br /> <br />
