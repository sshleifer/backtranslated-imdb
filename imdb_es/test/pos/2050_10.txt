This is the movie is actually one of my favorites of all time. I'm not a fan of Renny Harlin because most of his movies suck, but TLKG reaches its mark again and again. TLKG is about a woman named Samantha Cain (Davis) who suffers from amnesia. She is married and has a son and as she says: "I am a damn PTA member". and then their world crumbles as the pieces fit into place over their previous identity. Samuel Jackson plays a swindler cop who performs IP concerts, is dragged by her to solve his identity and collect some money for his work. Along the way we discover that Samantha is actually Charlie Baltimore, a secret spy who was abandoned years ago. The plot is great, making this story look real and Jackson does a great job as the second role of Davis (who always does a great acting job). The explosions are endless, the action intertwines with a memorable scene after a memorable scene. Pretty impressive visually, although the boy was nervous at the end (be careful with the cars!) I'm tired of young children ruining a movie to save, but even so, this movie is worth it because the child joins the movie . Once again, this movie is really good, I never understood why it was not made more at the box office, but if it were a man starring in the film, I'm sure it would have raised a hundred million. the good thing is that over the years, more people are discovering this movie and they are giving good grades, since the average of this film on this site has increased over the years. I hope it goes further as this is a great action movie. and I love action movies
