Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot, Rock Hudson, on a mission to Germany. <br /> <br /> The songs are beautiful. The two are well matched. Julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the girl she normally plays. <br /> <br /> A half-German, half-English girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in World War I, Julie sings some endearing Mancini songs. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie. Some will say it's a "movie for girls", but so what? It is wonderful. <br /> <br /> The secondary characters are a bit stereotyped. It may not be up to the interpretation of Rock in Pillow Talk, Magnificent Obsession or Giant. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards shot the film in Ireland and used authentic WW I aircraft in the film. The landscape for England and France is absolutely beautiful.
