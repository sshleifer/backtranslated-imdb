Centurions are one of the best cartoons in history and should be published on TV and DVD so that people can enjoy the younger generation in such a good show that it is much better than the trash they made in the last 14 years. I have an online petition found at the web address Http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html that originally tried to get this program five days a week, but is now trying to include this program in DVD from The television station he focused on has poor public relations. We must all convince the people who own this program to put it on DVD so that future generations can see it. In addition, as Hasbro Toys now owns the toy line of this program, we may want to convince them to make a live action movie as they have done with Transformers and sometime this year, G.I.Joe. We need good cartoons like this one to come back and be enjoyed by younger generations. Please sign this petition so that one day we can have DVDs of the famous types by shouting "End of energy!"
