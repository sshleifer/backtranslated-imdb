Yes, sometimes "unconditional love" overflows when it bounces, no, bouncing, from one element of the story to the other in more unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it was not until I saw the movie for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been trying to do with this quirky and unconventional movie. Perhaps the whole film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love that Grace (Kathy Bates) longs for and describes in the back of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is just that, without condition and without qualification. So I went back to seeing "Unconditional Love" with that in mind. I laughed much more than the first time, I became more involved with the characters, I began to understand that, sometimes, the absurd turns of history. The performances are often exaggerated, but no more than necessary to fit into the strange and extravagant vision of Hogan, a vision that moved me to tears, longing and laughter with laughter. Yes, Hogan is asking his audience a lot. But, for my part, I have come to truly love your film, unconditionally.
