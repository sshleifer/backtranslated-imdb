Hilarious movie, I had a great time watching her. The star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes credited as Steve Arkin) is a popular actor from Turkey. He has played in many tough roles, epic sword movies and romances. It was fun to watch him with an international cast and a pair of really lousy-looking gloves. If I remember that it was also dubbed in English, which made things even more fun. (A bit like seeing John Wayne speaking Turkish).
