Nicole Finn (Madonna) has just been released. Although ordered to go by bus to Philadelphia, she wants to stay where she was arrested. This is because she says she has information that would erase her registration. Louden (Griffin Dunne) is assigned to accompany her to the bus for her future father-in-law. Louden will be driving around the city anyway (in her future mother-in-law Rolls Royce), picking up the wedding ring and a rare big big cat for an eccentric collector. Nicki, however, begins the chaos that follows as soon as she jumps in the Rolls to take over driving. Among the big cats, taxi drivers, assassins, bridesmaids and a wedding cake with weapons, lawyer Louden knows he is no longer in Kansas. Is there any way out of madness? This movie is a wild journey down the avenue of comedy. Madonna and Dunnea are perfectly confused, which makes their connection noisy, as they play their roles as ex-convicts and as downcast and downcast lawyers, respectively. The script is praiseworthy in its ability to send the viewer to hysteria attacks, as an unlikely scene gives way to the next and the next. Everything secondary, from the supporting actors to the stage and the costumes, is also quite pleasant. If you know someone who needs a jolt of joy, rent this movie for them. You two will be cheerio soon.
