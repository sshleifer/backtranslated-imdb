This is a film about loneliness and how distance. Physical and emotional: between people tends to hinder relationships. <br /> <br /> The narrative is simple to the point of banality: a young Yusuf (Emin Toprak), from a rural village, comes to Istanbul to stay. his older and successful cousin Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir); Yusuf wants to work in the big city. After trying to find work without success for a few weeks, the tension of having Yusuf living with him is too much for Mahmut. They fight ?? Nothing physical, only verbal. Finally, Yusuf leaves, leaving Mahmut alone again. End of story ... <br /> <br /> Except for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best in the movie. Much is said visually; the dialogue is used to bring to light the disagreement, mistrust, hostility and insecurity that exist within and between the two men. <br /> <br /> There are many visual gems in this movie. For example, while looking for work, young Yusuf, who needs a relationship, tries in vain to attract the attention of several young women in the city. The look on his face, as he looks frustrated each time, says it all. <br /> <br /> Or, wanting a cigarette, Yusuf opens the balcony door of Mahmut's apartment and lights up in the cold December air. leaving the door open; Mahmut finally gets up from his desk, walks to the door (all glass) and the cousins ​​only look at each other for what seems like a long time. Then Mahmut closes the door, leaving Yusuf out in the cold. The metaphor is complete. <br /> <br /> Or, Mahmut cleaning up after Yusuf, reluctantly and with growing anger; And all the time, Yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking for work seriously, and spends Mahmut's money on a toy for a nephew? Yusuf is emotional, disorderly, impulsive and vulnerable. Mahmut is rational, logical, sure of himself and is a demanding fanatic of control: the dichotomy of the right brain and the left brain, very well interpreted by two actors who say more with a look, a gesture, an expression that any word can express. /> <br /> But, Mahmut is not completely without emotion: he still loves his ex-wife, who tells him that he went to Canada with his future husband. Mahmut affects a distant and safe friendship with her ex, and makes sure she is well to go. He wishes her well. He says goodbye. He leaves the cafeteria where they were talking. Later, when he calls to say goodbye one last time, on the way to the airport, Mahmut goes there and watches secretly as he leaves. The emotion of emotion on her face, while she disappears through a door, is worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> In short, this is an outstanding work of the two main actors and the director, Nuri. Ceylan. Some might argue that the pace is too slow; but life goes on slowly for much of the time, especially for those who are alone. The work of the camera is also relatively simple: choose the scene, set the camera and the lighting, and allow the actors to move through the scene, enter the scene and leave the scene, while holding the camera still. There were some panoramic shots, some high-angle tracking shots, some rural scenes. but much of the film is shown as on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide-angle lens. Except for radio and television music within the story, there is no music soundtrack. And, there are many long silences when the two men sit and watch television together and / or engage in a very limited conversation. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on TV, so it was fun to watch that, in a TV. On some occasions, I was watching TV as they were also watching TV. The silence in the film coincided with the silence in my house (I was awake, everyone else in bed); my chair and my position coincided with Mahmut's while watching television. Very strange, giving me the feeling of almost "being there" with him. And, in a certain sense, I suppose it was. <br /> <br /> I will not say more, because I want you to enjoy the other scenes that I have not described. It is not a movie for everyone, for sure. More than any movie I've seen, it shows how much we die when we're alone. Just as we are alone when we die. The face of Mahmut, while it fades to black in the final scene, will stay with me for a long, long time ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for film fans.
