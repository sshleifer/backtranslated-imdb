As a SCUBA diver, I can appreciate the incredible physical tension that the cameramen must have endured to get the shots underwater. However, this series is MUCH more than that. The narration is perfect, the scenes that surround the improbable and the exciting subject. The daily struggle for life that is taking place out of sight of the terrestrial inhabitants is amazing. This DVD set has opened my eyes to another planet here on Earth. I urge everyone to watch this series.
