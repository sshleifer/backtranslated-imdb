I love this movie (I do not know why it's called Pot Luck in England, what an absurd and completely irrelevant name!) I spent 8 months in Barcelona, ​​not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so I felt like same. It brings so many good memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries and from the city itself. I really want to see the next 'Les Poupees Russes' (the Russian Dolls), I guess it will not be released here. My brother saw it in France and said it was not so good, but it had the same cast (Wendy's brother apparently gets married). Does anyone know anything about this movie? What if it can be released?
