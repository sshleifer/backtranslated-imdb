I had heard about "games" and "Dungeons and Dragons" before, but I knew it could be like what I saw in "Gamers: Dorkness Rising." These guys are so funny and fun to watch. Especially the guy who plays the "bard" or the "minstrel" or whatever, has a gift for physical comedy and time. There is so much background humor and energy in some of the scenes that make you think that at least part of that was improvised on the set. The special effects had to be worked out a bit, but I saw it at a convention last year and that's one of the things they said they were going to redo and improve, so it's probably a perversity now!
