What do I not like? <br /> <br /> I captured this again tonight and marveled at the capture of the essence of Philip Larkin by Hugh Bonneville without resorting to tics and caricatures. <br /> <br /> There are many layers of the description of the complexity of the main character and Hugh gives them life. His prudent mother, his unresolved problems with his father and his inability to commit to a woman. <br /> <br /> His poetry is intertwined everywhere and some scenes are trapped in his story of them to the wife of a friend whom he then proposes, but almost casually, almost innocently. It is not hard to see where his attraction is for the many women who fell in love with him (and who knew each other to begin with, and continued to see him!) <br /> <br /> Cerebral, fun, jazz enthusiast , faithful friend. It is always more than looking, women moved beyond their baldness, deafness and lack of vision. And a beautifully nuanced performance by Eileen Atkins as her mother is an additional advantage. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
