While watching "Wirey Spindell" I could not help but laugh at what was happening on the screen. Wirey certainly had a lot of participation from both boys and girls, but he was confused as to why the actor who played Wirey in H.S. Was 10. Then the actor changed his age to 20 to play Wirey when he was a senior at HS ... but anyway, I thought it was funny.
