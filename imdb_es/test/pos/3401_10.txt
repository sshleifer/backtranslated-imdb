I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story. This is one of the best pieces of time about the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps from character to character so you can keep guessing what will happen next in their lives. There is a great balance between good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to see them. Every time something more despicable happens than the last, I curse the television as if they heard me. I love how this miniseries makes me feel involved in his drama. However, I would advise NOT to watch the third movie of the DVD series. It is a disappointment compared to the first two films and most of the original characters do not return. I do not want to remember how the third movie ended, I prefer to live with the thoughts of the end in the second movie. It makes me happy.
