I saw it last week and the sketch of the people of Korea was fun. Very ironic and appropriate to the political climate. Complete points for the writers and Spike for that. The part where he makes the translator pull out a rickshaw and throw words in Korean could have been extracted only by Spike. This is a brave attempt by Fox. This is a brilliant show and I hope it goes ahead. My wife and I have been doing it regularly, and even though it collides with a couple of other programs, we now see it on MySpace. I hope that Fox devotes all the resources to the program and does it daily. I can not wait to see Bobby Lee on his show. With people like Bernard Abedalla behind the show, this is on the right track. Also Mary Mae as his wife looks beautiful.
