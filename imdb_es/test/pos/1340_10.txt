This was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid. He had everything: music, stories, a talking squirrel and giggles. I wanted to be one of those hippy girls who sang and swung on a swing. I'm 35 years old and I grew up in South Jersey, but we have three New York channels with our cable, and I think it was on Channel 11. They do not do more shows like this anymore (I know, that makes it sound really old), and I'm surprised that I grew up with only 9 channels on our TV, but I can always find something great to watch. I have only spoken with another person who really listened and saw this program. She is three years younger than me, and grew up in North Jersey. I would love to see this series on DVD, so I could show it to my 5-year-old daughter, and she could see the silly (but great) things that her mother used to see! I just found a VHS tape of some episodes and a music CD of the program on eBay, and I bought them immediately, although they were a bit expensive. I can not wait for you to relive the great memories!
