Although copies of this movie are hard to find, if you can find them, get it! !!! I think this was, apart from In The Navy, the only musical by Abbott and Costello. Although they twisted the plot a bit (I've never heard a version in which the butcher goes with him), you still enjoy the antics of the evil but adorable Jack and the greedy butcher, Mr. Dinklepuss. With a bit of reminiscence of DuBarry Was a Lady, this noisy movie will make you roll on the floor, just to get up and dance as Lou Costello sings. (I do not know why they did not do that in other movies).
