I love the television contest. I hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 are chosen. I love seeing the judges too. Sometimes they are as entertaining as the contestants. I've been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. I would not miss it for anything in the world. It is the best reality show that has been seen on television. Good luck to all the participants, although I have already chosen the two who I would like to see playing Danny and Sandy on Broadway. I am anxious to see if my decisions are correct. I do not know how long the contest will last until Danny and Sandy are chosen, but I'll keep watching until the end.
