I saw this movie by accident while I was in Paris. I got into the wrong theater by accident and, when I realized it was not an advance or a short film, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> Paulina does a phenomenal job of keeping your attention with her performance. I can not say how impressed he was by his portrait of this true fatal woman. The rest of the cast works very well too. Do not get me wrong, this is not the best movie ever made, but since I did not know anything, I was left with a lasting and very positive impression. <br /> <br /> Finally, NOT speaking French in France paid off for once! I did not stop talking about this movie for 3 weeks after seeing it.
