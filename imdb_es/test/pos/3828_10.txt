I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; There is a special moment, physically tender, towards the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at an emergency distortion speed in an attempt to overcome a plasma ball Romulan possibly fatal, Janice, perhaps fearing that her life is about to reach a dramatic end, seeks consolation by placing her head in Jim's nice shoulder as they watch the instrument approaching its imminent condemnation in the main viewer. I thought it was sweet (and Janice, of course, she's beautiful!). <br /> <br /> (P.S. Goof: - Several times, while allegedly shooting phasors, the movie shows photon torpedoes launched)
