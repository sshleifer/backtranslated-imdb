This is one of those rare comedies where you try, you can not help but laugh, laugh and, yes, even laugh out loud. The acting of the main actor like Hyde is a pure maniac genius. See if you can keep a straight face when he makes his transformation. Good luck. :) On the downside there are times when the movie gets stuck. It seemed longer than his 90 minutes.
