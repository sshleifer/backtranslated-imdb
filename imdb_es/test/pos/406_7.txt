You have to be very patient to watch a film with such flat and fun phrases that you wonder what all this fuss was about when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from the public in the 1940s. <br /> In addition to some weak phrases and common visual gags, the plot is as farfetched as the stories that The Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience. He must ask himself why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it. But then, that's how unrealistic comedy is. <br /> <br /> But, if you're a true Red Skelton fan and enjoy a retrospective look at how comedies were made in the 40s, at least you can enjoy the kind cast that supports it. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Gray do it very well as their love interest and Conrad Veidt, as always, is an interesting villain. One of his funniest moments is his reaction to Skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans. "I never knew that," he reflects, impressed by a minor point that is presented intelligently. <br /> <br /> In general, a typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and simply accept the gags as they are. It is not always easy for a demanding viewer, as many of them simply get discouraged, as do many comedies of this time because the novelty of the visual gags and the sentences of a line has simply worn away.
