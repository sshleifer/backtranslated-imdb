I just took my 11-year-old daughter and my 8-year-old son to this movie and I can not remember a movie where I laughed SO loudly, literally out loud, with deep laughs because this movie is so funny. Of course, the story is predictable but the trip is so enjoyable that it does not matter if you know how it will end. The comedic senses of the actors over time were impeccable. The actors were perfectly chosen. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last young actress who is not ruining their lives. She is so refreshing. My children said that now is their favorite movie of 2006. Our money was spent well in this movie.
