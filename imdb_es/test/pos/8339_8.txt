This film, an old William Wellman, has an important message, particularly today. It raises the idea that sometimes there are more important things than your personal safety or well-being. The film, which has Walter Huston as the protagonist, is stolen by the performance of "Chic" Sales as Grampa. He is the most complete character in the film and a joy to watch. You will recognize some familiar faces if you watch many films from the 20s and 30s. It is well worth your time to see if you have the opportunity. Recommended.
