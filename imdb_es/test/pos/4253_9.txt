When someone refers to the field of independent cinema in the United States, it is often inferred that it means that the filmmaker or the people behind the project had much more creative freedom and did what they wanted. This, today, is not always really the case, unless someone is a solid "author" and creative freedom still has the caveat that one has to find distribution with one of the independent divisions of the main studies or be collected in some way for some kind of low level agreement in a worthwhile film festival. But Putney Swope, Robert Downey Sr's film about a tough African-American as a nail accidentally promoted to head of advertising guru in a production company, * is * independent film, the kind of work that was developed along with the "I like "or the Night of Romero. The Living Dead and Cassavetes Faces, at the same time that they do not obtain a real distribution of typical study, but cause waves, kicks and names in the world of cinema. For all your moments that are rough and raw, it is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It is also a funny movie, very and very frightening. Sometimes, the sense of humor is so ridiculous that it is almost impossible not to laugh, from the simple appearance of President Mimeo with his wife to the lines of dialogue of the announcements that the Swope team organizes as "I can not eat an air conditioner" in a true voice of "soul". It is as intelligent as the target audience, which is anyone who has two brain cells that can see that this work is not offensive or "too" shocking because it is meant to shake the cage, and it does it quite well. Well in the first five minutes. Once it has happened, Downey Sr continues his fight until he becomes a filmmaker who has nothing to lose: his protagonist is Fidel Castro, Isaac Hayes around 1972 (and yes, it's 1969 in the film) and another ex ad cio with a streak of gunfire to make Mr. Spacely in the Jetsons look nice. And do not forget those secondary characters, dear God. <br /> <br /> There are so many lines and memorable moments that it's hard to keep track of them. From maybe the most hilarious unsuccessful murder attempt in any film, to the only announcement of the "Face-Off" skin cream that includes lines that would give South Park a run for its dirty-mouth money, and only one Little help with Jack's only boy. Hill's films play the Muslim who continues to criticize Swope and that boy with the nun who curses a storm and impresses Swope in a swift blow. It's a pretty direct message about the media and publicity, but there are also many powerful moments in which only the head is hit on racism in the United States, sometimes without having to do more than one gesture and other times doing something HUGE like having a black. Panther types go this way and around the Swope advertising regime. And for a low budget production (I mean super low, hence the comparison with Night of the Living Dead and Faces) Downey got some really good actors, all non-unionized, and it's hard to imagine that some of them have had their First time I come to the camera here. <br /> <br /> It should be mentioned that Downey's style does not make him perfect: he is coarse and, at times, too crazy and antiquated for his own sake, and I'm sure I did not. I get some of the underlying humor of a couple of ads since I am a full generation after these ads were aired (although the "Miss Redneck Jersey" definitely was not lost on me). In general, although this is one of the best of your time period, a satiric itchy and a feature with a predominantly black tone that is too aware of what comes from an excess of power, regardless of the color of the skin. It is, as someone might say, "good whore".
