This is an excellent television series, it's friendly and for once realistic! The representation of lesbian women is handled delicately and is well done. On top of that, the address is wonderful and the setting sumptuous and rich, a real pleasure. If you missed the first one I advise you to watch the next weeks, 9PM, BBC 2
