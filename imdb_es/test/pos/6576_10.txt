Almost 4 years after the 911 events, if you were to ask what comes to mind that day, most people will probably comment on things like the vision of crashing planes and the collapse of the twin towers, the twenty of people killed, acts. of terrorism and heroism mixed, etc. everyone who was alive at that time will never forget that day. However, for most of us, memories, even if they move, are not personal. Now comes an extraordinary movie that gives everyone who did not lose a friend or family member the opportunity to get involved on a personal level in only what we lost in 911. This is a movie that should be seen.
