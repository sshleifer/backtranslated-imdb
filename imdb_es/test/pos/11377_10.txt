This movie has it all. Great actors, good dialogue, drama, comedy, and excellent writing and direction by Paul Thomas Anderson. I've seen this movie several times and I enjoy it more and more. It does not age, it is entertaining and stimulating. Easily the best role of Burt Reynolds, and he does a great job. John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle also give excellent comedic performances. There is not a weak element in this movie.
