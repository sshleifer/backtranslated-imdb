"Quitting smoking" can be as much about the exit of a preordained identity as about the withdrawal of drugs. As a rural boy coming to Beijing, class and success must have struck the face of this young artist as a call to break away from his roots and far surpass the success of his peasant parents' performance. However, problems arise when the new man is too new, when he demands too great a distance from family, history, nature and personal identity. The resulting divisions, and the confusion between the imaginary and the real, and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic, are the object of a control of the gut on the one hand or a complete escape of oneself on the other. Hongshen slides towards the latter and his long and lonely path back to being can be grim. <br /> <br /> But what exceptionally convincing peculiarity, honesty and sensuality, director Zhang Yang and his actors, bring to this trip. No clich√©s, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no necessary sex, romantic or violent scenes, no necessary street language and, to boot, no money is assumed to make the characters and whims of characters float. <br /> <br /> Hongshen Jia is in her mid-twenties. He is a talented, impressionable, vain, idealistic and perhaps emotionally hungry actor. The perfect recipe for your enablers. Soon he is the "cool" actor, idolized by youth. "I was hot in the early nineties." "He always had to be the most fashionable." He needs extremes, and enters heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. His performance means the arts, friends and roles, but not the kind that offers some challenge or personal contribution. And his self-criticism, dulled by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational doubt, a hatred towards himself. "I did not know how to act." "I felt like a fake." Medications available to counteract them. He says: "I had to drug myself to do what the director wanted." Therefore, his superficial identity as an actor becomes, through drugs, an escape from identity. <br /> <br /> Hongshen's withdrawal from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent and stubbornly his. Loneliness, space, meditative thought, speech rejection, therapy replacement. The summary is out. And much of its change occurs outdoors, not in idealized places, but mainly in green areas below the highways, bridges and skyscrapers of Beijing. Physicality is almost romantic, but it is not. Bike rides to Ritan Park, long spontaneous walks, sun and rain soaked, grass picnics, sky patterns and kites that absorb your meditation are very specific. It drifts to get there, while collecting indications of a more real and realistic identity. "I started to open up," he says of this period in retrospect. And the contact seems to start with his ungainly body that projects a kind of dancer positioning (clumsy, funny, humorous, narrative) in a current circumstance. If he lacks mind or spirit, his legs can force him to walk all night. <br /> <br /> Central to his return is the rejection of established roles. To emphasize his end to the performance and his determination to a new identity, he breaks his videos and television, and bangs his head until he bleeds against his "John Lennon Forever" poster. He has disappointed his iconic anti-establishment artist, but it is the only viable guide he knows. He even imagines himself as John's son (Yoko Ono), and adopts his "Mother Mary" as an intercessor in his "hour of darkness" and "time of anguish." (The heartbreaking and trembling pain in the park: hallucinations and skitzoid pains) "Music is much more real than acting," he says. And he talks about Lennon's influence as "showing me a new way". In the mental institute, apples that save lives (resistance, nutrition) reflect the presence of Lennon, as well as Hongshen's need to hang up the poster of his hero in his redecorated room. <br /> <br /> If Lennon's influence is on the spirit, Hongshen's Father's influence is on the ground. Although father and son are actors and users (drugs and drink), it is Fegsen's differences regarding his son that support his change. Because the father is more sure of himself: he accepts that he is Chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a director of rural theater. And he exercises control over his habit and his emotions. It is this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat him as a sounding board, sometimes with rage and anger, sometimes with humor (blue jeans, the Beatles) and passivity. In his most insane and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of lying and false, he exposes himself more than his father: "all the acts I did before were foolish ... life is nonsense. "And before Hongshen's emphatic" you are NOT my father, "he replies softly," why can not a peasant be your father? " <br /> <br /> Under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates in the rehabilitation facilities, he makes some tangible connection to a real self (not the whole). As the long-term effects of drugs recede, so does their old identity. Indebtedness replaces pride, distrust relies. Integrity banishes its black cloud. All its edges soften. "You are only a human being," he repeats unceasingly after being released from the safety belt incurred for refusing medicine. Back home, peasant butter soap is fine with him now. And his once "rare and true friendships" begin again as he is so evident in the contiguous and blunt fence scene with his musician friend. Hongshen says of this movie: "It's a good opportunity to think about my life." And I could add, become a new actor, united to art and life. Like Lennon, he has gained success without a loss of identity.
