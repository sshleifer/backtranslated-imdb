Although this movie starts with the usual: something goes wrong, the ships crash, people are helpless, etc., but it keeps appearing and presents the viewer with some new ideas. Riddick is something like a bad convict and has modified his eyes to be able to see in the dark, which is a very sought after skill due to the situation in which the crew and ship are. The cut in the film is very good and emphasizes the mystique that surrounds the antihero and male protagonist: "Riddick". The story in Pitch Black is, as already mentioned, to some extent very unoriginal and unsatisfied, but the trimming and cutting of the film mixed with some surprising elements that have been added to the story help it stay well and is one from them. then he left behind with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more. Vin Diesel acts really well in the role of Riddick and although his character is a tough and hard survivor, he still makes moral decisions almost on the edge of good, but that does not mean that his decisions do not turn in his favor in the end. ... Why destroy an already perfect reputation? In summary, this is a very good movie, although it is not perfect. The story seems very unoriginal on the surface, but below it shines with enough originality to entertain. Some scenes have that surprise factor, while overall it's a little better than the average. Maybe it could be described as a cult movie and it is definitely a recommendation for people who want a science fiction story enriched with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist, namely Riddick.
