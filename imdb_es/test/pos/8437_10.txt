"The China Syndrome" by James Bridges is a first-rate thriller; a model for those who want to make a genuinely terrifying thriller but do not know how to do it. <br /> <br /> Most thrillers end up with the standard shooting and chasing game that ends with the villain getting what he or she deserves. But Bridges understands that such a standard ending is not the case in some scenarios. "The China Syndrome" is exciting in a way that no one would expect. It has the type of end that is so unexpected, but so logical. <br /> <br /> The film stars three (then) current Oscar winners: Jack Lemmon (Best Actor 1973 for "Save the Tiger"), Jane Fonda (Best Actress in 1971 and 1978 for "Klute" and "Coming Home" respectively) and Michael Douglas (Best Film of 1975 for producing "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest") This is not the standard "Spot the Star" movie that became popular in the 70s. It is so solid and strong that we forget who is playing the roles and we believe that the characters are real people, that is a testimony of the collective ablities of the three actors, they can be stars, but they are actors first. <br /> < There is no music in the movie, apart from some background songs of jukeboxes or television shows, there is nothing Bridges does not allow any address style to appear on the screen, it is simply to present the material directly. dramatic as this , we do not need a score to distract us. It seems to me an ancestor of the films of Dogma 95 initiated by Lars Von Trier in 1997. It focuses on the characters and the story rather than the style. <br /> <br /> The story is about a nuclear power plant located in Southeast of California. ** SPOILER ** It seems that an accident happened and basically the film is about Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas try to expose the truth. In a way, this is not a spoiler, since the trailer, the television commercials, the video boxes and the reviews give it away. But from this apparently simple premise, a game of surprisingly complex morality arises and the suspense comes from human nature and the actions of people instead of a villain that frames another man (although this is an element of the film) . That's what makes "China Syndrome" so good. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
