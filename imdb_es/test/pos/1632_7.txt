I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say that it is one of the few books that I could not stop reading. <br /> <br /> However, the movie was pretty much what I expected. A lot of action, with a somewhat mysterious story. Tom Hanks interprets, in my opinion, a much better role for Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br /> You will not have to worry about this being as bad as the Da Vinci Code, this is all it was not. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense and less unnecessary controversy. If you have not read the book, do not worry, you will still find it very interesting. And if you've read the book, well, let's say you might be a little disappointed because I'm missing many scenes that I expected. <br /> <br /> In general, a quite impressive movie for any everyday movie viewer. But, maybe it's not something too special for Dan Brown fans.
