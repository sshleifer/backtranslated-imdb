There's not much that comes close to the perfect-rhythm storytelling and action-packed suspense levels like "GoldenEye." When it came out, it was the best game of all time, and even today, it remains strong. <br /> <br /> I admit that this game got boring after a few months of play, and not playing again until two years later, I got back into its prime, almost as if I was playing it for the first time again. <br /> <br /> There are 20 action-packed levels, which is probably the most of any James Bond game to date. Probably the most unforgettable is the level of the tank, which was probably the most explosive videogame sequence at that time. And the first-person shooter, as well as the use of Q devices, is what James Bond fans are always dying to use. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as a James Bond fan, I look for aspects of a true James Bond experience. , which are now appearing in PS2 games. So this game, although it has a great action and usable gadgets, I expected a little more, even in 1997. I was also upset that this game did not have Q or M or Moneypenny, nor anyone from MI6. While watching the movies, Bond interacts with these characters at least a few times throughout each movie, but they do not look anywhere in this game. And the vocal dialogue would have made the game more animated instead of the text dialogue they ended up using. They had the technology. They just did not use it. <br /> <br /> Probably the most annoying feature of this game is that it somehow follows the history of the movie accurately, and other forms is incoherent. For example, there are two levels in which you must protect or save Natalya, although in the movie she can take care of herself. There are also some unnecessary levels, like the Barco level, where you have to disarm some bombs (which are not in the movie), which adds nothing to the story. There are even some levels in which you rescue Natalya, but at the beginning of the next level, she is captured again. How? <br /> <br /> Oh well. Even those little things really can not stop this game. And although I prefer the newer games, this Bond experience is definitely one that you will not forget. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
