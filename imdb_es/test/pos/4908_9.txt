Directed by Michael Curtiz, Four Daughters is about four sisters with great musical talent, their suitors and their father, a conductor. Playing in a sardonic manner, Mickey Borden is John Garfield in the role that made him an instant star. The film also stars Claude Llueve as Adam Lemp and the sisters Lane, Lola, Rosemary and Priscilla, and Gale Page as their energetic daughters. His final scene takes place in the living room of the Lemp. Cigarette hanging from his lips, Borden is playing one of his own compositions. Ann Lemp, from Priscilla Lane, tells her that the piece is beautiful. But he says: "It stinks." He continues: "It does not have a beginning or an end, only a means". Ann urges you to create a beginning and an end. Borden responds: "For what? Fate is against me." They threw a coin: heads are poor, tails, I'm rich, but they threw a two-headed coin. The public loved the way Garfield, with his harsh voice from the city, said it stinks. That scene created the personality of Garfield's screen as the eternal stranger. Four Daughters is a slice of Americana with Garfield, in a compelling performance that provides more than a touch of darkness. <br /> <br />
