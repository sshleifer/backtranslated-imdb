This is a movie about passion. The passion that it represents is very badly directed, even for the main man. But there lies the incredible power of this film: it shows us that what we believe can be contaminated by nonsense, and can even lead us to do things that are destructive, for us or for others. In addition, those who try to escape from acquiring passion (see the drug addict who visits the studio) also risk self-destruction. <br /> <br /> The world needs to hear the message of this movie more often.
