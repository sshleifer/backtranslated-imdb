Now for sure, this is one of the happiest stories in which Bruce Willis has been up-to-date, and yet he remains poignant. I really like Bruce's style and personality, I did not like everything he's done, but he brings it to me in most of his film efforts. <br /> <br /> The story begins ..... He is power, confidence and style with an "S" capitol. Drive a Porshe, live well, in a palatial estate with a great view of the just city. That's Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant for those who are at the top or are rising to that. His recognition, he is Russell Duritz, he knows what it takes to achieve it. It seems that as life goes by quickly and is established in a basic way, there is a problem, an intruder in your house, the alarm has been activated! <br /> <br /> Russell can not understand (for the time being) what is happening to him. It is different and, nevertheless, it is something familiar. A little boy, who looks exactly like ...-- him. As their lives mingle, there seems to be a reason that is screaming at him: "You have a pending issue to attend to, now!" <br /> <br /> Amy, the young support lady from The Story is probably the best balance she has seen and has in her life. She works with him, endures her "ego" and, nevertheless, is in love with Russell. Very much. With Rusty his "I" gone now in the picture and talking a thousand times an hour, singing too late in the night, everything that was fundamental is turning into jelly! <br /> <br /> Willis is funny, self-centered and, sometimes, out of his head in this adorable classic of Disney's modern era, 'The Kid', and to add his little sturdy side kick, Spencer Breslin is a perfect complement to this flash. History from childhood to adult and back to the children's adventure. Chi McBride is an inspiring support character, as he is the heavyweight champion, and he teaches 'little' Rusty how to box to defend against the bullies on the playground. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a true winner of a movie, even with Lillie Tomlin as Russell's assistant and secretary. Originally I saw it again in 2000 and then, years later, with equal enjoyment. This is a brilliant family comedy that has a super finale that will warm the hearts of any Disney fan. Highly recommended (*****)
