This was a thought-provoking, well-filmed and directed television movie that approached a great subject with precision and intelligence, and gives it a cinematic treatment that would look great on a bigger screen: the palette is a bit muted for television. If you are looking for a war action movie or "bosnia lite", this is not for you, it is a common woman who took on an extraordinary challenge for humanity. If you want to learn more about the conflict and how a woman's work influenced the world in a massive way, watch this movie when it comes to you. I do not see that many other television films have dealt with the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. History avoids the obvious demonization of "the bad guys" and, instead, shows the denial and daily hatred that caused the death of thousands of people. It touched me at several points, and not somehow manipulative of Hollywood with background music and flashy mise-en-scene, but it allowed me to discover the horror and the implications along with the characters. This is a film brave enough to let the content speak for itself and keep the images underestimated to support it with dignity. <br /> <br /> The actors do a great job to bring the intense dramatic scenes to life. The scenes where the victims give their testimony before the court of war are powerful, and Wendy Crewson, Stipe Erceg and Heino Ferch are excellent. The British accent of William Hurt is horrible: no one else has given him the opportunity to play a Briton, and when he finally has it, he blows it! - and although the body of John Corbett was born to play a soldier / commando, it is too nice, although it does a good job.
