Whoever chose this movie was a genius, all the characters are perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job. This is a good look at what life was like before and during the civil war, the difference between the rich, the average white and the black. The story gives you some insights into the real problems of the era and the difficulties inherent in everyday life in those days. The story is convincing, and the drama keeps your attention throughout the film. There are characters that you will fall in love with, there are characters that you will hate and you will find yourself emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Both my wife and I loved it, and we'll see it again in a few years, I'm sure.
