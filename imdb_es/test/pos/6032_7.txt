Being a slasher addict who confesses to himself means that it is very rare for him to have the opportunity to review many of the larger films with recognizable budgets. Apart from the box office success of James Mangold, Identity; There have been no entries of big names since the Scream trilogy put Wes Craven's name back on the Hollywood map. Is that why The Last Stop by Mark Malone? A mystery thriller with flagrant slasher nuances intrigued me instantly. With a decent lineup that includes Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow and an intriguing soundtrack that even finds room for Lynn Anderson's Rose Garden, I must admit that the early signs were very positive for this claustrophobic feature. As far as I know, there have only been three other slashers for the snow, unless, of course, you consider that Demon Possessed fits into the category. The first slice and dice in the ice was Satan's blade, dry to the bone, and then came the Lisa Loring cheese feast that was Blizzard of Blood and the pleasant Shredder followed about fourteen years later. Blizzard, state trooper Jason (Adam Beach) fights through the snow to reach a remote lodging in the Colorado mountains. Your task is to inform guests that the road is closed and they must stay at least one more night until a path can be cleared through dangerous conditions. This news does not agree with the suspect group, which includes two problematic brothers (Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming), a truck driver who really does not want to stay (William S. Taylor), an excellent couple. of lovers (Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson) and Jason's ex-girlfriend, Nancy (Rose McGowan). The owners of the motel (Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson) are also not very happy with the news, but they offer rooms to the stranded guests and try to calm the tense situation. Things get worse when Jason finds a mutilated body and a bag full of stolen money lying in the snow behind the coffee. Like a chapter in an Agatha Christie mystery, tenants begin to die at the hands of a masked assailant who seems to be trying to recover the money. With so many dubious characters to choose from and there's no way to leave the crime scene, Jason has to try to stop the maniac before he kills again? <br /> <br /> A good mystery needs at least a handful of suspects who have a credible motive, a remote location from which no one can escape and a clever protagonist to help unravel the clues. Fortunately, The Last Stop provides each of those essential ingredients in a thriller that has its same moments of brilliance and stupidity. The film begins magnificently when the doubtful personalities confront each other in a claustrophobic environment that manages to keep the tension high throughout the execution time. Malone keeps the levels of interest high as each character reveals his own motives for attracting some suspicion, and to be fair, the essential turn is not one he can easily guess. In fact, I found myself watching the movie once more to see if I could catch any hint that I missed the first time. Unfortunately, when it is revealed that the maniac is an exaggerated psychopath who behaves like a bad boy in the comic, The Last Stop loses a lot of credibility. Fortunately, not everything is lost when an unexpected and brilliantly orchestrated turn rescues the end of the film. <br /> <br /> You can draw similarities with the excellent identity, since the two plots are almost interchangeable. The effort of James Mangold has to be the best of the two, mainly due to the stellar turnover of John Cusack and the always reliable Ray Liotta. That said, although Adam Beach does a pretty good job up front, while Jurgen Prochnow, Amy Adamson and brilliant Callum Keith Rennie add credible support. Rose McGowan acts as self-consciously in this role as she probably does day to day in reality and Winston Rekert began fantastically before completely exaggerating with the climax of the movie. If you are a slasher fan who is watching this for some bloody murders, then you will be disappointed. The psychopath wearing balaclavas appears only once and the rest of the murders are committed off the screen. But as I said before, the talent of director of Malone means that the suspense is never too far from the boom and that you can forgive the few faults because the positive aspects almost triumph. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look at The Last Stop. Slasher addicts and movie fans alike. Yes, there are a handful of negatives, but overall this is a solid example of emerging Hollywood talent. If you liked the identity, then definitely try it?
