A jewel of Japan, where today many of the best films in the world are being made. Stylistically, this is nothing so special. It's just a simple drama (with some comical nuances) about recognizable people who make their lives. Yuko Tanaka, best known for expressing the character Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, plays a 50-year-old spinster. She takes pride in her health, spending each morning in a vigorous exercise while delivering milk through the steep hills of Nagasaki. Once she has finished with this part-time job, she does her usual job as a grocery store clerk (called S-Mart, which made this Army of Darkness fanatic laugh). Along his route of the milk lives a man of 50 years, whose wife is dying. It turns out that the dairy woman and the man, a child services worker, left in high school, and apparently, each of them is still in love with the other. The movie actually has some important narrative problems. When the scriptwriter really wants the two unrequited lovers to join, he uses a pretty incredible deus ex machina technique. The climatic sequence is also really forced. But most of the film is beautifully small and attentive to the two main characters, as well as many secondary characters. The movie also has several subplots that look like they will eventually weigh the movie, but they will never end up doing it. I think the best thing about the film is the heartbreaking performance of Tanaka as the lonely woman of milk, who has resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life. Whatever the problems were, the film especially transcends them.
