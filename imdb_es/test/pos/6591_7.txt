Ernesto is a man who makes a living cheating other solid citizens of his hard earned money. Along with Manco, an older man with much experience, takes out capers that allow him to make a decent living, but that is not turning him into a rich man in any way. Enter Federico, an older man who has more experience in the art of deception. Together with the young Ernesto they are a winning combination. That only lasts until Pilar, Federico's old love interest, appears in the image. <br /> <br /> This Spanish film, directed by Miguel Bardem, is light and pleasant to sit on. Other better made caper movies have been made with much smarter plots than this, but the movie is easy to take and sometimes has many fun situations. <br /> <br /> This spectator will see Federico Luppi in anything, even reading the phone book! He is an actor actor. We have had the privilege of having seen him on stage in Buenos Aires doing an excellent job before his international film career. Like Federico, he does what he does best. It is impossible to imagine someone better in their role. Ernesto Alterio, the son of Hector Alterio, is a young actor who promises to have a great career. Victoria Abril makes Pilar have fun while getting involved with these scammers. Miguel Alexandre, a veteran actor, is also good as Manco.
