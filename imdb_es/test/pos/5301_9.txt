While Hayao Miyazaki's films have always been a must-have with me in regards to the story, they are incredibly beautiful to look at, with simple animation characters in a context of artistic images. Ponyo adheres to that formula, with a main character so adorable that I want a stuffed doll and a landscape so beautiful that it does not look out of place framed like a picture on a wall. <br /> <br /> The story, on the other hand, I did not enjoy as much as their last two releases, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. He was just a little too young, looking more for the children and letting the adults enjoy the animation. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed that the score made by Joe Hisaishi, who also scored the above. - He mentioned two movies, this time it was not so memorable. Although I can not remember Howl's score now, I still remember that it is one of the most beautiful I've heard. Ditto Spirited's - although I only remember that it is very complementary to the movie. Maybe it's because Ponyo is a more youthful rate than the score is not so disturbing. In any case, this film is still a must for fans of the anime or Miyazaki.
