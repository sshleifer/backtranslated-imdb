I could not believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot, I guess I'll stay for a few more episodes. Assy is quite funny and the entire police team shows that there are characters, but Assy is difficult to understand and that was a bit frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is, literally, an ass with nothing more than legs than sports socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips. Assy drinks too much and "plays according to his own rules", as you may have guessed. The only other funny moments are that Assy shoots many, many people and spends time at home, in the bathroom. Squidbillies is not fun, but it's worth checking out.
