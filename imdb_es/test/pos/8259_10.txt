Superbly adapted to the screen and extremely faithful to Mary Webb's period novel, this film is a true masterpiece. Apart from the emerging star with exceptional talent, Janet Mcteer as the protagonist and one or two established actors, the film mostly used little-known names. However, the drama was much more convincing for that. The social and personal tension is almost tangible and I felt as if the cast reacted the character of the other as if they had done it in real life. I saw that a commenter asked if Janet McTeer really had a hare lip, a testimony of how good her characterization was. I saw this on television when it was shown for the first time, I recorded it, and then the tape was lost unfortunately. But it is clear as nothing in my mind. If you have any fondness for the social period, it is something you should see.
