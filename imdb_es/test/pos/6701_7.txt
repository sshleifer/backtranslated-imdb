Ok, first let's remove this: like a movie piece, Lifeforce is garbage. As a bit of cheesy entertainment for SF fans, it has a lot of merit. If you enjoy watching those old SF black and white movies - giant spiders / mutated ants or alien monsters wandering the desert - you will really love Lifeforce. <br /> <br /> Bad things: the story It makes little sense and the acting is quite poor. Good things: special effects are half decent; It has a very different British history (set in London) that gives a different feel to most SF films; and has the well-endowed Mathilda May (surprisingly cataloged as "Space Girl") wandering completely naked. <br /> <br /> In summary: it's fun. <br /> <br /> I've seen him half a dozen times now, and every time he appears on TV, I give myself time to see him, it's true that this is partly due to Mrs. May naked, but it is also to see with the enjoyment of some unpretentious and silly SF.
