Food always makes a good theme in movies, as "Chocolat" showed. "Fiesta de Babette" is the same kind of thing. Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) is a French cook who flees from her native land after the repression of 1871. She moves to a very religious Danish town. The people in this town simply do not have use for joy. That is, until Babette prepares one of their exquisite meals. <br /> <br /> It's not just that this movie is about taking the fun to a place that has never known it. Like other Scandinavian films (and non-Hollywood films in general), it shows that a movie can maintain its interest without the use of explosions, car chases, etc. This is a movie that you can not afford to lose. <Br /> <br /> One more thing. Do you think the Danish word for "party" sounds a bit like "tastebud"?
