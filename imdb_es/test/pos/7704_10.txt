I watch this movie with horror in my heart because my mother was also a crackhead like Michelle. I've been wondering where Michelle is now. There have been times when I had to find my mother in places where I was afraid to be but more afraid to leave her there. Seeing Michelle act like that made me wonder where she was sleeping all that time? I saw with the hope that it was never so bad for my mother! And what I want to know is ... where Matt and Tracy "ripped that ass"? The worst scene for me was seeing Tracy shoot himself in an old navy dressing room. You've never put on your clothes before and it seems that all of them, except Michelle, have aids! Where are 2008? Can we get an update ??????????
