I will not bore you with plot and story lines, as they have been presented many times on this page, so? It's been a long time since I saw a movie like that. Beautiful, elegant and sober, with a matching narrative rhythm. A film with sensitivity and underestimated qualities that is rare in these times of clich√© plots. The beautifully tenuous photograph, saturated with rich rich colors, and for lack of better words, each painting is filled with an air of tension. The settings and locations are used repeatedly, but the film manages to give them a new life each time they appear, there always seems to be a key element, a lighting fixture or a piece ready to give a small clue to the audience about where we are in the characters . world. <br /> <br /> The performance reminds me of "The Bicycle Thief", not the style, but the fact that you forget that you are seeing two actors involved in their craft. There is a meaning behind each gesture and almost all movements have assigned a meaning to explain the inner world of the characters, the relationship, the feelings and the situation of the two lovers. The dialogue is scarce but, like the rest of the film, it is impregnated with meaning. Speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is contagious. Used here it becomes a device to tell stories. And although the film is of Chinese origin, even a song sung in Spanish by Nat King Cole imparts the film with a subtle meaning. The orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive, but the repetition is what makes it comfortable. It is used together with the story, and not just as a means to put the music into action, or to make the audience feel a certain way in a certain point of the plot. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone, I'm afraid that most people will be tired of the quiet flow of history, but I would recommend it to someone who is looking for an alternative to the romantic imbroglio that It fills the multiplexes on our side of the world. I must say that this film captivated me completely and I continued to see it night after night. The story takes time to appear and supports repeated presentations, since very few films in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. A very beautiful movie.
