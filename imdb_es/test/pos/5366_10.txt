A wonderfully thoughtful and immersive film that leaves a mark far beyond its initial release. Based on a true story, one of the many "little" stories before the Second World War, which lend an understanding to the mindset of most ordinary men's cultures, impacted by others perceived as ancient enemies and perhaps future enemies, with the darkening of War Clouds on the horizon. Seen at the Stony Brook film festival, the film was received with enthusiasm. Well written and issued by experts. The characters were more credible and attracted one to experience their trials and tribulations.
