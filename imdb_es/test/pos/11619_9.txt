First of all, this movie will not be for everyone. There are scenes of extreme graphic violence and "disturbing" images that only by their nature will turn off many possible spectators. Obviously from the comments in this forum - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY has divided those who have seen it. I am among those who I liked a lot for several different reasons. I feel that it was a very ambitious (and very competent) company for a group of young people of 18/19 years without a budget and with little experience. I think that every aspect of the film: the direction, the performance (although the interpretations of the character are more similar to the representation on stage or free form due to the nature of the film ...) the production, the FX, the score / sound design: they are all far superior to many of the movies that I have seen that exceed the budget and experience of these children ten times. Honestly, I have not been so impressed by an art-house horror movie since Nacho Cerda's GENESIS ... <br /> <br /> First of all, I'm not going to pretend that I understand and / or understand everything . of the graphic content in this film, but knowing that this was not a direct narrative type film when I entered it, I was not disappointed with the way it was developed. SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is 4 relatively short vignettes that revolve around the theory of the right brain / the lust of the left brain / psychosis versus restriction / compassion / "normality". To summarize briefly each "chapter": <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL basically has a naked girl who has an eyeball cut from her abdomen. I'm sure it's symbolic of something, I do not think I've paid so much attention at that moment and it happened to me pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> The next "episode", HUMAN LARVAE, is a nihilistic, horrifying and genuinely spooky story of a boy who is in love and rejected by his pregnant sister, who surrenders to the growing psychosis that causes. to the shocking conclusion of that particular chapter. HUMAN LARVAE is the best of the group in my book and will probably get under your skin. The narrative dialogue of Dead-Pan accentuates the growing tension since you know something horrible is going to happen, but you're not quite sure what it is. Do yourself a favor and, if you are interested in watching this movie, do not investigate it too much. Come into this with an open mind and an iron stomach and I think you will be pleasantly surprised, especially with this particular episode. <br /> <br /> REBIRTH has a group of people in a field who screw the ground and blow trees and stuff. Apparently an "artistic" interpretation of the violation of the earth or something similar. Not bad, but this one is also quite short and I missed the point ... <br /> <br /> AND RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM seems to be related to religion and religious hypocrisy and also together with HUMAN LARVAE, it has some of the "most difficult" images / messages of the whole function ... <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL is nothing fancy, mainly because it is a very short execution time but it does follow up decently Madness to come ... and REBIRTH is also a bit short and not as stimulating as the thought, but HUMAN LARVAE (especially) and RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM are so extravagant and well made that they more than make up for the other parts. I think the main reason why I liked it so much is that it is "shocking", "repulsive", "violent" and "excessive" as it is, it is also done very well and it can be said that this was a real labor . of the love of those involved. Nothing about the film feels cheap or rushed, and even if the content is not completely decipherable, it is without a doubt original, and that is only what is at stake in my book. It's not that all the films of "strange art houses" that have an unintelligible plot should be praised for their "originality", but the SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is the kind of film that I think I'll see a few more times in the near future to see. What other interpretations can I get from it? Once again, this film is not ABSOLUTELY for everyone, with some VERY extreme scenes of bloodletting, murders, rapes, incest, sacrilegious images, etc. ... that are definitely there to surprise the viewer and take a deeper look at this movie. I must say that it worked for me, and I am looking forward to the Hussain / Cerda collaboration that is rumored to come next. Take a look at this if you have stomach for it - 9.5 / 10
