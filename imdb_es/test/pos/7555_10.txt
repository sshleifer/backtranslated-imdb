A wonderful movie about people. The first time I saw Four Friends was when it was originally shown in theaters and I've seen it many times since then. If I'm not seeing it when it's on TV, I'll meet friends and rent it. Invariably, the people with whom I have seen this movie find it enjoyable. It's about friends from childhood to adulthood, in the 50s and 60s. It's very funny and moving, dealing with first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics, the whole set of 60. It can also be quite dramatic. If you like movies about people, this is definitely worth it.
