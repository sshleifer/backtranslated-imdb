For all those people who believe that dialogue is worth something, and who appreciate a farce intelligent enough to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a "whodunit" for people who can not not follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid). <br /> <br /> Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing, drinking a little, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely gives to his students. He has recommended a friend for progress, and a bright young student has sent him a manuscript as an independent project. Cornell does not even want to read it, so he gives it an "A" and pushes it to the side. Leaning with a drink in his office, he looks out the window, when the bright young student goes through his window on the way to meet the sidewalk in a meeting. <br /> <br /> Hal comes to talk, and talks, drinking a little more The Cornell realizes that he has to read the manuscript, now. When he goes home, his wife is waiting with divorce papers. He drinks a little more. She leaves, and he goes to a faculty matter, only to find her there. He drinks even more. And when his wife finds out that the student is dead, she faints, and he finds out that he had been having an affair with the student. This, of course, prompts him to drink a little more alcohol. The next morning, she wakes up to find herself in the bedroom of one of her students, a freshman named Syd (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> He feels worse than a hangover, goes to the doctor and finds out that he has been poisoned, is irreversible and has between 24 and 48 hours of life. He does not have much time to find out who killed him, and there are secondary plots, motives, relationships and surprises at every step, although everything makes sense in the end. All his discoveries and exchanges are adorned with sarcasm, dry wit and sharp observations. Let's say that this movie will give a new meaning to the adage "publish or perish". <br /> <br /> There are no bad performances in this movie. There are recurring images, and symbolism used at careful intervals. Observe the broken glass and the distorted images through the glass. Some of the camera shots are revolutionary for 1988, and part of the violent action is choreographed carefully and skillfully. The music is discreet and appropriate, although occasionally makes its own statement, in the lyrics of the songs. The images in this movie are impressive. <br /> <br /> If there is a failure, it is that the first 20 minutes move a little slowly and almost put you to sleep. But the pace accelerates rapidly, with just the right amount of exposure between the action segments. <br /> <br /> There are no explicit sexual encounters, although there is violence and a bit of bad language. <br /> <br /> This is a writer's movie, and it is best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure. I think if you take it seriously, you're already in big trouble.
