To talk relatively, if one were to see now "Pixote" by Hector Babenco (1981, Brazil, pronounced as "pi-shot"), after having seen several films dealing with street children, juvenile delinquents, children in problems ("The 400 Blows" by Truffaut, "The Forgotten" by Bunuel, "Shine Shoes" by De Sica, "Salaam, Bombay!" by Nair, "Mouchette" by Bresson, "Leaf on a Pillow" by Nugroho, etc. .), one might fear that the difficult situation of the child portrayed in the film may no longer affect any, since it was "de-synthesized" already after going through the emotional roller coaster set in motion by the films mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, that will not be the case. For Babenco, he narrates his film in such a practical way ("without art", as a film critic said, in a positive light) and that his main child artist, Fernando Ramos da Silva (13 years old at that time and the same child on the street), offers such a simple interpretation, wounded, raw in its simplicity (that hardened face, those lonely and longing eyes) that one is hard not to pierce in any way. (Such a feeling can achieve such intense realism when one learns that the child had only lived a short life, having been involved in street crimes after the movie and subsequently killed). <br /> <br /> Approximately in the first half Pixote and his fellow street and criminals spend time in a reformed state repressive school, where brutality and humiliation, rape and murder are the norm and the culture, where they are forced to confess their "crimes". In the tenuous idea that, according to Brazilian law, juvenile delinquents are not "punishable" for their crimes. For these children, the questionable freedom offered by the streets is more preferable than the harsh rehabilitation provided by these supposedly well-intentioned authorities. Within the walls of this supposed establishment of protection, these young souls will soon discover that the love and care of father figures are nowhere to be found, if not in a worse degree. <br /> <br /> (For Pixote, the only form of escape comes from the sponge grass and inhalation glue, which is secretly hidden inside the reformatory.) <br /> <br /> When children they throw themselves into a small-scale "revolt" to finally express and then fulfill their collective desire to return to the outside world, their "home", intensity and form are such that one can not help but think of the revolt of schoolchildren in the influential "Zero for the behavior" of Jean Vigo. It's just that in "Pixote", the "lift" is made to appear on a channel level. <br /> <br /> Once Pixote and his small group are back on the streets (the second half of the movie), they get involved in robbery, procuring and drug trafficking to fend for themselves, throughout of which you can meet Sueli, a battered but kind prostitute. Sueli voluntarily welcomes the four lost souls, in a way that allows them to steal from their clients and provides them with more than maternal care (at least one of the children). <br /> <br /> One would have thought that street children have finally found the only person who can give them the love and warmth they have lacked in their lives. But as doubtful as the freedom that these children believe the streets provide, this newly discovered "maternal figure" can not help but stay forever. <br /> <br /> Jealousy, disputes, differences and murder have only separated children, and forever. And during that defining scene in which Pixote, motivated by the circumstance, can shoot not only the arrogant American client of Sueli, but also his fellow street urchin Ditto (more than a son of Sueli), thereafter literally returns to the "childhood", since it sucks the right breast of the disoriented woman, right there and then materializes her persistent desire for affection from the parents, the image itself is sad and disconcerting. <br /> <br /> So, Sueli, in a probable return to his "senses", regrettably push Pixote back from his "nutritious" position and reject him, forever. Therefore, in a silent and heartbreaking moment, Pixote, with that youthful face and those somber eyes (not quite different, although in a different context, to the voice of the child in the heartbreaking "Come and See" by Elem Klimov ), stands up. , he puts on his coat and takes his pistol (yes, a gun!), and goes nowhere, walking along the train tracks and with the morning light just beginning to appear. With that scene, Babenco could be doing a tribute (among many other tributes found in different movies!) To the final iconoclastic scene in "The 400 Blows" by Truffaut. <br /> <br /> But while we have to know what became Antoine Doinel three years later in the short film "Antoine et Colette" (and in three other feature films in later years), we were left adrift in the darkness of what awaits Pixote when it disappears. of the last frame, that is the last time we will see this child of the street in real life (despite the fate that eventually has happened to him nowadays). <br /> <br /> "Pixote" may not be nearly as capricious as "The 400 hits" or as mind-boggling as "The Forgotten", but it still stands out among similar theme and texture films because of its simple power and raw.
