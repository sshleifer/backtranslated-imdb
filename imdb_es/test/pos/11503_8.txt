This movie is incredibly story-free. It is a pure experience where music eclipses the visual impression. - The words can not, of course, express what should be expressed, but it is the requirement of the classes of talks that are made, they are introduced in the production lines of mediocrity and, therefore, it is a necessity for express any thought or sensible opinion about something that should not need to be degraded by the talk. Therefore, these elaborate opinions are presented to satisfy those empty minds that must be filled with a noise that you will not find no matter how much you try in this movie.
