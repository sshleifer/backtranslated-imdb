For me, a movie of ten stars is one that never dies in my memory and, nevertheless, it can be seen again and again with the same pleasure as the first time. This could be a technically flawed movie; pleasure has nothing to do with spitting and polishing (my personal top-ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). "The Thing" by John Carpenter is one of the few films that fit this criterion. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of science fiction since I was a child in the sixties, and I read the short film John W. Campbell the story on which the movie is based ("Who Goes There") before see the original film by Howard Hawks in black and white (as in many people, that visualization was illicit, on television, when it should have been in bed!). That movie, like so many others you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed almost perfect: the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; everything seemed to work. I saw it many times in later years (and still do, when it is shown on television). Because of this, I avoided the Carpenter version for years: watching remakes of one's favorite movie is, I thought, always a mistake. When I finally saw it sometime in 1988/9, again on TV because there was nothing else on, I realized that I had to change "always an error" to "usually an error"! Carpenter had produced something different from the original movie, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. From the initial scene of the helicopter and the husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog-pound, to that end (sorry, there are no spoilers here!), I was hooked. The sound track alone lives with me, all I have to hear is a great similarity to the rhythm of the drums, and I'm in the final scene again ... <br /> <br /> Until Al see "The Thing ", I had Carpenter as another gore-monkey, based only on the comments and reviews of the general press. Since I saw "The Thing", I think I've seen most of his films: I have not left to do it, but if one appears, seeing his director's name is enough to decide to see that. He is thoughtful and knows how to build a film so that it reaches a point where something remains in the memory. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen "The Thing" and enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favor: sit in a dark room, wrap up and get ready to improve your memory.
