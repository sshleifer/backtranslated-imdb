Yesterday I saw this movie in a theater in Singapore (February 4, 2006) and I got a better understanding of what happens with patients with schizophrenia and their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Ms. Aparna Sen should be congratulated not only for addressing a difficult issue, but also treating the mentally disabled with a deep understanding of her situation that is necessary to help them deal with the trauma of the disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of disturbances that unleash in their minds. <br /> <br /> We have had Hollywood films on this subject, such as "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", where Jack Nicholson took the honors. Since then, the research has helped to provide more information about the problem and to clear up some misconceptions about the treatment. In "... cuckoo's nest", for example, shock therapy has been described as barbaric, but in "15 ..." it has been pointed out that it is not as bad as it seems. <Br /> <br /> The other misconception is that childhood abuse is a cause of schizophrenia. But scholars like Dr. E. Fuller Torrey have emphasized that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is thought to have some genetic roots. <br /> <br /> It has now been established that schizophrenia can be treated as any clinical condition and its progress can be checked if detected early. Even in fairly advanced stages, regular medication and counseling can be effective. <br /> <br /> The same understanding demonstrated by Ms. Sen is evident in the way the actors play their role. According to the seriousness of the subject, the performance is controlled through the evocative silences and the eyes of Mrs. Konkana Sen-Sharma that reflect the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind that speaks louder than some of the statements to which We are used to in most of the movies they have includes characters with mental problems. <br /> <br /> Like me, most of the audience in the theater seemed confused in the abrupt end. Leave many questions pending in terms of the plot. <br /> <br /> Is the search for Meethi over? Why can not you find it at number 15? Were the children playing when Meethi passed through the doors with his eyes shining with recognition? Can anyone solve this puzzle?
