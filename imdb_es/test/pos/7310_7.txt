The wife, Norma Shearer (as Katherine "Kitty" Brown) awaits her husband Rod La Rocque (as Bob Brown) hands and feet. While making her breakfast in bed and helping her dress for a golf outing on Sundays, Mrs. Shearer suggests joining Mr. La Rocque for the day, observing how often they both look. But, La Rocque discourages her, saying that her presence adversely affects her game. Then, unexpectedly, Shearer finds the real reason for her husband's frequent absences. Your beautiful blonde mistress! <br /> <br /> Three years later, Shearer is a glamorous and coquettish divorcee. During the summer in Paris, she has established a friendship with the socialite Marie Dressler (as Mrs. "Boucci" Bouccicault). Mrs. Dressler invites Shearer to her home on Long Island, to socialize with some friends and ask her for a favor. Dressler is concerned about her granddaughter's relationship with a soft and mundane man. He wants young Sally Eilers (like Dionne) to marry Raymond Hackett (like Bruce), instead. Aware of Shearer's flirtatious conquests, Dressler asks him to keep the undesirable man away from Mrs. Eilers. Shearer is surprised to discover that the man is La Rocque, her ex-husband. <br /> <br /> Shearer and Dressler make this a cute and entertaining game. They are in top form, offering guaranteed performances to be popular, with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is foolish and predictable; However, in a way that helps the humorous situation. And, the ending is pretty smart. In fact, the comedian "Let Us Be Gay" may have aged better than "The Divorc√©e", of greater production and more serious of Shearer, which was launched at about the same time. The cast uniformly well. La Rocque is better than her film with Lilian Gish; but, its role is not at all endearing. Gilbert Emery (as Towney) and Tyrell Davis (as Wallace) are fun support suitors. <br /> <br /> Those who are not familiar with Norma Shearer may not realize that it is she who appears as the disheveled wife in the opening scenes. This is Shearer as "Kitty" before her makeover. Look at Shearer's close-ups with a light, natural make-up to see an intriguingly beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> ****** Let Us Be Gay (1930) Robert Z.
