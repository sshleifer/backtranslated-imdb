The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Although she knew privately that she was an excellent nightclub and ballerina, Miss Turner rarely had the opportunity to demonstrate this ability in the film. <br /> <br /> So, the viewers take note! Here, MGM was clearly still trying to determine in which direction the young star would be developed, and, therefore, they sent it to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire. <br /> <br /> In "Two Girls on Broadway" however, he is given an excellent opportunity to show his native rhythm and his ability to change the pace in the luxurious production number, "My Wonderful One, Let's Dance " This number, conceived and filmed, is a kind of hybrid between the Busby Berkely style and the kind of routines that Hermes Pan designed for Astaire and Rogers in RKO. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the number opens with George Murphy and Miss Turner represented as customers of the bar (with the whole chorus) before a curtain of lame black in which Mr. Murphy sings the number Miss Turner. Then, the camera (in a pen) pulls back on a remarkable crane to reveal a huge stage, and a rotating set equipped with steps, columns, enclosures and sliding walls. <br /> <br /> As of this moment, Murphy and Turner execute a variety of moods and attitudes, which include elevations, turns, soft shoes and end with an electrifying series of combined pirouettes that conclude with Murphy both at lift as you turn Turner with an exciting speed for a racing orchestra. <Br /> <br /> Everything said a dizzying feat that proves that Miss Turner was capable of more than dancer, although I dare say that most of her fans would resist leaving her on the throne as the queen of melodrama.
