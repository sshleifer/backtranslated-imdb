This movie was my first contact with the talents of Chris Cooper. I was deeply impressed by the character he played. I knew when I saw the movie that more great things would come from this talented actor. He plays a Union Captain who, along with a couple of enlisted men, is foraging in eastern Kentucky. They occur on the farm of a woman "Sesech" whose husband has chosen to go to the Confederation. <br /> <br /> The representation of Eastern Kentucky, and its seriously divided feelings during the War, is very accurate. If you're looking for a war movie with a lot of blood and guts, it would not be like that. If you are looking for a drama that explores the psychology of peoples at war, in reality and philosophically, this is the best study of how divided loyalties affected the interaction of peoples in the border states during the Civil War of the United States.
