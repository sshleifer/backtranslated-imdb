It is clear that the value of this film far exceeds the cost involved in the format (mini-dv). In fact, the filmmaker adopts the format and incorporates it so cunningly in the story that I forgot the fact that I was not watching the typical 35-millimeter movie. It has the main appeal of independent films like Clerks and the work of Robert Rodriguez combined with a fantastic "new take" of the romantic comedy genre. "This Is Not A Film" is an honest film with honest performances and is an excellent rhythm narrative. There is not a point in this movie where I felt that a scene could have been (or should have been) omitted. On the contrary, the director extracts amazing performances from really talented actors and does so in extremely limited circumstances. From page to screen, this film is a valuable and relevant story that reaches many levels (creative, technical or otherwise). I recommend it for all those who enjoy cinema or those who are looking for a bit of charm in an otherwise unattractive medium.
