This is a very good movie with incredible humor. Jim Verney, as we know, was very good with facial expressions and shows a lot of this in this movie. This is definitely the best of Ernest's films. I would surely recommend it to any Ernest fan. I think I have great taste. In the movies and I'm sure that anyone will enjoy this movie. In the film, (Ernest) plays 2 roles, bad guy and good guy and interprets them quite well. I really enjoy the exaggerated type of humor where things seem impossible, like in naked gun movies, for example, and there's a lot of this in this movie. I bought this movie right after I saw it. Good address, good script, it's worth renting.
