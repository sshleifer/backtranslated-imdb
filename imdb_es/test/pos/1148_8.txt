<br /> <br /> Average adventure movie that took a serious and "devilish" story. The effect of dilution made especially towards the average script snatched the place of this film as a solid classic. Why dilute such a good story? Probably because these are "delicate" colonial issues and the producers do not want to create a political heat, only quick profits thanks. The direction, the cinematography, the soundtrack and the acting were good. The script was average. Connery's charm offset his wrong Arabic accent and all the scenes with President T. Roosevelt were master shots. The costumes / games here were very good. Very badly, we did not have more than one serious historical drama since this is what the story demands. Only for the big fans of the main actors or the fans of the exotic Romance / Adventure Holywood movies ...
