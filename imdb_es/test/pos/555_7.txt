This movie was a new direction for Natalie Portman. A much more adult role, although she comes to him from the footprints of a child in the film itself. Ann, (Portman) and Susan Sarandon, who plays her newly divorced mother, Adele, travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to Beverly Hills. There, these tortured souls try to accept their new life and their new relationship as Portman's character grows. Without knowing it, at first for Adele, she grows up and becomes a better mother for it. <br /> <br /> Ann sees her mother telling her that she wants to be an actress, or so she thinks. Adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives. We see their struggle while the mother and the daughter come to an agreement between themselves and with being alone, having left behind their old lives. <br /> <br /> The performance is first class for both. Apparently they become mother and daughter before your eyes. You can almost feel that there is a link there beyond the real movie. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not really lead us to any new terrain in this type of film, the fact that the performance is well done, and the story is not too flawed, let me recommend it. <br /> <br /> However, I will say that it will probably disappear soon, I do not think I can have the staying power necessary for a great Christmas. Movie season from a week or so. Watch it now before this happens if you like one of these actresses
