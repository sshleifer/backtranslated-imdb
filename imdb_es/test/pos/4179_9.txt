That this film has failed at the box office, and that it still strives to obtain the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity, although in some way quite appropriate. The commercial suicide committed by the Monkees in making this film is reflected in the metaphorical suicide they commit on the screen. So brutally destroying his carefully constructed image as a healthy American alternative to the Beatles is brave to the point of being reckless, as is the admission that he is nothing more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (literally, in the film) in your own the artificial. The Monkees television series was not so conventional, but HEAD is completely untrue ... although in the end, in fact, there is a circular logic. Unrestricted by a genuine plot, the surreal sequence of events is, in turn, hilarious and quite disturbing. The biggest irony is that the Monkees effectively signed their death sentence as a commercial force at a time when they were reaching their artistic peak. His exploration of psychedelia reached its zenith with the soundtrack of HEAD (all the songs are interwoven in a memorable way in the film), which is one of the most emblematic albums of the sixties. The Monkees began to disintegrate after the failure of the box office of this film, but HEAD serves as a noble legacy.
