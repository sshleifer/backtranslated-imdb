This film was made with a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) Without almost any promotion from its distributors. I only knew because I'm a fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme for a long time and I always look at his latest films with the hope that at least they can be seen and, apart from a few peacocks (Deviated, Second in command), they are. This movie has a fairly easy to follow plot and Van Damme offers a good humorous performance, but the film owes all its credit to the fight scenes involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the last of them together. The editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible, but Isaac Florentine can definitely film a good fight scene. I'm also happy that Van Damme has been acting better lately (In Hell, Wake of Death, Until Death), but with the good performance came less martial arts. In El Pastor, Van Damme proves that he still has it.
