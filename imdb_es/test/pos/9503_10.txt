The residents are a band known for their strange appearances and strange musical styles, so obviously, their music videos will not be exactly normal. In fact, these little videos are abnormal and strange, but they have great artistic value for them. The environment is built with lighting and well thought out visuals. It is a great observation experience. <br /> <br /> Basically, Icky Flix only consists of many resident music videos made for his songs. The music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music that sounds like an 80s horror movie. What does not change is the quality of these videos. They are great! <br /> <br /> Any fan of art movies will love this. They are so original with their images and the angles in which they are filmed, and the lighting especially makes them so interesting. The music is spooky and catchy and very original, and these short films are mini-classics that deserve multiple looks. This is an almost perfect collection of short videos. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** of ****. 56 minutes
