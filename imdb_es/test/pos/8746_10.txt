This is a wonderfully harsh drama, detailing the various aspects of international drug trafficking with heroin: from the hills of northern Pakistan, where the tacitly permitted cultivation of opium poppy is produced on a large scale; to the "Euro-Trash" of Germany and England who organize the importation of processed heroin in consignments of contraband of several kilos; for end users trapped in the network of addictions and the crime necessary to keep their habit growing; and, finally, all the levels of corruption and hypocrisy of the international government surround the efforts of the police to control "the problem of drugs". This drama is sketched with a wide range of well-developed characters, a completely evolved plot and an excellent acting of the characters. and the shot to the place. <br /> <br /> This puts the Hollywood epics like "The French Connection" in its place! <br /> <br /> Traffik is an espionage story related to modern drugs that invites reflection and thought. , and the international efforts of many people to try to eliminate it. <br /> <br /> Unlike many "crime dramas" that revolve around drugs, Traffik focuses heavily on discovering the social reasons * that people slide into drug addiction. As one of the characters says "... until we, as a society, build a world in which people want to participate, instead of wanting to escape, we can not stop people from taking drugs ..." <br /> <br /> This is a fascinating and completely fascinating drama. I highly recommend it!
