What a great cast for this movie. The moment was excellent and there were so many smart lines, several times I still laughed minutes after they were delivered. I discovered that Manna from heaven had some amazing moments and, while there were things I thought would happen, the way they came together was not predictable. This movie is about hope and the correction of mistakes. I left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing. Bravo to the five sisters.
