You do not have to be a fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this movie. I saw it for the first time when I was nine years old, having been a fan of the TV show, and my parents laughed as hard as I did. It's done in the classic style of the Bugs Bunny cartoons of yesterday, and considering the vulgar caricatures of today, I think anyone would appreciate a cartoon film that relies more on "madness" than on vulgarity, to get some laughs .
