I usually try to avoid Barbie movies, but this was undeniably impressive. Congratulations to the graphics and character voices. Everything flowed well. This charming story is a great turn of others, but it's worth buying! I do not have children, but the children I care for children (including children) find it intriguing and love the additional features of the DVD. Honestly, I do not know why this has such a low rating, but for children, especially your beloved 8-year-old Barbie, she will love it. It is not simple and predictive like most movies. This film for "children" has an excellent moral and shows teamwork. He has no oath, not a little romance (if he's old enough to solve it) and a beautifully written plot. That's why I give him ten out of ten!
