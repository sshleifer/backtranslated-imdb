I came across this site while I was looking for a video or DVD of the 1959 version of Porgy and Bess with Sammy Davis as Sportin 'Life. If someone finds this in a home movie format, let me know. I talk with my daughters all the time about things that they think are new, that have actually already been done. We went to see a live theater of the version a couple of years ago and all I could talk about was this movie. Unfortunately, my daughters can not remember seeing Sammy Davis Jr. in any production, even if they have heard of him. Needless to say, they are not familiar with the other great actors in the film. It is an important oversight not to have this classic film (due to the cast) in a home movie format for collectors and for future generations. Anyway, in my opinion this version was the best!
