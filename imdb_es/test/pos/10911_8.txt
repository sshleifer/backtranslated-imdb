Although friendly and fun for the gay public, Frank Oz's film "In and Out," about an imprisoned gay teacher that has been published on national television by a former student, has been sanitized and deodorized to attract the most direct viewers. large and more profitable than Sponsored "The bird cage". Although the audience probably patted their backs for being tolerant and liberal enough to watch the movie, the film revolves around Howard Kettlet, Kevin Kline, who is a very stereotyped gay man. The film states that a tendency to dance disco music, delight in Barbra Streisand's films and dress well indicates their sexual orientation. Like "Queer Eye," the film actually slapped heterosexual men and stereotypes like slovenly, stupid and lacking in taste and culture. Okay, "In and Out" is just a comedy, but even comedies send messages that may hurt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, at the center of the movie's mood lies a somewhat pathetic character. Howard is middle-aged, he is very closed or he denies himself, and evidently he has never had a sexual life. A three-year commitment to a teacher at the school where she works is described as a series of sunsets, long talks and watching "Funny Lady". Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays Howard's intended, Emily Montgomery, and she steals the show everywhere. Most of the funniest moments in the film belong to her, although Kline's attempts to resist dancing during a tape of instructions on the behavior of the males are very funny. He is a talented physical performer, but the movie only gives him a few moments to shine. Matt Dillon also stands out as the student-turned-actor, and the video of his Oscar-nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical. However, despite the gay theme of the film, there is no boy-to-boy romance, and only a man-to-man kiss, and that kiss is as erotic as Michael and Fredo Corleone's in "The Godfather II" . <br /> <br /> Although well intentioned, "In and Out" does not address the injustices and prejudices it illustrates. Howard is dismissed from his teaching job despite his outstanding performance and credentials, but little indignation is expressed. Most of the characters are more annoyed by the canceled wedding than by Howard's self-realization, which seems to take place during the night, and his abrupt and unfair dismissal. Not surprisingly, Howard's parents, represented in a endearing way by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, and their students stand up to support him. However, the sugary ending is as embarrassing to the audience as evidently it was to Howard Brackett in the film. The film would have been more refreshing if it had revolved around a gay man who dressed like a bum, was a soccer fan, drove a truck, listened to country music and lived on fast food. Despite some good performances and funny situations, "In and Out" perpetuates stereotypes and, whether positive or negative, stereotypes must be consigned to the dump of social history.
