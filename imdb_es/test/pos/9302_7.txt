This is a strange and compelling movie. The issue, about the atomic bombs created in Los Alamos, New Mexico in the United States and used in Japan during the latter part of World War II, is huge and, of course, deeply disturbing. The plot of the film assumes many heavy problems and the actors have to put up with a lot of the creative tension. I had never seen the film, or was very interested in it, I must admit, until I read the book "Smoking in bed: conversations with Bruce Robinson". Robinson wrote the story and the script. I think the movie was better than I expected when reading Robinson's point of view in the conversations about it, but I can see how he thought it derailed. I think Paul Newman is pretty good, but somehow he's in the background, badly done. He's too Hollywood At one point, a big, evil guy walks into Newman's office and has such a surprising presence that I immediately thought he should play the character that Newman plays. The other track, which plays the lead scientist, is also pretty good, but somehow it is not bright enough to represent the great anguish that comes with the part: the immense responsibility of creating a definitive machine of death and destruction. One of the most effective characters seems to be a composite personality, played by John Cusack. He is affecting strangely at all times, and in the end, he is the character whose destiny really hits home and who made me think more vividly of the fate of more than 200,000 Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
