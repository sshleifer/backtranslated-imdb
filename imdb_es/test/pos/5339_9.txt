I was very surprised to read some of the negative reviews of this movie. First, many have said that they took their daughters and granddaughters of 4 years to see this and did not enjoy it. First, I do not think this is a movie for children, at least not a movie for very young children, at least 4. It has a very subtle mood, but does not pretend to offer a quick fun like the one you see in Tom and Jerry or something A) Yes. Many people have also complained that it's going very slowly ... I guess all those people are used to "quantity" about "quality". While I have a small quality problem with this film and it is that the film was not as detail oriented as the short films, I still believe that it was achieved quite well for a full movie. And how can people complain about jokes? The jokes were sensible, timely and well thought out, never insulting or "in your face". Wallace is extremely intelligent, but cautious and Grommit is the most adorable, intelligent and cute character he could be. This was a beautiful film and the subject was very appropriate ... for adults, that is ... especially with the increase in obesity and metabolic disease in the world, there is nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits by once ... and this was achieved in a very tasty way in that ... while people are concerned about the appearance of vegetables that does not necessarily mean they are healthier or that they eat more of them ... but only that are in accordance with nature, which is in fact what caused the rabbit legend to come true. And for those who complained about religious jokes, I say ... come on! really? Many villages revolve around the local church, and legends / premonitions, etc., are normal topics, without harm. This movie was absolutely amazing, however, some people had negative comments and I find it absolutely absurd.
