I really liked the movie, I thought it was very entertaining and dramatic. But I just had a question about the music that is the movie. I have not been able to find any type of soundtrack (if there is one). And specifically, I was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is being played while the boys go down the river on their way to New Orleans. I thought it was something like "My great getaway", but I searched the Internet, books, almost everything I could think of trying, and I just can not find it anywhere. If someone could help, it would be very appreciated. Thank you.
