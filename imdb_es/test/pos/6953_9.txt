Where rivers flow to the north is a well-told story about the struggle of two people to live their own lives in the face of "progress" and development. In addition to enjoying the film as entertainment, I also learned a lot about life in rural New England in the late 1920s. <br /> <br /> The cinematography captured the natural beauty of northern Vermont and prepared the stage, while the music brought the film to life. Very well done for a low budget movie, produced locally. I found that the character of Michael J. Fox is the weakest in the movie, but Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal turn in two of the best performances I've seen in a long time. I was sad that I did not get a nod for best actress that year (I guess the movie was too "small" to be considered).
