Liv Tayler in her sexiest movie! <br /> <br /> She incorporates the role of "Femme Fatale" in an amazing way, while at the same time she manages to appear as a super sexy woman while maintaining the position of "sweet girl" and is not shown as evil like others. similar movies (eg, "Femme Fatale" with Rebecca Romijn) <br /> <br /> Until this movie, Lord of the Rings was the only movie I saw (I'm hooked with LotR) <br / > <br /> Point: For LoTR I formed an opinion that the role of the pure and sweet woman was the only role that Liv Tayler could play, but when I saw "One Night in Mc Cool" I completely changed my mind. She's the sexiest woman of all! <br /> <br /> Therefore, as a movie it is a mediocre common comedy with a "confusing" argument
