The first feature-length adventure of Jim Henson's beloved muppets is a very competent musical comedy vehicle, as Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree and swampy surroundings by the bright lights (created by Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise, who heard it to sing); on the way, he meets Fozzie Bear (a pitiful comedian in James Coburn's The Sleazo Caf√©, which has Telly Savalas for a bouncer and Madeline Kahn as patron!), the Rowlf piano dog, the bestial drummer Animal and his friends . back, funky band, queen of egomaniac beauty Miss Piggy (in a ceremony presided over by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc. Meanwhile, Kermit and others are pursued by hamburger magnate Charles Durning and reluctant acolyte Austin Pendleton, sold cars. Milton Berle, Bob Hope and Richard Pryor, respectively, served food for the insolent waiter Steve Martin, almost a brainwashing by the crazy German scientist Mel Brooks and, finally, they got an audition in the offices of the movie mogul Orson Welles ( who has Cloris Leachman as secretary)! The pleasant rating of the song is courtesy of Paul Williams, who also makes an appearance as a resident pianist at El Sleazo. For the record, I recently purchased four of the subsequent Muppet movies and should see them in the coming weeks when it is their turn.
