This movie shows that you do not need a Hollywood budget to do something fun to watch. What struck me is how the crew of different places could join without promises of riches to do something just because they believed in it. I think anyone who makes low-budget films can relate to certain scenes, such as actors who simply can not understand that line, that the police annoy them and that most of the team disappears after the first week. Nobody was paid for this, which says a lot for people who had to travel across the country and during the long hours dedicated to editing. After seeing Stuie sell his personal assets, use his own money and destroy his house to make the movie, I'm a little curious about how close his wife may have been to leaving. Good job for everyone.
