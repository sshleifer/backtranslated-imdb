This video was my first introduction to the residents, and I could not stop playing it for the last three days. The visual elements are dynamic and more inventive and technically complex than any other you have seen on the big or small screen. <br /> <br /> However, the DVD loses points for the useless addition of new music. Residents' original music is different from anything else you've heard, and it will really modify your brain in the best possible way. The new music, however, is uniformly uninteresting and in most cases is quite bad compared to some of the classic tracks. Also, the incomplete Vileness Fats video feels VERY incomplete, and I could only understand the plot of the story from an extensive reading of the notes on the disc. <br /> <br /> Speaking of notes on the album, this DVD has many fresh Easter eggs that will probably attract Resident fans for a long time. Tip: look for icons on the note pages that should not be there. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the disc is one of the best DVD transfers available. There is virtually no observable pixelization, and only a little nervousness at the points of strong contrast. <br /> <br /> Kudos for a first-class presentation. This album really deserves your attention.
