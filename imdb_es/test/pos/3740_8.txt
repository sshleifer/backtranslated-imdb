Discover something, the trip is much more fun, much more surreal and much more emotionally galvanizing than when you finally reach your destination. Falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world. You feel energized, energized and alive. You just want to be close to that person every second of the day and the sound of your voice excites you and sometimes excites you. Love, and all the physical and emotional side effects that come with it, is pure happiness. Wherever you go from here, everyone guesses, but when they start their journey together, nothing can compare with it. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and Dr. Paul Flanner, two of whom are marked by their emotionality. Elderly people. In this film, you are about to embark on that mystical journey together, where love and the discovery of emotions on the road will help to save them. <br /> <br /> Lane deals with the typical imbecile of an ex-husband who still loves her, but in her eyes, just because the woman she cheated with does not want him anymore. As hurt as he was by him, no matter how much he really dislikes it, there is a part of her that is really considering giving it back to him. Why can you ask? Because in life, and in love, sometimes comfort exceeds intelligence. Yes, this man cheated on her, but she has children with him, she built a life with him and obviously there is still a connection with him. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere plays a recently divorced husband and a separated father. He also just lost a patient when she reacted negatively to anesthesia. Now he is being sued by his family and feels guilty but hardened by the problem. This is what takes him to Rodanthe in the first place. Although his lawyer told him not to, he felt obliged to visit the woman's husband in Rodanthe. He stays at the inn that Adrienne is taking care of. Soon, they will find comfort in each other's arms and discover that they can also have a second chance in life. <br /> <br /> For now this sounds like a simple idea for a movie, and although it might be something for you. As I've seen or read before, Gere and Lane simply own the movie. Diane Lane lights the screen with her smile. His eyes shine in the darkness and the life he brings to the character is something worth seeing. The character of Gere is a little different. He is more hardened and bitter. It takes Adrienne's pain and passion to get it out of her shell. He silently blames himself for his tense relationship with his son and she secretly blames herself for the patient's death. On the outside, she tells anyone to hear that it is not her fault and that she was one in 50,000 victims. But deep down, he eats it. They are at a time when they both need someone to listen to them. <br /> <br /> Gere and Lane have been together in the movie before, but this is the first time they play lovers. They married in Unfaithful, but here they play with lovers who meet when the people in their lives have abandoned them. They have a spark and a real chemistry. I would love to see more movies with them together. In fact, I'd love to see more movies with Diane Lane, but that's a story for another time. <br /> <br /> Nights in Rodanthe is a very passionate and romantic movie about two lost souls that are saved. Both become better people, both become stronger people. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone, not just couples. This is a film about redemption, absolution and second chances. <br /> <br /> It will also ask you to bring some handkerchiefs. <br /> <br /> 8/10
