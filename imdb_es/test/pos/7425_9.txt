A true comedy. The dialogue is quick and very ingenious. Eleanor Parker in its physical apogee. Flynn as only Flynn can be "the charming rogue" ... although now it has passed its apogee. The movie moves well. If you have not seen this movie, please take a look. You'll be surprised by the timing of Flynn's comedy. the most attractive movie of Parker, it's worth seeing. The romance of this movie of the 40s will not be lost in those who are so inclined to see movies from Hollywood's golden past. My bet is that Never Say Goodbye will not disappoint.
