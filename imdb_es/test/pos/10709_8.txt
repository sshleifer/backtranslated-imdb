Favela Rising is a documentary about the poor neighborhoods of Rio, the favelas, specifically the most violent one, Vigário Geral. According to this film, many more children died violently in the favelas of Rio during the last decade, more or less than in Israel / Palestine during the same period, a surprising fact if it is true, which shows how little recognized this social problem is in the rest of the world. This is an important issue, especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to bring together the most needy and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program. This is a compelling documentary, if it is occasionally affected by a personality-based version of the events and by a video and grainy digital film that can sometimes make you think you need your eyes examined. <br /> <br /> Drug lords Favela government and adolescents with guns are the main drug traffickers, as in some parts of Colombia. The movie City of God / Cidade de Deus by Fernando Meirelles has been accused of celebrating violence (Cidade de Deus is another of Rio's many favelas). But the first section of Favela Rising shows that, in fact, the boys of the favela celebrate violence and want to trade with drugs where there is money and action. It's great to have a gun there, great to work as a drug dealer: it's fifty times more profitable than the profits available through other means. <br /> <br /> Mochary discovered for the first time the AfroReggae movement and its leaders Anderson Sá and José. Junior while visiting Rio for a conference and quickly convinced his friend and mentor Zimbalist to quit his job and come to help make a movie with his own promise to fund it. The eloquence and charisma of Sá and a surprising turn in his life make him the center of the film and its main narrator, but like the favelas, the film is full of other people. There is no doubt about the fact that Sá is an outstanding leader, organizer and artist. <br /> <br /> Vigário Geral is compared to Bosnia: firing there was very dangerous. The friendship, protection, caution and diplomacy of Anderson Sá on filming allowed the filmmakers to access and shoot detailed images of their subjects, while (mostly: there were direct calls) avoiding any serious confrontation with drug traffickers or the policemen who deal with drugs. They also trained the children to use cameras and left them there on their trips home. That resulted in 10% of the images, including rare shots of violent incidents, including police beatings. It is difficult for a stranger to track the police massacres in Rio. There was one in the early 1990s that looms over history and inspired Sá, who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to direct his cultural movement. The police are in all the drug trade and if somebody does not like it, badly trained police paramilitaries come in (often with black ski masks) and shoot in a neighborhood, killing many innocents. <br /> <br /> This is practically the image we get in the City of God of Meirelles, except that this time Sá, Junior and the other boys entered, starting at Vigário Geral, but finally they spread to other favelas to give Percussion classes that attract Dozens of young people, both girls and boys. His program AfroReggae (AfroReggae Cultural Group or GCAR), formed in 1993, is a new alternative way of life for young black people in the ghettos of Rio. It leads them to leave behind the habit of smoking, alcohol and drugs (that's the rule) to explode in rap, songs, percussion and gymnastics in expressive and galvanic performances. Finally, the best of the artists led by Sá appears before large local audiences with local producers, and his Banda AfroReggae has an international recording contract. <br /> <br /> Other centers and groups have been created by GCAR over the years in Vigário Geral and other favelas to seek the improvement of youth, providing training and staging of music, capoeira, theater, hiphop and dance in the GCAR centers. <br /> <br /> Performing arts are not everything, only the focal point. GCAR is also a movement for broader social change. Gathering public awareness through such actions, the centers also provide information training (newspapers, radio, Internet, email links), hygiene and sex education, to try to bridge the gaps between rich and poor. , in black and white, and to offer workshops on audiovisual work, including the production of documentaries. The program is currently active in four other favelas. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes of street and favela life in Favela Rising and they look a lot like the images in City of God with the important difference that the focus and the result is very, very much more positive It's not that it's not an uphill battle. And the corruption of the police, the inequities of the social system and the indifference of the general population of Brazil are not directly addressed in any of this. But there is a scene in which Sá talks to some young children in another favela, cynical children who are not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and determined to work in drug trafficking like Sá himself did when he was a child. Sá does not seem to convince any of them despite pointing out that the traffickers do not reach the age of fifty. But we learned that the most negative child in this group, Richard Morales, joined the movement five months later. There is also the account of a strange accident that disabled Sá, but with a positive result. <br /> <br /> It would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story was edited a bit, but this is a vibrant and inspiring material that represents a committed and risky documentary, and it is good that Favela Rising has has been included in seven film festivals and has won several awards, including Best New Documentary Filmmaker at the Tribeca Film Festival. He is currently showing at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. However, a large audience for art in the United States seems unlikely. <br /> <br /> Included in the SFIFF 2006
