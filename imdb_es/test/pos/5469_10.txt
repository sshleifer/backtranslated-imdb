There is almost no information available about this movie, or its broadcast dates. After an exhaustive and ongoing search, I found that the DVD was available for 3.99! Release date: February 28, 2006. Try yahoo / DVD and the video. In order to publish this information, I will continue to affirm that this is a well made movie with a true and fascinating story about a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual staircase in a church. It is an opportunity to see William L. Peterson before C.S.I. It made him a star Equally present in history is the venerable Barbara Hershey, does anyone remember when it was Barbara Hershey Seagull? I have to keep writing to get this published. Thanks to previous commentators for taking the time to recommend this somewhat obscure television movie that obviously leaves a lasting impression on many.
