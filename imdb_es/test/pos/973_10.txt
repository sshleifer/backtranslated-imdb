This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in my life. A 14-year-old boy, Jason Shepherd, wrote an English-language newspaper called "Big Fat Liar." When his skateboard was removed, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the university on time and arrived in a limousine. When he entered the limousine, he met a famous Hollywood producer, Marty Wolf. When he left the limousine, he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and turned the role of Jason into English in a movie! When Jason admitted that he left his paper in the limousine and Marty took it, his parents and his English teacher did not believe him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood and get Marty to admit that he had stolen his story from Jason's parents. When Jason told Marty to call his father to tell him that Marty had stolen that role, Marty cheated on him and burned his paper! Jason got so angry that Marty burned that paper, so Marty called security to get Jason out of his place! Jason and Kaylee realized that Marty is not going to admit the truth. To knock down Marty in Phase 2: The Takedown, Jason and Kaylee put a permanent blue tint in the pool and when Marty jumps, his body turns blue and he does not take off! Then, they put a permanent orange tint on Marty's shampoo and when you use it, your hair turns orange and does not come off. Finally, they put a lot of glue in Marty's earphone to make him call Jason's father and when Marty uses it, it sticks to his ear! It was fun when Marty's hair and body turned blue and orange and his headphones stuck to his ear! After that, they cheated Marty by telling Monty, who is Marty's assistant, that Duncan moved into a house where a party was being held. When Marty went to see Duncan, he was in the wrong house and all the children at the party beat him. When Marty was in the house, Jason and Kaylee changed the controls on their car. When Marty was driving his car, he knew that all the controls were changed and he did not know which button to press. It is stupid enough to fall into the trap. When Marty hit the back of the shredder, the shredder destroyed his car! It was so funny. So Marty starts calling Jason's father and tricked him again! He was on the phone, but it was not his father, he called security! After security took Jason and Kaylee out of Marty's room, they were suggested to go home. Monty was going to be on the side of Jason and Kaylee because he knew that Marty was a liar and therefore he told Rocco, that he is one of the security guards who will take care of the children. Jason told his father the truth of what he has been doing for the past 2 days and if his parents came to L. A. When Monty came to the children, she will help the children move on to Phase 4: The reward. Jason divides the team into 3 teams for Phase 4. A team will distract and cheat Marty until Jason's parents arrive on the set. Marty rode for the first time with Frank Jackson, but his car broke down, so he rode with Jaleel, but took him to the desert and left him there. When Marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. After that, one of the blades gets stuck, so Marty and the pilot got off the helicopter. After that, he was on his way to the set and when Jason saw him, Marty stopped and saw what Jason has: his monkey! So Marty went after Jason and Kaylee and when they saw Lester, he let go of the water and when the water came, he pushed Marty away. Marty was still behind the children and when Kaylee went the other way, Jason took Marty to the top of the apartment building. At the top, Jason was challenging Marty by making him admit the truth and Marty will never tell the truth. When the crew surprised Marty, everyone, including Jason's parents on the set, knew what Marty was doing. Marty was going to kill Jason, but the only way to escape from Jason is to jump from the top! After that, his parents believed him that Marty took his story. When the people who were on the set left, this is Marty's end. In the end, Jason's story, Big Fat Liar was a movie. I can not get enough.
