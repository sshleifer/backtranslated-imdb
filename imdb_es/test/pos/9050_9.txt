Despite looking dated, "Inki and the bird Minah" is, in my opinion, a nice and charming caricature. The work of art is not extraordinary, but it is good enough. This caricature has no dialogues, only sounds and music, but this combination works quite well. The cartoon itself is good, fun, old-fashioned, creative, entertaining and fun. <br /> <br /> This cartoon also makes a difference because it focuses on just 3 characters: Inki (the little black girl), the Minah Bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion who wants to eat Inki and Minah , so he chases them for most of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> Actually, I find that lion very handsome, hilarious and cool. I really like that lion. That poor lion is so stupid and loser that you have to feel sorry for him. For me, the real enemy is the Minah bird, not the lion. At one point, the lion almost eats it, it is a pity that he did not swallow it because it deserved to be eaten. <br /> <br /> Back to this animated short, there is not a single boring or boring moment At least for me. The only thing that seems stupid to me is the end because the bird has a great fight with the lion, it steals his teeth and puts them on himself. Apart from that, I have nothing important to criticize about this, apart from the fact that the steak should have gone definitely for the lion and not for the bird. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a very forgotten one. and underestimated little gem that should definitely get more credit.
