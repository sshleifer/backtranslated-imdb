I love this movie!! Maybe it's my generation but I can really connect with what he is talking about and what it means to do. He kept me laughing for the time. Duration of the film, the next day and beyond. I think this movie is not something to see if you are mainly concerned with the plot and the development of the character. This movie is practically only for the generation that will understand it. There are many things that you only know that were raised in that generation that you would not do if you said 40. I think that Sacha Barren Cohen was Very and I want to say Very Good. He is a genius. and the reason why h is an idiot is because he can make people believe he is a complete idiot, and make it fun at the same time! <br /> <br /> Very good movie. Strongly recommended !!!! (Not so strong if you have more than 30)
