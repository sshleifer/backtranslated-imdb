Do not forget the lover aside! She is a 'hottie', Karen Parsons is delicious, she is wonderful, in acting, beauty and style. It's just your job! HO, well, now here's a show that the writing hits you in the stomach and, as you bend, it kicks you in the ass! In citing Peter's wife, (The Associate / writer / Producer) said that when they were watching the "breakthroughs" of the next "new" shows at an ABC network party, she looked at her husband after the presentation of " Work". and said: "This is not like anything else that is in this network, you are in trouble." That is, 'looks' very well! But it does not seem that the common people of the "comedy of happy and bright people" or the drama about hair style, (ABC) are comfortable with the "Air". From the moment I saw it, after the first episode ended, I made sure not to waste that space of time next week. I was instantly addicted to "The Job" Cutting the wit and cynicism, the outrageous situations and the laughter of the writers make this series a success! <br /> <br /> Then I felt anger and a feeling of disappointment, that the program has faded. I wondered which executive took the decision to knock down one of the main comedies in his network. <br /> <br /> I talked to other people on the subject, some know, some do not, but I know that the stupid network did not promote it enough, or should I say it visually enough. If they had, they would have lasted at least 3-5 seasons, maybe even six. I just think that, knowing what a network is, I can not subscribe to one 'formula' or another, they lost the pot. this one There was so much room for expansion, it had barely begun. The situations were fun and serious, fast and, sometimes, slow, but not much, maintained a good pace. Some years later, I finally found it on a new DVD for $ 50.00. For me it would be worth $ 1,000.00 to have this in my entertainment library. I watched with amazement as I went through both seasons for the third time on DVD and the final episode of 'Betrayal', was entering a segment of totally serious drama with them discovering a murder victim, was better than most victims of the drama The unit 'and' cop 'are shown in the air now !!! They entered the scenes as serious as a heart attack and so credible, they did it as if they were not even skipping a beat. Just as I was meant to be serious, I am so impressed with the "versatile ways" that Tolan and Leary shared in stories and scripts. <br /> <br /> In another indignation of the 'entertainment week' I learned that the beautiful costumes, silk ties and expensive suits with pressure shirts and ultra-elegant shoes ... were sold to the film made for cable "In the cut" (2003) for only four hundred dollars, that's all! ! I'm sick. Did you see what everyone has for each show? A good coat could only run a lot. <br /> <br /> This was Denis Leary in some of his best. I recommend this great "drama" of policemen for the inhabitants of the east coast or wherever you are in this country. I even heard that the people of Ireland were joking about the episode "Bath" of Leary, repeating the lines to him from that moment, because they saw him there. (****) A show by Newyy Leary / Tolan incredibly intuitive police officers from New York.
