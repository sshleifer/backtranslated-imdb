After World War II, the constant crime in Phenix City, Alabama, encouraged by money from an Army base across the river in Georgia, worsened. Gambling, prostitution, loan loans and similar things helped an organized crime apparatus in the city. Soon it was too bad and violent even to tolerate more. This movie is based on the real story of that fight. <br /> <br /> According to the standards of the 1950s, it was surprisingly explicit. Although low budget, that same small budget helped with the realism that required firing in the location. A very rough movie. Richard Kiley was wonderful as always, and John McIntire resists. <br /> <br /> Why this good movie is not on video is a real puzzle!
