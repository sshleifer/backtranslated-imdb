I've always liked animated ducks for some reason: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck. Although none of them is as upset as Duckman. Originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997, Duckman lasted a total of 70 episodes, but could have gone on forever without becoming obsolete. <br /> <br /> The titular character is a vaguely discombobulated, without apologies and practically the worst living person in the world. world. He is a private detective, a widower, a furtively looking tom, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a murderer, a (fill in the blank). Whatever it is, Duckman has done it. But who can blame him for being so thin when the world we live in is so foolish, outrageous and just plain absurd? Eric Tiberius Duckman (voiced by the maniac Jason Alexander) could take the entire show alone, but when surrounded by a handful of eccentric supporting characters, you simply know that the problems are waiting to explode at every opportunity. My favorite has to be Willibald Feivel Cornfed (or simply Cornfed Pig), Duckman's incredibly inexperienced companion, who is apparently talented and highly trained in everything and who is always oblivious to the infinity of vice and incompetence of his partner. <br /> <br /> the typical plot will involve some strange case in which you will inevitably make a mistake or turn around your highly dysfunctional home, though occasionally the Chicken King (Tim Curry), enemy of Duckman, a kind of Professor Moriarty in the form of a bird, appears as diabolical Scheme in revenge for having been bullied in high school. <br /> <br /> Since I was a teenager, this has been my absolute favorite animated show, better than The Simpsons, Family Guy and even King of the Hill. Nothing will ever surpass him. There never was, or will be, something like Duckman ever again. The level of satire, observational humor and writing is so clear that it is deadly and the animation is done in that unique style Klasky / Csupo (anyone who has seen Rugrats will understand). It's a wonderful world, highly imaginative and wild, and all with a noble feeling, from the 40's. <br /> <br /> You can never have too much of this particular bird.
