This movie is almost as good as the first Jackass, but with slightly more unpleasant parodies. I would not say that this was as good as the first, but it was very close. Jackass fans will not be disappointed, but if you did not like the first movie, you will hate this one. There are scenes that will look like the Jackass classics (the older suits with "additions", the "taxi ride" and many others), and the ones you would never want to see (eat garbage, drink semen, etc.)) Overall, this movie was a good watch, and I'm glad I saw it. I am sure that this movie will not have the best rating due to the critics that qualified it (I sat in the press section and most of the older viewers seemed disgusted), but do not let that stop you from enjoying it.
