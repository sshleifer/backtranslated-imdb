This film by Blake Edwards is not sure if it wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. It does not matter, the mere presence of Julie Andrews, is enough reason to see this comedy, drama, musical, espionage and parody. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but it's more than good, like Julie's romantic interest. Authentic automobiles and aircraft of the First World War, add to the appeal. In general, the movie is very entertaining. The DVD release is an edited version (by Blake Edwards) of the original release. Supposedly, this is the only version that Edwards would allow; but, Turner Classic Movies has shown the full version (theatrical version) recently. Recommended.
