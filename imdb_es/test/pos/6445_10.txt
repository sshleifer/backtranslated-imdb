I saw this movie when I was a kid and I fell in love with it. It has a sweet sensitive history. Something that children can appreciate. I loved it so much when I was a kid I had to find it for my daughter. It is definitely a movie that you would see with children. It reminds me of a lot of stories about a Disney nature like Pete's Dragon and Mary Poppins. As much by the live action as by the cartoons, but in its premise. It is also a good story to show children that if they tell the truth, they can trust them and adults will listen to them. I think all children should see it and enjoy it. It is a break with the violent films of bad taste that many children see these days. It has all the charming qualities that many of today's movies do not have.
