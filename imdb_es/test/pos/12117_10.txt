This is an excellent anime movie. It is well animated, has a good intricate plot and very good music. I understand that some may think it's a little long, but I think it's a good length and animation is a good traditional anime. <br /> <br /> THREE CHARACTERS: <br /> <br /> The way they use Tenkai is masterful. For example, the double body that appears in all these locations adds to the ominous tone of the movie. Tenkai's design is also good, he looks like a monk and, in the final scene, the armor he is wearing. <br /> <br /> Elderly Andou is sensible and has a very nice character. When Jiro meets him, it's a turning point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Sanpei, the Satsuma Shinobi that infiltrated the Tenkais clan, saves Jiros's life twice. However, it remains in the background most of the film, but in reality is one of the heroes of the film. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT: The plot is good. It is traditional without being original. The historical epoch in which it is represented is interesting, the Meiji restoration. Tenkai looks for the treasure to restore the shogunate, whereas when Jiro finds it, he uses it to help the anti-shogunate forces to overthrow the shogunate. <br /> <br /> The way that Tenkai cheats on Jiro is interesting and has a kind of "Hamlet" feel to it. There is also a sweet irony in the fact that if Tenkai had not managed to get Jiro to become a shinobi, I do not think he could have killed him in the end (maybe with guns, but not with hand-to-hand combat weapons). <br /> <br /> The plot with all the death makes it mostly very dark, but there are some moments of light when we see some of Jiros's childhood memories. In general, it is a good argument, dark and intricate. <br /> <br /> THE MUSIC: The opening theme, for example, is very good with the electric guitar and the drums. Occasionally, in that piece they use what I think are the taiko drums, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of good music. Like the one they played while traveling to the Iga shinobi. I think the piece is called "Numatou" and it has an incredible flute. The flute can be a pan flute, but more likely a shakuhachi. <br /> <br /> The final theme "Kamui no komoriuta" is calm and delicate. The voices are beautiful and so is the song in general. <br /> <br /> THE ANIMATION: <br /> <br /> The animation, although it is good, is not perfect and the blood that runs through the characters sometimes does it. They seem to be orange. The transitions are interesting and I think some are very nice. An example of a good transition is when Jiro and the Iga shinobi are running, there is a sunset in the background and the music is playing. The transition is simple, but effective and also has a good feeling. <br /> <br /> MY FINAL WORDS: I think the plot, the animation, the music and the characters make this one of the best anime movies.
