Nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 2004 Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to meet his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited work, unpaid debts and three separate families who lived at a distance of a few kilometers. <br /> <br /> My architect follows Kahn's life through a chronological examination of his buildings, and interspersing his beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius. Like the son Lou never acknowledged publicly during his life, Nate has delicately placed himself in the story without dominating the main focus. <br /> <br /> While examining the magnificent Salk Institute in California, Nate evokes the mythical use of space and light from his father in his buildings, which makes it a peaceful and fascinating experience for viewers. The photo of Nate skating on Salk's white and smoky central meeting place emphasizes the harmony of the building with nature. It's impressive. My architect also covers the difficulty Louis Kahn had for his designs to be accepted. Several fantastic buildings exist only on paper, dismissed by more practical architects and real estate developers. It was not until Louis Kahn left to the east that his visions were embraced with enthusiasm. In India, where he built the Institute of Management <br /> <br /> of India, a former co-worker describes him as a guru. In Bhangladesh, where he built the magnificent building of the National Assembly, citizens consider him a father of democracy. <br /> <br /> Looking at my architect is a wonderful way to start or continue learning about architecture and the importance of space. But it is the irony of Lou Kahn's selfishness combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you. 4 stars.
