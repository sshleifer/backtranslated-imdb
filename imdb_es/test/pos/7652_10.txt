My girls 4 and 6 love this show. We run into him at a PBS station and they always ask when it's on now. He reminds them of his grandmother who takes care of them every day in summer. It is also funny and, sometimes, they can not stop talking about one scene or another. I would definitely recommend this show to all the little kids. It is very clean and shows you that you slow down and it's not about watching TV all day. When Nana reads a story, she is slow and talks about each page with Mona. It reminds me to slow down when I read the next book to my daughters at the time of going to bed and I talk about the book instead of reading it quickly so that they fall asleep.
