Having grown up with GWTW, I rejected both the sequel to "Scarlett" and the miniseries so far. When I recently saw the video for the first time, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed watching the performance of Timothy Dalton by Rhett Butler and Joanne Walley-Kilmer as Scarlet. I feel that "Scarlet" should be judged on its own merits instead of attempting any comparison with the venerable masterpiece Selznick GWTW. While the "Scarlet" storyline and part of the dialogue suffered from lack of inspired writing, I generally thought this was a valuable dramatization of what could have been between Scarlett and Rhett.
