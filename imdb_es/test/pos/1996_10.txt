This movie is the most impressive Turkish film I've ever seen. Probably "Okul" is the first Turkish horror movie. I must say that I was thrilled to see the movie because of some reasons. The first reason is that the story is impressive, I mean that at the end of the film he realized all the details about the film, this makes the film attractive and Another reason is that no Turkish man made a movie like that before. This shows that the Turkish film is improved over time. Although it was the first test to make a horror movie, it was really successful. I advise everyone not to miss this movie ...
