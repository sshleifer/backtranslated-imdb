Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. Although his background was mainly comedy, it shows that he can make the drama equal or even better (although there is a lot of humor in this). It's hard to ignore his American accent, especially since his character is supposed to be English, but that's a bit less. <br /> <br /> All the villains are equally good: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O 'Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Although most of them are small or giant people, they are 100% credible in everything they do and their motivations are very clear, for example the incessant suspicion of the Lilliputians about Gulliver, Grildrig the hatred of the dwarf (giant) towards He for having usurped his position as court jester, Dr. Bates's attempt to get Gulliver crazy so he can marry Mary. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen is great as Mary Gulliver (another seventeenth-century English character with an American accent, but it does not matter). She is a deeply tormented character because she has been waiting for her husband to return home for nine years and, when she finally does, she is talking about tiny people, giants, a flying island and talking horses! Mary, despite the strong fantasy element in the story, is a very credible character. <br /> <br /> The special effects are impressive, especially when you consider that it was filmed on a television scale at a time when CGI was in its infancy. It seems very realistic when we see a 6-foot-tall man walking through a city full of people who are 6 inches tall. <br /> <br /> Cameos are also great: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All the great actors that create a strong supporting cast that complements Danson's excellent acting ability. <br /> <br /> The Houynhnhms and the Yahoos are probably the most effective element in history on the satire side: a society of talking horses. those who do not possess any of the vices that humans have, while the Yahoos are primitive, disgusting humans who mate with force and designate their leader depending on how disgusting it is. The study of Gulliver and Mistress on them is also very well done and shows the differences and similarities between humans and Yahoos. <br /> <br /> The best version of "Gulliver's Travels" by far and one of the best mini-series of all time. .
