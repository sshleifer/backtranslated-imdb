A hilarious comedy by the best director in history, Oz Scott. The list of television icons of the eighties goes on and on. Milano (Who's The Boss), Yothers (Family Ties), Stone (Mr. Belvedere), Robinson (Night Court), Jackee (227), D'abo (Wonder Years), Walston (Mr. Hand!). It's one of the funniest movies in history. Big lines, subplots without sense, cheesy, bad performance. This is a group of high school children who need to pass the driving test. Night Court Mac needs them to pass their final exam, or they will be fired. Great performance by Brian Bloom as the silly / cool guy from Riko Conner, but it's nothing compared to B.D. Kiki de Wong (pronounced kee-chee). A great movie for all ages, so bad that it's good.
