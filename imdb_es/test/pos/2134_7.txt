This great movie never appeared in my city, so I did not really have the opportunity to see it until the late 80's when I saw it on German television. I expected something like a disaster and, instead, I found a well-operated grand western with an excellent location job. The tiny tube really could not hurt it and there is hardly a dull moment in this 4 hour movie, so I hope to see it again on the big screen. What a spectacle that would be! Do not miss it, if you ever have the opportunity. Unfortunately, the harsh treatment of "Heaven's Gate" in its opening ruined the career of Michael Cimino and moved from the passable ("Year of the Dragon") to the boringly ridiculous ("The Sicilian") and squeaky fools (" Desperate Hours "). .
