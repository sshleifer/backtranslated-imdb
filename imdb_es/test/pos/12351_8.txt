The multiplied and strangely melted name, "One Dark Night," also known as "Mausoleum," is one of the best horror video rentals. Original and quite crude, we met briefly with Adam West in this film about telekinesis and head games for teenagers. Meg "Tilly" dared to spend the night in a crypt for "The Sisters", a high school gang of hairstylists in blue satin jackets. The initiation is interrupted by the recently buried body of a psychic mass murderer magician called "Raymar". Surprisingly amazing effects of make-up and fright paints this chilling film with style and offers a poignant climax.
