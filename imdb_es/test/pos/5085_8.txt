Some people think that this was a pretty bad television series, with cheesy effects. (considering that it was filmed between 1977 and 1979) but, in fact, it reviews those years and thinks: "We did not have computers at that time". So if you think about it, it's a good television series. <br /> <br /> I always thought that negative ratings killed the program, but no. The network did it. They canceled their theme as "The network of superheroes" and abandoned a short series of spider-man. if it had continued, it would probably have performed well in the 80s, and if it had been very lucky (and I mean a lot of luck), in the early 90's. <br /> <br /> And nobody wanted to choose this series up . <br /> <br /> Anyway, Jolly, the old (or young) Nicholas Hammond of The Sound of Music, takes to the TV screen as Peter Parker, the secret identity of the amazing spiderman. Throughout the series, Peter deals with a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country and a corrupt politician. <br /> <br /> while the series is outside the timeline (since Peter already graduated from college, and that's when he's bitten, and Uncle Ben is already dead,) The audience is treated with the action, the suspense and the attitude that the characters have towards Peter and his alter ego, Spider-Man. <br /> <br /> While it's also a bit disappointing that Robert. F Simon is nothing like JJJameson, it's not so disappointing that Betty Grant is not Betty Grant, but an African-American girl (who reminds me of Halle Berry, who is one of the most attractive women on the planet). One was not so bad. <br /> <br /> but considering the time and amount of drama that they accumulated in this, it is a kind of harbinger of how bad television is today. Either way, it's entertaining, even for today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
