"Haggard: The Movie" is well written, well directed and well acted. There are many moments of laughter to laughter and some fantastic skateboarding scenes with Margera. The scenes from West Chester, Pennsylvania, were beautifully recorded and the script is quite fun. What I like about the movie is that, instead of being another sappy love story or another version of "Jackass," it takes a dark and funny look at the breakouts from a different perspective. The majority of the films of rupture present a naive woman confused by a deceptive man. Then he goes to find Mr. Right and tells his former cheat to get lost. This movie takes a look at the emotional roller coaster of a leaning man ... without taking himself too seriously. Ryan Dunn does an excellent job as the abandoned man and with Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo as your best friends trying to help you in this difficult time, how can you take something seriously? It is obvious that Margera and company have an incredible talent both behind and in front of the camera. I look forward to your future films and efforts.
