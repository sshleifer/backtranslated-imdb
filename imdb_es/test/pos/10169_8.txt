Alfred Hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own British film of 1934, "The man who knew too much". This 1956 version of the same story is much lighter than the previous one. Mr. Hitchcock was fortunate to have collaborators who accompanied him from one film to another, thus maintaining a standard in his work. Robert Burks did an excellent job with cinematography and the George Tomasini edition shows his talent. Ultimately, Bernard Herrmann is seen directing at the magnificent Royal Albert Hall in London at the climax of the image. <br /> <br /> James Stewart was an actor who worked well with Mr. Hitchcock. In this version, he plays an Indiana doctor on vacation with his wife and son. When we meet him, they head to Marrakesh on a local bus and the intrigue begins. His wife is the adorable Doris Day at her best. She had been a well-known singer before her marriage and is now the perfect wife and mother. The film has a good supporting cast, Brenda DeBanzie, Bernard Miles, Daniel Gelin, Alan Mowbray, among others, do a great job of portraying their characters. <br /> <br /> Although this is a "light Hitchcock", one I can not dismiss as a failure. "The man who knew too much" is a change of pace for Hitchcock fans.
