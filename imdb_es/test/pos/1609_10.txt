History of a strange love and a desire to fall. Poem about beauty and its perfection, fear and touch. A slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And an agonizing venice. I do not know if it is a masterpiece, a poem or the reflection of the world of a film director. It is, absolutely, a "memento mori". And an exploration of the illusion. An old mirror of limits, signs and delicacy of death. A trip in an old space, nostalgic, cruel and splendid. "Death" is a copy of Orfeu's journey in the immediate reality. And the essence is music. A soft and sweet music, like honey or winter fire. Like all repentance and every pain. As a refuge in deep solitude. Gustav is gay by accident. He is the investigator of the last form of God's presence. Beauty, that beauty that gives meaning to life, that is sin and virtue at the same time, the gift of expectations and sufferings. He dies because he has the right to hope, to believe in the reality of the miracle and on his way. A victim? No way! Only Tadzio can give freedom as an insignificant sacrifice. Who saw that the sun can expect to live in the same conditions?
