The Blind Spot images are great. The action attracts you completely, although the film is a bit long. In the end, the credits you can think about are the positive points of the movie. The main actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heartbreaking. The score of the movie is very underestimated. Completely moving in its own powerful form. It is not your standard melodramatic signal. The moments of trance add a poetic resonance to the fascinating narration and the incredible visual compositions. I hope you have the opportunity to see this movie. Go deeper into a dark territory, but you leave the tunnel without seeing anything but white light.
