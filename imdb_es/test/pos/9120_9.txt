I just saw him in the closing film of the Austin Film Festival. Upon entering, he had seen some fragments of his performance at Alamo Drafthouse, and thought the trailer was fun, but he did not expect such epic music and the use of tarot cards is great in the title sequence. Beware of the cameos of Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins, and with the dark lord (who has a fetish for KG). So much exaggerated fun and the songs are so catchy. The car chase was by far my favorite scene. I know this will gain cult status immediately and win some new Tenacious D fans, like me. I hope they do well in theaters. "Follow me, we are the shadows"
