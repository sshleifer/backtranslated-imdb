Viva La Bam was one of those programs in which I did not have many expectations, before seeing it, and I never knew it until I saw it to my friend. I thought Jackass was very funny, but the tricks were just that, funny and I never really got into the show. When I saw Viva La Bam for the first time the totally opposite effect, I loved it. I had more of a TV show feel, which many of the "Reality Shows" have today. I was hooked and wanted to see what new scheme they were going to prepare for each episode. All the way to the last episode, I was interested and, although some of the ideas seemed repeated, it always had a newer and funr touch. Viva La Bam is one of those programs that hook you and I still have to see another program that is like this.
