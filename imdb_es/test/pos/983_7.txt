Okay, I'll admit that if I did not have children, I would never have seen this movie and I would never see it. But, considering all the rotten children movies I've seen (like SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG IN THE CITY), this is a significant improvement. And, I had enough to not be totally bored with my skull or contemplate suicide (something I did repeatedly in the other two films). Sure, the performances are quite broad and the plot is a bit silly, but it's a movie for children. And, compared to other movies of the genre, this is definitely better than average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines seem to have some talent and will probably continue to have careers after puberty, at least in infomercials or voice-overs. <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you are looking for a movie for Mira with your children, you could certainly do much worse!
