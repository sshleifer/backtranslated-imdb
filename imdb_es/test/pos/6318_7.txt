One of the most significant quotes of the entire film is pronounced halfway by the protagonist, the middle-aged mafia, Titta Di Girolamo, a physically indescribable middle-aged man, originally from Salerno, in southern Italy. When we were introduced to him at the beginning of the film, he has been living a life of no-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the past ten years, running a business to which we are gradually introduced. . While this pivotal scene, though seemingly uncomplicated, takes place, Swiss bank employees who normally count Di Girolamo's money tell him that they are missing $ 10,000 from their usual suitcase full of well-stacked bank notes. In the news, he silently but coldly threatens his inciting bank manager to want to close his account. Meanwhile, he tells viewers that when you bluff, you have to lie to the end without fear of being caught or looking ridiculous. He says: you can not bluff for a while and then in the middle, tell the truth. Having finally done this, cheated only halfway and telling the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and, ultimately, love, is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's problems. <br /> <br /> This initially unfriendly character, a sullen, taciturn and dry man on the brink of 50 years, a man who does not even respond to the waitresses and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes a point Someone at that the viewer cares deeply. In a moment of his non-life, Titta decides to be worried about appearing "ridiculous". The first half of the film can be described as "slow" by some. In fact, it reveals the days and nights of Di Girolamo in that hotel at a strangely distant and deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may seem unnecessary reveal how important they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man without imagination, identity or life, the unfriendly character that you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling when you least thought you would - is also transmitted with elegantly edited sequences and a very interesting use of music (one highlighted especially the theme of the Scottish band Boards of Canada. <br /> <br /> It was never the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mafiosi more at odds than since the release of films like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the insomnia of the protagonist, not unlike The Machinist (and in a much more explicit way, the film by Al Pacino on insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell 'Amore uses this condition to symbolize a deeper emotional discomfort that has been rammed so deeply into the darkness of the unconscious, that it is almost impossible to point its cause (if there is one). <br /> <br /> The young and friendly hotel waitress Sofía (played by Olivia Magnani, granddaughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man she has not seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provides a small window to life that Titta finally (although tentatively at first) accepts to look again. Although it is never explained explicitly, the viewer KNOWS that for a man like Titta, accepting The consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that develops in its own time and does not grant anything to the expectations of the spectator, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is an excellent representative of that small, discreet and discreet Renaissance that has had place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino style dishes, more La Vita è Bella-style films ... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, world.
