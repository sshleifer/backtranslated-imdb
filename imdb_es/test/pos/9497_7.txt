I found this film full of irony. But watching the movie you can almost see what will happen. Leila is a confused and bored housewife, constantly looking for happiness. When he believes he finds true happiness, he clings to it, leaving behind everything he knew. But she finds herself almost comparing notes between her ex and her current husband. She learned that if she had only communicated more about what had bothered her in her previous marriage, she could have saved herself much more easily than she intended. He realizes that words are nothing without action, but he learns too much in his second marriage and finds himself looking back and waiting once again for the change. The main conflict in this movie is Leila vs. herself. You can not have true happiness without being truly happy. I liked this movie, but I would only recommend this movie to women, I can not see a man who really enjoys this movie.
