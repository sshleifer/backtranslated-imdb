Well, I must say that I had the opportunity to see this show here in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sometime June 6. And I really loved it. My favorite Madonna look was the era of the 1990 Blond Ambition tour. For me it is "MADONNA" Now that she is the mother of 3 children, she has to change some things to adapt to motherhood. And I totally agree. This is a classic Madonna concert. I wish that "Live to Tell" has not been edited. We saw how the body fell from the buildings. in 911, we can see a woman on a cross ... in any way, I look forward to the release of this tour on DVD and I hope it is the whole program without editing and with a lot of additional material. She is an artist of all time. the best that exists ... and even at the top and with strength. Viva MADONNA!
