The joy and tragedy of the Christmas season lies in the fact that it revolves mainly around the family. That is why some people call it "children's holidays". As we get older, natural wear and tear will eliminate the people and things that gave us our special memories. John Denver, in one of his sweetest roles, plays George Billings, a successful New York architect and a new widower who lost his wife about a year before. His life focuses on his 9-year-old daughter, Alex; Both continue to suffer their loss. George is doing everything he can to make this a special Christmas for his daughter. Enter your boss, Thomas Renfield (mischievously played by the wonderful Col. Flagg of M * A * S * H, Edward Winters), who sends George to Georgetown, CO to explore a possible real estate deal. When lying to her daughter that the purpose of the trip is to spend the holidays instead of work, George and Alex fly to the city, where they immediately meet with a collection of amorous groups of characters, somewhat eccentric, whose main eccentricity is that all believe in santa claus Georgetown is a community of picture books in which we would all love to live and we would love people for their neighbors. George soon finds a love interest in Susan (Jane Kazmarek.) If it were not for the grinch (Renfield), it would be an ideal time. But the fact is that he's in the city to find a property that Renfield can develop, and there's a nice ranch near the city about to be executed, and the dark edges of the movie revolve around imminent foreclosure and foreclosures. reactions of the inhabitants of the city. rancher, and outsiders. I will not spoil the end for those who have never seen the film. It is a typical happy Christmas ending, but it is handled in a very subtle and believable way that shows the best in the human spirit without being too sweet. All in all, this is the most pleasant way to spend a couple of hours of TV at Christmas. John Denver and Jane Kazmarek have good chemistry and Gennie James as Alex does a good job. I've always loved the work of Mary Wickes, an actress with recognizable characters, and all the other cast members do a good job with less fleshy parts. This is a regular Christmas rate for my family; I rate it 4/5.
