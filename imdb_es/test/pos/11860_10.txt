The first time I saw this movie was at a premiere party in Fredrikstad, hometown of Mr. Zwarts. There, among directors, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities, I laughed and laughed ... I just could not stop. If you like a comedy with black humor, sharp lines and an excellent performance, this is a movie you MUST see! It's like mixing "True Romance" with "The Wedding Singer" and adding a touch of "Mad about you" Hilarios! <br /> <br /> 10 points!
