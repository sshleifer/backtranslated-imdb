The dramatization of Oscar Wilde's only novel, by playwright John Osborne (Look Back in Anger, The Entertainer), delights in the homosexual subtext of the original, perhaps too much. However, the dialogue, the performance, with a cast led by Sir John Gielgud and Jeremy Brett, and the brilliant brain production (marked only by a "too fast" ending) make it worth the time of any theater lover, with a capital "T".
