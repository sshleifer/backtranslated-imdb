Dogtown and Z-Boys <br /> <br /> Summary: Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers who changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice (Dogtown), California, as we know it today. With their low turn style, they embarked on a journey influenced by Larry Bertlemen that would lead to countless successes and couple failures. After the Dogtown items appeared in a reincorporated Skateboarder magazine, the sport was renewed and members of the Zephyr skateboarding team forgot about Jeff Ho, and seemed to be on summer vacation for the rest of their lives when joining other teams of skateboards that could afford to pay them like movie stars. The original team of Zephyr Skateboard Team, composed by Jeff Ho (owner of Zephyr Surfshop) and Craig Stecyk (photographer) included Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantineau, Jim Muir, Peggy Oki (only women), Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV, Allen Sarlo and David Ray Perry. All the original members, except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill, are still good and surfing / skating. Jay Adams, at the time of the documentary, was serving time on drug charges. Chris Cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in Mexico. <br /> <br /> Topics: The themes of this documentary are a kind of reading between the lines, but if there was a clear The theme would be that even children can provoke revolutions. Other issues that include a long party in the past can lead to an unsatisfactory future, and by planning and taking care of one's assets, a very rewarding future may be available. <br /> <br /> Other works: Stacy Peralta (Writer and Director) has a wide range of documentaries that she has written, produced or directed. Most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as Riding Giants, Sk8 TV, The Bones Brigrades and Lords of Dogtown. He has also made films with the theme of growing in the United States when he was a teenager, such as: Influences: from yesterday to today, Crips and Bloods: Made in America and The 70s: The Decade that Changed Television. <br /> <br /> Themes: The themes of Dogtown and Z-boys are the original members of the Zephyr Skateboard Team, except Chris Cahill. Peralta included Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk in the interviews. Other subjects were people who grew up during the 70s reading Dogtown articles, as well as skateboard enthusiasts. Skaters from the Dogtown area, but not on the team were interviewed. <br /> <br /> Edition: The editing of this movie was phenomenal in my opinion. There were scenes of the subjects speaking so that the audience could see who was speaking and have an idea of ​​the character, but they would cut immediately to the archive images that would explain what the speaker was saying. When a song could better explain the emotions of the subjects, as when the unfortunate life of Jay Adams was a topic of conversation, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, evoking many emotions. Sean Penn was the narrator of the film and explained the transitions throughout the film. The film was presented chronologically from the moment the Zephyr surf team was assembled to create the skateboarding team until all the Z-boys left the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: The film was filmed in an interesting way. The film of the subjects who spoke was in black and white and all the file images of the Z-Boys surfing or skating in color. Of course, the images of the 70s were grainy, but that only improved the film. Most of the interviewees were shot in the same area as it seems, but they were all outside. All the images were very well controlled, including the archive images, which I found very surprising. <br /> <br /> Music: "Seasons of Wither" - Made by Aerosmith "Toys in the Attic" - Made by Aerosmith "Generation Landslide" - Alice Cooper "One Way Out" - Performed by The Allman Brothers "Lollipops and Roses "and" Whipped Cream "-made up by Herb Alpert" Into the Void "and" Paranoid "- performed by Black Sabbath" Godzilla "- Blue Oyster Cult" Aladdin Sane "and" Rebel Rebel "- David Bowie" Fastcars "- The Buzzcocks "Gut Feeling" - Devo "I'll give you money" - Peter Frampton "Funk 49" - James Gang "Ezy Rider" and "Foxy Lady" and "Freedom" and "Bold as Love" - ​​Jimi Hendrix "Sidewalk Surfing" - Jan and Dean "Achilles Last Stand" and "Hot on for Nowhere" - Led Zeppelin "Six Underground" - The "Surfrider" sneakers - The Lively On "Cat Scratch Fever" and "Motor City Madhouse" and "Wang Dang Sweet Poontang- Ted Nugent "We and They" - Pink Floyd "Bad Boys" - The Pretenders "Maggie May" - Rod Stewart "I Want to Be Your Dog" and "Give Me Danger" - The Stooges "The Children of the revolution "- T -Rex" Bad Reputa "- Thin Lizzy" Inferno Disc "- The hobo" Hannah "- Rob Trower" Rocky Mountain Way "- Joe Walsh" Old Man "- Neil Young" La Grange "- ZZ Top <br /> <br /> The music In the movie they make the movie. Each of these songs contributes to what the subjects are saying and evokes emotions that otherwise would not have been remembered.
