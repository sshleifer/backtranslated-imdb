The dirty Harry goes to Atlanta is what Burt called this fantastic first class detective thriller that borrows part of his plot from the venerable Dana Andrews movie "Laura". Burt Reynolds not only stars in this magnificent saga, but also did it and does not make a single mistake in the staging of the action or casting characters. It's not a bad performance in the movie and Reynolds does an excellent job of directing it. Henry Silva is really cold as a hit man. <br /> <br /> Detective Tom Sharky (Burt Reynolds) is in a case of narcotics in the Atlanta underground area when everything goes wrong. He ends up chasing a suspect and shooting with the gunman on a bus. During the tumult, an innocent bystander dies. "The Killer" by John Woo replicates this scene. Anyway, the Atlanta Police Department rejects Burt to be Vice and he receives orders from a new boss, Frisco (Charles Durning from "Oh, brother, where are you?") In the basement. Sharky ends up in a real crime puddle. Sharky and his fellow detectives Arch (Bernie Casey) and Papa (Brian Keith) set up the surveillance of a high-priced prostitute, Dominoe (Rachel Ward, from "After Dark, My Sweet") who has a luxurious apartment she shares with another girl . . <br /> <br /> Dominoe is watching a local politician Hotchkins (Earl Holliman from "Police Woman") on the side who is campaigning for the governor, but the main villain, Victor (Vittorio Gassman from "The Dirty Game ") He wants the end of the matter. Hotchkins is reluctant to accommodate Victor, so Victor has cocaine inhaling Billy Score (Henry Silva's "Wipeout") ends with Dominoe. Billy makes a hole about the size of a twelve-inch pizza on the door of Dominoe's apartment and kills it. <br /> <br /> Sharky has done the unthinkable. During the surveillance, he has grown fond of Dominoe to the point that he becomes hopelessly insane with her. Sharky's mission in life now is to overthrow Victor, but he finds out that Victor has an informant inside the Atlanta Police Department. The plot really heats up when Sharky discovers later that Billy shot the wrong girl and that Dominoe is still alive! Sharky takes her into protective custody and things get even more complicated. Assemble your "Machine" title to deal with Victor and his hoods. <br /> <br /> The panoramic lens of William Fraker's action is impeccable. Unfortunately, this much-understated classic is available only as a full-frame movie. Fraker definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the image, especially during the scene of mutilation in the boat when the villain cut off one of Sharky's fingers. This is a pretty scary scene. <br /> <br /> Burt never made a film that surpassed "Sharky's Machine".
