A well written script. A moving story that shows the best of the middle class of English. A great performance by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of the best actors in Britain. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress with whom she was not familiar, but to her credit she does a great job playing the wife of ******* The director, Julian Fellowes, did not succumb to the typical Hollywood tricks to give the movie a meaty plot. He has not dramatized his portrait of the English middle class. The rhythm of the films does not waver, although it is not a film face to face. A good twist in the plot, which is not predictable. A lovely English rural village setting. I enjoyed this movie very much. The locations were also very well selected. If you like movies about relationships, this is one to watch. Better to have some handkerchiefs ready!
