Florence Vidor plays the daughter of a strict librarian father who kicks her out of the house when gossip taints her name. In the big city, he finds the dying wife of his own brother (the two had secretly married) and raises his son on his own. Years later, he returns home to face his family. <br /> <br /> This old melodrama is full of fascinating feminist themes (around 1921, but sounds remarkably modern). Some of that is done with a palette (like the father, Theodore Roberts gives his eyebrows a real exercise), but it is well composed in a dramatic and loving way, composed by the cinematographer Henry Sharp.
