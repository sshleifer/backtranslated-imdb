I do not say anything new when I say that "Ray" was magnificent. As I go on to praise this movie, I must mention something that differentiates it from other movies. Very rarely is a film made entirely by the actor (s). "Ray" was simply made by Jamie Foxx. Without the wonderful performance of Jamie Foxx, "Ray" would be another interesting and informative biopic. I always thought that Foxx was funny, from his days with "In Livin 'Color" and "The Jamie Foxx Show", and he also knew that he had talent, since he used his own program ("The Jamie Foxx Show") to show his talents But I never imagined that I could achieve a role like this. I do not know much about acting and what they go through to get into character or other things like that, but what I saw of Jamie Foxx was extremely impressive. He wrapped himself in that role and made us see Ray Charles instead of an actor who played Ray Charles. The story of "Ray" was great, yes, but Jamie Foxx gave it life.
