I was very impressed with Mick Molloy's latest production. As a fan of his, he was used to a different mood from the one shown here. He wisely opted for a more subtle and subtle style of comedy in Crackerjack, rather than his usual low-key wandering. It is, at times, inconsistent and irregular, but a decent script works beyond that, and makes it an entertaining visualization. Directed by Paul Moloney (who has directed almost every Australian television series imaginable), Crackerjack tells the story of Jack Simpson, a guy who belongs to his local club of bowls for the sole reason of parking. When the club has financial problems, it is forced to play competitively in an attempt to raise funds to prevent the club from becoming a haven for poker machines. A familiar and successful formula, which is handled well. There is no denying that the film owes its success to Molloy's great casting. He seemed to have a great relationship with Samuel Johnson and excellent chemistry with Judith Lucy, and although the character is probably not very far from his own personality, he can not help but wonder why he did not try his arm in the movie. earlier. To smooth the cast experienced, the charming Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter are compatible, and often steal their scenes. They are two excellent actors and the couple crosses their roles with ease. If it had not been for the great success of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding', Crackerjack would have reached number 1 in the Australian box office, but when you consider what your film is about and who is involved, you have even reached number 2 was an outstanding effort In short, an ingenious and well-being film. Great cast, great team and great soundtrack combine to make one of the best Australian films of 2002. 7/10.
