The basic premise of Flatliners is quite simple. Several medical students are about to die to discover exactly what the brain does during the process. It sounds like something a crowd of bored students would do for a joke, but it forms the basis of some very scary substations. In today's world, where Hollywood has to exploit foreign markets for ideas to make a horror movie, Flatliners is one of those weird gems that show that Hollywood can do something different when it tries hard enough. <br /> <br /> What separates Flatliners from many movies based on this premise that would come out today is that it is not inclined to be condescending or arrogant. Flatliners recognizes that people go to the movies to entertain themselves, not to moralize. In this kind of supernatural thriller, the difference that this moderation makes is really incredible. What is even more incredible is that Julia Roberts appears without being annoying or showing that she can only play Julia Roberts. The theory of the dark, that the performers do their best work with the smallest public, is valid here. <br /> <br /> Secondary arguments about what the characters find during their loss of almost everything that makes them alive, and how they re-meddle in their present time, do surprisingly well. The moments in which the character of William Baldwin finds that his personal collection of videotapes returns to torment him are especially intriguing. That William Baldwin seems so perfect on paper says a lot about the script or direction. I'm not sure which one. <br /> <br /> Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, really shines as the protagonist. One really feels for him as the mystery of what the experience of the past is intruding on the present and why it develops. As the character of Kevin Bacon looks for an old-school dock whose life made hell and tells him how much he feels, it becomes clearer what the movie is about. We can try to change the past as much as we want, but what matters most is what we do with the present. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the Flatliners is how it achieves an atmosphere without the use of expensive ones. Elaborate visual effects. Very unusually for what is essentially a horror movie, Flatliners did not spend their budget in places where they did not need it. Much of what we see during the most surreal sequences is a case of professional simulation, simple trick photography or archival footage. Sometimes, the simplest things are the best. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the movie, it feels like ten minutes too short. The ending seems more superficial than conclusive, as if someone in the studio asked the director to wrap the film in order to publish it at a certain moment in the market. Of course, many movies have been left with pain points for this very reason, so Flatliners should not really be different. The one hundred and fifteen minutes that we obtain are very satisfactory, although not too bright. <br /> <br /> I gave the Flatliners a seven out of ten. It works well as a dating movie or a kind of popcorn movie late at night. Apart from that, it's a good reminder that low-budget horror shows were not always sad pieces of trash.
