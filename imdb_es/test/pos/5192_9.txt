I found the film very real as much as Saving Private Ryan and gave an account in advance from the German perspective. The graphic action and the individual characters gave this movie a lot to keep me interested throughout the film. Stalingrad was a very brutal battle and the scenes gave this film the stark reality of this battle. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in military history. This was the second time I saw this movie in a few years and I was captivated again by the realism. Weapons, uniforms and listening to him in German while reading the subtitles gave him a lot of credit for a good military movie. In fact, this was a German perspective of the battle, it was encouraging the Germans, even though they were the aggressor and the last loser of the war.
