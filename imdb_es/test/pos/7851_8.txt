I was surprised by this early performance by Clint Eastwood. I had not read a summary of the film, when I decided to watch it on television. Because of Mr. Eastwood, I was expecting some nice shots and no deep story. I was quite wrong. I found a couple of topics unusually explicitly addressed, and until the end, I could not decide on who is good and who is bad. This movie is definitely not the typical Eastwood, but it's probably worth watching.
