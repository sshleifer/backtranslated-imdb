I can not disagree with a previous comment that "Driving Lessons" is more than a little twee, but the accusation of one man is the support of another, I suppose. In my book, this movie has a great charm, it is not a small thing in itself. <br /> <br /> I can not help but wish that the story was a little less conventional given the amount of talent that acts on it, but by the End the plot seems rather a backdrop for the interactions of the characters . Dame Evie by Julie Walters is a gloriously glorious actress at the top and on the hill. Although Evie has not had a stable job in years, it is not clear the last time she visited reality, if ever (think Edina of "AbFab" at age 65, at a time when she is even forced to deal with their kitsch factor). Some may find it annoying, but I think that's the point, to emphasize how much he presses Ben's reserved buttons (Rupert Grint) to force him out of his shell. Ben is equally isolated from reality, living all his life under the thumb of his overly dependent mother, whom Laura Linney manages to give life to, despite being a fairly one-dimensional character (the old and religious dominant mother). I was quite impressed by the fact that Rupert Grint, whom I met to give a very honest and credible performance (not to mention how sweet everything is), I can not think of many teenage actors of which I can say that. <Br /> <br /> The heart of the film is what happens when the worlds of Ben and Evie collide. At first, Ben is understandably hesitant, but also intrigued, since Evie is essentially the opposite of everything he has ever known. With the combination of Evie's persistence and Ben's helpful nature, a genuine sweetness develops between them, culminating in an unlikely road trip that gives Ben his first true taste of independence. <br /> <br /> The tone is always light even through some brief melodramatic fragments, but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance, a credit for the main actors. In general, I would say that if you are willing to relax and be seduced by some beautiful performances, "Driving Lessons" should not disappoint. However, if "cute" is not in the vocabulary of your movie, it is better to stay away. <br /> <br /> Another note of minor importance, the soundtrack presents the music of Sufjan Stevens prominently, a nice touch.
