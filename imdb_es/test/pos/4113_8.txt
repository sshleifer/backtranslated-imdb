While the songs and dance numbers, in general, are not as strong as many would, the story and the message of the film are still there and sound loudly above the simple musical numbers of the 70s. <Br / > <br /> Considering that this movie was made after Hollywood Musical had almost become extinct (with few exceptions such as rock musicals), the audience that went to see it as new did not appreciate the fact that it was a brave attempt of something that had not been done to date. Audiences who see him today will tend to judge him compared to today's movies and musicals and, perhaps, the huge series of past-star musicals. But doing that with this movie, or with anything else, is an injustice to the movie itself. <br /> <br /> There are some good musical moments in the movie. The first is that of Bobby Van. Mr. Van took on his role as Harry Lovett just after closing a 2-year Tony nominated career (for the best actor) of the Broadway revival, "No, No, Nanette." He is a singer and dancer from a long time ago and, honestly, the only one in the cast who was truly talented and experienced for musicals. You never miss a step in your "Question me an answer" and rightly so ... I was totally at home like Harry. Olivia Hussey makes other nice numbers when she welcomes the new visitors and, although the lyrics are weak, James Shigeta shows his strong voice in the song "Family", as well as a very well made staging of the complete piece. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see what it is ... a fantasy about a place where it never grows old, hidden in the snow-covered mountains of Tibet, found by a group of unsuspecting people today. wrapped in the The struggle of any modern culture. Take this and compare it with reality and you will get a movie that does not reach a goal. But ... take this film for the message of love and peace and tranquility and brotherly love and you will get a warm and refreshing message and a positive one. <br /> <br /> For some, this movie may seem cheesy Other a welcome release from the hectic pace of reality. The first, try not to judge and simply enjoy the message. To the second, you have discovered the secret of Shangri-La!
