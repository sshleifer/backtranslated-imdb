Better than he has a right to be, this film had a quick and painful death at the American box office. Sometimes, dull, in others, scathingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde are mostly an almost perfect reflection of the times, full of drugs and sexual humor, which at one time or another remember everything Woody Allen says about " Everything You I always wanted to know about sex "to Mel Brooks from" The Producers ", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong. Look at it, listen carefully because some of the jokes go by very quickly and remember a time when the comedy was allowed to be offensively funny.
