An entire director's production that tells the story of the Emperor Qin's ambitious plan to unite all the kingdoms of China. Some great characters, sets, costumes and scenes. However, I was not impressed by the film in terms of the ability of the actors (which was good, I enjoyed the Marquis as much as possible) or its appearance (although the concentration of troops was extremely impressive, if it was a real man, that's a lot Additional features!). <br /> <br /> I've seen Li Gong in other movies and she's always great. I think it's a good period piece, but not one to judge the true historical accuracy of it. Good movie and I found that 2 1/2 hours or more is not a problem. <br /> <br /> Rating 7 of 10.
