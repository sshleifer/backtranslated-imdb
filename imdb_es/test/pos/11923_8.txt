It really is not worthy of a "best picture" consideration, but as entertainment, it does the job! This is one I've seen, with a pulse every time, at least a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done, and we can recognize them from other works. . Those who do not have a current name recognition probably do not want it. <br /> <br /> This was a fun ADVENTURE. Something like The Little Rascals if only they had to be serious.
