It is likely that this film is too sentimental for many viewers, especially for contemporary audiences. However, I enjoyed this film mainly thanks to the realistic charm of William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are some truly moving scenes between the couple and the talent of these two actors rescues what in minor hands could have been beaten lines. The Hong Kong cinematography of the filming period is another highlight of this film. In general, a romantic drama better than the average, 7/10.
