I have nothing but praise for this mini series. He's only a year and a half old, but I've seen him twice already; With greater enjoyment the second time than the first. I think seriously about seeing him again soon, since it seems spiritually uplifting. <br /> <br /> It is a very romantic romantic drama with such beautiful presentations, sets, costumes, music and scenes that it has a resonance that places it almost in a league of its own among the mini series. <br /> <br /> Some others have commented on the difficulties of living as a lesbian in Britain in the 1890s. Nothing particularly difficult about that; It was only male homosexuality that was against the law as poor Oscar Wilde experienced at great cost and as a great loss to the literary world. Anyway, I'm rambling. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the essential television. It is perhaps one of the greatest romantic dramatic dramas since Romeo and Juliet, although not in the conventional sense. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 of my part. <br /> <br /> VMY
