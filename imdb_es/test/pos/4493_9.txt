For those curious, this episode is based on the theme of the work of Pirandello, "Six characters in search of an author" and the work of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Without exit" (as indicated more obviously by its title), but, of course, with a twist of law. <br /> <br /> Five very different individuals are in a round room with no idea who they are more than the indication of their attire. A bell rings intermittently (perhaps also an allusion from Hemmingway?), Increasing the agony of his imprisonment. The newcomer to the group, a Major, is determined to escape, while the others are resigned to their destiny. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pirandello, these characters do not even have a story. They have nothing but the experience of the room in their consciousness, and no one can write their non-existent story, so their position is even more desperate than the characters in Pirandello's piece. Unlike Pirandello and Sartre, there is no relationship between the characters and, therefore, there is no real conflict between them, although the issue of personal responsibility versus apathy is prominent in this story. <br /> <br /> Although this differs significantly from the plot of the authors alluded to in the title, the themes of Sartre and Pirandello (and many other authors of the 20th century) appear with absolute clarity. This is, obviously, a piece that addresses the postmodernist perspective in the context of the Cold War era. There is also an emphasis on issues of personal insignificance. <br /> <br /> This is easily one of the best episodes I've seen, and still exceptionally relevant to the current experience (as are Sartre and Pirandello). Exactly what turns a good piece of writing into a classic.
