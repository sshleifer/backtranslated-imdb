I'm still waiting for years for a new DVD edition of this wonderful movie. I own a beta max recording with the FRENCH language. Unfortunately, MGM skips the track in French on its recent DVD ... Only in English, with French subtitles ... I do not know how to make MGM aware: I wrote emails to them but, of course, I have no answer. If I insist, it's because, exceptionally, the dubbing track in French was spectacular, fun, well written, etc. The performance of George C. Scott is always outstanding and, for people born like me during the 50s, Diana Rigg represents something very different from Madonna (for example). Thanks for helping ... Best regards ...
