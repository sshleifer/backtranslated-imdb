Personally, I LOVED THE TRIS MOVIE! My best friend told me, so I rented it and looked at it. It's amazing! Music, acting, story lines, emotion, everything ... well, except for a minor fact. Absolutely no loyalty to books at all. I watched this movie before Interview with the vampire and before I knew there were books, I was surprised to find out how many people really hated the movie. I quickly discovered that the book fans were not happy with the infidelity, that they did not want to be hypocrites (I hate the Harry Potter films due to the lack of loyalty to the books). I remained silent. Finally, I took "The Vampire Lestat" and understood immediately why everyone hated it. It's completely different (The movie The Queen of the Damned is a combination of "The Vampire Lestat" and "The Queen of the Damned"). But I still loved the movie when I saw it before reading any of the books. So if you have not seen this movie or read the book, watch the movie first or you will hate it. If you've read the book, you have every right to hate this movie.
