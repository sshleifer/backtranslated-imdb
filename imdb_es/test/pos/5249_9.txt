This is an extraordinarily musical movie. It made me feel bad that Rodrigues died in 1999, before I had the chance to see her live. To know that she did a wonderful Lincoln Ctr. Concert in 1991 and I could have been there, but it was not painful, beyond words. <br /> <br /> I just bought my first recording of Amalia. While the musical recording is fantastic, in this film, SEE this face and its tremendous expressiveness and passion while singing these songs of terrible sadness is wonderful. Something like seeing Mary's face while she cradles Jesus in her arms in Piety. When I saw her in a movie, she reminded me of having witnessed an extraordinary similar concert by Mercedes Sosa in the mid-1990s at Lincoln Ctr. As I listened to Mercedes sing, I felt that I was in the presence of a tremendous musical and spiritual force that contained an amazing primordial power. Some of the musical segments of "The Art of Amalia" are moving, like Caetano Veloso paying homage to Amalia and singing one of her solo songs in front of a packed concert hall. The musical segments also convey the incredible international sweep of their musical repertoire and the links that w. Fans all over the world There is a segment in which he states that he has played in every city in Italy that has a stage! <br /> <br /> In another section, Amalia talks about her fight w. mouth cancer and how he came to New York to commit suicide in a hotel. However, when watching videos of Fred Astaire's film, little by little she convinced herself that life was worth living and not committing suicide. Amazing! Later in the film, she admits quite bravely and directly to the interviewer that, although she could have conquered the world musically, her personal life was one of sadness. She admits that she has never been happy. This is unbearably sad to hear, but perfectly in consonance with w. a singer immersed in the tradition of fado (which she translates as "bad destiny" or "bad luck"). Also, one wants to hear more about her personal life: what made her feel so sad? What were your disappointments? <br /> <br /> "Amalia's art" is a little disappointing in other important areas. My questions: to show 20-30 full songs in the movie, but to provide only one English translation, the latter seems a waste (unless the film is only intended for a Portuguese-speaking audience, which I can not imagine). Seeing the deep pain in his face while singing and not understanding the lyrics is a disappointment. As for the other disadvantages: there is almost no biographical material about Amalia's family history. There is one 20 sec. fragment of code w. its singing w. his mother (she is absolutely great). There is a brief reference to his parents moving fr. The field to lisboa. I would have loved to see images of the town he came from. The interviews as they are are almost exclusively w. Amalia herself (and some close friends). She is a good one, but not a great subject. There are no subjects interviewed who are experts in fado or in Portuguese culture and society, so we do not understand in depth their musical roots. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a wonderful movie that everyone interested in Amalia should see. But it is not a perfect or definitive work on the subject.
