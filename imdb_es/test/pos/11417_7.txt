I liked this movie. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, so I could not comment on the similarities between this and other films of this genre, but I found this movie quite captivating. the story line, although a bit obvious, had some genuinely frightening / tense moments and the performance (particularly of the woman's main role) was not bad in any way. <br /> <br /> In general, I am a Little surprised by the low rating this film has achieved. I see many movies (working in a video store tends to help) and this really is not as bad as people seem to think. Although I have some criticism. The police officer's last call was terrible, almost exaggerated, the dead girl in the bathroom seemed to have a little sleep (probably because of the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank) and the children's reaction to what was happening instilled in me the idea . I hope they have finally been killed <br /> <br /> I hope this helps some people
