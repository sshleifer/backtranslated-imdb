It must be said that the director of The Cell, Tarsem Singh, has consolidated quite well with his first feature film, which is one of the most visually surprising films in contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> The Cell It's more of a visceral experience than a movie. Like a thriller, it rises above most of its peers, with competent editing and a chilling rating that provides an exceptionally suspenseful environment. However, ultimately, Tarsem's ability to design and image elaborate and disturbing scenarios is what conveys the film's sense of terror. <br /> <br /> As in several recent films, I have been struck by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have commented negatively on The Cell; In defense of the film, I will address some of these issues. The plot seems to be the main concern, and while it is not revolutionary and relies heavily on The Silence of the Lambs, it was never intended to be the most important aspect of the film; The plot itself is a vehicle through which the vision of Tarsem, both horrifying and wonderful, is presented to the public, in the same way that the plot of The Silence of the Lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of its two main characters . Lecter and Starling. Although the silence of the lambs is clearly the superior film, it is irrational for one to condemn the plot of the cell and, at the same time, to praise the silence of the lambs. <br /> <br /> My end The concern is the mention of the "MTV style" address. It hurts me to see the condemnation of the directors who use innovative camera and cinematography techniques. A camera has the potential to be much more than just a tool for recording events; The angles, the trays, the color adjustment, etc., are used in their entirety in The Cell with the purpose of creating the sensation of a dream state that otherwise could not have been achieved. This is essential for the film, since the whole premise behind this is the visualization of the subconscious of a serial killer. If you simply want a series of static shots, stick to the plays and leave the cinema altogether. <br /> <br /> That said, The Cell is completely entertaining, terrifying and impressive both in its pace and in its design. Anyone who is able to look beyond the script (perhaps without inspiration, but never bored) will find one of the best films of the year 2000.
