There's a small clever scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes the impromptu decision that Karen sing for the studio's owner. <br /> <br /> Richard is wrong. Key to Karen singing, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bewilderment on the owner's face; He believes that she really can not sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is the wonderful and beautiful voice of Karen, and the owner makes an invaluable double take. Well done! For some reason, I have never forgotten that scene. <br /> <br /> The story of Karen Carpenter tells the meteoric rise of carpenters and Karen's struggle to overcome anorexia. Many things are overlooked. This is not a documentary, and the movie left me with many questions. There is very little mention of Karen's solo adventure (the CD was released a few years ago.) If you buy it, you'll wonder why they waited, it's one of Karen's best works, songs are not as eternal as her work with her Brother Richard, but it was a great recording, in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I have heard that you may be listening to a small cheap radio in the middle of the Third World. That seems to produce more static than anything else. But when a Carpenter song appears on the radio, you might think you were listening to a $ 1000 hi-fi unit. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
