A surprisingly great caricature in the same league as Batman: TAS and his ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently I was able to see them all again, a great acting voice of Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only The complaint I had was that Rob Paulsons' voice seemed too old for the title character, but it was not a big problem since the stories were great, and the fact that everything has a great loop ending. Some people say that it was an escape, but I found it refreshing compared to many series that simply leave things in suspense. With luck, one day they released this series on DVD, unfortunately it came out at a time when DVDs were still not frequent and the caricature probably only served to sell a particular type of toy, which I never found attractive despite the entertaining caricature.
