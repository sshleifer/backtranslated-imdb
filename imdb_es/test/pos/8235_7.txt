During the Second World War, there were a lot of movies created by Hollywood and after seeing many of them, they begin to resemble each other. However, OVER 21 is unique in many ways, as it shows one side of the war that you will not see in other movies, which makes it worth seeing, even if you've seen other movie bazillions! <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the male lead, but the real protagonist of the film is Irene Dunne, who looks amazing for a 47-year-old woman (yes, I checked, she was really so old when she made the movie ). In OVER 21, the couple plays husband and wife. He enlists in the army, much to the dismay of his father (Charles Coburn) and owner of the newspaper where Knox works, and most of the film takes place when he is in the school of candidate officers. The film shows little of Knox at school, but instead focuses on Dunne, since she lives in nearby Spartan housing for wives. During this time, she (as the British say) maintains a "rigid upper lip" and makes the most of it, although in reality she is not a housewife but a famous professional writer. From time to time she receives very brief visits from her beleaguered husband, but most of the time she is dedicated to doing housewife tasks and keeping Coburn at bay. Finally, she decides to stop the annoying Coburn from calling without stopping (she ALWAYS complains that her newspaper will not survive without her son) pretending to be Knox, writing wonderful editorials that everyone supposes were written by him. <br /> <br /> While there is nothing trembling in this movie, it is a very interesting part of the movement of life. In addition, the performance in general is very good. It is interesting that this film is a fictitious reworking of the experienced Ruth Gordon (a famous screenwriter) and her husband, Garson Kanin (also scriptwriter and director). When Kanin joined the army during World War II, Gordon soon wrote and starred in the work that became this film. <br /> <br /> By the way, I noticed that some of the critics liked the speech towards the end of the film very much. and they were inspired by her. While it was very good, it was also very sad since all this hope for a better world after the war was short lived.
