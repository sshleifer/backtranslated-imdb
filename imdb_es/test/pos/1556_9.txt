I gave this 9 stars a maximum of 10 possible. If I had had a bit more plot than the plot, I would have given it 10. <br /> <br /> However, it is a very interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey, playing a nice old man, should have received the Oscar for her performance. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace (who plays Alice), whom I had never seen before, also does an excellent job and has the sexiest body I think I've seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> In an instant, in the old car, Alice has lit up from the beginning. for Florida, where she has a friend (or maybe she's her sister, I'm not sure, and that's my fault, not the movie), and the high hopes of going to college, which she and her family can not afford. <br /> <br /> She seems quite vulnerable out there on the road alone, and she surely runs into some slightly rough-looking characters and, shortly after, she finds out that there is a hole in one of her tires. <br /> <br /> She is in a rest stop at that moment and receives assistance from a woman named Sandra and her husband, Bill, an older couple who travel in an RV. <br /> <br /> They go south, to Florida. , and take it under his wing, but do they all show themselves? Flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns new lessons about life.
