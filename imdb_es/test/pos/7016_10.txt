I heard this movie from a friend for the first time. She loved him and always looked at him. When he told me about it and told me how old I was, I immediately decided that I would not like it. I was so wrong Dirty Dancing was such an incredible movie! I love music and dancing. I bought the soundtrack and the DVD immediately after watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray were brilliant at that. They captured the emotions and feelings of the characters very well. Both were such good dancers. After watching the movie I wished I could dance like them and I hope to go to the ballroom and the Latin dance soon. I've become a fan of that kind of dance and now I'm hooked on all the movies and shows about it. Dirty Dancing revealed my passion for dance and music. My favorite parts of the film are when Baby enters the staff headquarters and sees them dancing and obviously the last scene in which Baby and Johnny dance together in front of everyone. I think everyone should see Dirty Dancing at least once in their life. If they do not, it's your loss !!
