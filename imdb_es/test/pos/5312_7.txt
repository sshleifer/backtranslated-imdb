The title comes from an alteration that a teenager imprisoned in a correctional institution makes on the cover of his school book on the government, entitled "United States"; add "from (your name)". <br /> <br /> Many characterizations in this movie work well: the scenes between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and Father Fitzgerald (Spacey), as well as with Leland, Becky and Sister Julie (Michelle Williams), among many others. <br /> <br /> But the central thread of this film, the fulcrum on which everything is based, is the character and motives of Leland. He is a somewhat shy, passive and friendly high school student who boldly introduces himself to Becky, who (we met) goes to an alternative school because of a past history of drug problems. In Becky's family, she has a sister, Julie, who has just graduated from high school and is preparing to go to college; Julie's boyfriend, Julie's age (and whose parents died recently) also lives with them. <br /> <br /> Leland lives with her mother; his father (Kevin Spacey) and his mother have been divorced for a long time and his father is a famous novelist. Leland is very perceptive. The young man in "The Sixth Sense" saw dead people; Leland sees the lovers of adolescence and recognizes that years later they will divorce, that the pain will follow the experience of present happiness of many people. BUT, for reasons that are never made explicit, his anticipated gift seems to work sometimes, for some people, some relationships and not for others. ??? <br /> <br /> The parts of the film look a bit like a derived quilt: borrowed from "American Beauty," "The Sixth Sense," "The Graduate," and possibly others that do not. recognize. That would not be bad if only the character of Leland worked. <br /> <br /> I think Gosling did a great job playing Leland, but the script and the story imposed limitations. Would a young man be so observant and meditative? Even for altruistic reasons? Nothing in the movie gives a reason for this. I am a retired therapist with a lot of experience working with families and teenagers; While many of the reactions shown in the film work: this part, this most essential element certainly does not. <br /> <br /> And there is at least one other element that, in my experience, would not fit the real one. Life though is not so critical. The reason for the differences between the sisters, Becky and Julie, is never intimated, but that's fine. Once two sibs begin to occupy different roles (one of them, the good girl and the other the problematic), the roles can begin to lead to more extreme positions. For the problem, Becky, it's something like, "What do I have to do to be loved here, stop being me and become Julie?" And the pressure to live up to being the daughter of All-Good, pleasant for parents, is no less intense for Julie. So why would he break up with his long-time boyfriend and whose parents obviously approve? <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle was as good as Leland's teacher; everyone else was good in their parts. 98% of the scenes were good. What was missing was that crucial slip to understand human nature. <br /> <br /> Good performance; defective history and psychology; It's worth seeing It's not a total loss.
