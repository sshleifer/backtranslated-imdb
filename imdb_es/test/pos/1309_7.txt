I just saw this with my three children - 12yrs (boy), 10yrs (boy) and 8yrs (girl) and this movie was a very old family action adventure. Although definitely aimed at the children's market (I would say from 5 to 13 years old) it was certainly visible and, as a parent, it is a pleasure to find a film that attracts a wide variety of ages and is suitable for the whole family. - particularly the smallest children. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Ricky, a little nerd with a vivid imagination (this can definitely be seen in his dream sequences) that frustrates a kidnapping and a great art theft while it's on-board of a flight to Washington for a school trip. Ricky's father is an aircraft mechanic, so Ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft upside down, but he is also a top-notch pistol in his computer's flight simulator. This is useful when the pilot and co-pilot are out of combat through a series of misadventures and there is no one left to fly the plane. I do not want to give more of the plot.
