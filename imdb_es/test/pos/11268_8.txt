This has to be one of the most beautifully morbid movies I've ever seen. Merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrible violence, sex and a minimalist account of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and the thick grain layer make you question what you are actually seeing at times, but the use of texture, combined with extreme contrast, creates an incredible visual experience. This movie is not for everyone. I think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content, which is extremely difficult, but it makes a pretty important statement about creation, God and humanity. If this movie is a work of art, or the trash of shock value is open to discussion.
