Brain of Blood begins when Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), the leader of a country called Kahlid, is close to death due to cancer. However, if he dies, Kahlid tears apart without anyone guiding them, so Dr. Robert Nigserian (Grant Williams) and one of the devotees of Amir Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) has devised a plan to take Amir's body to America. , where mad scientist Dr. Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) will transplant his brain to a fresh body and with a little plastic surgery no one will. I know he was even dead. However, things do not go according to plan, because when the time comes for the transplant. Amir's brain. Trenton's assistant, Gor (John Bloom) brings a corpse from someone who fell off a balcony, Trenton needed a living body and strong form. once you decide to use Gor's body as a temporary space to leave it until you can find another more suitable one. Unfortunately, when Amir wakes up in his new body, he is not very happy with what he sees, I mean, would you be if you discovered that your brain was inside a badly burned monster? <br /> <br /> Also known as brain damage, The Brain, The Creature's Revenege & The Undying Brain, this cheap exploitation film was produced and directed by the one and Al Adamason and, frankly, I'm offended by the pathetic rating of Brain of Blood that Brain Brain has in the IMDb, personally I think it's fantastic to have fun in such a bad way that it's good. The highly entertaining screenplay by Kane W. Lynn and Joe Van Rodgers is as farfetched and silly as they come from brain transplants soaked in careless blood to crazy mad scientists, monsters with 7-foot-tall acid scars who play with toy cars. 4-foot-tall medium, from dungeons in the basement to rooftop chases, from car accidents to murders, kidnappings and shouting to women with little clothes, from Regina Carrol's hairdo, which should be mentioned during the opening credits for teenagers imprisoned in the basement for the blood to smile. A hilarious and noisy ending that includes a deep and meaningful speech! Everything is here and Brain of Blood has a seal of quality quality, if you're a fan of bad low-budget exploitation movies with a sense of fun, this movie should be at the top of your list of "must-haves" movies . Despite its low rating of 1.5, I'm proud to admit that I really liked Brain of Blood, I thought it was a great pleasure to see it, it slowed down a bit at the end with too many pictures of people wandering around doing nothing. in particular, but until then had moved like a rocket, at 85 minutes is relatively short, it is difficult to guess the clumsy argument and I think it is a lot of campy fun. <br /> <br /> This is the director As far as I'm concerned, Adamson's masterpiece together with Dracula against Frankenstein (1971), which he did a year before this. Those who have seen an Adamson movie before will know about production values, special effects and cardboard games that no longer exist, and all this adds to the fun. This film achieves that fine between incompetence and seriousness to create a memorable visual experience. I love Kahlid's opening photo, which is obviously just a picture of the Taj Mahal in India, with sculptural people in the foreground! Regina Carroll's hair seems to be a separate entity by itself, it seems to change style between takes and it's downright terrible, do not make me talk about your makeup work that you should apply with a paint sprayer! There is another hilarious moment when we see that Amir's body has been transported to the United States wrapped in what looks like an ordinary sheet of tin. Why the question I asked myself was why? The effects are variable, there is a terrible-looking fake spider, Gor's burned makeup work is pretty bad, although there is a surprisingly bloody brain elimination that is actually quite impressive. <br /> <br /> The budget for Brain of Blood must be practically non-existent, I must admit that I thought the Trenton lab was pretty good with several computers and medical instruments, although the rest of the movie seems cheap and nasty. The production values ​​are low, the music was taken from another movie Beast of Blood (1971) and the acting is horrible, but in some funny way. <br /> <br /> Brain of Blood may have the best title for a film about exploitation and, as far as I'm concerned, it's a very entertaining nonsense that I had a lot of fun watching and laughing. They just do not / can not / will not do so, impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good movie, but lovers of bad movies should enjoy it. I liked it, but again I'm just weird.
