I do not understand how people can not like this movie. You have Gossit Jr., the boy who played the main character in Stand By Me, Sean Astin and many other great actors. A lot of action and fun that you do not see in today's movies. It is really a shame. <br /> <br /> This is an underestimated film that is among other great movies like Let's Get Harry. The 80s and the beginning of the 90s created such great movies that they will never be overtaken by current standards. <br /> <br /> They tried to recreate this movie in Masterminds in some way, but they fell short with a really bad performance. The only thing that had gone in that movie was Patrick Stewart, but obviously that was not enough.
