Seven months after a revealing presentation of Faces, I finally found a cost-effective DVD copy of the first Cassavetes feature. Filmed in Manhattan and in his acting workshop on ad hoc series, Shadows was the culmination of months of improvisational rehearsals, in which actors (mostly amateurs) developed links with each other, invented their characters and polished their techniques to give . His filmed performances are just the correct tenor of spontaneous familiarity. This intimate approach led to an incredibly daring work on Faces, meaning Seymour Cassel clenched his hands down Lynn Carlin's throat in an attempt to revive her from an overdose, just when the conviction of the actors here produces incredibly honest moments like Lelia and Tony's post-coital assessment of their relationship and Ben's repulsion at the contact of a black woman as a manifestation of his racial confusion and self-loathing. A homemade production in the best sense, the dubbing and the recording of out-of-sync sound, and the granular cinematography and the nearby camera configurations, create an immersive atmosphere that perfectly adapts to the nuanced vision of Cassavetes' human relationships as works perpetual in progress, Marked by desperate emotional fluctuations and tentative attempts at communication and understanding. The largely improvised jazz score by Charles Mingus is an ideal complement to the film's vision of living for the moment, a mantra for which Cassavetes worked and apparently lived.
