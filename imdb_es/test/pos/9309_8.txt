It is rare for a film to cover the process of problem solving and a fantastically extensive moral dilemma. And it is a fairly accurate historical film, but Fat Man and Little Boy perform this trick. <br /> <br /> It's the story of the Manhattan Project - the Second World War effort to build the atomic bomb, told as the conflict between the two men who made it possible, General Leslie Groves and Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> The historical figures are a great study in the opposites: military vs. civil, practical vs. idealistic, emotional vs. scientist, brute force vs. problem solving based on consensus, immediacy vs. long-term vision. A fictional character, played by John Cusack, is added as a kind of synthesis of the two historical figures, to show the humanity that strangely escapes real people (and, of course, the compulsory love interest, played by Laura Dern) . One who searches for a direct documentary might criticize the lapses in the melodrama (and the occasional slack with the facts, but that's Hollywood for you), but the purpose of the fiction is to synthesize and galvanize the events into more universal truths, so I think that this can be forgiven. . <br /> <br /> One of the great images of the film is when Oppenheimer witnesses the first atomic explosion: it is completely realized through his reaction, and taking into account the amazing images inherent in an atomic explosion, It is a courageous and totally effective action. The way to describe in a single moment the ambivalent effect in humans of unleashing that power (the kind of thing lost in the typical version of the history of Hollywood shooting). The use of music is particularly excellent in the last third of the film. <br /> <br /> Very accessible and highly recommended as historical film and drama of the highest level.
