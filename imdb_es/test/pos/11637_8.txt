(*** Minor spoilers ***) <br /> <br /> If there is anything in the world of silent clowns that baffles me, it is that Charley Chase never had his deserved "break" in the movies. Oh, well, maybe it's not so strange, really, to the extent that he never starred in any feature film. But when I think about it, such an explanation makes everything more mysterious, because why the hell did Chase not receive any offer to play the main role in functions? One explanation is that his character, no matter how funny it was, was simply too realistic to fit a longer storyline; without the burlesque elements that Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon and other comedians possessed, it can be assumed that the comedy he did and that worked so well for twenty minutes would become repetitive after a few more reels. However, I do not buy this at all, since the construction of the Chase gag is magnificent and, in my opinion, could keep the interest of the spectators only for a longer period; At least I'm tempted to think like that when MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE runs the program. <br /> <br /> Mr. Moose is not extraordinarily handsome, and Mrs. Moose is not a "classic beauty"; He has the largest front teeth of all humans on the planet, and she has a very large nose. Both undergo plastic surgery without the other knowing it, and when they meet by accident soon after, he does not recognize his wife and she does not recognize her husband. They begin a series of hilarious misunderstandings, with many intelligent gags throughout. I do not think it reveals anything else, so that the visualization is more pleasant for you. Because if you're a fan of silent comedies, or even if you're not, A MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE offers you so many memorable moments in such a short time that I would see it as a real shame not to see it; Foolish indeed, but no less extremely funny.
