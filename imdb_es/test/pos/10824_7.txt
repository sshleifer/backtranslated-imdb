Increasingly, French cinema proves that it is the only one capable of confronting those of Hollywood and spending large sums of money on its films. If Bon Voyage had been made in the United States, nobody would be surprised. Perfectly set in France, in the 40s, when the Nazi invasion, technically irreproachable, and with some of the most international French actors (Depardieu, Adjani, Ledoyen ...). The centrists of Bon Voyage in two parallel stories: a scientist and his disciple (Ledoyen) trying to hide one of his discoveries (a type of water that can work like an atomic bomb) from the Nazis; and a poor man in love with a well-known actress (Adjani), who ends up in jail accused of a crime he has not committed to protect her. <br /> <br /> It seems that Bon Voyage was done in the old style, without unnecessary movements or effects of the camera. Without big twists in the plot. As I said before, with respect to the production itself, they have done a great job. But the main problem with this movie is about the script. Is it a spy movie? A romantic comedy? A spy comedy? A comedy of intrigue? It's not clear. That makes Bon Voyage a bit unbalanced. When you think you're watching a comedy, suddenly change to another story line, more dramatic, slower ... I think they should have focused on one of the lines of the discussion (the spy's argument) and I left the parts romantic in the background. <br /> <br /> My rate: 6.5 / 10
