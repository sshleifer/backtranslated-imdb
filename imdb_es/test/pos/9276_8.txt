I suspect that there are several cuts of this doco doing the rounds. The copy I saw focused heavily on Joe's erotic movies and referred to his horror production as he passed. There are numerous X-rated movies presented in their X-rated glory and the EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA "snuff" footage (the breasts that are cut) receives a generous screen time. <br /> <br /> The interviews with the most pleasant Joe are informative and sincere. He is a modest and unpretentious gentleman, and speaks of his interest in shocking audiences, why he wanted to mix the erotic with the horror and how he could have been responsible for one of his interpreters becoming gay. <br /> <br /> Their friendship and the working relationship with Indonesian beauty, Laura Gemser, is touched, as is their indifferent attitude towards the filming of hardcore. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato epitomizes an incredible period in continental cinema that has already passed. It's great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his excellent and unique work. <br /> <br /> RIP, Joe.
