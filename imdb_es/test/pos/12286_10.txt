'This Is Not a Film' works because it is so true in what you are trying to say. If you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus on the message, you will see a little of yourself in the main character, Michael. Whether man or woman, we have all reached a point in our lives where we want to look back and reexamine a situation or a relationship. Did it really happen as we remember? What went wrong? Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. More than anything, he wants to feel better about how things turned out. But even so, he is a nice character because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships. Otherwise we would not be in them. When the movie ends, I'm not sure if Michael has learned something new about himself or not. Our best indicator of the relationship is through her friend, Nadia. She is the soul of the film and reminds us how there are always two faces in each story. I discovered that Michael is pompous, arrogant and simply clueless. Which is exactly why I liked it. He is a true character. If you have ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship, then this is a movie for you. To finish, it's a movie for everyone.
