"Four Daughters" begins as another clone of the melodrama "Little Women". A single father with four eligible daughters with musical talent has his hands full trying to keep them online and guide them in their courtship rituals. What turns the film around is the sudden appearance of a new Hollywood star, according to some critics, the first anti-hero long before James Dean appeared on the big screen. From the moment when the dark and premonitory figure of Mickey Borden (John Garfield) appears in the gate of Ann Lemp (Priscilla Lane), which splashes his self-pity and his doomed philosophy in the rest of the cast, "Four Daughters" becomes much more than a girl. flick <br /> <br /> Although Garfield is the main reason to see "Four Daughters", there are other flashes of brilliance to enjoy. The director of Hungarian origin Michael Curtiz, then responsible for jewelry like "Casablanca" and "Mildred Pierce", points out certain images with his camera (aided by cinematographer Ernest Haller of "Rebel Without A Cause" fame) that stays in the mind of the spectators, for example, the screeching door that Ann's first suitor, Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), opens so cheerily becomes a symbol of the changes in the moods and affections of those who use it. <br /> <br /> That Garfield offers outstanding performance It's obvious, but the rest of the cast follows it almost all the way. The underestimated Jeffrey Lynn plays his role perfectly, as the careless suitor whose love for his beloved Ann never falters even when he is with another man. Claude Rains, somewhat misunderstood as the father of the four young women of legal age, offers an excellent portrait of a group about the loving family head who gets lost in the confusion. The three Lane Sisters, already famous for their musical skills, become successful actresses, playing their roles well. A lot of supporting actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson and Eddie Acuff, make everything believable. <br /> <br /> How opposites are attracted is part of the stratagem to touch the quickness of the viewer's imagination. Ann is the eternal optimist, even when she and Mickey are depressed. She always looks on the positive side and, like so many trapped in the pliers of the Great Depression in those days, saw prosperity just around the corner. Mickey recites a complete list of the bad things that have happened to him looking for company in his misery of Ann, that Ann refuses to do. Mickey hopes to leave with a lightning bolt that strikes him to death as he circles the corner of life. Mickey has little talent as a composer; Ann has a talent as a singer and musician. Ann is great in beauty; Mickey is great in personality in a twisted way in a way. And the differences go on and on. The way in which all this is reconciled in the end is an important part of the film, which should not be lost. <br /> <br /> Watch "Four Daughters" to see John Garfield's big debut on the big screen. The only time he was better was seven years later, when he returned to hypnotize the audience with one of the best performances on screen, as Frank Chambers in "The Postman Always Rings Twice", along with the equally charismatic Lana Turner. But also look at "Four daughters" to capture important elements that can be lost if you put too much focus on the star of the show.
