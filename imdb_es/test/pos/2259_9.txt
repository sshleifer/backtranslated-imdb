I saw this last night and I voted it with an "8". Since then, he grew up in me and I gave him a "9". <br /> <br /> The film has (at the beginning) a facade apparently slightly disconnected between the first and the second half. The first half is a comedy and there are few signs of the irregular truths of the times, life, wars, religious intolerance that will be revealed in the second half. Although at the beginning it can be a bit disconcerting because it is an unfamiliar narrative sequence, in the reflection it works. <br /> <br /> The acting was good (Hultz in the role of Alex, the interpreter, was especially good). <br /> <br /> I have scanned most of the other "User Comments" and I see that some who have read the book are satisfied with the movie, while there are some who are not. Both feelings, of course, are valid. <br /> <br /> For me, a retired family therapist and one-world believer, the film was relevant at two different levels. <br /> <br /> The first, as history, gave a powerful reminder of how polarizations occur frequently, with demonizing and trying to exterminate any of those with a moral value system different from ours. <br /> <br /> The second was that by demonstrating the first, it also revealed something in common to EACH ONE of us, ALL of our families, that each of us must return to our roots to understand each other better. <br /> <br /> TS Eliot expressed this exquisitely in the room of his "Four Quartets" when he said: "We will not stop exploring // And the end of all our exploration // It will get where we started // And Know the place for the first time. " <br /> <br /> Jonathan makes a satisfying journey that any of us would find fantastically enlightening: exploring and discovering our roots; What were those people going through then, who were they? Really! - Before, when and during the first years before and after we were born? Etc. <br /> <br /> So the film at first gives us the impression of a comedy, then changes to give us a history lesson and human deficiencies, but through all that it also gives us, subliminally, a Message about each one of us. All of us would be rewarded abundantly for coming back and understanding the place from which we started.
