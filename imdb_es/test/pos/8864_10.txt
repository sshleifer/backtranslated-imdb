This is another one of those movies that I remember having been watching late on TV, scaring myself to the awesome age of about 12 years and condemning me later to a life of obsession with horror movies. This is a GREAT movie, and it is living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGI. <br /> <br /> Located on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to retake its original version (The Thing Of Another World) left. US scientists discover a Norwegian base decimated a few miles away. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of an unidentifiable thing that is about to melt away from the complex could offer some answer to what might have happened. The Thing is returned to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing melts and disappears, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses His path, but also absorbing them, becoming Whoever He wants and whatever He wants. The film then becomes a brilliant piece of paranoia. Everyone is suspicious, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. It has gone the strength and security that are found when human beings unite despite their differences to fight against a monster. The group splinters and fear dominates supreme. Who is the thing? <br /> <br /> The bleeding effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I could have done it without the dogs' heads opening like a banana peel, but that is the lover of the animals that are in me being demanding: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kittens and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, humans are taken by the alien that changes shape. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer it; The real threat is found inside and is more frightening because of the fact that it can not be easily seen or detected. When he is forced to hide, his anger is enormous and the results are horrible. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films of Carpenters, along with The Fog and Halloween. All the actors give strong and realistic performances, and the special effects are so powerful that they stand out as their own main character. This movie has something for any lover of the horror genre. Do not miss it
