This is an excellent example of cinema without inhibitions at its best. The search for Richard Greene (who does well in the role) of his two missing friends takes him to the domain of the Black Forest and the castle of Count Bruno (Stephen McNally), a past enemy who has never seen face to face . The amazing movie has so many amazing elements combined (for once) in a single movie: a crocodile pit; a great silence (played by Lon Chaney, Jr.); an astute doctor (played by Boris Karloff); a leopard hunting (VERY well done and VERY atmospheric); a love story; a castle; a sword fight a sadistic, one-eyed tale and his two evil accomplices (played by John Hoyt and Michael Pate!); an intriguing background story that makes the movie even more interesting; and more!. The screenplay by Jerry Sackheim does not let him take it by himself: to make a film that is extremely recommendable for anyone who dedicates himself to the cinema in an unlimited way with a touch of horror and ambience.
