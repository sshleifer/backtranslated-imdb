Over the years I have seen this movie many times when I saw it on "HBO" and now I have a DVD copy. I must say that it is very memorable and entertaining, while also interesting and educational. As any television fan can relate to the time of the early 90's, when it came time to replace Johhny Carson, the living legend of "The Tonight Show", who will be Jay or Dave? This original HBO movie "The Late Shift" stays true to its form and shows very well the real events that show the battle behind the scenes between the network leaders of NBC and CBS and even ABC, all fighting for the services of Jay and Dave. The acting makes it look real, since there are very few real life TV images shown with real-life people, while the actors representing Leno and Letterman make it seem so real. I have not read Bill Carter's book, so I do not know if he stayed true to the pages, but over the years I've really enjoyed this movie. From the moment he starts showing CBS entertainment bosses watching Leno sub by Johhny and they decide they want to participate in the game of the night. However, when Carson announces his unexpected retirement, NBC wants to stay loyal to Leno, but the conflict comes when Letterman also wants a crack in the slot at 11:30. It was fun to watch the extravagant meeting with Michael Ovitz (Treat Williams) that makes all networks want to consider Letterman for a show. It was interesting to see the scene of Johhny telling Letterman by phone in a direct way to walk from NBC and consider CBS. And, by the way, Rich Little was fantastic, since Johhny Carson could not match his performance. And many tense moments were provided in showing the disputes and dismissal of Leno's talented manager, Helen, who was pressured by NBC bosses to do. In general, a great movie that shows how television really is and shows that networks have power and money, and at the same time show that it is a fierce business. Clearly there is no business like show business. Great HBO work very memorable and a clock at any time that showed the true story of the night wars.
