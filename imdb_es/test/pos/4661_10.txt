Do not they make movies like this anymore? although some may say that it is a good thing. Although this was one of the first films rated for Disney's PG, it has more of the feel of G-movies than its studio resulted in the '70s (ie, "Freaky Friday," "The Greatest Athlete of the World") that PG movies that came out in the early 80's (ie "Watcher in the Woods", "Tron", "Something Wicked This Way Comes"). Due to the support of Disney, "Midnight Madness" obviously had a big budget. A huge cast and a lot of different places are going to prove it. But zaniness, a crazy treasure hunt and a spectacular visual style were not enough to keep the movie from being a huge failure ... A failure at the box office, most of us were introduced to the film on HBO early on? The 80s, in the days when the same films were shown 29 times a week (Oh, wait, they still do!). Essentially HBO did for this movie what CBS did for "The Wizard of Oz"? they created a huge cult audience for a sweet and sugary mega-flop ... <br /> <br /> The biggest problem that makes this movie "bad" is that there are too many characters and very few of them are brazen. outside ?? The "squadron" of Eddie Deezen does not even have a name! The blue team, although they are the villains, are the most attractive and have more work on their characters (with the exception of the girl, who can not act and does not have enough to do). Harold, played to perfection by Stephen Furst, is really the only one whose character is completely made in the film. The other outstanding character is Melio, played with a lot of charm by the now director Andy Tennant. Although then Dr. It was assumed that Pepper's spokesman, David Naughton, would be the star, his character often becomes unpleasant, particularly when he faces his brother Adam, Michael J. Fox. While they all have favorite characters, they do not I do not think anyone who loves the movie can disagree that Furst and Fox are the only characters from whom you really learn something. <br /> <br /> Despite the many faults and bad actors in the film. (most of which fell off the face of the earth after this movie) still works because the actors seemed to be having fun, and the fun on the set is just as fun on the screen. Come on, what college athlete does not dream of floating in a tub of beer and what zoftig girl does not dream of stealing the show at the local nightclub ... uh ... I guess today would be in a rave. Campy, impeccable fun for anyone who was young in the 70s and 80s, it is logical that he has finally achieved the massive video release he deserves. But where the hell is the wide-screen DVD release with the commentary, the trailer and the full version of the song played in the disco?
