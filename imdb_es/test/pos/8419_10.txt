Shwaas is awesome! Considering that the producers had a limited budget, they have done an excellent job. It is a must. The little boy has done an excellent job with many emotions that flow through his eyes. Grandpa is at his best. The photography is excellent. Technically correct and very creative. It helps to add many emotions to the general content. The film will keep you absorbed and do not be surprised if you are shaken after the movie and the story remains in your mind for a few days. I sincerely hope you reach the final Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it and do not miss it.
