Bergman's story about how the hell of war can lead a couple of sensible musicians to barbarism. With many memorable scenes throughout the film, I found particularly remarkable that near the end, where Ullmann and Von Sydow go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating in the sea. A fascinating masterpiece!
