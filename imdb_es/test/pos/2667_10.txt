For all those baffled by the length and rhythm of this movie ("like, why do you show the spaceships for, like, 15 minutes?"), Here's a word you should think about: <br /> <br /> Beauty. <br /> <br /> Beauty is an underestimated concept. Of course, you often see a good photograph, etc., in the movies. But when was the last time you saw a movie that contains beauty just for the sake of it? There is a strange belief among cinemagoers that anything unrelated to the plot or character must be eliminated. This is depressing nonsense. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the plot of the movie. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships without more reason that they are beautiful, and it is not illegal or bad to do so. <br /> <br /> '2001' requires you to see in a different way than you normally see movies. It requires that you relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Do not get me wrong, the plots and the characters are good, but they are not the whole and the end of everything. There are different types of movies, and to enjoy the '2001' you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, without restrictions by the banal conventions of everyday movies. <br /> <br /> "All art is pretty useless" - Oscar Wilde.
