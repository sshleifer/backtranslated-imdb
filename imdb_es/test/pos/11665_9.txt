"Dead Man Walking" is an incredible piece of cinema. All the action is first class and realistic, and the script examines the issue of the death penalty on both sides, paying the same tribute to both. Above all, this is a deeply moving story of redemption, death with dignity and loss of ego. Any film that treats this with courage and maturity with such an incredibly difficult subject deserves a rating of 10/10. Thanks, Tim Robbins!
