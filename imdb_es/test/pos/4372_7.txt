For those of you who like comedians, you must have heard about George Carlin. He is really one of the best live comedians, so you should know him. <br /> <br /> But he died, God rests him in peace. Or hell. He did not believe too much in religion, so he could choose Hell to live eternity. HAHA, just kidding, do not take it seriously! <br /> <br /> It's bad for you! It's one of George Carlin's latest works, before his death-- <br /> <br /> believe me, one of his best works, a must for any fan and one of George Carlin's best jokes. It's not the best ... but it's really fun. <br /> <br /> He has less political and religious jokes. Just to have a good time! <br /> <br /> The edition is very good. It is not a concert, therefore, there should not be quick changes of shots ... the slow fading to another shot was well done. Fading is the best option in terms of editing!
