This film is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the impressive photography and the acting, the scenes of battles of kolossal style (without computer graphics here, only thousands of people). Someone said that the story has something to do with the tragedies of Sheakespearian. I also find some connections with the tradition of Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> The emperor, extraordinarily acted, fights between power and love, but is forced (for the greater good, by the will of his ancestors) to Choose power (and loneliness, hatred of his subjects and relatives) as his destiny. He, like Creon in Antigone, was a good guy before becoming emperor. Once he gained power, he has to be ruthless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, his father, etc.) to defend and expand the empire. Trapped by power, it becomes a monster. In general, the Emperor Qin is a majestic figure of Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> The murderer evolves in a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. Even this character is forced towards his destiny by love and by his new ethics. This character is also truly unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Lady Zhao, a wonderful Gong Li, is uncorrupted morality, neither by power or love or hatred. She is the moral against power, in some way like Antigone. Their conspiracies (for and against the emperor) always have a moral foundation. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a wonderful movie. If you like movies and want to try Chinese movies, you can start here.
