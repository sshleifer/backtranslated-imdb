Upon entering this film, I knew two things about it. I knew it was a real extreme movie, and I knew it was something artistic. Both attract me in their own right, but when placed together they can be truly unique. And this was damn right, no doubt, unique. As I said before, it's an artistic film. The way they used an intense sound, it reminded me a lot of a film by Aronofsky. Visually I have not seen anything like it. The cinematography and the lighting were done very well. The film uses images and sounds seriously better than anything I've seen in a long time. Especially when you consider the experience of these young filmmakers (couple of 20 years old), you really have to take off your hat. <br /> <br /> The movie is not easy to describe or even discuss. There is no real story. You could say that it revolves around the right and left sides of the brain and how they control your life, I think. There are four segments, or four ideas that come to life through visual and auditory extremes. There is something about listening and talking, but it is mainly a movie that does not speak. <br /> <br /> The first segment is the shortest and rotates on a naked body and an eyeball. Try and guess what happens? Wrong. The second segment is my favorite. It is about a brother and a sister (who looks a bit like Sarah Silverman, but with bigger boobs). The brother is crazy and the sister is a whore. I would say that this is the most extreme of all the segments, and the most well done. The gore effects on this one were great. The third segment revolves around a group of naked people sexing it with mother earth. He is probably considered the weakest in the group, but he is still smart and well done. The fourth segment is probably the strongest in the movie and I would also say the deepest one. For my part, I will have to see this a couple of times to understand what is really being said. I know that you approach Christianity in a way that most likely causes your mother to feel offended or vomit? Test it. <br /> <br /> I was recommended to subconscious cruelty and I am proud to say this is now in my movie collection. It is extreme, violent, bloody, very sexual and, surprisingly, very provocative. The next line that I am about to say has been used in almost all the reviews I have read for this movie. "This movie is not for everyone." Now that is not the truth. If you like extreme movies and / or you're just a movie lover, do you want to see something different? Watch this. 8 1/2 outta 10
