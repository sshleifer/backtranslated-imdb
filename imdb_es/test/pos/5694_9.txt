WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> This movie was on the shelf in a movie store and since I had seen a handful of very cheesy horror movies there. I had very low expectations for this. Well, I put it on and almost immediately absorbed me. As I watched him, I got deeper into the story and, very soon, I was looking with great interest. This movie is surprisingly spectacular and I loved every second. The story is about a boat trip on a river in Australia. It seems pretty safe until your ship is ambushed by a crocodile that is ready for some food. When I looked at the back of the case, I thought this movie was going to have crap visual effects like Lake Placid 2 and many others, but when I saw the crocodile for the first time it looked incredibly real! Do not laugh when I say this, because I'm serious, but this is one of the most spooky movies I've ever seen. I really knew how to increase tension and suspense with this intense situation, I mean, think about it; Your stuck, in a tree, where to run, where to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below. You can not tell me that that does not scare you just a little. I even managed to shiver down my arms, like when the crocodile took Adam and Grace and Lee were baffled. This is a very attractive movie. There were maybe 1 or 2 parts that I found HIGHLY without interest, but other than that, I would say that this is my favorite animal attack movie that I have seen.
