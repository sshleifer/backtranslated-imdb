Because Mr. Bean almost never speaks, I sincerely recommend using a DVD player with the master by pressing the pause / play button. At the end of the lesson of any age group, simply devote 5 minutes to pause and play the DVD, and encourage the students to shout the answers to "What is this?", "What will happen?", "What is it?" is it happening? "," What's wrong? ", or any other question that gets answers from the new vocabulary and grammar of that lesson. <br /> <br /> Because everyone is watching television, usually shy students go crazy. Because the DVD can be started or stopped at any time, it is a perfect "fill-in" for the "difficult moments" while the students come and go. <br /> <br /> I tried other DVDs, especially "Tom & Jerry" cartoons and Red Skelton DVDs, but no other was as good as "Mister Bean" in the constant attention of the students.
