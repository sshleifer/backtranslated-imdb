The mere fact of reading why this program was canceled makes me feel pretty bad. This was one of my favorites as a child and I always saw it when it was turned on, no matter how many times I saw the episode. Of course the effects were not great, but they were not horrible either. They did a pretty good job with the costume and they had the nice feeling of the 70s that is always nice to see and hear, since the music was also very 70's. I really did not have any comic book villains, but then most of them the adaptations of the live comics did not have very few real super villains of the comics. Spidey's powers were also a bit different here, he had his sense of Spidey and he could climb walls, but he was not as strong as the spiderman in the comics. Although it was very strong, since I remember an episode in which broke into a room to break the doorknob, it was not the car launcher that can be the comic. The show took place in Los Angelos, so there were not many man-made buildings, but they did well with the web. It is good that this program really has the web shooters and not the organic shooters of the film. I love movies, but a part of me wants them to start over and make the smarter pants that Spidey has the mechanical shooters. This show had a good star like Peter Parker and it was good as Spider-man, it's good to see a Spidey who basically does not live in poor neighborhoods like he does in movies. However, neither this program nor the film have a spiderman who is quick with the insult like that of the comic. Still, this show was fun without being as cheesy as the Batman show.
