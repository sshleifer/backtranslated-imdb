I really enjoyed this Minghella epic, not as much as "The English Patient" (a modern-day classic). The first 20 minutes or so feels uncomfortable, but when Inman (Jude Law) embarks on the journey back to his love Ava (Nicole Kidman), the film begins in leaps and bounds and becomes a very memorable romantic drama and reflexive. Apparently, it's fashionable to hate Kidman right now, but I do not agree at all, and she's doing well here. In fact, I think the romance between Inman and Ada is weakly developed in the script (they do not really have much time on the screen to develop a relationship), but Law and Kidman give it their all and convince him. Ada's journey is the essence of the film: she becomes a strong woman who can stand almost anything. At first, Zellweger seems to be wrong as Ruby, but she grows in you after all and shines in many of her later scenes. The film has a beautiful photograph and a scenography design, but it never really captures the real feel of a period piece. Jack White, in particular, has long, messy hair and a pale rock complexion that looks completely out of place with the stage. Cillian Murphy fans will enjoy watching the talented Irish actor in an early part, and Natalie Portman actually proves that she can act in the most amazing sequence of the movie. It's a pity that "The Other Boleyn Girl" is so inadequate.
