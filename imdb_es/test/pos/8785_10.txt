I really enjoy this movie. It is a look back in time when this nation was really at risk from the nations that attacked or declared war against us, namely the Japanese and the Germans. Robert Cummings and Pricilla Lane were excellent in the lead roles. The cast of support ... Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevins and Norman Lloyd were also outstanding. The direction, the rhythm and the end were maintained and continue to maintain my interest. So much so, that I bought my own copy. Thank God for Turner Classic Movies, they show many truly classic movies, including this one. <br /> <br /> Robert Cummings certainly was not a light actor and, although I'm a big fan of Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea, two of my favorite actors, who were first offered the lead role, I do not see what they would have contributed to the role that would have exceeded the performance of Bob Cummings. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that I enjoy watching repeatedly and I urge others to watch.
