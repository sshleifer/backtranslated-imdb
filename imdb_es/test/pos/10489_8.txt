"Il Prezzo Del Potere" by Tonino Valerii, also known as. "The Price Of Power" is an excellent and fascinating Western Spaghetti that reflects Kennedy's assassination. A great performance by Giuliano Gemma and an excellent score by Luis Bacalof are just two of the many reasons to see this movie. <br /> <br /> In 1881, Texas is divided into those who appreciate the abolition of slavery and only want to live in peace, and those who, after 16 years, still want to reinstate the confederation. Despite the warnings, President James Garfield, who wants to establish a new equality policy, decides to visit Dallas, where corrupt officials of the law are planning his murder. Bill Willer (Giuliano Gemma) and two of his friends, a black man named Jack Donovan (Ray Shaunders) and a crippled man named Nick (Manuel Zarzo) are determined to avoid the assassination of the President. <br /> <br /> Since James Garfield was not murdered by racists, who wanted to reinstate the confederation in Texas, but in Washington DC by mentally unstable Charles Guiteau, the story of "Price Of Power" is, of course, historical nonsense. However, since the film does not claim historical accuracy, but tries to allude to Kennedy's assassination in Dallas in 1963, the fact that the story is fictional is legitimate. <br /> <br /> Giuliano Gemma offers an excellent performance as the main character, Bill Willer, Benito Stefanelli is excellent as the villain and corrupt Sheriff Jefferson. Some other good performances are those of Ray Shaunders as Bill's black friend, Warren Vanders as Arthur McDonald, the president's adviser, and Fernando Rey, as Pinkerton, a rich and villainous businessman. Luis Enr√≠quez Bacalov's score is excellent, the cinematography and the places are excellent and (as in Valerii's previous "Day of Wrath") they are very reminiscent of Sergio Leone, for whom Valerii used to work as assistant director of "A Fistful Of Dollars "and" for a few dollars more. " <br /> <br /> Everything said, "Il Prezzo Del Potere" is, after "Day Of Anger", another excellent Spaghetti Western that shows the great talent of Giuliano Gemma as an actor and Tonino Valerii as director. "The Price Of Power" is a must for fans of Spaghetti Western, and I also recommend it to everyone else. 8/10
