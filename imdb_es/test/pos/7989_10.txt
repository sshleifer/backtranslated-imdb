Batman Returns: My opinion is that the first Batman in the Batman series was only half the movie that Batman Returns is. In Tim Burton's first Batman we only had Batman and The Joker, both beautifully played by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. <br /> <br /> In Batman Returns, we have what I think is the most perfect Batman movie (yes, even better than the Dark Knight). Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the role that never surpassed the character of Batman, which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains he faces. First you have Danny DeVito, who is deliciously crazy like the Penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat-Woman, and I daresay she's one of the most interesting and complex villains in the Batman movies. I feel that way about Pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the Cat-Woman, she starts like the pathetic Selena Kyle and then she plunges into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance from a woman who goes. from trying to be a hero to a villain and then I guess I'll be a hero again at the end. Also in this incredible cast you have the evil businessman Max Schreck played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken. While in a supporting role, there's something in this role that I love and maybe it's Schreck's appearance in the movie that makes his acting even better. <br /> <br /> As for the story, I have to say that Batman Returns has much more at stake this time compared to the first Batman. Part of the reason why I liked this story so much is the fact that Burton dared to go in a much darker and twisted direction compared to Nicholson's antics. You have the story of the Penguin and how he tries to trick the people of Gotham into becoming the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her struggle to decide who she really is and what she should do with her new person. When it comes to Batman, I feel that in this case he is more the leader of the band that keeps the two stories together but, of course, kicking asses at the same time. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was the dark and atmospheric film, like the story that is taking place inside her. Gotham City never looked as good as it does in Blu-Ray and HD, so if you have the opportunity to see it this way, do it because it really adds to the overall experience of Batman Returns. <br /> <br /> So, actually, I feel that out of all the Batman movies, Batman Returns, believe it or not, surpasses The Dark Knight for me because, although I enjoyed that movie because of Heath's incredible performance Ledger as Joker, I felt that the film was missing something. Batman Returns does not lack anything, so if you want to watch an amazing movie with what I think is a perfect cast, then this is the Batman to turn on the Bat signal.
