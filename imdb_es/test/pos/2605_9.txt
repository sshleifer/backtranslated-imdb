I must admit that this is one of the few films of Lou Costello that I really saw in the theater. Most have already seen on television and I must admit that Lou is really nice and also stays with the girl. This was the first time I saw Dorothy Provine perform and, of course, I fell in love with her like so many others that day. I have seen most of the work that everyone has done and enjoyed. His performance in The Great Race is one of the reasons why I bought the record in the first place! <br /> <br /> Every comment in this movie says that this is the only movie that Lou Costello did without Bud Abbott, which is true, but if Lou had lived, he would have done many more. He really does a good job and does not have to rely on his old routines to get laughs. For my part, I regret that Patterson's little man, N.J. I did not have the opportunity to do that. <br /> <br /> I hope it comes out on DVD at some point so I can add it to my comedy / science fiction collection.
