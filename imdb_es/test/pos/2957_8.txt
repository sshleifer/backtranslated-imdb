Clayton Moore made his final official appearance on screen as the masked man in director Lesley Selander's epic adventure "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold," co-starring Jay Silverheels as his loyal Indian scout Tonto. Selander was a westerns veteran during his 40 years in movies and television with more than 100 westerns in his credit as a director. This fast-paced horse opera adopted a revisionist perspective in its portrayal of Native Americans that had been gaining acceptance gradually since 1950 in Hollywood, after director Delmar Daves led the way with the "Broken Arrow" west of James Stewart. . Racial intolerance figures as the main theme in the screenplay by Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald. After having written 13 episodes of the television series "The Lone Ranger", Schaefer and Freiwald were familiar with the formula, but they increased the level of this theatrical scene. Our vigilant heroes go to the rescue of the Indians who are being killed by hooded white men for no apparent reason. The mystery about the identities of these murderers and the reason behind their homicidal behavior is revealed soon enough so that they do not have to guess what is happening. <br /> <br /> Although the violence in this Selander saga seems to be docile. contemporary standards, the fact that the Lone Ranger shoots a bad guy to kill in a scene instead of hurting and that a cowardly lady kills a double-crossing accomplice by throwing a war ax that sinks in his back between his shoulder blades It was quite bold. The television series never reached this length, and when the Lone Ranger picked up his six-gun, he fired the villain's fist instead of driving it away. The other discrepancy here is that the Indians lynch one of the assailants and torture him for information, but they are never charged with kidnapping this henchman. Douglas Kennedy did not have the villainous statue of Lyle Bettger, who threatened the Masked Man in director Stuart Heisler's "The Lone Ranger," but he introduces himself as a cowardly criminal who kills one of his own henchmen without problems when the malefactor threatens to divulge his name and the identity of his cronies to a band of vengeful Indians. <br /> <br /> "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" opens with a summary of the protagonist's origins masquerading as a Texas ambush. Ranger and his transformation into the Lone Ranger with Fool as his companion. This initial two-minute update is an excellent way to start a series-oriented character so that everyone, including non-Lone Ranger fans, is on an equal footing. The main plot about a gang of relentless white hoods and called "not surprisingly" the hooded assailants begins with them killing Indians and stealing medallions that are worn around their necks. The Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive too late to intervene, but they find a baby hidden nearby. Taking the baby and the dead Indian, they travel to a nearby Spanish mission supervised by Father Vicente Esteban (Ralph Moody from "The Outsider") and they give him the baby and the body. Initially, the Father must assure an Indian maid, Paviva (Lisa Montell from "Gaby"), that the masked man does not hurt them and is their friend. Father sends Tonto to the city to search for the doctor, Dr. James Rolfe (Dean Fredericks of "Gun Fever"), and Tonto quickly gets into trouble in the form of the city's official bidder, Sheriff Oscar Matthison (Charles Watts of "Giant"), who hates the Indians. Silly tries to see the doctor who attends to the prisoners in the sheriff's jail and Matthison's men begin to mistreat him when Rolfe intervenes and returns to the mission. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the Lone Ranger and Fool can capture one of the hooded assailants, but an Indian Redbird (Maurice Jara from "Drum Beat"), and his brave companions kidnap the henchmen and take him away from him. return to his village. They distribute it and shoot arrows to loosen the tongue. The main villain Ross Brady (Douglas Kennedy of "Hell's Crossroads") and his cohort William (Lane Bradford of "Devil's Canyon") travel to the village and Brady uses his Winchester to kill his captured henchman. Little does Brady know that his henchman spoke. The Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive shortly after and reprimand Redbird for his perfidy. Redbird tells them what the man said before he died and the lone Ranger decides to adopt a costume so he can learn more. He disguises himself as bounty hunter with a mustache and false southern accent. <br /> <br /> Despite its brief and concise 83 minute playing time, "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" is not without emotion or surprises. Selander keeps the action moving at full gallop. The dialogue is largely expository rather than memorable, since Schaefer and Freiwald drive the plot more often than the spring surprises, but there is a big surprise that relates to the good Indian theme. There is also a scene in which the lone Ranger presses his own creed on justice available to all under the law at a time when the Chief Justice, Earl Warren, had embarked on the historic decisions of the superior court that recognized and mitigated the conditions surrounding racial segregation. civil rights, the separation of church and state, and the procedure of police detention in the United States. One thing that differentiates "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks to the time of the Spanish conquerors with a bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor. In general, the stories of Lone Ranger were limited to the nineteenth century without creeping into European history. No, the Lone Ranger was not the first movie to deal with the Spanish conquerors. "The Seven Golden Cities" by Robert D. Webb (1955) referred to Spaniards who sought places of the same name in the southwest, but Selander's western defeated the "Gold of the Seven Saints" by Gordon Douglas (1961) on the screen.
