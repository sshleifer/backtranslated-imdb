This film was adapted from the well-known Sutra in Journey to the West, where a monk with his three students seeks to find a long-lost book regarding the Buddha's teaching. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not as solemn as the previous films made according to the legend, however, it managed to bring a romantic and funny scene full of humor. <br /> <br /> This real goal of this movie revolves around more about the monk that was Saved primarily from being devoured by demonic flying creatures. One of his students, the Monkey God, managed to get him out of the battle just in time, but in turn he was captured by the demons and thrown into the deep throat of a dragon, locked in that particular dungeon. <Br /> <br /> The monk woke up in a small town where he met Mei Yan (the so-called daughter of the ugly snake) who fell in love with him at first sight. Although ugly, he did not let his appearance be discarded apart from reaching him. However, the search to rescue his three students will soon be filled with obstacles and each of them will get worse with Mei Yan following the monk. The problems deepened and this is where the conflicts between the relationships get worse. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story would remain at your disposal, but suffice it to say that this film does not describe the typical history of the story. book, it is more for those who want to look for a funny and light image of what the Journey to the West and the obstacles of love really mean. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, you can describe the whole summary with one word, and that is love. The monk went to show the Celestial Gates, the Heavenly Palace and the Buddha himself, how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and is considered the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of higher powers. <br /> <br /> Beautifully created and fun acts await those who buy this ticket. Of course, there would be no regrets, at least on my part and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same movie.
