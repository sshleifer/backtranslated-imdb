(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> Russia in the thirteenth century. The opening shot shows the relics of the last invasion: spawning uniforms, human skulls and the skeleton of a horse. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) drove away the Swedish army and impressed the Mongol ruler to such an extent that he intends to promote him to the rank of captain. But Nevsky replies: "Die in your native land, but do not leave it." Try fishing, build boats and trade. But it warns of a more dangerous enemy: closer, more petty and without possibility of being bought: Germany. Your goal is Novgorod. They have already reached Pskov: mothers and daughters suffer for their parents and children. The marauding occupation forces distribute the louse. The rich merchants want to buy their freedom (it is always a place for the struggle against the capitalist), but the "common people" are ready to fight. They want Alexander as their leader. Pskov burns to the ground. The Teutonic Knights feel invincible and have a smug smile for Russian women who are powerless witnesses of how their parents and children are killed. The babies are thrown into the fire while the high dignitaries of the church observe and remain inactive. In Novgorod: Olga Danilovna has two admirers: rich and serious Gavrilo and high and cheerful Vasili. She promises to marry the bravest. Vasili calls Alexander Nevsky in Perejaslav. The prince decides not to wait for the attack but to attack at the same time. Even women put on chain armor ... The invaders want to prime the "Russian bear", but Nevsky's stratagem withstood the test: Lake Peipus is his war zone: his men know the territory but the Germans, who they are heavier, they will break through the ice ... <br /> <br /> Open your eyes and see the most impressive battle scenes ever filmed. It is not only the multitude of extras (which were, I believe, pressed in this patriotic exercise), but the masterful handling of Eisenstein of such a large number of individuals: it displaces divisions like pieces on a chessboard and almost all the shots look alike to the composition of a painting by Rembrandt or Rubens (including horses with fantastic outfits). Russia, in winter, seems intimidating in itself, but Eisenstein's visual imagination is a contest. Heaps of corpses plunge into the cosmic light under an infinite horizon. At nightfall, Olga and other women search with surviving torches. A devotee falcon sits on his master's corpse while a crow waits for the right moment to distinguish the eyes of the deceased. The direction of Eisenstein and the score of Prokofiev make ALEXANDER NEVSKY the "Rolls Royce" among the propaganda films. Nevsky is, of course, Stalin's alter ego, and Russians are tall, attractive, heroic and have a perfect hairstyle. The Germans are bearded savages and look like members of the Ku-Klux-Klan. The actor who plays Vasili offers a performance of a man and four characters: first hesitant, then heroic, young lover and comic relief. The main duty of Cherkasov is to look heroic. In the end, Nevsky-Stalin shows his generosity: he forgives the "little soldiers" and accommodates the knights for soap. Only a bearded assassin and a traitor cleric are handed over to the mafia. Do not forget a final warning: whoever comes with the sword will die by the sword ... He fulfilled his promise. 10/10
