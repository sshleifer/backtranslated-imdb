Clint Eastwood plays a wounded soldier of the Union found by a girl from a boarding school in the Confederation and he is welcomed and treated again to health instead of handing it over to the soldiers of the Confederacy. It seems that the women in this place have hidden motives. Geraldine Paige, the director, justifies not turning it into the Confederation and even makes it happen as a cousin. Of course, when the man feels better, he becomes a great lady man and is practically doing the rounds, but when he is caught, he is REALLY caught, in fact, his leg is cut, but it is for his own good . Of course, not for retribution. Things go a little further when certain women do not get what they want. I have not seen this for years and still have a certain chill that by today's standards is still quite strange. It's not typical of Eastwood at all. If you have not seen it, it's worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
