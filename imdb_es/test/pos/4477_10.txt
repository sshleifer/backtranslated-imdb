This movie is beautiful in every way. It is visually impressive, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take one or two pages of paper. The acting is excellent; It is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of becoming an animal, and mixing that wild nature with the dominant passion and honor of a man. There is no fault, no mistake or wrong moment that can be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you are going to experience. It is not a movie for anyone who wants normality.
