This is one of the most gruesome and creepy Bergman movies I've seen. I also believe that this is one of the most powerful films about the ugliness of war and what it does to human souls. <br /> <br /> The pair of musicians, who left a big city for a remote island and formed a living as farmers, are able to perform shameful and shameful acts that normally would have been impossible for them to imagine, while struggling to survive the horrible reality of war. They betray their souls, their friends and even others in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are brilliant, as usual, like a lost, confused and terrified couple who were trapped in the middle of a civil war. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
