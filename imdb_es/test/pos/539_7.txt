It's a movie to watch on TV and only once. I mean, it's fine, but it's a bit long and the plot is very well known, it's not very original but it's not boring. The best of the film are the performances, Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon are a great actress and in this film they have done a great job. I give him a 7.
