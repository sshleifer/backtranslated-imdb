One can not help but be impressed with the intelligence and scale of this film, and at the same time disappointed by the missed opportunities. <br /> <br /> I found Edmund Purdom's script and vocal talent to be quite impressive. However, as an artifact of his time, the film suffers from too many holisms of Hollywood, especially the bad releases, too much exuberance of sets and too much pretension. Edmund Purdom (who plays the title character) is so uncomfortable with physical acting, I suspect he had been in Shakespeare's theater before. <br /> <br /> So, if movie people are reading this, I propose it as an excellent candidate for a remake, especially if you choose real Egyptians as Egyptians!
