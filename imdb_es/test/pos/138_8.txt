Although sometimes I was the only one in the movies who laughed, this is the main pleasure I took from the beautifully filmed "Sed", laughter. Although at times it seemed that the film had an identity crisis and I did not know if it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest black humor shone at regular intervals. <br /> <br /> Of course, it helped that the performance standard of everyone involved was wonderful, and that I was a little obsessed with the sometimes evil protagonist, who was superbly elegant, no matter how drenched and malevolent she was. . became. <br /> <br /> I read reviews that suggested that this movie was too long. I did not think. In fact, the last scenes, touching and hilarious (I mean, brown shoes ...) in turns, were among the best in the film.
