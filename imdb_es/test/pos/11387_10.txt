Some time ago I saw a video of Paul Thomas Anderson in which he expressed the great interest he has in porn movies and how this industry could have produced better films and, consequently, a complete genre and not just sex on a videotape . Paul Thomas Anderson put his own beliefs of the porn industry into the character played excellently by Burt Reynolds. His name is Jack Horner, a director whose biggest dream is to make a "real" movie that can keep the viewer in suspense due to the great dramatic story and, at the same time, exciting with beauty. and with the "big cocks and tits". As soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he thinks he has found the new star for his films. And that's how the story of young Eddie in the porn industry begins. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a sequence inside a nightclub where we can see all the people who will be part of Eddie's life and later on They can see them outside the porn industry, living their daily routine . But soon we can see them in the porn industry and after a single party, the story of the new Eddie begins, the story of Dirk Diggler. All of them will prove the real success with Dirk as the main star, winning many awards and helping Jack to realize his biggest dream with a series of films about Brock Landers, the new character of Dirk. This type of exploitation films are an amazing success and for Jack are his first "real" movies. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "horrible 80's" when there will be $ ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and friends. But we all know that excess can destroy any person and erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses on their lives after the total success and how everyone is having a bad time with many problems due to the bad aspect of society. Porn industry and a period with many excesses. In Dirk's decline, after trying and failing in the music industry, there is a brilliant sequence that can perfectly sum up how things are going for Dirk and his friends. That sequence is that of his first drug business, with the appearance of Alfred Molina, which ends in a total disaster. It's fun for us and it's a terrible experience for Dirk and his friends, but there's always a solution if he comes back with what he knows and when Dirk comes back, Brock is back. <br /> <br /> Well, I have not mentioned more of the characters in my summary type, but I must say that they are all surprisingly well developed. The cast is simply magnificent with the best performance I've seen from Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has a powerful acting in a really touching character; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc. They are memorable, all their characters with funny and sad moments. <br /> <br /> Finally, I love Anderson's incredible cinematic style with a unique view of the porn industry in the late 70s and early 80s. I used to say that "Magnolia" was my favorite of Anderson, but at this moment, after seeing everything except "Sidney", I can not say that I have a favorite because I love them all! <br /> <br /> PS: Somewhere I read that this movie is Anderson's "Scorsese movie", so I'm more than positive that if you like "Goodfellas" and "Casino", you'll love this too. I f * cking love "Boogie Nights"!
