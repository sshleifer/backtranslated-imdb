Every time that the supposed explorers and we, the public, are ready to see for the first time one of the new marvelous worlds, for some unholy reason, the filmmakers decided to get distracted by an "emergency" or some false alarm or a bit of artificial drama . suspense. <br /> <br /> Then, instead of quietly enjoying Io's surface, or standing on Saturn's rings or concentrating on the magic of flying by a comet or an asteroid, we become distracted by worrying about the well-being and the survival of the characters. Big disappointment !!!! <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seem to be unsure of what they want. A documentary of the natural wonders in our solar system, or a thriller of suspense in which the viewer is more concerned with the characters than with the theme. Come on. <br /> <br /> Hello. If I wanted suspense and tension, I would see a true narrative science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> Of course it's a docu-drama. But the characters and their survival here (the risks of such a mission - should be secondary to the theme). I waited. Yes, the risks of such a mission are an important part of the topic, since it is essentially a movie about a space mission, not just about the solar system. But I was overrated and distracted strongly from the discovery of new worlds that we were supposed to be enjoying. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic feel to the human elements of a space mission, the disputes, the tensions, the weight of responsibility, the almost fatal errors, the sacrifices , etc. It would also fit very well in the hard science fiction subgenre, in fact, it would be one of the best, because here science was almost totally adhered to. <br /> <br /> But the distractions were terrible. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I did not see the effects of being in space for several years in astronauts AFTER landing on Earth.
