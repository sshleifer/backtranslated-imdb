One of the best hidden and lesser known horror films of the seventies. It's rough, exciting, scary, surreal here and there, and in some moments even very smart, what can not be said about many of the films of this type. I can not avoid seeing some symbolic and metaphorical points in the society of the seventies and in the things of the time in which this film was made. Obviously, the scriptwriter has been cooking while offering some old scenes "from the crypt". With a job well done by a creative director, the result is entertaining and stimulating. The simple but effective ending shows especially how these things are treated correctly by those who can. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast was almost unknown to me, except LQ Jones as the bad-tempered but funny sheriff and Strother Martin as the city doctor. Martin, of course, always ends up stealing the movie. With that voice and skill, he's one of the best crazy people in the movies, for me anyway. What an actor! <br /> <br /> So, for me it's a bit mysterious why this movie has not received much more recognition. I think he deserves an almost equal place in the horror cannon hidden next to Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. A hellish movie!
