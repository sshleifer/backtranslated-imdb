I saw Bandit Queen in 2005, more than a decade after it was produced in the middle of a great controversy in India. The language, the strict treatment and the natural performance (for a relatively unknown cast for that time) could have been even more impressive at that time for an Indian population more familiar with fantasy cinema. The film, the cast and Shekhar Kapoor, deserve praise for the breakthrough. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very different from a typical vengeance drama performed in various forms in India. In fact, there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story. The reason why this stands out is that it is supposed to be a first-person account of someone who really went through all this, and many other things that do not find a place on the screen, and survived to tell it. He survived long enough to see his story turned into a movie at least. Phoolan Devi did not live long after he got out of prison in 1994. <br /> <br /> The film has several aspects. The cinematography is great. The music is apt. The cast, many of whom became more familiar names later, is very good. But the script is irregular. Things move too fast and in pulls sometimes. However, it is understandable, because there are too many strands that must be united to make everything cohesive. Or maybe I felt it because I read Mala Sen's book, which is a more detailed and better, though obviously not so shocking, visual account of Phoolan Devi, and which is supposed to be one of the main sources of the film. <br /> <br /> There are also some objective ambiguities. According to Phoolan Devi, she was not present when the Behmai massacre occurred, and despite claiming that it is Phoolan's dictated story, it is shown that she participates and, in fact, initiates, the massacre. Then, the final scene where Phoolan surrenders the sample touching the feet of the Chief Minister, while in reality he had surrendered to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Only symbolic value, but it shows that Phoolan did not want to show servitude to a common and living person. It would have been good to show the Chief Minister that he resembled Arjun Singh, who many remember was the CM of Madhya Pradesh. <br /> <br /> But these are small cracks in this eminently well-made film. a rare gem from the Indian film industry, made by a man who was once known as the best masala film of the late 1980s: Mr. India.
