Chris Nolan's labyrinth as noir about voyeurism and identity is incredible from beginning to end. A first film is as complex as "Memento" or "The Prestige", although maybe a little harder to handle. It still smells of originality and creativity, and has a "twist" as intellectually challenging as a realistic pulp. Few filmmakers have taken advantage of both the use of their editors and the attention to the narrative that Nolan has. The story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street, until he follows someone, who realized that he followed others and has been following him, from there complexity increases and identities begin to reorganize. More naturalistic and realistic than Nolan's later work, but just as sharp.
