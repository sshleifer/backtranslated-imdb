Who are the people who star in this thing? I've never heard of them! But this is one of the funniest comedies I've found. I should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parodia. The absurd begins when Dr. Jeykl snorts and becomes a demon of sex. He is chased by the nurse in charge of the libido at the beginning of the film in one of the funniest scenes in the film. Pay attention to the PA system of the hospital in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has made me laugh for years. Oh ... and the "Busty Nurse" is Cassandra Peterson, who became Elvira, the lover of darkness. <br /> <br /> If you liked the classic Mel Brooks movies (Blazing Saddles, etc.), I suspect you would like this one. <br /> <br /> Damn it, you can not get it. DVD anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's available on DVD now !!!!! The good thing is that DVDs do not wear out!
