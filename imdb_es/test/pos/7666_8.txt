This show was amazing, but too esoteric for most people. If you had never really seen a European variety show in the 70s or 80s (or at least one Mexican one), the entire program would probably be lost. If you had done it, this show was a dead one in the satire of the false shows and the superficiality in which these programs are submerged in their worst moment. Attracted by a hip-hopper who smokes softly with a mustache pencil and his ultra-glamorous and immasculated harridan of an ex-wife, "Viva Variety" is a variety show that tries to take off from the ground in every episode, but always descends to the fight. And the acts have gone very badly. The hosts are joined by "Johnny Bluejeans", a side kick that seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in their country and that means that children will like it, which of course they do not like. . <br /> <br /> The result was a hilarious parody of variety shows in general. Imagine the argument that BACKSTAGE probably occurred during the last days of the "Sonny & Cher Show". Now imagine that ONSTAGE is happening in front of you and the stars are trying to maintain their composure. Now add cheesy acts and a Euro-rich mentality (tuxedo, gowns, alcohol, accents and smoke). NOW you have "Viva Variety". <br /> <br /> Have you ever listened to a musician whose music was written for other musicians? Too conceptual? Viva Variety did this for the comedians. WAY too esoteric for the standard American audience. It was phenomenally funny. And condemned.
