This is a horror movie of the early 80's in which a young girl (Meg Tilly) wants to get rid of her "shoes of two" image and becomes part of a gang called The Sisters. Her initiation for her consists of spending the night in a mausoleum. Pity that the mausoleum is the "last" resting place of a psycho-Russian psychic and is not yet completely dead. It seems that this guy was found in his apartment with many things trapped in the walls of his telekinetic target practice, in addition to that there are a lot of dead young girls found in the closet. All evidence that the hitch can be dangerous, so listen to the girls. The daughter of this man (Reymar) is a little distressed by the death of his father and faces a man who said he knew Reymar and they gave him a tape to listen too. Her husband (Adam West, of Batman's fame) is there to laugh and mock, and not much else. But it seems that maybe Reymar's daughter may also have some skills that she does not realize. Anyway, after depositing his unfortunate promise in the mausoleum, the rest of the Sisters have gone to look for things (like masks, sheets, etc.) to come back and scare her, but little suspect what's going on and They get more that the shit that scares them Even in death, Reymar is a very busy guy and is reviving many corpses to entertain himself. And it also seems that he has one thing for prison bait. In general, this is an acceptable horror, nothing too intense but not terrible either. The Media Blasters DVD also contains another version of the movie that is a rough cut, I guess, I just saw it a bit, so I do not know how different it is from the theatrical premiere, but from what I saw, I think it's a Presentation "warts and all". 7 out of 10
