When I saw this film at a festival years ago, I was very impressed and started looking for it. There is nothing to do, either in theaters, on DVD or in Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How is it possible that this really can happen? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way. The music is perfect and James Franco is very hot! <br /> <br /> Drop this masterpiece and let it have It's the proper life !!!!!!!!!! This is really a great movie that people should see and deserve another chance! <br /> <br /> Edvard
