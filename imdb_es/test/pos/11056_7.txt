The short film that put Gaspar Noe on the map of the film, introduced us to his horrible but very interesting character, The Butcher, played brilliantly by Phillipe Nahon. Noe's address here has all the hallmarks of his latest films, and shows that from the beginning he was recording his own voice and style. Its sudden cut, along with loud and harsh noise, skipping flashbacks and many other techniques, are used to baffle the viewer. And it certainly works. In addition, he is not afraid to show violence, as the spectators of Irreversible will know. Here the violence is equally powerful, and in the sequel to Seoul Contre Tous, it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a horse being killed. They shoot him in the head and we see him writhing on the ground, his pool of blood flows out. Then we see a human birth in all its bloody glory, the daughter of The Butcher. He was orphaned in the Second World War, and has grown up hating the world, everyone and everything in it. He serves his clients, but his inner monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts: he wants them all dead. His daughter Blandine Lenoir, who would also resume his role six years later, is the only thing that matters to him, and we see them grow together. However, she is mute, and the subject of bullying and gambling. The Butcher's relationship with her is almost incestuous, bathing her when she is old enough to do it herself, etc., but this is explored more in the next film. When she is attacked by a man, the Butcher explodes with rage, stabbing an innocent man in the mouth. He goes to jail, taken out of the only things he wants: his shop and his daughter. In the short 40 minutes we see all this and more, his time in prison and his release back to his world. Due to the state of her daughter, I think she is also autistic, she is insipid, recently except to look, and is under the total control of her father. The film continues in the exceptionally gloomy Seoul Contre Tous. If you can, look at these two movies, this first one. It has a really excellent performance, but it is very difficult to see due to the implacable tone. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
