From the director of Oldboy comes this vampire movie. Kang-ho Song stars as a priest who accidentally turns into a vampire while heals a deadly and mysterious virus. His vampirism and priesthood are quite at odds, but he can survive by stealing the hospital's blood bank and unconscious patients who may not care for a bit of blood drawn. Due to his supposed miraculous survival, he enters the life of Ha-kyun Shin's family. Shin has cancer and his mother believes Song can cure him. Unfortunately, Song's vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he can not avoid falling to Shin's young wife, OK-vin Kim. Kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism, and the two become lovers. The movie there goes in strange directions that I think you should experience for yourself. What really should be mentioned is the control of Chan-wook Park in the middle of the cinema. My God, I have rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers. The main flaw of the film is that it is a bit incoherent, especially near the beginning. Park is interested in telling his stories mainly in images, which can sometimes be difficult to follow. But when it works, man, it flies. The movie is also perversely hilarious. The final sequence, easily one of the best of the decade, is both heartbreaking and deliciously ridiculous. OK-vin Kim should become a world star after this movie. She gives one of the best performances of the year.
