"One Dark Night" is a staple in the low-budget horror genre of the 1980s. Filled with retro puns, clothes and set design, "ODN" transports the viewer to a simpler moment, when the films of terror were just that ... Terror! <br /> <br /> Nothing so intense that you can not understand what's happening. From now on, the film tells a dark fable of what happens when you mess with the dead. Well acted by the stable of shouts and queens, and an excellent directorial work by Tom McLoughlin, who delights in time and makes you believe what he is presenting. There is no "Who did it?" And certainly there is not a big turn at the end. It is direct and in his face the horror from beginning to end, with a lot of humor of the 80s to add flavor. I give it "8" simply because some of the special effects fall short towards the end of the film, but at least there is no CGI ... Perfect movie for new fans of the horror genre of the 80s, or for anyone who wants relive. A fun night of classic terror.
