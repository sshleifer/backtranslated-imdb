Pitch Black is a survival story. It is about how to survive in a hostile and strange world against even more hostile enemies. The task becomes even more difficult when the closest enemies can be found within their own surviving group. <br /> <br /> The plot of Pitch Black is quite common and has been seen several times before in different variations. But what makes this film shine above others is that they are well written. <br /> <br /> The group is made up of very different people, with some more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot who has difficulties with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty hunter with a drug habit; Imam, a holy man before the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer who learns to value others, not only himself. The characters begin to live in the movie. They are not just paper like in many other films of this genre. You start taking care of the characters, especially Riddick, although that feels pretty strange. He is supposed to be the bad boy. In this film, the line between light and black tone is very thin. All the characters are familiar with both. <br /> <br /> Another thing that works in this movie is casting. Rarely do actors adjust to their roles so well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelty and sense of responsibility to Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does a great job as Riddick. In his hands, Riddick is quite spooky, definitely very dangerous and also a deep character, just as he is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> So, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and the enemies even closer.
