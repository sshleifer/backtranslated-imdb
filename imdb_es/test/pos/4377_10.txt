It may be an exaggeration to say this as a Carlin fanatic, but the material, both written and interpreted, in It's Bad for Ya is one of the best materials of the late era. At age 70, Carlin recovers from the level of despair (and some of the stumbles in the act itself) of Life is Worth Losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful, or as much as the "old shit" . You can get and it's continuously, incessantly, fun. And funny, as in the memory of what some of us had been doing when we saw Back in Town or 'Diseased' for the first time. The material, even if it sometimes sounds a tinge of what was done previously (ie, everything about the children in the school and the camp as the segment of Children in the sick), is always fresh and with a touch of truth to everything that scalds the mind. while (here it goes) tickling the funny bone. <br /> <br /> Moving on from the subject of death (how long to wait to scratch a name from the book? six weeks, unless it is in the computer programmer), the facets of communication, look from the sky, the places of God (naturally), the children and the problematic gestures that involve hats in religion and if people really have "rights" make up most of the specialty, centered on the premise that what is bad You, plain and simple, is BS. Total, complete BS, which as we also learn (or if you really learned it, you are like the child waiting on the corner of the street for a week after the father left him, not randomly) keeps the country united. However, Carlin is not necessarily angry, although disdain seems to surface on most shifts, even to observe how horrible the children's teeth look. It is a skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything will NOT be "right". <br /> <br /> It all comes down to this: Carlin is an impromptu, witty and cautious comedy, what Yoda is for the Jedi everywhere, which is a small spark of hope through a crystalline wisdom in a world where it is very difficult to get something. At least, we get the classic GC: outrageous lines and fragments of comedy number 13 (or is the 14th) of man, which includes even the observation of people who play Mozart music during a birth!
