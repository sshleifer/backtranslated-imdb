A fantastic comic strip / drama / farce resembling a screwdriver swan facing the implosion of France in 1939. Played with great breadth and straight face by a talented cast and chockablock with action, satire, social commentary and authentic details of the Time, from elegant hairstyles and hairstyles to a fleet of CitroÃ«n "Tractions", a fun and short soundtrack but believable imitations of Charles de Gaulle and Marshal Petain. <br /> <br /> It is simply one of the best entertainment recently shown on the screen, without presumption or "message". If the movies were trains (and there is a creative recreation of a trip on a steam-powered train that works even though there is no steam locomotive (an expensive accessory, no doubt), this would be a TGV).
