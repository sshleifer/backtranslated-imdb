Dirty Dancing follows the story of Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Gray) and her family as they spend the summer at Kellerman's Family Summer Camp. We can see her discovering herself when she falls in love with the dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). <br /> <br /> The movie is full of wonderful dances (hence the title!), Great music, and a fantastic landscape. It handles some difficult problems with dignity and grace, and, of course, it has (a shocking spoiler here!) A happy, wonderful ending, of feeling good! You know how it's going to end from the beginning, but that's not the point here. The point is the trip, a trip that touches all the members of the family. <br /> <br /> It's one of the movies I need to watch every time it appears on TV ... it does not matter that I already have it. memorized
