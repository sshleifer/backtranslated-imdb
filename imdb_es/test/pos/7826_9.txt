It is very easy to understand why The New Professionals was a failure, at least in New Zealand: not only followed in the footsteps of the original, but followed Bodyguards, which greatly exceeded the professionalism of the show with its boss and Formula of two agents. Major McIntyre was a George Cowley of the last days: he was tough with his team, but one that defended them to death against others. The shadow that projected the show was enormous. <br /> <br /> Well, not as big as it should have been in the UK. Here, I was on network during prime time. It was even marketed in promotions as "They are the professionals". Someone else obviously noticed the difference. We were lucky not to have this program launched in different regions in different time slots. <br /> <br /> It was the high production values ​​that sealed the deal for me. As noted by other reviewers, he followed the great British tradition of the one-hour activist, but combined personal elements at the same time. There is a slight undercurrent of something that is developing between Liz and Ian, although that never distracted one from the real plot. Most of the episodes were based on inflammatory diplomatic incidents, the kind of things that help Spooks over time. <br /> <br /> Unlike many shows of the 2000s, the plot was not sacrificed at the expense of fancy pants photography or more. - Elegant management. Directors like Christopher Young kept up the pace and did their job. They made good use of places, making bodyguards more skilled than if they had been fired on back roads and alleys. It was contemporary, it would still stay very well today, and it was one of the best examples of the British activist in the 1990s, which shows that the UK can still do better than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Maybe Except the Germans and their Cobra 11.
