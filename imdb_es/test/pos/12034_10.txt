This movie has 4 parts and each one lasts around 170 minutes. It is based on the true story of Joe Bonanno's life and tells how he saw it. So in some events we can notice that we have heard different about it. The film makes you occupy the chair until the end, I think it is possible to see the 4 followed, and not notice that I saw 2 followed and 2 the next day in a row. Acting in the movie is fine in some impressive scenes, but overall it could be aggressive, but this movie is not about acting or special effects and glamor, this real show and story is key to this movie. So anyone looking for the same spectacular Rambo / matrix / titanic movie can skip it. The good thing about the movie is that it follows the main story so you do not have long and boring love scenes or any other interruption with something that is not important to Bonanno's crime business.
