Starting from characters previously developed in a series of highly praised short films, THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT is as far from the common "family meal" as you can get: beautifully designed and with an ingenious and intelligent dialogue concepts, this is really a movie that will attract almost every member of the family. <br /> <br /> The story concerns Wallace and his dog Gromit, who live in a town obsessed with growing large vegetables for the annual fair and those who operate "Anti-Pesto," a humane solution for all those annoying rabbits that torment the passionate gardeners everywhere. The business is a great success, but Wallace proves to be a little too smart for his own good. When it tries to "rehabilitate" rabbits from their crunchy forms of vegetables, it unexpectedly unleashes an ancient horror of legendary proportions: the Were-Rabbit! And suddenly no vegetable in the city is safe! The film is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly intelligent dialogues and references to everything from KING KONG to THE WOLF MAN, more than enough to attract even a jaded teenager, but the real charm of the thing is in its characters. The amount of personality that artists and animators can extract from pieces of clay is amazing: they seem to be as alive as any actor of flesh and blood. The launch of the DVD (and I recommend the widescreen) also includes a series of informative and entertaining extras. Highly recommended! GFT, Amazon Reviewer
