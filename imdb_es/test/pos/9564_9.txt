"Best In Show" tracks the stories of a handful of human participants as they prepare for one of the biggest dog shows on the calendar. Any amateur psychologist would say that an unconditional love and obsession with a pet is a sign that something is missing in someone's life, and each of the characters somehow fills this clich√©. There is the old high school hottie who is now married to a geek man, the yuppie couple without children, obsessed with the seal, the bachelor of nature, the young wife of an old and rich coder (along with his dog handler of short hair) and the gay couple <br /> <br /> What makes this film so much fun is the way in which it portrays these stereotypes in a completely credible, almost affectionate way, in many cases. Every ridiculous thing that one of the characters does or says, with his dog as an innocent bystander, seems to be the kind of behavior you expect to see in a dog show. <br /> <br /> The biggest laughs come from the commentator team of a fully American-style sports announcer, comparing moments in a dog show with parts of a baseball game, and their English, canine academician, foil. <br /> <br /> The evidence of the geeky husband as his The blonde wife encounters an amazing number of men from her past, which is also good for laughing, as well as the insane behavior of the yuppie couple as that increases the pressure, while your dog remains completely baffled. <br /> <br /> Well worth looking - even if the cats are more your bag.
