My family really enjoyed this movie. As for what this film will do for Rugby in the United States ... well, I'm sure it will be debatable. But as for me and the others around me, I know that after watching the movie we were more curious about the sport and, personally, I gained more respect for the game. You can ask how it is possible, especially because the film does not submerge and explains Rugby. But the simple fact is that it attracted you to the players and the excitement of the game and life. The film was inspiring and entertaining. He made us laugh and cry. The chemistry between Sean Astin, Big Budah and Sean Faris worked well. Some may think that the movie is a little cliché, but seriously I would like Hollywood to make more movies like this one. I could not help drawing analogies of the game and the struggles of life. In the end, I found myself examining my own life to see what I needed to do better, to be the best person I could be. Sincerely, I was grateful that this film taught morals, values ​​and teamwork, there is much to the contrary. After seeing this, I really hope that my children are trained by someone who has a philosophy like Coach Gelwix.
