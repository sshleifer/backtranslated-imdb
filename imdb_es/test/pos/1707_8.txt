Tia Carrere was the reason why I decided to watch this movie, since neither the title nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money in this movie. what shows, to me and to all, that a DVD should not be judged by its cover. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** The movie felt like it was rolling, without really going anywhere at the moment ?? the discomfort of Paul Faber (Zak Orth) around the girls was almost too embarrassing to watch, and the fringe on the sexy Kirsten Beck (as Alexondra Lee) was too young to see. Where were they really fashionable in 1995? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Vicky Mueller (Tia Carrere) and Todd Boomer (Jason London) was tempting from the start! That first encounter across the lake? magical. What a beautiful coincidence they should meet again, since he has behaved like a complete imbecile ("Boomer, with two O as an imbecile?") In front of Alexondra. A pity that we, as a public, knew who Vicky Mueller really was. (Well? The title revealed it, do not you think?) <br /> <br /> What really surprised me was the performance. Especially in the scene where Vicky gives Todd a metal version of her alter ego (the dog character), in the little white jewelry box. Did the actors really manage to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss? Point of no return for Todd and Vicky. It's a shame that the film ends up focusing (after beating Todd's parents at Harvard) in his re-union with his friends. Could you imagine a completely new movie? Following Vicky to New York? There must be a good art college there that Todd can attend?!? <br /> <br /> However, a movie that does exactly what we want Hollywood to: entertain us for the duration of the movie. Did anyone else notice that any of the loves are happy in this movie? Todd's mother is a little crazy (on the phone, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), her father does not find her attractive (more?) Obviously Todd's teacher is disenchanted with his wife and vice versa? Todd himself enters into a wonderfully erotic and daring relationship that, however pleasant it may be, would be very difficult to maintain (age difference, difference in maturity, etc.), and Alexondra and Zak do not meet because Alexondra is not enough mature to handle a relationship (-> their reactions to the condom, deception, Zak's advances, etc. are all very immature and, often, involve running away), and Zak himself, the poor? It is too much of a best friend / as a brother-man to attract even Alexondra. <br /> <br /> But yes, good movie! I gave him an 8/10. Brilliant performance of the actors, who give life to the script.
