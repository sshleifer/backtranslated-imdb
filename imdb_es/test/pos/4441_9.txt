The documentaries in which the sons and daughters seek to understand a father and, by the process, their own lives are not so infrequent. Neither are uncommon results that reflect lack of talent, a failure in introspection, a large amount of narcissism and, perhaps, a subtle search for public vengeance punctuated by innumerable past, real and fantasized wounds. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and fascinating portrait of a fascinating father and "My architect: The journey of a son" is that rare accomplishment. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally marked by an accident. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia, where the talented young man loved art and music. He soon fell in love with buildings and decided that only an architect's career would respond to his creative abilities. <br /> <br /> Kahn became an architect, but as this film shows it was a long time before he attracted the attention of leaders in his field. One architect suggests that he was a victim of the "yellow bracelet", that anti-Semitism, together with prejudice against women, was for a long time a bad-reputation aspect of the American architecture profession. <br /> <br /> When you managed to notice it. He was seen, clearly precise, as a self-confident, work-addicted prophet who exclaimed the inflexible demands that his vision and only his vision be realized. That inflexibility was the reason why, while drawing wonderful plans for many buildings, he built a few. The interview with an elderly gentleman who fired Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars on the perimeter and walked into the city is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Kahn was a born teacher and some of the extensive archive images here show him with students, his firm but passionate voice, his respectful and intense looks. <br /> <br /> Many architects were interviewed by the director, writer and project manager Nathaniel Kahn, the only architect. son. Some are world famous - I. M. Pei, Robert A.M. Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Gehry and the still active nonagenarian, Philip Johnson. His comments paint a vivid image of this idealist, but in the end, financially unsuccessful designer of buildings that combined the castles, fortresses and grand buildings of centuries past in designs for the present. The buildings of Kahn are shown, among the most impressive of the Salk research laboratories in La Jolla, California. For me, his style has a neo-romantic air dead for too much blank space that repels instead of attracting human interaction. <br /> <br /> But Kahn's son was looking for something more than the story of his father, the architect. For many years, Louis Kahn had three families: a wife with whom he had a daughter and two long-term relationships, one of which produced a daughter, the other a son. Kahn visited his son in the mother's house often, but at the end of an afternoon, mother and son took Kahn back to the matrimonial home. Nathaniel clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships, but it does not seem to be marked by what was certainly a strange issue for a small child. <br /> <br /> When Nathaniel was a child, Louis Kahn died of a heart attack in the men's room of the Pennsylvania station in New York after returning from India, where he had launched one of his massive projects , another that was never built. At that time, his Philadelphia firm had at least $ 500,000 in debt and, if he had lived, a trip to the federal bankruptcy court was probably in sight. <br /> <br /> Kahn left several monumental structures, of which is the government building in Bangladesh. Clearly the largest. A tearful local architect hails Kahn for creating a building where democracy can flourish (and hopefully he will). <br /> <br /> Comrade architect Moshe Safdie thinks there might be something appropriate in Kahn's suffering from a deadly heart attack at a train station given his incessant globe-trotting. I do not agree: it is sadly ironic that Kahn should die in the faceless replacement of one of the true architectural gems of the United States, the former Pennsylvania Station, destroyed to make way for a sterile replacement without character or continuation of civic memory . <br /> <br /> There are a series of emotional moments filmed during the young Kahn's trip, including with his stepsisters and his mother, but they are genuine and moving, they are not concentrated and organized. The historians of architecture will always study Kahn. His son found reasons to remember him as a defective man but very iconoclastic and, ultimately, private. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
