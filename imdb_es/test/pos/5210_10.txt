People of my generation and older people know about the Second World War (or as it is called in Russia, the Great Patriotic War) not only school textbooks, but also witnesses and participants of the event. My grandfather was a soldier in Stalingrad and when I was a little girl I used to hear his stories of how he defeated the Germans. He also told me some anecdotes, not everything he told me was bleak. But it was a long time ago, and no, when I have a conscious interest in what happened there at the Battle of Stalingrad, I have to turn to books and movies to get information. Somehow, most of the films I saw were made in the Soviet Union, only a few in Russia today. And "Stalingrad" is an exception. In the film, war is described from the opposite side, and the fact itself is interesting. Everything that is shown in the movie is very different from what I'm used to. <br /> <br /> The film reminds me a lot of "Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben" by Remarque, because the war is shown through an ordinary perception of the German soldier. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed in repeating that he is not a fascist. The heroes of the cinema, coming from a clean and enthusiastic Europe, from the Italian coast come to the hungry Soviet Union covered in snow. They are condemned to die; It is clear from the beginning. <br /> <br /> After the elite detachment participated in their first fight in Stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the phrase that reflected the whole idea for me; He said: "If you start thinking, you will go crazy." And in my opinion, it's also true for the viewers. On the one hand, one can think, it's okay, I'll only see this movie and it will not dissipate me, I should not feel sorry for the people on the screen, since they were the ones who attacked my country and not the other way around. . However, sooner or later, but inevitably one begins to sympathize with the characters. Probably when the lieutenant represses his tears to see the execution of Kolya. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is hard to see, all these legs frozen, earth, executions, snow, hunger, illusions destroyed. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, Lieutenant Hans von Witzland is one of the few films in which Thomas Kretschmann played his star roles. I saw many Hollywood movies where they gave him unimportant parts of small potatoes, like "Next" or "Trans-Siberian" (Why did he do it ?!). And after having seen "Stalingrad", I can not distinguish the desire of European actors to appear in American films, not even in second place at any price. The fact deeply disturbs me. I think that Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and scripts much better than those given in Hollywood. And from what I saw with him, "Stalingrad" is the best, beyond all doubt. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the worst drawback of "Stalingrad" is the way they speak Russian in the movie. I mean, of course, those who are supposed to be Russians. The boy who spent time with the Germans or the girl they planned to escape with. Was it really that difficult to find actors capable of pronouncing a couple of sentences without that horrible accent? Initially I started to watch "Stalingrad" just to listen to native German speakers because I am studying the language. I did not expect anything extraordinary from the movie. But it impressed me, made me cry when I was not going to. I know I'm 15 years late to see it, but "Stalingrad" is not a next-generation film, and after 15 years it can still be seen and is shocking.
