After the high temperatures of the dark place, it was never conceivable that Holness and Adobye could create anything as good as Garth Marengi. However, I think that from man to man in its own right is such a good show (about good episodes) as a dark place. I can not argue that 2 of the episodes really are not that good, but the other 4 certainly make up for it. If I had to choose 2 big episodes, go for the formula4 driver Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi. Already having a bit of understanding of the program is a real advantage, since Dean Learner makes a lot of internal jokes, but even if you have not seen much, Dean, I recommend it, since some of the comments he throws are great. Your discussion with Def Lepord about your name. All in All is a great show that simply misses all the ratings due to the few less funny episodes.
