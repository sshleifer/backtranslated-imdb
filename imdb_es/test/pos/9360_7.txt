"Crossfire" is apparently a murder mystery, but what distinguishes it from other similar films of the time is the killer's motive, which is anti-Semitism. The story highlights examples of the kind of ignorance that fuels fanaticism and contains references to a "mound" and an Irish immigrant who also suffered abuse because of his ethnic background. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is based on the work of Richard Brooks. Novel called "The Brick Foxhole", which deals with a hate crime where the victim was gay. It is ironic that this story about a form of intolerance is met with intolerance on the part of the censors who stipulated that, for the screen version, the type of intolerance involved should be changed by anti-Semitism. Another irony is the behavior of a soldier who seems very proud of having served in a war against the Nazis and yet embraces his hatred of the Jews. The director and producer of this film also suffered another type of intolerance when they were included in the blacklist after being called to appear before the "Activities Committee of the House of Non-American Representatives." All these points seem to underline the deeply rooted and intractable nature of the whole problem of fanaticism as shown in this film. <br /> <br /> When police captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), he discovers that on the night he was killed, Samuels had been socializing with a group of soldiers and one of they, Corporal Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell (George Cooper) is quickly identified as the main suspect. You also get more information from Montgomery (Robert Ryan), another of the soldiers who was present that night, and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), who is a friend of Mitchell. Keeley, with the help of other soldiers, then looks for Mitchell and when he finds him, he hears what he did the night of the murder, including his meeting with a dance hall hostess called Ginny Tremaine (Gloria Grahame). <br /> <br /> Keeley helps Michell avoid being arrested and tries to identify the killer. Ginny Tremaine is questioned, but her information is insufficient to prove Mitchell's innocence, but Finlay's investigations lead him to recognize the motive of the crime and, later, create a complex trap that leads the real culprit to expose his own guilt. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is a film with a message and the identity of the murderer is revealed at a very early stage of history. The "message" is transmitted in a way that was undoubtedly appropriate for the period in which it was made, but by today's standards it seems to be quite hard. J Roy Hunt's photography is simply marvelous, with little lighting and creative use of numerous strategically placed table lamps that combine to evoke an aspect that is perfectly compatible with the drama presented on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite this, being a low-budget production, "Crossfire" was a huge blockbuster and benefited from having an absorbing and very relevant story with a wonderful cast, two of which were Nominees for the Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan) and Best Supporting Actress. (Gloria Grahame) Additional nominations for Edward Dmytryk (Best Director), producer Adrian Scott (Best Picture) and John Paxton (Best Screenplay, Adapted Screenplay) are just one more proof of the positive recognition this film rightly received.
