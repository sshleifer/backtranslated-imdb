This show is absolutely fantastic. It provides all the great drama and romance of shows for teens like The OC and Dawsons, but it's much more fun. It is a show with moral values ​​and values, without everything being coated and disinfected with sugar (up to 7th Heaven). We do not have fraternities or fraternities in Australia, and our university system is completely different, so I have no idea how accurate Greek life is. portrayed But I do not care! Because this show is my new favorite! Any writer who can make me love a racist and homophobic Confederate flag aficionado must be a genius. <br /> <br /> And Cappie is my new Pacey. I'm sorry Josh Jackson, you've been dethroned!
