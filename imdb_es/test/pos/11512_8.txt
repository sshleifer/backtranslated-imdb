When reading the other comments here in the IMDB, I had many expectations before seeing 'Angels of the Universe'. I was not disappointed, and by giving the film an 8, I would say that I can justify that rating. <br /> <br /> The movie has an incredible performance, especially by the main person, Pall. The supporting actors are also doing a very good job as the patients in the mental institution, the parents and the brothers of Pall. It is also worth mentioning the music, supporting the film at all times, giving depth and feeling. <br /> <br /> Although the film is very Scandinavian, it does not leave aside the humor and has a kind of objective authorship about the life of Pall. . Still, if you want to watch a comedy or something light, this is not for you. It is a story about people with mental problems, about how they are treated in society, but above all, a story about Pall. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all movie connoisseurs. It is one of the best films that has left Iceland, if not Scandinavia.
