A very nice film job that should have had a wider distribution. Ian McShane is at home playing the DJ who loves souls because they are canned because he "does not agree with the program" and intends to inform the world what is being lost. The supporting cast is also great, and music is the "soul" of the movie. I just want the movie to be released so I can get a copy of this for my movie library.
