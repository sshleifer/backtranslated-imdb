The mandate of Tex Avery as cartoon director for MGM was in the 40s and 50s and was one of the brightest moments in the history of cartoons. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY strange touches that were then celebrated in the film THE MASK. The eyes open when a boy sees a girl, the impossible acrobatics and endless action are the trademarks of these movies. <br /> <br /> This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and is among her best. Droopy is a Mountie and is determined to get his man, ... although in this case he is a wolf who has escaped from prison. Throughout the film, despite many stunts, Droopy keeps up with this thief until finally the wolf surrenders because Droopy is seemingly everywhere. Full of funny jokes and full of laughter, this is a great caricature.
