(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school nymphomaniac who hooks up with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to meet her needs. Ronnie must show up at her National Guard unit and leave Rae completely alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the vagabond of the city with a powerful need to get together with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up hitting her half and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazaro (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and takes her home. Lazaro gives Rae medical attention and believes that he can also save her from herself. Rae is like a dog in heat, so Lazaro puts a 40-pound chain around her and her radiator to keep her from going out looking for men. Lazaro has his own problems, because his wife just left him for another man. LÃ¡zaro uses his blues music to relieve his pain. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The film has a profound meaning once you overcome sex and violence. The movie has a different feel. The story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there. The chain of 40 pounds is a good metaphor, and symbolic of a chastity belt. You do not give love to anyone, but you keep it for your true love. The chain could also be parallel to a wife who is chained to the kitchen, but Rae did not cook. Rae just wanted to have sex all the time, while a wife did not. I think Craig Brewer (writer and director) has made an extraordinary film, and Samuel L. Jackson sings a blues song. The story is full of emotions, addressing the issues of race, religion, music and sex, all in one. (Paramount Classics, Run Time 1:56, R rated) (8/10)
