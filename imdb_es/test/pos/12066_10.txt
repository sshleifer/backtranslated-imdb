This show is about to shine. He is a modern married ... with children. The scripts are ingenious, as they are peppered with intelligent sarcasm. They are also realistic and face problems that many parents of teenagers face today. In addition to the ongoing charge, you may not be the best father in the world and what is the best way to deal with this? However, at the same time, he manages to remain cheerful and fun. Which, with all the drama and action on television these days, is a very pleasant and welcome change. It's something you can sit in front of for 30 minutes and relax, laugh and relate. It is not the most hilarious comedy in the world. However, it will make you laugh at least a handful of times an episode. Michael Rapaport is brilliant up front like Dave. Fill the big shoes that the sarcastic script requires and some more. He and Anita Barone (Vikki) have fantastic chemistry and bounce very well. This program has a solid future if it is marketed in the correct target audience and placed in the correct timeframe. Also, if Fox releases it on DVD, the following will be stronger and bigger. (As is a classic example with Scrubs).
