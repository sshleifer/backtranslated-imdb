Although I'm not a big fan, I'm a purist of the Three Stooges. I think his best work, by far, was with Curly as the third Stooge and his first films are generally the best. That's because after a while, they started to remake their films and the gags began to become obsolete. Here, in 1934, they were still quite fresh (in more ways than one) and fun. <br /> <br /> Here, the boys play very unlikely roles: respected doctors in a hospital! The three go crazy acting silly, hitting each other and scaring anyone who hopes to improve. Uninterrupted energy and freshness make this a must-see for fans. <br /> <br /> By the way, although I liked this movie, I ONLY recommend that you try to find a much less familiar short of the educational ones. Images. NIFTY NURSES looks a lot like MEN IN BLACK, but it manages to be more fun and is about the best hospital comedy of the time, even better than the Laurel & Hardy COUNTY HOSPITAL.
