Once the slow start begins, the movie starts and it really becomes quite funny in many unexpected ways. The ensemble cast is really good, with Heather Graham perhaps the weakest of them all. Casey Affleck as his brother is really good and extremely nice, if you catch my drift. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie if you just want to have a good time. Teenagers should really enjoy this movie because it says a lot about relationships.
