Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous lovers in their day? Even an actor so often replaced as Michael Redgrave once brought a bit of whimsical charm to a representation of W.B. Yeats. The lives of writers are an inexhaustible source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> But of all the poets was Dylan Thomas, the braggart Welshman and freedom-lover who enjoyed a pint or two (and committed suicide in New York at the age of 39), which was the spirit closest to the film industry. During the Second World War, he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries. He even wrote the script for a vague melodrama called The Three Strange Sisters, in which three old maids in a village in Wales plan the murder of their rich half-brother. Everything that is now forgiven. <br /> <br /> In The Edge of Love by John Maybury, Thomas is played by Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. It is not a large-scale biopic. The film covers four years in the life of the poet during World War II, when he lived with two women: his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and former mistress Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley), whom he met by chance during the war. It seems he loved them both. The relationship of these extraordinary women, with Thomas and each other, is at the heart of Maybury's absorbing film. <br /> <br /> The way it was done is a story almost as remarkable as that of lovers. themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson, the film's producer, is the granddaughter of Vera Phillips and William Killick. William, a war hero (played in the movie by Cillian Murphy), married Vera when she was still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired to make the film when he discovered a book about his grandparents, Dylan Thomas: A Farm, Two Mansions and Bungalow, by David Thomas, which describes their lives entangled. Sharman Macdonald, who wrote the script, is Knightley's mother. The part requires that Knightley sing, and her mother included songs especially for her. Surely no movie with such good family connections deserves to do more than succeed. <br /> <br /> We started in London during the Blitz. The bombs fall, the sirens sound and Phillips sings to house the crowds in a subway station. In a pub, by chance, he meets Thomas and discovers, after all these years, that he has a wife and son. Phillips and Caitlin form a friendship without problems by jealousy or resentment and soon they are sharing beds and bathtubs, listening to Thomas read his poems, exchanging intimate secrets and smoking their heads, as they all did in times of war. Caitlin turns out to be more experienced on the roads of the world ("My first step was Augustus John, he seduced me when I was 15"). But it is the refined and poignant Phillips who shakes Thomas's deepest answers and finally succumbs to his charms. Meanwhile, she has married reluctantly with Killick, who has seen her in the subway station and has been captivated by her beauty (if not her singing). <br /> <br /> It's an intense and strangely beautiful movie. Thomas himself may be his less impressive character. It is best to remember it by Under Milk Wood, his verse on the radio that touched one day in the life of the mythical Welsh town of Llareggub, whose name written backwards was not something that English teachers called attention to. I once had a vinyl recording of Richard Burton reading the poem (he appeared in an Under Milk Wood movie in 1971), and I have never forgotten the creamy and seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma, the magnetism of man, is something I missed in the performance of Rhys. Thomas appears as a strangely pale, even secondary, figure compared to the women in his life. <br /> <br /> In his previous film, Love Is the Devil, Maybury explored the turbulent life of the painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model, George Dyer. The Edge of Love seems to me a richer and more satisfying movie. If you ask me what information it offers about the springs of Thomas's creative inspiration, I would have to say Llareggub. But as a vision of his selfishness, his fiery mood and his general indifference to the feelings of others, it is wonderfully sad and revealing. <br /> <br /> Thomas had a good war, drinking and writing while other men (including Killick) were being traumatized by the horrors of the battle. In a scene near the end, Thomas' behavior towards his friends seems implacably insensitive. But this is not, after all, Thomas's movie. Murphy gives us a magnificent study on the condemned passion and the emotional weakening of war. Miller is charming and pathetic as the wife. And Knightley seems almost too exquisitely delicate to be real (as he did in Pride and Prejudice). But this is probably his best performance. And in all aspects the film is worthy of it.
