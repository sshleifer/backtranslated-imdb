I did not know anything about this movie until I saw it ... in fact, my brother suggested I take a look. Normally, their suggestions are not much police, but I got stuck for something to see, so I saw it. <br /> <br /> Well, to summarize a long story, I give it 10/10. <Br /> <br /> The film centers around two people, who meet while they are staying in the same place. One is initially very dependent on the institution that surrounds it, the other is a rebel. One does what he likes, the other as he has been told. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of the film, we quickly see the friendship between the two buildings and see how they stick together a bit. It's an extraordinary job, that manages to tell a good story without kinks after another, people jumping from bathtubs or superheroes who come to save the day. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of guts and reality. there, not everything can go well, not all chasms can be crossed, and this movie shows the lot. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie and it does not impress you ... I suggest you do not see anything again.
