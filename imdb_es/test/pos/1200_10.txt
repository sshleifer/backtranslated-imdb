The songs are fantastic and the plot is good. Like many other acting schools, mine also produced HAIR. For the majority of hair production it is a golden opportunity to make nudes, but my production was completely dressed ... I do not believe that frontal nudity in a film or a work guarantees artistic quality ... And they also did the creators of the movie. The movie version is great, with classic successes followed while letting the plot unfold to the chilling climax. A great cast of actors, dancers and singers.
