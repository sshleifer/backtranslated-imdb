So Dark The Night poses a difficult challenge: it is very difficult to write about it in detail without ruining it for those who have not yet seen it. Since it remains quite dark, that includes almost everyone. The film will surprise those who are familiar with the best known titles of its director Joseph H. Lewis in the black cycle. Gun Crazy, The Big Combo, even My name is Julia Ross, who in its brevity looks like ?? as a strange choice. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the French bucolic environment serves as the stage. Steven Geray, a middle-aged detective with the Surété in Paris, leaves for a vacation in the village of Ste. Margot (or maybe Margaux). Quite unexpectedly, he finds himself in love with the daughter of the managers (Micheline Cheirel), even though he is engaged to a local farmer. But the siren song of life in Paris is hard to resist, so she agrees to marry him, despite the disparity in their ages, which inevitably becomes the talk of the city. <br /> <br /> But on the night of her engagement party, she does not return to the inn. Soon, a hunchback finds his body by the river. His jealous and spiteful lover is the logical suspect, but he is also found dead. Then the anonymous notes threaten more deaths, which happen. For the first time in his career, the bereaved Geray finds himself perplexed ... <br /> <br /> A particularly weak script almost makes the film; Play as the bad guy that Cornell Woolrich crossed with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. But Lewis makes this screeching vehicle proud. You take your time near the beginning, but then the story? And the narration? gain momentum (unfortunately, just when the script breaks an axis). Burnett Guffey illuminated and photographed the film, with an intriguing thread of looking and peering at the windows; There is also an effective score by Hugo Friedhofer, who provided a hearing threat to many noirs. A lot of talent has been lavished on So Dark The Night, but in the end it is reduced to being nothing more than a trick. And it's not a very good trick in that. It is a pony of a single trick of a movie. <br /> <br />
