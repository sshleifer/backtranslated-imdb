I admit that I ignore the existence of this movie, until I saw it announced in a cable outlet. I was very impressed with the novelistic structure of the film. The film, which is in a language I do not understand, shone with intelligence and nuances for me. I think this talks about the quality of the movie. It was visually stunning. The performance was visually fascinating. The movement traditions of Chinese theater, used to improve the transmission of dialogue, are so convincing after watching a Western film, where actors traditionally focus more on dialogue. The action in this movie comes directly to you, without many explosions to get your attention. It is the human action that is so affective here. The additional advantage that the film taught me the story of one of the most important tourist attractions in the world, the funeral clay army of the First Qin Emporer of China, was very impressive. It seemed to give the film an international relevance beyond the great ethical issues of the film. This is a movie that I can recommend comfortably to a wide variety of friends and acquaintances.
