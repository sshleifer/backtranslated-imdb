It is 1913. A studio assistant spies the actress who will become the next big Hollywood movie star and he is the director that will make it possible. After inventing the launch of cakes and the key policemen, his dream comes true. However, being completely absorbed in his filmmaking, he does not realize that he is losing his protagonist in front of another man. After several excess budget failures, he is known only as the director who rejected Rin-tin-tin. Fortunately for him, Hollywood's loyal and compassionate residents lack ambition and ego. It will be fine while you have your friends. <br /> <br /> This film begins as a typical crazy comedy of the period, and in the opening scenes it is presented with the best of them. He has a playful lack of self-consciousness that is lacking in most of today's comedies. Little in the film, however, moves away from this comedy mode and instead tries to entertain us by using the movies within the film. These are silent comedies, well done, but nothing out of the ordinary, and they last longer than necessary for any audience that has seen the originals. Upon returning, the film takes a dramatic turn. It's well written and the cast does an excellent job of making the transition, but the film really should have decided from the beginning what it was going to be. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, it has been transformed. Once again, this time in a song to the brightness of Hollywood. The small city of Los Angeles has become the city that makes films that entertain the whole world. <br /> <br /> Despite its promising beginnings, this film has not aged particularly well. However, it has some strong scenes, a certain nostalgic appeal and an entertaining subtext about the people who made it and the audiences for which it was created.
