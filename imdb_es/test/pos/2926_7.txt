Although this episode was offensive to the Tourette Syndrome Association, others thought it was fun, while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season. <br /> <br /> This episode was fun and simply shocking. South Park has made history as its first episode with the most unfortunate words, unless you count the film as an episode. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed how they made fun of Chris Hansen and his television show, for Catch a Predator. I did not like the idea of ​​how they thought Chris Hansen would do a show on the tourettes and let a guy talk and beat the Jews. <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like is how South Park thought that people with Tourettes syndrome would just drop bad words like that. I have seen people on TV with Tourettes syndrome and they do not just say bad words. Unless it is incorrect.
