The best performance of Gary Busey in a biography that flows very well. Since he had a musical background, he was able to make his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that excellent actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well. <br /> <br /> An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Fortunately, Mr. Busey was nominated for an Oscar for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A low-budget film that does not disappoint, with BIG SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this has made a lot of mass. Busey never became popular again for several reasons, but fortunately he has an excellent resume.
