MY DINNER WITH JIMI is a glimpse of Howard Kaylan's vertiginous and dizzying journey to fame with his 1960s folk-rock band, The Turtles. The turtles were a kind of "second level" act during the sixties, but the film clearly shows that they could eat, drink and celebrate with the titans of the hippie culture. And, not only that, they had the musical chops to back it up. Many of the star acts of the era are seen while interacting with the band at work and in the game. This provides my only complaint about the movie. Almost since the beginning of the film, one sees that it is almost impossible to find actors who can convincingly impersonate those recognizable stars. Too often during the movie, I felt I was seeing an attractive display of fake wigs and mustaches. But, if you are a fan of the music of The Turtles, or The Swinging 60's, in general, this could be the movie for you. And, do not forget to see The Extras. There is a very funny (and informative) part of the band members, Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, about their disastrous experiences with managers and agents.
