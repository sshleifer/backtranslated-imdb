This game is an action / adventure with combat. There are quite long periods without combat but other times, you have to get rid of various types of monsters. Monsters are nothing like what you would see in real life, and they must be eliminated in order to continue your search. The whole game is a search. You play Adam Randall, whose father contacts him from the other side and asks him to come and save him. The game is from the mid-1990s and should be played in DOS. I used Dosbox and I was able to play the game quite well. The graphics are not as good as some games, even of the time, mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes seem quite complicated, but others seem to be better, but do not let that discourage you. The game is very imaginative, it is long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere. It is not for small children who probably would not be interested anyway, but more than 13 or 14 years would like this game. It is a combination of horror / mystery / action / adventure / combat. I thought it was a great game. It has to be found now. maybe ebay But remember it's a DOS game and you could not play it on the fastest computers of today. It would be difficult to play on fast computers unless you use Dosbox. Oh, and the acting is also very good.
