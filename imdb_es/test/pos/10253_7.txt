In this series of dramatizations from Chicago in the early 1960s, we follow a group of friends from high school as they navigate the ups and downs of their lives. The two central characters are Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Turman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs). Both boys have a promising future. Preach is a great writer, but a lazy student, and Cochise just received a college scholarship for basketball. When they are not hanging out in the local dining room, they roll dice with their friends, or at a friend's house or chase girls, jump into school, travel on trains through Chicago or go to parties in rooms weekends. <Br /> <br /> Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and leaving in a stolen car. The police chase them and they are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (Garrett Morris of SNL) are released. But the two hoods are not, and promise to take revenge on Preach and Cochise, thinking they were blamed for everything. <br /> <br /> This movie is very episodic, but it still works because that's what life is like, a series of episodes. Some fun, some sad, some romantic, some strange. The film never gets boring because all the characters are so well interpreted and realistic, and the situations are believable and easy to relate. How to preach romantically chasing a beautiful girl, or a party that turns violent when an asshole decides to start a fight, or deal with a younger brother. But even when a situation can not be related personally, like the guys posing as undercover cops to cheat a prostitute with some money so they can get all their friends involved in a movie, the sequence is still very funny. <br /> <br /> 'Cooley High' was the basis of the classic 70s comedy 'What's Happenin!' That was aired on ABC from 1976-1979. Although the show is more famous for the Rerun character, it is not in this movie, nor is there any character remotely like him. The humor of that show was very broad, but still fun. The humor of 'Cooley High' is more faithful to life and, therefore, more entertaining. <br /> <br /> Also, the soundtrack is wonderful. The classic songs of that period by Diana Ross and The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & the Vandellas and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film, which adds to the fun, youthful and exuberant tone of the film.
