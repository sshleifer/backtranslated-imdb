One of my favorite movies of all time, I've seen it three times. He does a great job in summarizing Isrelai's lifestyles, Israeli humor and seriousness, and many of the problems that Israelis go through. Universal theme of wanting to be accepted, and accepted for who you are. The subtle good humor, and it's the charisma of the characters, what makes this movie magical, and it says a lot about Isrlaei culture and irony, contradictions and humor, with a great actor, Oshri Cohen. I recommend it to everyone, and it is a perfect movie for practically anyone, family movies, boyfriends, and also says, apart from the Israeli culture, that it wants to be accepted, above all, how important is the family, with all its diversity. and imperfections. <br /> <br /> Great big movie.
