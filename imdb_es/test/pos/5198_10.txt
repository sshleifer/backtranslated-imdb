Stalingrad is an excellent film, well acted and directed, and rather to land in its approach to the various strange aspects of the war and its politics. This is, along with "Das Boot" one of the best war movies (along with the Finnish "Vinterkriget" ("The Winter War", in English, I think)). It represents the evidence of some of the German soldiers who fought, and died, in Stalingrad and its environs during World War II. There are no great heroics, no emotional confusion, just the fear of every day of death in war. The mood of the movie is similar to that of "Das Boot," and that should give you some clues as to what to expect, I suppose. So, if you like realistic war movies, not Hollywood movies: rent it, buy it, just make sure you watch it! Finally, a film fan rating: for information from previous reviewers, I just want to add that "Stalingrad" is not run by Wolfgang Petersen (who did "Das Boot").
