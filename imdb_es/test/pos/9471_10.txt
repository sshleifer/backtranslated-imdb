I had the opportunity to see this film in an early screening in Brea and since then I have gone crazy. The film is based on Twelfth Night of Shakespeare, which I have read, loved and seen on stage several times, so I certainly liked the references. But if you like Shakespeare or not, it will not matter, the movie goes on. He is super funny, witty and charming. Amanda Bynes is hilarious and so was David Cross. Actually, the whole cast is great, I'm just a big fan of David Cross. The cast is hot and the soundtrack gives many great bands and some that I had not heard before, but I know they have a CD that is coming out, so I will definitely buy it. Everyone in our audience laughed from beginning to end, all age groups. !!!!
