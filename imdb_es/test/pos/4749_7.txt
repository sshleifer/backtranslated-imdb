How did you get that film photo of the car hitting the back of the semi? And then Roy sits down - great! It seems that the DVD is scheduled for May 2006, it's about time! Watch this on a large screen or relive the movie in a theater, if possible, to fully appreciate the aspect ratio. My other favorites in this category are: Original Italian work with Michael Caine; Bullit with Steve McQueen; Live and die in Los Angeles with the CSI boy when he was young; French connection with Gene Hackman; Ronin with Robert Deniro; Vanishing point with Barry Newman; Enemy of the state with Hackman again - What are your favorites?
