Even with only $ 6,000 and a cast of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a teacher. Nolan is in my opinion, the next big news and our first test of Nolan does not contradict that. <br /> <br /> None of the problems that constantly plague and discredit the low-budget independent image plague Nolan and his team. Our actors are inexperienced and young, but they give us and involve us in this story. Honestly, I think that Following is the best Nolan script because it is about the one that has more control. It is a beautifully imagined movie. It takes us to a world where we do not feel constrained by budget constraints. The dialogue and the atmosphere are bold and intelligent. <br /> <br /> Nolan's trademark method of telling the story outside of continuity applies for the first time here and here it is done in a way that throws the whole story at him. . With Memento and The Prestige, you have to think a bit to truly understand the genius, but Nolan does not try to confuse people with his movie prototype. We can distinguish the time by the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is creative and attractive. I'm glad Nolan has been so successful with this because her films become more than they could be with this method. The rewards in Prestige and Memento would not have been exciting if the film had been told in a conventional format. This idea has been done with moderate success before, but Nolan has really made it his. <br /> <br /> The script here is the best of Nolan. I had some doubts about his writing skills, anyway I figured that his brother Jonathon was the talent of writing, but he shows that I'm wrong with the follow-up. It is a story that makes people reflect and makes interesting observations of people and how they work. Cobb's assessments of theft and how it can lead him to discover what it is that makes people work really sounds plausible. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that the work of the camera sometimes wobbles, but it does not take anything away from the story or the acting. <br /> <br /> Below is the first film of the man who will embody the best of 21st century cinema.
