It's the best movie I've seen !!! I just love them! I see him every day! I have internet episodes! Here in Romania the 6th season is being broadcast! I am happy to have seen the program from the beginning and I am glad that through the Internet I can see season 7. So far, season 5 is my favorite: I love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. I also liked Dean, but Logan is the best. I would like Lorelai to stay with Christopher, because he is beautiful. This show is good for all ages and is worth seeing. I really want the DVDs, but I think that here in Romania it will never appear, because I think they do not even know they have fans here. But, no matter what, I'll be seeing it. goodbye!!
