This film tells the real-life story of Ramon Sampedro, who lived for 27 years lying in bed after breaking his neck, and struggles in a battle to get legal permission from someone who can help him with his death. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem is one of the best actors of his generation. Consider this: you have to take this movie with your face alone! Incredible that he did not even get an Oscar nomination. Now we can all see that the Academy is a joke! The supporting cast was excellent! The optimist Rosa, her lawyer Julia, the rest of the family ... Each and everyone has their own opinion about the fact that Ramon wants to die. <br /> <br /> Whether you are for or against euthanasia, put your opinions aside, because this movie deserves to be seen by people all over the world! In the middle of the movie, I started crying and did not stop until the credits rolled. This movie is so heartbreaking but also wonderful to watch and I can not wait to see it again. I give it a 9/10, and in my opinion, it's the best movie of the year so far.
