Although many audio recordings of great musicians like Jascha Heifetz survive, the film or television record is really limited. That's why musical offers such as "They Shall Have Music" are such rare gems. Whereas, with modern eyes and ears, one can object to the plot, the insightful viewer should put the unique delights of this film in its correct perspective. The plot was designed to attract both young and old audiences of the time, but it is still pleasant to this day. An important aspect of the experience of watching classic films is to see them through the spectator of the time. <br /> <br /> I must disagree with the critic who complains about a black and white film. or that they feel obligated to report that their students express such reservations. These are youthful complaints that reflect a limited historical perspective. For the teacher, this should offer an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black and white photography and its place in film history. Color can, in fact, stand in the way of a good story, or music. For example, the black and white photograph of John Ford's "The Diligence" is, like the still photographs of Ansel Adams, an artistic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> As to which Heifetz is made of wood, I could not disagree more. If you want brazen emotional postures, go to a rock concert. The role of a classical musician like Heifetz is to move the audience, not himself. The emotion of Heifetz is transmitted through his game, not through his body language. He had a rare ability to extract all the emotional nuances of music and transfer them to his listeners. The listener must be moved, not the artist. <br /> <br /> By the way, a critic asked if he had seen Heifetz on YouTube playing the first movement of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, with Frank McHugh in the audience. This is from the 1947 movie "Carnegie Hall", not from "They Shall Have Music", "Carnegie Hall" is an even bigger treasure of many great classical artists in their heyday. We are fortunate that there were film producers who, at least in these limited cases, chose to exhibit these artists. It was still an era that is not totally overwhelmed by the lowest common denominator we have today.
