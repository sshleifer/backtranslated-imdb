In Brooklyn, nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing at McGuire, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar, trying to find a pearl. Rusty's life changes when he participates and wins a contest to be the cover of Vanity magazine. They invite her to work in a large theater on Broadway, whose owner proposes it. She loses her happiness and begins to drink in her new lifestyle, missing the love of Danny and his old friends. 'Cover Girl' is a charming romantic comedy, very naive and with magnificent parts, like the beautiful and talented dancer, singing and acting Rita Hayworth; Gene Kelly, especially in two scenes, dancing with himself and with Rusty and Genius in the street; The songs and choreography of the dances are also spectacular. Danny, the character of Gene Kelly, is almost unpleasant with his chauvinistic behavior. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her incredible in 'Gilda', but she is awesome in 'Cover Girl'. According to the information on the cover of the VHS, 'Cover Girl' was the first musical in which the songs were part of the plot, giving continuity to the story, instead of just being 'released' in the film. My sixteen year old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age at a recent Gene Kelly festival and they loved 'Cover Girl', so I dare say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to previous generations. . My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Models' ('Models')
