Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later, this has made them grow without conscience. As the celebrations of their tenth birthday approach, they become cunning and calculating of cold-blooded killers. Local teen Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin) finds herself facing these little terrors when most of the others are falling in love with their angelic customs. <br /> <br /> Backing up movies like "The Bad Seed" and "Village of the Damn", the premise of this film about evil children may not be completely original, but it's still quite disturbing. The three children's actors, Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby and Andy Freeman, are incredibly convincing. Director Ed Hunt and co-writer Barry Pearson maintain an unpleasant but convincing mood for the duration of the film; they go so far as to make the girl reluctant to admit to a show with the participation of her older sister (future comedian and MTV personality, Julie Brown, whose striptease is a true eye). <br /> <br /> Name the actors Susan Strasberg, as ice teacher, and Jos√© Ferrer, with just a little time on the screen as a doctor, they join the procedures with their presence, while KC Martel, one of the Young of the original "The Amityville Horror", is very nice as the younger brother of Joyces. Other faces known as Ellen Geer, Michael Dudikoff from the movie B, Cyril O'Reilly ("Porky's", "Dance of the Damned"), Joe Penny ("Jake and the Fatman") and William Boyett ("The Hidden One") You can also see it. <br /> <br /> Touching the fears of parents as children playing with weapons they have discovered and who are locked inside old refrigerators, "Bloody Birthday" is a little more than a slasher Variation with children as antagonists. Helped and instigated by the music of Arlon Obers, this film remains in memory more than some of his brothers, without there being many gore in which to fall again (although that arrow through the gag of the eye works quite well). /> Desolador, disagreeable and strong, the "Bloody Birthday" is worth it for the curious. <br /> <br /> 7/10
