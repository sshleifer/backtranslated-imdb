Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the best examples that any possible filmmaker should look at carefully. Sure, you could spend a lot of quality time reviewing the classics from Hitchcock to Scorsese; but let us follow the example of the modern generation and study half. <br /> <br /> Where to start, I guess you could see the movie as a simple story, maybe even a docudrama that focuses on the porn industry of the late 70s. - And what industry was ! The other half could focus on the incredible details that a brilliant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and rubber * ahem *. But, honestly, Boogie Nights gives you back the pure cinema, no-bul! Shi $, to your face, the kind of cinema that I have not experienced since the great ones of the movie of the 70s ... ironic ... or of genius. History is full of richly detailed characters, all of whom can also relate, love or hate; But the impact is clear: you are feeling something for them. Among the characters, the two standout performances are: Burt Reynolds as Director Jack Horner, and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams / Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brilliant, like Heather Graham ... but if I focus on any actor, it would have to be John C. Reilly. John's performance is a perfect balance between the comic timing and emotion driven by the character ... I'm a fan of the line "Did you ever see the movie Star Wars? ... People say I look like Han Solo " Anyway, the look of the film is amazing, the Director of Photography and Director / Writer / Producer, has created a vibrant color and striking style that compares to Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick (in terms of his perfection of his craft ). ); but with the creation of his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the longest shot I've seen ... that's the sequence of the New Year's party. <br /> <br /> Music, as in any great movie, It is a character of its own. Sometimes, it is consumed with pain or sorrow ... but mainly it's about having fun, dancing and having a good time; The spirit of the seventies. Well, let's go back to the performances. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a director of pornography who feels the burden of what the future of the "movie" means for his genre. The terrible transition from filming on film to recording on magnetic tape. The loss of his art, so to speak ... and the changes in the mentality of the people he works with. Walhberg adds the perfect combination of innocence and sexual courage needed for the character. For all those people who have seen Burton's monkey planet, do not pay attention to Wahlberg's performance in that film ... rent boogie nights and see the difference a good script can make! <br /> <br /> Julianne Moore plays the future mother for all, and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels, as life imitates art; and she loses all those who are close to her. Heather Graham is the candy, but later she stands up, and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds. Each character is multidimensional, rich in life and is played by actors who seem to be a perfect image for the part. <br /> <br /> The film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting and provides an intransigent look at the turbulent. Lifestyle of the 70's fast-paced. He has no excuses, and he does not tell lies; and offers the public a return trip. But even more importantly, the film gives us a great example of how movies should be made; and a new director whose bold visions return art to cinema.
