My girlfriend, while walking in the cold London night in Leicester Square, after the movie, says: if they did not speak English and did not show the stadium, they might have thought it was the poor neighborhoods of a South American city. or some other poor neighborhood anywhere in the world, not Queens in New York. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani is, at this moment, my official hero, because he seems to have dedicated his work to showing not the OTHER face of the Americans. but the REAL face of America. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani's films are like Ladri di biciclette, or Germania anno zero, or Roma citta 'aperta. Chop shop is reality turned into a film, it is more realistic than a documentary, in fact I think that Ramin Bahrani's films are more realistic than documentaries. This is a great movie, but do not expect any persecution or filming. This film is about tragic lives in the margin of the richest and richest country in the world.
