In general, Big Bad John was a hilarious and moving movie. If you want romance, tragedy and humor, this movie has it. If you are a fan of the song (as I am), you know how it ends. But if you do not do it, or do it and want to see it anyway, I recommend this movie. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean are a hilarious couple with great chemistry. However, I would not recommend this movie to strict urban people. You have to understand where these people are supposed to come from, and we only have a few left. But even some urban people can understand and appreciate it for what it is: a good home movie that will make you laugh, cry and inspire you.
