I entered, I did not expect much from Human Traffic and I left really satisfied. The film is well made and acted and very elegantly filmed. It has a lot in its favor: it's a film that I really recommend, especially for those who liked Trainspotting (or for those who like to discuss the debate in the drug and media sector). Tremendous fun
