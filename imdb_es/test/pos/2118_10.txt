I really liked that movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl in the heart. There are no movies for small children. I loved this because the worst was when one of the boys said "stupid". I applaud you for going out and making a real family movie. I rented it the first time we saw it and we know how to buy it to add to our collection. My daughter can not stop talking about it. It goes according to our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family movies like this one. He even named one of our calves "Hokey Pokey Keen"! I can not say enough about this movie. I hope many more movies like this one.
