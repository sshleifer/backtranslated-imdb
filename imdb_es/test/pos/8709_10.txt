This is one of my cheap, cheesy and favorite B vampire movies of all time. <br /> <br /> The underwear model Calvin Klein ... oh, I mean, Stefan, the good vampire, returns to Transylvania to ascend the throne of Vampiric Royalty, but the half brother, with manicure problems and Always drooling, Radu has other plans. After having killed his father the Vampire King, Radu now looks at Stefan, Stefan's new mortal girlfriend, Michelle and her two pretty friends, and the almighty Bloodstone. <br /> <br /> Well, the scenery is beautiful, and it should be like it was filmed in the place in Transyl-fricken-vania for God's sake. The actresses are not great shakes and Stefan, the heroic vampire, is as charming as a chilled poker fireplace, but who cares? There's only one reason to see this movie, and its name is RADU! It is a physical tribute to Nosferatu and has the best phrases of the film, all spoken with the husky voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. The cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film, as Radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his smiling and slimy face for the world to see. I found myself encouraging him as he picked up victims and provoked his perfect brother. But maybe I'm just sick. Leaving aside the questionable taste of men, I recommend this movie to vampire enthusiasts. It's original, it's fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I've seen in a long time ... much more fun than the hard, tragic and whining undead brats that infinitely adorn the horror screens these days. Radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. He is what a vampire should be.
