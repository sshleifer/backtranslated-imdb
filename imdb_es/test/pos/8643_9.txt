Originally filmed in 1999 as a television pilot, "Mulholland Dr." It was rejected. The following year, David Lynch received money to shoot new scenes and make the film suitable for display in theaters. He did, and created one of the biggest, strangest and nightmarish movies ever made. <br /> <br /> The movie does not really have main characters, but if there were main characters, it would be Betty (Naomi). Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a cheerful blonde who stays in her aunt's apartment while auditioning for parts in movies. Find Rita in her aunt's apartment and decide to help her. You see, Rita has lost her memory. She has no idea who she is. She takes her name, Rita, from a "Gilda" sign in the bathroom. So the two set out to discover who Rita really is. <br /> <br /> David Lynch has been known for making some strange movies, but this movie is the definition of strange. It is strange, nightmarish, and absolutely indescribable. It's like a dream captured in a movie. At the 100 minute point, the movie has become extremely confusing, but if you have been watching it closely, it will make a lot of sense. After watching the movie and then reading an article on the Internet that points out the things in the movie, I now understand the movie completely. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Watts is phenomenal. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director who faces problems with the local mafia. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of his best scores. And the address - ha! David Lynch is the most masterful filmmaker that ever existed. <br /> <br /> Is this your kind of movie? Well, that depends. You should probably see more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You'll have to be patient with the movie, and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues that Lynch has left throughout the film. For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true. <br /> <br /> "Mulholland Dr." It is a masterpiece It is brilliant, enigmatic, and filmed with mastery. I love.
