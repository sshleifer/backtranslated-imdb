Certainly, when I saw this movie on HBO, I was a bit erratic in following the plot, but it catches my attention when I see Dustin Hoffman in it. Honestly, I'm not enthralled by watching old movies, but in the long run it changes my point of view. Seeing this moving film made me experience once more lying down in my seat without noticing my tears suddenly rolling down my cheek, and then, I let out a deep sigh when I realized the impact of what I just witnessed. Kramer vs. Kramer was in fact one of the best classic drama movies I have witnessed for a long time and that I could not even imagine how it moved me. The story was very emotional, but it is not saturated with that. The characters were not unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers like them in whatever position they have in the film, such as the role of Meryl Streep, she was a mother who honored her mistakes in the past, but then relies on defending her emotional motives to obtain what In a fair and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was too outstanding, I can not even understand how this guy could play very difficult roles and suddenly jump to another role that is completely different, and then he performed well. Even though I've seen the movies many times, when I sit down and feel at home scanning worthwhile movies to watch and buy time for it, taking a look at Kramer vs. Kramer will make my experience another time that worth it.
