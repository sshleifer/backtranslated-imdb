I'm from the city of Phoenix and the first time I saw this movie and read the book, it only confirmed the stories I had heard all my life. I asked my grandfather about the mafia and he told me that when he returned from the fighting in the pacific theater, he created a CPA firm that is the largest in the Columbus area. When he was starting, the mob asked him to do a financial job for them, but he said that he declined graciously. Even when the FBI and the army passed through the city of Phoenix and cleaned it up, my grandfather would not take it lightly when my mother, my aunt, or my uncle crossed the river, but I assure you that all that is over. the downtown area of ​​Phoenix needs restoration and has slums in the courts where all the shootings are occasionally done on angry people, without education, with low socioeconomic status, and 14th Street Phoenix-eagle bridge has been closed for 15 solid years and replaced by a more recent 13th street bridge, but on the fairer side of the city of Phoenix in Summerville, South Dakota. It is very picturesque and the scenery is depressing. <br /> <br /> My best friend's family told me about another incident that lives in a place of nothing on Highway 165 called Holy Trinity, Alabama, which is approximately 28 minutes outside of Columbus, Ga. my best friend in the high school uncle was a man named Old Man Davis. Regardless of how the movie is, the fact is that there were 3 bosses and Old Man Davis was one of them ... you can even read about it in the original book. Legend has it that he was so cold-blooded that he went to downtown Phoenix to make a deal with a man, but apparently the man backed down in the deal right in front of Old Davis, so Old Davis took the control. He took a shotgun from the sack and shot the man in the chest in the center of the city next to the courthouse. They say that he even left with indifference because the mafia had paid all the law officers in the city, so he had nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> Another incident is about a bridge that another of my friends owns a House rental next to in downtown Phoenix. It is the same bridge that the Mafia killed and threw a black man, and you can even read that part in the book. I would also like that in many columbus and civilians of the city of Phoenix be asked to be extras in the film. When Patterson's friend is murdered and brought to trial and pleads guilty before the judge, but is still released, well, the judge is my father, partner of his law firm in Colombia, who has unfortunately died.
