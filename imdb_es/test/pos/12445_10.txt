Slipknot is a heavy metal band from the big city of Des Moines, Iowa, where rockers wear their own distinctive mask (I know someone already said this, but I need to fill the space for this review). The members of the band are Joey, Mick, 133, Sid, Clown, James, Corey, Chris and Paul. This band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and should be heard by all who love hardcore rock. Another good movie is called "DISASTERPIECES" which shows the band's performance at the London Arena. The video for "My Plague" was filmed there and is included in the DVD. The coolest song they made is also there (Sic). So, if you love the band, you need to see this and if you like heavy metal music, then you have to listen to this band.
