The only complaint I heard about this movie was that it was slow. Although, maybe this is the point. The two characters clash relentlessly and the slow accumulation of tension between them produces anxiety. Intricate and subtle gestures and minimal dialogue bring tension to a point where an otherwise normal argument surprises the audience. Istanbul and the outskirts are dreamy, the scenery captivating and the plot is exciting, not in that "look", the hero flew another car and is now flying with his motorcycle "somehow". I had chills on my spine as the characters moved in and out of each other's spheres and watched the fog wrap around Istanbul.
