In general, Anthony Mann made westerns with 'the greats' - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda. . . the list of cowboy stars. But in this B + movie, he tackled something remarkably different and had a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly Western type. The main character, played by Victor Mature, is a hunter / mountain man, and they are usually romantics in the movies: Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, that sort of thing, where the hero is not a typical mountain man but a clean cut . Heroic figure that goes out with real mountain men. Not here. For once, a true mountain man, vulgar, coarse and animal, is the central figure, and it is something to see, giving Maduro one of his best later roles. Robert Preston provides the real acting skills, excellent as a self-absorbed cavalry commander type Custer, and James Whitmore, poor Spencer Tracy, as another of those veterans who feel trapped between increasingly hostile Indians, on the one hand. and the coming force of civilization in the other. Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft as the officer's wife, who initially feels rejected by the mere fact of seeing the creepy character of Mature, then discovers that her own appearance of civilization is fading when she begins to realize, for her own surprise, that she is attracted to him. Rarely, if ever, a remote border fortress has been made with such precision on the screen, without the romantic charm that John Ford gave to that place in his masterful Apache Fort. The battle sequences are large scale and remarkably violent, and particularly impressive if you have seen them in widescreen format. Good show, and underestimated movie, everywhere.
