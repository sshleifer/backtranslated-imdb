Great movie, a very valuable 7/10. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was at his best, the congressman who drank Afghanistan from his Communist oppressors! Based on a true story, it tells us how the West throws money and weapons at a problem and expects it to disappear. Well, it disappeared, though temporarily. Look who (the British, among others) are fighting against the same people to whom the United States gave them weapons, training and money in the 80s. <br /> <br /> This movie was always going to provoke political thoughts on the part of The people who see it, but it portrays a very beautiful story. However, once the main objective, that is, to free the communists from Afghanistan, is achieved, we can see how quickly the difficult situation of the people is forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie was good, it was a well deserved 7/10. He told the story of the communist invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the US. UU With some detail and dramatized well. Although it is a good movie, I will recommend it to people, but some people will not enjoy it, in particular, it is a serious film about good (USA) and evil (Russia) is not your thing.
