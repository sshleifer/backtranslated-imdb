I really enjoyed this fact for the television movie. I was browsing the channel and I found the beginning of the movie. Boy, I'm glad I stopped. This film has a real cast, as well as a semi-credible plot. There's drama, comedy, action and, best of all, the human nature aspect of this movie is what makes it great. I hope it comes out on video, because I'm going to buy a copy. Rating ... 9 out of 10 stars
