When you think of a brilliant Australian comedy, you do not think of Skit shows (although I'm quite partial to a bit of the 80s and 90s of Full Frontal) or even Sitcoms, you think of SATIRE! Something that we Australians really know how to do well. (For example: Front Line, the Micallef program) We know how to take the pi $$, and The Chaser's War on Everything, is a classic example of how to do it and how to do it really well. <br /> <br /> I've been a big fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel for a long time. I remember listening to them on the afternoon program of Triple J. Eran, and they are still two of the funniest comedians of all. <br /> <br /> Although I was sad when they left Triple J, I was excited to know what they were investing in so much time that it made them have to. go out. (They were doing CNNNN and Triple J at the same time, so I thought this was something much bigger) And what an amazing HILARIO is the Chaser show. It is best to bite political and social satire. <br /> <br /> I am also pleased to say that it has recently received a much better time slot than Friday night and that it has been moved on Wednesday nights just after Spicks and Specks. THANKS ABC! Finally I do not have to record it! :)
