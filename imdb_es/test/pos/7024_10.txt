One of the best movies of the 80s, Dirty Dancing was a low budget movie with high budget returns. With a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance, a love story that we all want to be able to live (at least if you're a woman), this is a movie that you'll want to watch again and again. <br /> <br /> Music, which is what drives the film, is optimistic and flows well with the emotions that are extracted from the viewer. From classic hits from the 60s like "Love Man" by Otis Redding and "Big Girls Do not Cry" by Frankie Valli to pure 80s hits like Eric Carmen "Hungry Eyes" and "Overload" by Frank Zappacosta, Dirty Dancing is a mix of fun and sensual, which shows the transformation of a shy young teenager into a woman who is flourishing, all in the beautiful setting of a summer romance that we all hope and want to become more. <br /> <br /> The dance in "The dirty dance should not be forgotten." Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny, a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and agile gymnasts.Sky Swayze does more than a job Fantastic and shows more and more his skills, not only as an actor, but also as a dancer and singer, and Jennifer Gray shines like Baby, while her transformation into dance also reflects her transformation in the state. <br /> <br / > In short, Dirty Dancing is one of the best films of all time, and it's worth seeing at least once, it's doubtful that the first rhythms of Ronette's "Be My Baby" in the opening title do not attract your attention and take you to a magical world of sensual dance and musical charm.
