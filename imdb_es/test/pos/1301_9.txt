I saw it because a friend told me it was very good, and I saw a video on it, so I was really interested in looking at it. I saw it and, damn it, the fight scenes are very good. If the boys can not fight like that in real life, they sure cheated me. I have to say that there are not as many fights as I would like, but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular. They do not show much, but you can say that it is violent and great. But there is also the plot, which revolves around a love triangle between the main characters, although it is a little twisted. Tae-sung is a carefree boy who loves to get into trouble and fights. He is the leader of his school, and he is the rival of Hea-won, who is the leader of his own school: a little playboy, a headbutt and a rich boy. Then there's Han-kyung, a little girl who does not like it very much (his father just passed away and moved in with his mother, the boy he liked is dating his old friend), and then he meets Hea-won, who she goes to her school, and Tae-sung, who calls her "nuna" (older sister). Finally, she discovers that Tae-sung is her brother, the result of one of her father's affairs, and he loves her despite his blood relationship. Meanwhile, Hea-won falls in love with her and takes her as her boyfriend. But she is divided between her boyfriend and her little brother, who confesses his love. In general, it's a wonderful movie, but I was really depressed after the end, and I could not help but think, Damn, are all the Korean movies what I see about fights / death / depression / incest? Because that sure was the case with Old Boy and Temptation of Wolves. It's a very good movie, but people have to be ready to cry at the end.
