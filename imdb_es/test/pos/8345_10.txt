I'm a college student and I bought this movie from a used bookstore because it sounded funny because of the description on the back. Nothing would prepare me for what would be the funniest MOVIE ever made! <br /> <br /> It's especially good to see if you're an Atheist, like me. Because then you can see how stupid these Christians are. They seem to think that non-believers like to live in really unpleasant and messy homes, and they do nothing but drink beer and be mean to neighbors. It's an assault on laughter! <br /> <br /> My friends and I see it every two weeks so we can entertain ourselves beyond our wildest imaginations! Watch this movie NOW! <br /> <br /> Hopefully Rich Christiano will do some more of these movies to entertain us!
