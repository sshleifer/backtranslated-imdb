Very funny things. Charlie was still working to reach his peak when he made this rather bold short film about soldiers in the trenches of World War I. Daring because, after all, the war was still going on and it was a comedy about a serious matter. <br /> <br /> The gags are fun without being hilarious or lacerating. One successful scene follows another, while Chaplin and his companions try to sleep in a bunker that is knee-high in the water. (That's where we got the term "trench foot"). Probably the most ridiculous episode has Chaplin disguised as a tree and frustrating any number of German soldiers as they try to execute an Allied soldier trapped behind the lines. Edna Purviance, Chaplin's main problem at that time, is a woman who cooperates with Americans and is also saved from execution. <br /> <br /> Chaplin would continue to do more fun and ambitious things, but this is better than most. Of his shorts during this early period.
