This is one of the best films of Alfred Hitchcock, and one of his most underestimated. I think it certainly surpasses a 'Psycho' or 'The Birds' for technical art and brilliance. It is a macabre, tense and humorous product that will leave you stunned for quite some time. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable villains as the parents' hatred, the mother's love (but it's not). Most children of the mummy of the Hitchcock villains?) Bruno. It is a disturbing and impressive performance that illuminates the entire film. His character is obsessive, apparently homosexual (look at those deliberately effeminate links and hear how he is described as "European"), strangely charming and dangerous to cross. Farley Granger certainly knows this when he becomes entangled in Bruno's sordid network after they both meet on a train. Bruno, knowing some insider information about Guy's affairs, proposes the two murders of 'exchange' for mutual benefit. Walker will kill Granger's whore and deceitful wife who is inhibiting her marriage to the beautiful Anne, while Granger will murder Bruno's father, whom he hates intensely. Everyone happy, right? A win-win, as Bruno says? Incorrect. Granger forgets the indecent proposal, but an obsessed Walker does not. He commits his murder and is determined to pursue Granger until he too completes his part of the bargain. 'Strangers' becomes a fascinating cat-and-mouse thriller game in Hitch's deft hands. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock was absolutely amazing in creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes. We have the bitch Miriam, Granger's estranged wife, pregnant with another man. She lasciviously sips a phallic ice cream while she eats Bruno openly with her eyes. Barbara Morton, Anne's sister, is a deceptively sweet but clever and clever young girl who presents the crudest comments she will hear from a girl with glasses in the photos of the 50s. Senator Morton is authoritarian and self-absorbed. This is one of the boldest movies that Hitchcock has ever made, and is, typical of a Hitch movie, subtly sexual in detail. <br /> <br /> This fits into the category of black cinema with its focus on murder, lies and deception and grim cinematography. Walker's nut is one for the ages, and Granger is a convincingly problematic protagonist. Roman is perhaps weaker than the other two, and I never believed his relationship with Granger. However, the overwhelming positive aspects nullify the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the BEST American films that have been made. <br /> <br /> Just look at what Hitch does here: originality, technical ability. We see Miriam's murder reflected in her shattered glasses. A game of tennis becomes one of the most exciting and intense scenes you'll ever see. An innocent amusement park becomes a place of murder and occurrences of disgust. Walker blew up a child's balloon in a cruel way (Hitch obviously liked what he saw in 'The Third Man!'). The delight of the children when riding the carousel becomes a scream of vertiginous terror. The hook subverts the normal, everyday events like no other. <br /> <br /> The camera work here is among the best that has been seen in a Hitchcock movie, and the premise is to die. It is impeccable, oozing sophistication and devilish charm. The cross section between the characters of Walker and Granger is magnificent. Granger's tennis match of life or death is as vital as the villager Walker's rescue of an incriminating test lost by a drain. Hitch turned his villain into an unpleasant piece of work, repulsive, at the same time charming and strangely charming (Did anyone else find him strangely attractive, more than Granger?) We are as tense as Walker in the hope that he can get the lighter out of the drain. We need it, anyway. He has the key to the story. <br /> <br /> You will never see a stranger approach in the same way again after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Incredible. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
