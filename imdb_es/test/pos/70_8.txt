This film is certainly well constructed, it starts and ends in the dark, with a focus on Lili Smith / Schmidt, Julie Andrews, initially the "angel" singer and then the notorious spy. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and saw it again recently. Although it was criticized by critics in the 70s as exaggerated, the 'vulgar cinema' and the lack of structure (among others) time has shown that they are wrong. Blake Edwards has certainly produced a film that is almost lyrical in quality. <br /> <br /> The movie rises and spins (aerial photography; Julie Andrews moving) and captivates. One must only accept the premise that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong. By overlooking the lukewarm chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson, one must believe that these are lovers, that in all innocence they fall in love. And in the end, love is much more important than winning wars. And so is maintaining innocence. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of underestimated acting, and the film certainly reaches emotional depths that are often not seen in comedies. <br /> <br /> There are wonderful comic elements the French thugs in Victor / Victoria), interesting diplomatic aspects (which remind me of The Tamarind Seed, seen about 18 years ago) and a general sense of goodwill. <br /> <br /> Suspend all disbelief and this movie take you away The songs of Julie Andrews and the 'Whistling Away the Dark' are a sufficient reason to turn on the TV, just for the soundtrack. And the striptease number, like the number of 'Jenny' in Star! jobs. <br /> <br /> This film has, like a good champagne, well aged. Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible. The same applies to the Star laser disk transfer! to DVD. Both are interesting pieces of the meticulous and then underestimated works of Julie Andrews.
