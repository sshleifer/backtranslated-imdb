When it was launched, in the early 80's, Pixote brings to Brazilian society the problems of young delinquents and the impact of this on Brazilian society. I can not watch the movie at that time, because I was too young, but now I had the opportunity and I saw it a few days ago. It's a very brutal movie, but everything is absolutely true, and sad. pixote is the name of a 12-year-old boy who lives on the street and survives with minor crimes; He stays for a while in a detention house, and when he leaves, he continues planning tunics with other buns and a prostitute, played by Marilia Pera. The boy is still addicted to marijuana and smells glue with other teenagers, to forget his sad reality. The quality of the images is not the best, but the film is totally realistic about the Brazilian problems and must be seen and admired.
