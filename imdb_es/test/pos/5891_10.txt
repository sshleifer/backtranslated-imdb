Best Years of Our Lives perfectly captures the era of my youth and the feelings of that era. The cast was uniformly wonderful. This was possibly Dana Andrews' best role in his career and he should also have been nominated for an Academy Award. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie that it is almost impossible to list them all. Cinematography is among the best of any movie. This movie is a time capsule of what it was in the 1940s. A must-see movie for any true movie fan. Some critics have said that this movie has aged. I do not agree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles facing veterans returning from the war will always be with us. This is just a great movie, one that can be seen again and again.
