Ok I have not read the book ???? And maybe the book would be better. "WHO KNOWS" // But I loved the movie. It was entertaining, not a little boring, pleasant and especially heartbreaking. The friendship between the two children was so pure and innocent. These children acted very well, especially the son of the Servant. Oh my God, that's like the shape of God in the face of EARTH. ARGHHHH he steals our hearts so easily. ********* Spoilers ************** The other friend, the rich man is a child and his confusion and frustration can be understood. BUT I got angry when he left and ignored his friend at the time he needed comfort. Anyway he was just a boy and a bit stubborn for. I wish the movie had also shown the previous version of the poor child. Arghh hurts just thinking about the end. This movie is sad. I felt terribly sad during the end. Tears fell through my eyes. Yes, the background scores are fantastic, the scenes are WOW. The comet scenes are fascinating. And well, it puts a little adventure in the middle. Wonderfully acted and superbly released. The children acted very well. GREAT Address. I do not know why this movie failed in WOOO the Critics. But surely he did me WOO. 10/10 what to see ??????
