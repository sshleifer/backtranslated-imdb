Although many have mixed feelings about this thriller by Giallo de Argento in recent days, it still stands as another splendid testimony to the cinematic brilliance that is Argento. <br /> <br /> A young opera singer has her first premiere performance and suddenly finds herself an obsession theme for a crazed maniac. <br /> <br /> In a way, Opera is like a modern version of Giallo in Phantom of the Opera mixed with all the glorious style and color that one would expect. Dario Argento to deliver. Argento makes excellent use of inventive camera techniques, recurring symbols (like those crows!), Gothic atmosphere and truly horrifying murder sequences. A special scene (involving a hole and a gun) will take the spectators out of their seats! In regards to the story, the film also clings with a strong suspense and a great atmosphere thanks to the wonderful music of Claudio Simonetti. <br /> <br /> The cast makes some satisfying interpretations. Cristina Marsillach is good as our protagonist. The late Ian Charleson makes a good turn as director, as does Urbano Barberini as a researcher, Daria Nicolodi as Marsillach's agent and William McNamara as the unfortunate lover of Marsillach. <br /> <br /> The opera is an excellent Argento in recent days, and perhaps the last of its great works. It will surely please your fans and even create some new ones. <br /> <br /> **** of ****
