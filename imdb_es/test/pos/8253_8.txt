Charming! It never pretends to be a masterpiece, but it is a little gem of the British comedy of the late seventies. Since the producers wanted to sell it abroad, it is played by an American (the late actor Richard Jordan), but at least he is not the boring type of Hollywood. Around him is the cream of the British character's acting talent, led by David Niven, who is wonderfully shy. <br /> <br /> Ivan the Terrible, from Niven, naturally receives the best lines and the best reaction shots. He also manages to be surprisingly threatening and intimidatingly dangerous. The moment in the snooker club, when he drops the charming facade and threatens Richard Jordan, will surprise the spectators who think that Niven is just a comedy star. It is full of genuine power and cruelty, as we see all at once how Ivan earned his nickname. Most surprising given how sick Niven was at that moment. Shortly after filming this production, he lost his ability to speak to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig's disease). This is the last image Niven made in which you can hear his own voice, which was later dubbed by the comic impressionist Sid Caesar. <br /> <br /> Beside him you can see many familiar faces of the seventies, the cinema and television. Elke Sommer (showing her breasts in the politically incorrect bimbo mode of the seventies era), Oliver Tobias, Michael Angelis, Brian Croucher, Davy Kaye, etc., etc. Davy Kaye has one of the biggest laughs while holding a security guard trapped making a phone. call. "Who are you calling ?! ... Bloody Dial-A-Disc! You're a gitless!" <br /> <br /> Great photos of the locations of the streets of London; making the film a time capsule of the patina of red telephone booths with thick round manual headphones, black cabs handled by "Cor blimey, gov!" cockneys, and ladies and gentlemen who model all kinds of leisure clothes and retro hairstyles from the late seventies, very unreliable. <br /> <br /> Unlike the classic Ealing comedies of a previous era, the "hero" can escape his crime and escape to a life under the sun. How the times had changed! The code of morality by which criminals had always been seen in movies to be punished had long since disappeared in the 1970s, with anti-heroes such as Pinky Green gaining status through their brazen anti-authoritarianism and their determination to " Laugh a laugh "to a suffocated capitalist. Establishment of fat cat businessmen suitable. They encourage us to encourage Pinky, unpunished and free like a bird with its ill-gotten gains. Compare it to the end of The Lavender Hill Mob! <br /> <br /> Highly entertaining, curiously dated in their fashions and attitudes, and the things that are seen in the nighttime cult. Perfect to see at midnight after the pubs have closed; If you are of a certain age, you feel a little nostalgic and you have always wanted to see David Niven in a McDonalds branch, intimidating an American with the use of a retractable telescope!
