Truly unique and amazing film of "For The Flag" by Jules Verne by the Czech director Karel Zeman. Although the story is represented in a rather discreet late Victorian style, the images are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted games, animation models combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore, Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added. Photographed in beautiful black and white, the animation is of the first order and not of a Saturday morning variety. There are underwater sequences in which the fish that swim are drawn with such precision that they can be used in a field guide. There are images of ships, submarines, flying ships, castles and machinery that are drawn with such precise detail that they must be frozen. Frame your VCR or DVD to pause the scene and study the remarkable details that went into this production. The late Victorian atmosphere is designed to look like this world that never was and delight us with the magic of science that made Verne the great father of the genre. If this is not enough, there is also the score of the movie that is probably one of the best that was created for a fantasy or science fiction movie. Truly a forgotten classic, it is worth looking for and buying it. Always one of my favorite movies of all time, it will surely be one of yours too. And remember: this was done decades before computer animation or CGI. Congratulations to the great artists who obviously put their hearts into it. Sample. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this movie. A film that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it adore it and treasure it. An outstanding achievement, this extraordinary film improves every time you see it. A true work of cinematographic art of a visionary director.
