I thought this was a beautiful movie. It's not my favorite of his films - Chungking Express holds that place - this is quite different from anything else I've seen of him. it's slow (but not so annoying); He takes his time and reflects on the characters. There is a minimal movement in the frame. The work of the camera is wonderful. The acting is great. The film feels like a long and comforting drink.
