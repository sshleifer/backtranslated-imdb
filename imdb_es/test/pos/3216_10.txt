Honestly ... this show warms my heart, I see it EVERY DAY in the fox family and now that the new season has started, I'm even more hooked than before ... the characters are very well developed and their relationships are so real ... i would recommend this program for any woman or mother and daughter. The Lorelei are clever girls who talk very fast and who really inspire you. The program is hysterical at times and it is never too serious, but it is serious enough to be completely addictive. It's a long hour, which is an important PLUS because you can never get enough Gilmore! even in an hour ... Emily and Richard Gilmore are KICKS (Loralie's parents, Rory's grandparents) are their average rich parents. Emily, president of the DAR and Richard, a well-known lawyer and student of Yale St .. Rory is following In the footsteps of her grandparents and this could not make them happier, of course, Rory's mother is very proud of her, but all her life has ultimately worked, challenging her parents and Rory going to Yale did not help her on that trip, but Believe me, every episode she approaches;)
