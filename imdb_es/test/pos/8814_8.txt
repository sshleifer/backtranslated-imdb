Every time I watch this movie, I really want to go out and have a good night! My partner uses the "weekend has landed" speech to the psyche himself before leaving! and me too ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great debut for the writer / director. Well done friend! <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, all the characters are believable and they are bigger than life! The "strange" scenes are a joy to watch, Jip is running flashbacks / explanations / views of Mr. Mr diskettes that are great! The scene in the pub huuuuuuuge when everyone stand up and begin to sing the simulated national anthem is also a laugh. Here is a lot of comedy. Howard Marks' speech about "the politics of fraud" is funny! <br /> <br /> Oh, God, you just need to see this. Of course, I felt that the movie somehow glorified the use of ecstasy, but hey, that's the truth, huh? At least the film does not escape this fact. I suppose the film also conveys a decent message: do not take your life ALSO seriously, you have to leave yourself crazy sometimes. And, of course, the talk in the pub when Moff tries to explain to his classmates that he is coming off drugs is a sure reminder that when the descent is far from the good times, you know that the party is over! <br /> <br /> This is sometimes a very smart film in the use of the camera, lighting, etc. It was a piece of cinema made, and a great story of friends, clubs, and drugs to feel good. <br /> <br /> Out of the people in the 'rat race'! <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
