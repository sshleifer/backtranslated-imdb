A film that reveals the discomfort of modern men and women in life when they face death. We are beyond the simple religious belief in the future life, and what is more in any kind of hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. However, human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially because we can take them away for a long time. In addition, the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe that we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. That was pretty typical of the late twentieth century. Today things are changing, especially when the president of the United States, Barack Obama, in a public speech to journalists speaks of his search for truth and qualifies that truth as something natural, because it is more a search than an end. objective or achievement The film shows the end of good metaphysical thinking that began to evolve towards an obsession with truth, an obsessive conception that truth was unique and irreversibly accessible. Postmodernism had not yet reached Hollywood, although today it seems to have reached the White House. So some young doctors and medical students decide to go to death and come back. Technically it is possible but the result is not surprising. It reactivates old feelings of guilt and frustrations that had been buried in the unconscious. One has to do with a father addicted to the drugs of a Vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a child who was stoned for the death of some others, among them, the death killer, another with a young black woman who was victimized and harassed in primary school Outside of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear in the face of shyness. He is so naive that he could cry of shame for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies crying for their bottles of sweetened fruit juice. Although the movie is interesting but in something quite different. The stage and the shots and every detail or treatment of any detail is baroque, morbid, decadent, in the style of "Death in Venice" or Greenaway, or other works of art that try to make friends with the basic enemy that death is Por Of course the movie is not saved, but at least that makes it worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Sorbonne Pantheon, University of Versailles Saint Quentin in Yvelines, CEGID
