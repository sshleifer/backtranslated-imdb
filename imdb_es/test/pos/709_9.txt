A film that deserved theater premiere. This film made for television is a cinematographic jewel that exemplifies Michael Mann's technique with a moving contemporary music integrated to visual images. Always with Mr. Mann, the amplification of the impact of the music is almost as if there were an actor that won an invisible academy award added to the set of actors, writers, directors and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely one of my favorites of all time. Although nothing is perfect, this movie is very, very close. <br /> <br /> Along with an excellent script, a great direction and a masterful performance by Richard Strauss, there is a stellar ensemble of character actors at their best: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You may not recognize the names, but you will recognize all faces. <br /> <br /> If it appears on TV, sit down with popcorn, increase the sound for an incredible soundtrack and music, and be prepared to be captivated. The 97 minutes of the movie. I recommend recording it, since it is only available on Holland's VHS and DVD and the DVD is encoded in region 2.
