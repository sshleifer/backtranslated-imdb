They take us to a convenience store where Nick is looking at the coins in his hand, thinking if he can get the special, a cup of 69 cents and 20 ounces coffee that comes with a free pasta. He decides to go for the bigger size, which of course is more expensive and also does not qualify for the cake. Try to argue with the Indian employee in the registry, who stands firm. With her it is a question of principles. Well, Nick is irritated at not getting his own way and proceeds to kill her. <br /> <br /> The tone of the story is established from the beginning. The people we are about to meet are not good guys. There's Nick, his girlfriend, Dallas and his partner Billy Hill. They are drug dealers. Nick decides to visit Casey, his friend and former partner in crime, in Houston. He wants to make one more transaction and then go to Paris with the proceeds from the sale of the drugs he brings. What he does not realize is that Casey has gone straight. He is an architect, is married to Christine and wants to adopt a baby. <br /> <br /> Casey does not appreciate that his old friend brings drugs to the house. He decides to get rid of things by throwing them down the drain in the kitchen. The premature arrival of Ice, a pizza delivery man, takes Casey by surprise. This man has been sent to kill him, but before that, Casey brings out some grass to share with Ice, who has a talent for rapping. <br /> <br /> It is at this point that Dr. Jarvis, the man From the adoptive agency, arrives. Casey's application shows a two-year gap that he can not justify. Jarvis begins to doubt the future father. At this moment, Dallas makes an entry. She's a woman who asks blank questions, like when she demands to know if Jarvis likes to watch pornography. Jarvis, who is excited, ends up running away angry. Dallas has decided to seduce Casey at all costs. There is a surprise at the store when Billy Hill enters the scene and does not like what he sees, and shoots Dallas in the process. Billy Hill has also left Casey, but he is outdone. <br /> <br /> Casey receives a visit from Kasarov who wants to get his money from Nick; in his absence, he will take it from Casey. Kasarov gives a deadline and Casey makes the decision to be smarter than all these low lives. He has all the parties that come to his house at a certain time and the different factions will take care of themselves. In the end, Casey has a better plan that includes taking Christine to a stay in Paris. <br /> <br /> We had never heard of "Thursday" because we were attracted by talent. Skip Woods directed his own material. This seems to be a movie with good intentions. Sometimes, the movie reminds others of the same genre, not a sin by any means, which seems to be the main objection to the negative comments left here on the IMDb site. To start, "Thursday" shows an ingenious Skip Woods who has gone to write other films, in particular, "Swordfish". The script is divided into chapters with suggestive titles, related to the action. Denis Lenoir does wonders with mostly indoor photography. <br /> <br /> Thomas Jane makes an excellent contribution to the movie with her Casey. Although it is difficult to imagine, he has overcome the odds and has done something with himself. This actor, recently seen in the television series "Hung", is one of the actors that we never tire of seeing. Aaron Eckhart, dark-haired, is a welcome addition to any movie. He is a greasy criminal who does not show redeeming qualities, or anything resembling remorse and does not hesitate to involve his old friend in his plan. James LeGros has nothing to do. The same goes for Paulina Porizkova, a beautiful creature that is just a distraction, or a last-minute idea to add a sexy angle. We enjoy Glenn Plummer, who appears as Ice. He makes an average audition on the phone. Michael Jeter and Mickey Rourke also appear.
