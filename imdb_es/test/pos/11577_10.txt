As many other users have already explained and commented on the story, I will not. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to reiterate that Bardem's interpretation is excellent, as are those of other actors and actresses in this film. <br /> <br /> Reading the comments above, I have noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film does not show opposing views to euthanasia and that those little presents are ridiculed. In my sincere opinion, this is far from true. <br /> <br /> There are many characters that move in a gray area between loving Ramón Sampedro and wanting him to stay and understand his desire to die. The most obvious of those are the family. For example, Ramón's sister-in-law never speaks for or against euthanasia. Another one of those characters is Gené (the social rights activist) who, at the last moment, tells Ramón to reconsider everything. The scene clearly shows that she does not want him to die. <br /> <br /> Then there are characters that are clearly against euthanasia. Ramón's brother is clearly against, just like his father ("There is only one thing worse than the death of a child and it is having a child who wants to die"). Other users have commented that the discussion between Ramón and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that Ramón is GOOD and the priest is BAD. Well, certainly the scene is comical, but that does not mean that the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. From my point of view, the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince Ramón to continue living using arguments totally alien to Ramón's thought. The priest's speech follows the line of "God gives and God takes", "We do not own our own lives, they are God's" ... and so on. The comedy comes from the fact that Ramón is an atheist and that everything the priest is saying does not make sense. <br /> <br /> This film is the antithesis of manicism, leaving the viewer the opportunity to think about the subject and make his own opinion. And above all it is a song of FREEDOM.
