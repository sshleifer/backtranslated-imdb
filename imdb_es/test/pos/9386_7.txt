As Roger Corman said in an interview, the making of low-budget films allows filmmakers to take risks with unconventional ideas. Well, it would be difficult to find a film that thrives as unconventional as "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" by George Barry. <br /> <br /> The movie has a background story, and it's interesting in that. I will give up transmitting any kind of details so you can listen to them yourself if you risk seeing them. Suffice to say that the title of the furniture has an insatiable hunger, which consumes the unsuspecting with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims as acid. <br /> <br /> "Death Bed" is a spooky and disturbing movie that plays its absurd premise in such a way that it transcends the usual variety of schlock fare. He occupies his particular dream world in such a way that I was able to take it seriously. It is a truly strange and unconventional horror movie. It delves into the exploitative ingredients (there are some tasty samples of female nudity) and, however, it is also art, although it is art with a completely distorted sensibility. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not so bad for a film with a microscopic budget, and Barry gives the film a good, atmospheric "midnight movie" quality. The cast's performance is as uninspiring as one might imagine, though Patrick Spence-Thomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as the artist / narrator, and a definite point of interest is to see a familiar face in his hand: the future 'Boy Meets World 'Father William Russ! <br /> <br /> This movie may not even have found the little cult it has if it were not for the pirated copies that were rolling; Undoubtedly, this must be considered one of the cases in which this practice ended up helping the film, even if the exhibition took years to take hold. <br /> <br /> If you like really strange dark items, "The deathbed" may be just what you have in mind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
