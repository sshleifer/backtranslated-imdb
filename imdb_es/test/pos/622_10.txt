This is a VERY good movie. I give it a 10. <br /> <br /> It's very different, since it's a long harassment scene. The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout history in a very credible way. <br /> <br /> She sees a murder (for a snuff film) and decides to run but is persecuted (this takes quite some time). hour). I will not reveal the rest of the film because it would ruin the experience, but you can be calm: it is very credible, it is well interpreted, it is very intense and it has some pleasant surprises and a great ending. <br /> <br /> Don 'Do not miss this movie.
