This film reappeared on Channel 13 in the 1990s when they made a series of Hollywood comedies in the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, to the beat of "The Jolly Fat Policeman," they had a montage of movie scenes for Present to the series of people who laugh, including one of Gary Cooper who laughs when watching a movie in a movie theater - a sequence of this movie. <br /> <br /> Everything starts innocently when Cooper, a millionaire, enters a luxurious shopping center in France to buy pajamas. But he just likes to sleep on top. The employee (Tyler Brooke) insists that he can not sell half of a pajama like Cooper wants. Claudette Colbert listens to the argument and offers to help, she just likes to sleep in pajama pants. What if Brooke sells each half? Brooke has never had such an offer, so she goes to the floor walker (Rolfe Sedan) and asks if this can be done. He is disturbed too, the request is quite unconventional. Finally, they contact the store owner (Charles Halton). Halton is in bed and comes out: his thin frame holding only a pajama top (if it's one long enough for the sake of censorship). Can they sell the two customers a set of pajamas (half of each)? Halton, duly horrified, replies: "No, of course not, that's communism!" So the sale is not allowed. Apparently, no one believes that Cooper can buy the full pair and sell half to Colbert. <br /> <br /> BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, from Lubitsch, has a reputation for falling on the floor, most viewers do not like it because they misread the character of Colbert. She is considered pretty mercenary towards Cooper, selling herself on her terms. <br /> <br /> Actually, Cooper's character is the most unpleasant, since he is rich and believes that everything has a price. It is correct most of the time. Look at the way the aristocratic beggar of a father of Colbert, Edward Everett Horton, sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. Cooper's willingness to marry Colbert in some way includes an agreement that if he has doubts or decides not to marry her, he has to pay for the damages. Horton, when he realizes this, pulls out a clock and (in the most reassuring voice) tells Cooper: "Take your time, boy!", To make a decision. Later, we see that Horton's wardrobe has become more modern and elegant. <br /> <br /> The film, written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, compares well with his screenplay for MIDNIGHT by Mitchell Leisin (also with Colbert, but with Don Ameche and John Barrymore). There, Colbert is willing to sell herself for a monetary marriage with (to Francis Lederer), but is complicated by a fictitious marriage with Ameche. She really loves Ameche (a taxi driver) but explains in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents were married "for love", but poverty made them grow up to hate each other. This is not found in the EIGHTH WIFE OF BLUEBEARD, where Colbert does not have a background like that (she is, after all, the daughter of a Marquis). His mercenary plan is to teach Cooper a lesson about his standards. <br /> <br /> The film has a good job of support staff, including Herman Bing as a private eye that turns out to be hiding things that Colbert learns from. , and a young David Niven, who has a set of moments of choice as a position in the punching bag and as an ear willing to Cooper. Coop tells Niven about his problems with Colbert and how she is so enraged. Niven listens with respect. In the end, Cooper is moved by his willingness to listen to what he had to say. "Albert, how much do I pay you?" Cooper asks. Niven thinks and says: "Thirty-five francs a week, sir." Cooper looks deeply into his soul and says (shaking his head): "That's right!"
