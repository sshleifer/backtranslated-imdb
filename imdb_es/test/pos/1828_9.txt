Bonny Hunt marks a coup d'etat with her directorial debut. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have something indescribable called chemistry. Of course, the plot is unlikely, but that does not stop one from enjoying this movie. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other great character actors play their card friends. Jim Belushi is hilarious as Megan's realistic husband, part of the extended family. <br /> <br /> Faith, family and marriage are respected. Some sexual references and salty words are used, but in context and with mild humor. <br /> <br /> And in the end, that wonderful song by Dean Martin: "Return to Me". <br /> <br /> Recommended.
