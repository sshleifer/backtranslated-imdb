The film begins with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for the sole reason that he is black, and the agency needs a "tab" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everyone is ignoring Swope ... Suddenly, the CEO screams in the act. No time is wasted A janitor is called to remove the body, and the board immediately and unceremoniously addresses the business of electing a new CEO. And as the votes are added one by one, the tension builds up and finally breaks into a hilariously ironic climax to the vote, which gives the viewer a delicious plate of logical implications to savor the rest of the movie. If you've ever talked to a stupid TV commercial, you'll like to watch this movie. Too bad there does not seem to be any real Putney Swop in the world.
