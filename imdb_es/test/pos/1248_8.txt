Hello, looking for a movie for the family to see on a Friday night? You can not find what you're looking for? I thought this was an extremely nice movie. Good for the whole family. I discovered that it had an extraordinarily rare combination of attractiveness for both adults and children. It was brilliant, to say the least. The performance of Bruce Willis was first class, there was a lot of humor and, in general, a great movie. In my opinion, it is a movie that must be seen. And I do not think that's about a lot of movies, believe me when I say it takes a lot for a movie to make me think that. It is clear that there was a lot of work done by Bruce Willis and the cast to finish this movie. Excellent story, good acting, and once again, in general, a very nice movie.
