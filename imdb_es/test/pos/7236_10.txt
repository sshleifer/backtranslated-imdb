Tromeo and Julieta (1996) are another gem of the movie archives of Troma Studios. Like The Toxic Avenger, Troma's War, Class of Nuke 'em High, Terror Firmer and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. This movie is an instant troma classic. James Gunn updates Romeo and Juliet taking a medieval tragedy and reinvents it as a street punk drama of today. If you have seen or read the work, nothing has changed much, except that it has been "tromatizado". <br /> <br /> Lloyd Kaufman adds his own twisted vision to the script and turns it into a very nice movie. The actors handle the script very well. I was surprised at how well they did the dialogue, much better than some of the big budgeted Hollywood actors who use a monstrous budget and expensive sets. I enjoyed this movie very much. Lloyd Kaufman does not disappoint because you know what to expect from his films and other Troma productions. I'd rather watch one of his films and be entertained than watching a boring and expensive movie with pampered actors, loose scripts, lazy directors and those terrible C.G.I. special effects. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. If you like funny movies with special cheese effects, with maximum performance and inspired direction, then this movie is just for you!
