The cast is admirably chosen and well balanced. This cinematography is excellent. The music is lovely as is all the music of Burt Bacharach, and is appropriate for the plot. Making a musical version of Hilton's story is a welcome change from a laborious rebuild. We see experienced actors who add real depth to the emotional content and meaning of each scene. I can not agree with the critics who overlooked this dazzling jewel of a movie. It is a treasure of the silver screen! Find him if he can and let his magic take him beyond the nightmares of daily worries, inspiring him to find his own "Lost Horizon".
