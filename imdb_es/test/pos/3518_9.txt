For a movie like this little hidden gem to go on sale in the 80s, it's shocking that not many people know it. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth seeing. It has all the things you need for a horror movie. Especially the good chills. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but I could not remember the name, so I came to IMDb a few years ago to ask. to get help in the search of the title. I finally got the name of the title and bought the movie. I still love him as much as I did so many years ago. <br /> <br /> Buy this movie!
