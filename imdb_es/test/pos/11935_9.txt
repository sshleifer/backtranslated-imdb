This is one of the best "Bloke" movies of the early 90s and although it is a bit old fashioned, it is one of those movies that would never be made today, which makes it very special! In fact, in the 90s a very similar movie called "Masterminds" was made and it was a variation of PG on the same subject, but it was not so funny or realistic for that matter. <br /> <br /> So, what is that? so special about this movie? It is the combination between the main characters and the theme against all prognosis of the film. Sean Astin is very nice and has starred in some of the most memorable films of the 80/90, in particular "The Goonies". It also happened to more important things with the trilogy "Rudy" and "The Lord of the Rings", but "Encino Man" is a good journey along the path of memory. Will Wheaton from "Stand by Me" lends great support to the film and Andrew Divoff is an excellent villain. Louis Gossett Jr walks asleep in his role, but adds some brevity to the film, particularly his relationship with the rebellious nature of Astin. <br /> <br /> So, how is the action? By today's standards, it is quite tedious and cheap, almost like a television movie, but the production values ​​are good and the violence is quite unpleasant for a film that involves school students. However, the director compensates the limited budget with some pleasant moments and a good mood. <br /> <br /> So park your brain at the door and enjoy this action movie remembered with a lot of love, but do not wait for Oscar material!
