A comedy beautifully constructed and brilliantly performed. There is not a person in the cast who does not absolve himself with a hilarious distinction. However, the true star of the film is the invisible director, Frank Oz, who brings all the sensitivity and ingenuity to this farce that brought Miss Piggy encounters with the Kermit frog. This is a movie that should not be missed.
