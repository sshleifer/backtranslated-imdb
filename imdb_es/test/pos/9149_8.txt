This film is a good start for beginners who have never seen a 'silent film' and for those who believe that the quality of cinema began with the efforts of their generations. They are hurting themselves by not expanding their horizons. The 'Silent Film' is an art form of acting in pantomime that is different from the sound film and the stage, it can be sustained by its own merits. <br /> <br /> THE BELOVED ROGUE (1927) United Artists is A fictional story of the relationship between the French poet 'Francois Villon' and 'King Louis XI'. Through the insinuation of 'Villons', 'King Louis' will defeat his nemesis 'Duke of Burgandy', minimize the feudal system and establish the KING as head of state and the beginnings of modern France. <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional, directed by JOHN BARRYMORE (yes, Drew's grandfather). For those who only remember him for the decomposing actor 'Larry Renault' in DINNER AT EIGHT (1933) or the ham in THE INVISABLE WOMEN (1940), this will be a revelation. Adjust, cut with the 'Great profile' still in evidence that he sends the screen. Co-Protagonist in his first American film is CONRAD VEIDT with his interpretation of 'cadaverous spider' of 'Louis XI'. This is a duel of titans acting, each of which does not give an inch to the other. In a note of triviality is the character actor and the dwarf ANGELO ROSSITTO in his first film, his last, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985). There are other character actors that would continue in the sound that are easily detected. <br /> <br /> United Artists paid no attention to expenses in this beautiful production supervised by WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES. The costumes, accessories and sets are well made and not exaggerated as in the DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS productions. There is a touch of reality here. The DVD copy we saw of 'Delta Entertainment' came from a good teacher. Although it was not "restored", its musical soundtrack was clear and the impression only suffered from annoying black spots (dirt) and abandonments. The only major damage at the end of the last coil of water. 'Kino' also has an edition that can be of better quality since they make important restorations in their prints. Better to consult with them. In our opinion, this is a 'must have' particularly if you do not have 'silences' in your collection. This is a good place to start.
