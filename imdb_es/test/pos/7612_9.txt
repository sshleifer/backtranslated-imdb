I love this movie so much. That always makes me cry. If you appreciate Drew Barrymore half as much as me, you will love this movie. It has all the essential elements that I look for in a movie. He has good actors, good characters, good humor ... also many moving moments. However, the flash-back moments when we see Josie in high school make me cry. Every time. I'm sure you'll like this, do not judge by the fact that it looks like a movie for teenagers, although in a way it's a movie for teenagers. Sure, if you're a boy, and all you see are unconditional special effects movies alone in the 250 best movies of all time, then this is not for you. But if you like romantic comedies that you will not forget after watching them, pick it up at a video store and enjoy: Drew Barrymore is great at this.
