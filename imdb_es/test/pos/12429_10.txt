If you took a good Jack Black movie, you added some small jeweler vines and then a little bit of joy with a touch of Texas massacre and a house of 1000 corpses ... you would have MONSTER MAN! I entered this movie, I did not expect much, but I ended up enjoying the movie. The whole premise is really corny, a monster man in a monster truck chases people, but it's so funny that the writer / director does not expect you to take it seriously. Justin Urich is a comical gem and should have a very promising career. He is identical to Jack Black. The only problem with the movie is the incredible hero role played by eric jungmann. but, in general, if you're looking for a really fun movie that will crack you until you're rolling through the corridors and, at the same time, you get scared ... watch this movie.
