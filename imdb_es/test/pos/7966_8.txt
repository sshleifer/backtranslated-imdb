Towards the end of his career, Jack Arnold, a very efficient director who gave us characteristics of such classic 1950s creatures as "It Came from Outer Space", "The Creature from the Black Lagoon" and "Tarantula", came together to the former soccer star. turned to the top 70 of the blaxploitation film, the conductor Fred "the Hammer" Williamson, in a couple of films, producing the cordial and striking western "The Black Bounty Hunter", and this refreshing breeze, ingenious and highly entertaining variant black action of the 70 in the standard film of the 40s The thread of private detectives in the heels. <br /> <br /> Williamson shows a charming combination of dry and self-critical humor and a relaxed and carefree self-confidence like Shep Stone, a cheap, affable and forever character. The former Los Angeles policeman became a private investigator. Stone is so hard to get that he uses a bar as his business office and barely arrives in order to solve minor cases of low cost that the police do not want to bother. As he hits the pavement for one of these deceptively simple concerts (Stone is trying to find the fugitive teenage daughter of a guy hiding somewhere in Hollywood), Stone finds himself in a complex, dangerous and seemingly bottomless , a criminal plot that includes a deviant Jesus. religious cult monster, dopies hippies of varied dead heads, a sleazy porn ring, an incalculable gold-tipped cane that belonged to a legendary silent movie star, an infamous clandestine drug smuggling operation and an increasing number of fresh corpses <br /> <br /> While lacking the perversely playful and mischievous wit of Robert Altman's masterful "The Long Goodbye" or the haunting and tireless pessimism of Arthur Penn's beautifully gloomy "Night Moves," the "Black Eye" does not it stops being such a high note The successful turn of Hip'n'flip 70 in the mysterious suspense thrillers of 40. Arnold's able direction keeps the rhythm moving at a pleasant and constant rhythm, dotted with knuckle-fighting scenes Naked hand-to-hand sporadic and excellent use of several red and sordid LA places (the dilapidated amusement park abandoned at the conclusion of the film is especially effective). The script by Mark Haggard and Jim Martin provides a good amount of plot twists that are quite complicated and often genuinely surprising. And the long-awaited variety of extravagant and rudimentary side characters is an interesting and bizarre group, with particularly notable twists of Rosemary Forsyth as an attractive and powerful owner of a lesbian model agency (Forsyth has the best line of image, boasting of Stone when She meets him for the first time: "I am a woman of everything", Teresa Graves, of the TV show "Get Christie Love", as the bisexual bisexual loyal of Stone (the casual and unprejudiced representation of Foryth's film, the woman Foryth's fatal unconventional and Graves'.) Atypical gal Friday is one of his strongest assets, and Bret Morrison, who made the voice of "The Shadow" on the radio in the 40s, as a cocky porn filmmaker and of poor quality, but it is a modest, but sure winner.
