The first time I heard about Begotten was when one of my friends picked it up in a "cult classics" section of my local video retailer. She knew that I liked dark and artistic films, so I rented them and took them home. He sat on my TV for a couple of days and then I put it on the VCR just before going to bed. I thought maybe I would see how it is first and then spend more time the next day. What followed was that he actually woke me up. I sat through the whole movie and I loved it. After I went through the closing credits I saw it again. Only after you see the closing credits do you have an idea of ​​who is who. After you know you can see it again with renewed appreciation. Do not listen to the people who destroy this movie. It is not for everyone. If you are someone who does not like reading subtitles, this movie is not for you (there are no subtitles, there is no dialogue). If you are someone who really has Rush Hour 2, this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> This movie is truly original and inspiring. It does what other movies have never done. It does not look like anything else and is bolder than almost everything there, from 1989 to the present day. You can say that everyone involved in the making of this film truly loves the art of what they do and understands what can be captured in film form. <br /> <br /> If you are looking to be "entertaining", then the movie is not for you. However, it is pure escapism in some extreme way and in film form. It's like someone connects wires to my head and records one of my worst nightmares. But this nightmare makes sense if you really sit down and look at the images, dissect the action of the actors and do not sit there playing the guitar passively, but look and do not blink. <br /> <br /> People compare it with Eraserhead But engendered is much more. I'm not kidding when I say it's my favorite movie. It is an important film, visually stimulating, mechanically inspiring and hypnotic. A review I read about this is very true, however, "nobody will manage to end up with Begotten without being marked".
