I did not expect much when I decided to watch this movie, so I was surprised to find myself enjoying it. A couple of scenes made me laugh almost uncontrollably. The characters were engaged (no pun); However, the story is predictable. The fun is to see Crawl (the character of Shore), a California uncle and wise but wise that a college girl takes home for Thanksgiving, trying with her uncomfortable (though attractive) way of adapting to her style of lifetime. I was also surprised that there was a message in all this. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie!
