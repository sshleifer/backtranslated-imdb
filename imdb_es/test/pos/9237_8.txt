This film would be particularly fun for anyone who has been in the film industry, especially with regard to any independent ability ... those whose heritage includes an introduction to the film may not appreciate it as much. I'm hard to please in the documentary category. However, this document is different; his pleasure comes from an earthly realism of indie filmmakers' punks that are very pleasing to be near and to watch. If you've ever wondered what it's like to be in a movie, in front of or behind the camera, or if you've worked your way through the sometimes painful and hard but rewarding independent world, you'll surely love it. this movie.
