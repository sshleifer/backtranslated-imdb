I love foreign films and this is one of the best. I tend not to see this as a comedy since it appears on the list and I find a comment on how we see others around us. Firmine, the protagonist of the film, is not due to her, since she is a domestic employee in a large company and people say and do things around them all the time that they would not otherwise say in front of others. leaves it with a group of information that can make or break the simple mortal. :) This actress is wonderful as this character and it is a moving story. There is an underlying story and almost many stories within the story in this movie. I only hope that if someone decides to make an American / English version of this film, it is not the vein of Three Men and a Baby that would definitely harm this CINE, it must be seen ...
