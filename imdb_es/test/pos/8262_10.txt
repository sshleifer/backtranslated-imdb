As you can see, I loved the book so much that I use the title for my Internet alias and I have it for more than 15 years. (Well, at that time it had to be written to fit the character limit of the name for the BBS, but what could I do?) If someone finds this movie, I'd love to see it! Janet McTeer is great in everything else I've seen of her. I think she would have done a great Prue. And even introduces Clive Owen, since before Chancer (a great series itself). What could not be loved? I hope the powers are wise and available on DVD soon! With some of the real dredging that pouts, it is time for well-executed productions to reach the market as well.
