I must admit that I did not expect much in this movie. I was surprised that he enjoyed it as much as I did. The script was not Oscar material, but it was not horrible either. The performance was great for Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great supporting role, and she looked beautiful as always. What this movie did for me was music. If you do not like the glam metal or hair bands of the 80s, then you probably will not like this movie. It's about being a rock star. Some clich√©s were present, but they did not shoot down the film at all. I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to stand up and scream! 8 out of 10 for a great performance and incredible music. <br /> <br /> Jason
