Another black comedy that won an Oscar for Best Screenplay. Starring George C Scott, this redefines the phrase "rip a new $$ hole". In this case, the goal is Medicare and the large hospital system in the United States. Throughout the hospital, patients and doctors are dying because their names and prescriptions are being changed. Scott roars, shouts and dismisses his workers and bosses as they fail more and more. His comment on Dachau to one of his many bosses will surely elicit laughter. He even hits and rapes a hippie 3 times. This is one that must be seen and heard, since monologues and soliloquies are the key points of the film.
