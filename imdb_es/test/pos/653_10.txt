In the early 80's, I recorded the Honky Tonk Freeway from the cable. Since then I have waited, waiting for it to be on DVD. Yesterday I found it. It is one of the best studies of humorous characters that I have seen. The Old Fashioned episode is priceless. At this time (04/28/02) only two have reviewed it. One hated him, the other loved him. If you have a DVD player, you can rent it or buy it like I did.
