"The Journey" is a very good movie. Produced in the spring of 1958, in Vienna, and released in 1959, this film was quite popular in its early years. Despite the political problems, which influenced the success of the film (because the story takes place during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), "The Journey" is a very good movie, but not very well known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD, because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home. One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, their intense relationship. All of their scenes together are very important, but they also reveal the strong feelings, the great passion and love between the characters (Mayor Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is the script, which is very well written. It was even published as a novel, by the screen player George Tabori. The film maintains its tension from the beginning to the end. At first, we did not know if Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary, because the communist commander discovers that Diana's friend, Paul Kedes, is Hungarian and is not allowed to leave the country. The Major falls deeply in love with Diana and this is, in fact, the real reason why he does not want to let her go. But after he hugs her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on the screen, and she kisses him too, he lets her go. And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed: Major and Diana say "Goodbye!", Arrive at the border with all travelers, including Paul, while Surov receives several shots from some Hungarians, as well that he dies. Yul Brynner is very, very handsome and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful, charming, refined, like an English lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of the best couples in Golden Hollywood. A true spectator should see this movie. "The Journey" has everything a good movie should have: a captivating story, interesting characters, a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is, in my opinion, the best). Finally, I want to give a message to Warner Bros. Studios or to those who restore and release classic movies: Please release "The Journey" on DVD as soon as possible.
