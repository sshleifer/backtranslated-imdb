Since others have complained about putting Sherlock Holmes in a contemporary environment, I will not. Basil Rathbone could have fit in at any time with that voice, that savoir faire. This is a very well-made mystery based on "The Dancing Men", one of the best stories of Conan-Doyle. Instead of the original plot, it makes men part of a Nazi plot. Holmes becomes a spokesman for the British war effort. His adversary is Moriarity, who seems to die often enough to rival the central figure in the movies on Friday the 13th. He is certainly creative, but the Rathbone Holmes is unflappable. Watson is along the ride on this. He is not given much stupidity to speak in this movie and that is a great advantage. The plot is complex enough to maintain interests. There is a conclusion speech that is almost a parody of itself. But then I can not be critical of a time and a nation that was under great pressure. If they needed to call Holmes, so be it.
