What I liked the most about this animated film from 1941 is the great sensation it offers in the early 1940s. It's the songs, the clothes, the cars, the jargon of the buildings of the day, etc. You feel like you have stepped back in time. <br /> <br /> As I read some of the reviews here, I see that this was difficult. - Lucky movie, being released a couple of days before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Wow, nobody would be interested in going to the movies for a feature film caricature during those eventful days, I'm sure. Pity, because people missed a good animation that really would have impressed at that time, almost 70 years ago. The colors are nice, the drawings are good and a story that involves the insects led by "Hoppity" and his beautiful girl "Honey" to make them happy forever and out of danger. It is also about all of them finding a place covered in grass in which they can live and not worry about the humans trampling them. <br /> <br /> There is a nasty villain, however, "C. Bagley Beetle" - and two of his henchmen. These assistants ("Swat, The Fly" and "Smack, the Mosquito") are comedians, with their Brooklyn accents! The story is familiar in which an unpleasant old man wants to marry the sweet young man and uses unscrupulous means to force his hand. Meanwhile, the good guy has the stick stacked against him, but in the end, of course, prevails. <br /> <br /> My favorite part (this will sound worse than it was) was when it was good "Hoppity" was electrocuted temporarily and danced in black and white. That was a fantastic animation! <br /> <br /> You know, it's good that I did not see him as a very small child; I would be afraid to play outside and crush all those nice people! You never know what (or who) is in that grass under your feet!
