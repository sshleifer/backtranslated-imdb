It was a movie that made you think a bit. Some parts a bit corny, some parts pretty good. The plot got thicker sometimes and just when you thought that Angella (Sandra) found a friend, the friend was dead or with fraud. All I have to say is that DENNIS MILLER should have been in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing after all the trash that Angella went through. He would have lifted me and Angella through the garbage cans.
