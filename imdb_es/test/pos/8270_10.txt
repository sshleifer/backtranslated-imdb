Hello, I'm John and I'd like to tell you that my dog ​​was in this movie on the bait screen, it was the hole as one, that he was going to bite the chained man. My dog's name was Colin and he stayed filming for a week for this movie. It was also in other things like criminal watch uk and some other small parts. He won some dog shows, but he died. Now I miss him. He was an excellent dog, faithful and loyal. We had fun times together, but he had a cancer that could not be treated, so I had to get rid of him. The worst day of my life, I hope this gives you something to look for in the movie if you see it again. <br /> <br /> Thanks to everyone.
