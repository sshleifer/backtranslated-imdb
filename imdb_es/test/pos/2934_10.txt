"Americans Next Top Model" is the best reality show! I entertained 99.9 percent of the time looking at it. I kept my eyes open all the time. (well, I blinked) It can be sad, funny or addictive. (mostly addictive) "Next Top Model United States" kept me wanting more and that's the point. It is also on more than one channel. Sometimes it is on MTV other times it is not. I hope you have more fans and grow to be a successful series! It's great for almost all ages, so everyone can enjoy it! :) <br /> <br /> Also, if you've watched the show before, have not you noticed that Tyra has a different hairstyle every time in the judges room? It will be short and curly one week, and then long and straight the next.
