Seeing this hilariously retro but very entertaining tale of career women, I was surprised by Joan Crawford's first appearance. All I could think about initially was: "My God, it's the same face as Michael Jackson in his notorious booking photo!" <br /> <br /> About 34 minutes from the movie, Diane Baker and Hope Lange get out of a taxi in Greenwich Village. While walking down the street, you can see part of a sign behind them for the Stonewall Bar, the scene of the "riots" of the time that are considered the trigger of the modern movement of the rights of homosexuals. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Baker and the taxis, I had to laugh when she gets into one and says to the taxi driver: "56th and Sutton Place, please, and be careful with the potholes". Can you imagine the reaction of a driver in Manhattan today? She says that, of course, because she is pregnant and does not want to hurt the fetus. But that does not stop him from jumping out of a moving car when he discovers that Bob Evans wants him to abort! Well, they had to find a way for her to lose the baby (1959 and all). <br /> <br /> Sue Carson is charming like Mary Agnes. Why was this his only movie? There is no biographical information about her in IMDb.
