Once again, Doctor Who delivers the goods for the load of the bucket. It has humor ("You are inventing it as you go!" "Yes, but I do it brilliantly"), action, monsters (in this case even more cybernauts), tragedies and scare tactics. In short, just what the doctor prescribed (intentionally). The way in which emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no sense of "moving on". Then, point 3 of the last 4 episodes that have made you laugh, then they made you cry and they made you pass "eek". <br /> <br /> In terms of character development, this is clearly the deciding factor for Noel Clarke's Mickey (and Ricky). Being one of the Doctor's partners, you know you will do the right thing and you may even suspect the way you do it. However, it is still an emotional shock when it confirms its future path. <br /> <br /> While "The rise of netizens" had more of the sinister buildup of terror, "The age of steel" is an all out explosion. As "Alien" compared to "Aliens", both They are true classics, but in different ways. Can the series keep it at this level? Hopefully.
