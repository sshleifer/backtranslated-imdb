Although both this film and the car chase firm have shown a lack of respect on the part of many critics, both are well above average. Roy Scheider does an excellent job playing his best guy; a strong and courageous policeman who works hard to do the job despite the drivers and politicians who should support him instead of hinder him. (He played a suburban version of this same role as the police chief of the tourist town in Jaws.) It's not so rough, but the same "do the job in spite of the politicians" and the brave approach.If a man who does not know swimming is terrified of everything in the water coming out in an old boat with a wabab and a nerd from Ahab, to face a huge killer shark, he has no guts, then tell me what it is ...). <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain; Most villains, in fact, have some depth and complexity. This is one of those films that improves with repeated presentations. In general, it captures the atmosphere of parts of New York City: sandy, not glamorous, often dangerous, but full of energy. History is sparse, narrow and subtle; does the work without strange elements. It may not be one of the best of all time, but it's an exceptionally good movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has an opinion about car chases. Mine is that this is up to the chase of the Mustang vs Dodge Charger in Bullitt. The Pontiac Ventura / Chevy Nova was similar to the Mustang for being a compact car chassis with reinforced suspension and a powerful small V8 block tucked into an engine compartment intended for a tasteless 6. The Ventura / Novas was left with a little respect for the tow band, but with the right suspension mods, made affordable performance cars that could handle both on the road and on the track. The shout of GM V8s as they end is music to the enthusiast's ear. I have heard this persecution criticized for "imitating" Bullitt's persecution. The truth is that they are two works by the same teacher, Bill Hickman, who also choreographed and managed to persecute French Connection. In addition to handling most of the car chase scenes, he created a melancholy and malevolent presence and a good combination with Richard Lynch as a pair of coldly evil assassins. <br /> <br /> Yes, the persecution has "errors of realism" often pointed out, such as the use of 3 different roads in New York to represent the Palisades Parkway, the end of the chase in an accident with a vehicle of 18 wheels on a road just for passenger vehicles, and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape the damage. That is not relevant. Let's face it: movie car chases are "unreal" by nature. However, in Bullitt, The French Connection and The Seven Ups, Bill Hickman and Phillip D'Antoni created much more realistic, and therefore more exciting, pursuits than the fantasy chases of flying vehicles, explosives, so common in recent films .
