People seem to be waiting for citizen Kane here! The planet is a movie of B monsters and, as such, is fun and different enough to be enjoyed. The director clearly has something to offer, not very sure about some of the actors. As for the effects? Â£ 8000 is not a budget of many effects. On the one hand, I would gladly recommend it to a science fiction boss or anyone who does not take monster movies too seriously. If so? Instead, see 3colours blue. I noticed that a review said that I had scammed Alien. As if Alien had not stolen things. The best of the movie? Director. The worst of the movie? The cast. Maybe it's time for the Director to move from Glasgow to London and find some talent. Meanwhile - well done. At least you're trying to do something.
