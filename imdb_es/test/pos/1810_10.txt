What can I say?? This movie has it all ... Romance, breakups, rich kids, punks and preparations. This is my favorite movie of all time that I can recite line by line ... I remember when it came out, I was 14 years old and could not enter ... so I finally saw it on the cable ... I was hooked! I wanted to move to California and be a girl from the valley ... (Hey, I even remember the Moon Zappa song, right?) I tried in vain for years to get the soundtrack that never happened ... now you can find it on the discs of rhinoceroses ....
