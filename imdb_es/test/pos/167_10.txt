Bloody Birthday plays with the alleged innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne, credited as Billy Jacoby) and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy), all were born the same day during an eclipse. In addition to sharing a birthday, they also share a love for murder (and are not fussy about who they kill). The young Billy, Elizabeth and Andy interpret the parts of these monsters pretty well without emotion, but they know when to put the spell as well. But they can not continue fooling everyone. This is a good horror movie in general, it is not unrealistic, there are some good moments of suspense and the children interpreted the roles well (although the adults are pretty bad). I would say it's worth seeing (I have a copy myself).
