Uzumaki, it's a visually stunning film, and I do not think anyone can discuss that. But, unfortunately, the story is somewhat flat. <br /> <br /> The movie, however, is very entertaining. He uses his wild style to tell a somewhat non-existent story. The movie almost works, only depending on its characters and style, but in my opinion, leaves something to be desired.
