One should not be too critical with the second characteristic of the director. <br /> <br /> I really like Madiba's camera work. As Mr. Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of looking at things. <br /> <br /> However, how is it possible for a 14-year-old child to take such beautiful images? Remember that you do not have any kind of education. I do not think English is the common language in the ghettos of Cape Town. Worse still, Madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14 years. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you overcome the features mentioned above, you can watch the movie and continue enjoying the good work of the camera.
