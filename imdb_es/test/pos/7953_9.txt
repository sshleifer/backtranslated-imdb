I really appreciate what Jung-won had done before his death. All. I mean that his choice for love is disinterested. If he chose Da-rim, that would be good for him. But Da-rim will need more time to recover from his death. Obviously he does not want to let it happen. As he did in the movie, he chose to give up. So it was just a temporary agony for Da-rim. <br /> <br /> As a comparison, My life without me is very different. Their behavior shows a great difference between the oriental culture and the western culture. I can not say which is better. Everyone can have the right to choose. That is totally up to you. Life is the same for everyone. We can live only once. Any option is acceptable if only you think it's right for you. <br /> <br /> In truth, the slow pace of the film can not be the excuse to reject the movie. Calm down. You will get more from the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best Korean movies I've seen in my life. 9/10
