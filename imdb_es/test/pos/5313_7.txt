After stabbing a retarded child, pessimist Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), fifteen years old, with problems, is sent to juvenile detention. His teacher and aspiring writer Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle) approaches and tries to understand him, first with the intention of writing a book and then becoming his friend. Leland slowly reveals his sad vision of the world, showing that he is a sociopath. <br /> <br /> "The United States of Leland" is a depressing and interesting study of a character. The slow-paced riveting script reveals parts of the story like a puzzle; There are excellent lines and dialogues; The performances are great, although Ryan Gosling, twenty-three, does not convince as a teenager of fifteen years; but it seems that a part is missing to complete the puzzle and make "The United States of Leland" an unforgettable movie. The disappointing clarification of the "why" of Leland's violent action against Ryan Pollard is neither convincing nor moving, in fact it shows that this character is a sociopath totally deranged with a strange and sickly vision of the world. Also, the way Allen Harris gets Pearl's knife is ridiculous. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Mundo de Leland" ("The world of Leland")
