Of course I'll think it was a great movie. I recognized several people that I did not see during the filming as well. I was the one who was on duty an hour after the movie in the exercise hall on death row asking for a light for a cigarette. I also changed this scene. Originally, they had established the order to go to the playground and straighten the inmate, turn him around and take him out. The Director said: "It's taking you a long time, what would you do, Gower?" I said, "We have to go in, hook the arms and drag him back, that way, the camera can stay in his face while we take him out of the stage." I also lived in this same prison when I was a small child, since my father was the Assistant Security Guard. I am also a current employee in the Tennessee Department of Corrections as a supervisor at the Riverbend Maximum Safety Institution. Although much of the movie was a joke, the part I participated in was reality. Also in the bar scene, the dancer kicking in the air and leaving the stage was a real stripper with whom he used to work in a club called "The Classic Cat".
