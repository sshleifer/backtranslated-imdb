I saw FAREWELL TO HARRY at the Plaza Theater while I was in New York City and I was quite surprised. The performance of William Hall Jr. is tremendous. This is a movie for the movie classic. The direction of Garrett Bennett reminds me of the early work of Barry Levinson and Robert Redford. The film seems to transcend the typical independent film. It has a soul and a visual power that is quite unique. I saw this with a small audience (400) that were captivated from the first credit until the last and, although I did not go out to mourn (like the lady next to me), I have to admit that I had a little watering in my eyes .. . <br /> <br />
