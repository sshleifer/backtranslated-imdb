This is my first movie of Deepa Mehta. I saw the film on television in its Hindi version with its character "Sita" presented as Nita. I also note that it is Radha who submitted to the allegorical trial for fire in the film and not Nita / Sita. However, what I loved about the movie was his script for Ms Mehta, not his address. The characters, large and small, were well developed and seemed quixotic towards the end, something like the end of "A single woman" by Mazursky. They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And a cardboard man (Ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him, with his invalid mother Biji. It seems that finally assumes a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherence to religion. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Mehta seems to have difficulties as a director (however, compared to most of the main Indian cinema, she seems to be brilliant), since she can not use her script to go beyond the family microscopic presented, except the presentation A look at the Chinese micro-minority in the social environment of India. He even dedicates the film to his mother and daughter (not to his father!) However, his Radha recalls Halcyon's days with her parents in a mustard field. Compare her to Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giants, given her competent Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehta's movie of two bisexual ladies in a middle-class Indian home may be a sacrilege for some, but it simply captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire to anything better than their immediate survival in a limited social space. Kannada, Malayalam and the Bengali films have touched on parallel themes in India but they did not have the publicity surrounding this film and, therefore, have not been seen by a wide segment of informed filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Das, Mrs. Azmi, Mr. Jafri and Mr. Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding. Ms. Azmi is a talented actress who gave excellent performances under good directors ("Khandar" by Mrinal Sen, "Paar" by Gautam Ghose, "Ankur" by Benegal), a brilliant notably absent in this film. Ms. Das shone because of her presence on the screen instead of her acting ability. In general, the strength of the film remains in the structure of the script that is above average in terms of international cinema. I am sure that Mrs. Mehta can perfect her writing talents in her future scripts.
