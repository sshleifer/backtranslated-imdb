This is the first feature film by Australian comedian Mick Molloy. Mick wrote the movie with his brother Richard with the help of John Clarke, another comedian and actor. Mick and John also have leading roles along with several other iconic Australian actors: Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson and others. The basic premise of the film is that Jack Simpson (Mick Molloy) has become a member of a Lawn Bowls Club for the sole purpose of obtaining free parking near his work. The Club is in a desperate financial situation and asks Jack for help. John Clarke plays the arch of the club: he is trying to take the club and turn it into a "Poker Machine Slum". Jack and the other members of the club come together to try to save the club with many funny twists and turns, and the eventual redemption of Jacks. . This is a pretty smart little movie. It is well above the usual humor of Mick Molloys. It is pretty well written and well acted. The older Australian actors are brilliant (Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maughan and ors). The film snakes along instead of going along, but that adds to the charm of the movie. There is a low level of rude language.
