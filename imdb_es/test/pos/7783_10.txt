The summary is only for those who hate this movie, since it is acceptable to find the film as correct or average. Visiting this film in IMDb has made me feel nostalgic, since I can not avoid returning in the year 1994. I was one of the lucky few who saw this movie in theaters. Instantly it became one of my favorite comedies and it took some years to make it my favorite. How can I tell what made this movie my favorite? Was the writing excellent (the story was fine, but the script and the dialogues were fabulous)? Were superlative performances? Was it the mood of the movie? <br /> <br /> After thinking about it for so many years, I say it has to be a mix. It's one of those movies that did not have any flaws, not even its music. (The other movie that comes to mind at this moment is Sholay) <br /> <br /> PS: Rajkumar Santoshi, please keep a balance between your drama and comedy films. Only 1 comedy is not enough. I want moreeeeeeee ..........
