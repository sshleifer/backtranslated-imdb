Swift's socialism and pacifism resist against all odds in this well-made remake. (Did you know that there is no script after "good"? Fact.) He encounters warrior miniatures, socialist giants, philosophers (literally) with heads and clouds, and pacifist horses that rule Yahoos, almost Neanderthal humanoids. (Is that where yahoo came from?) We also met the cowardly Dr. Bates, the devout Mary Gulliver, the sweet and devoted son Thomas and the complete cast of a truly horrible lunatic asylum of the nineteenth century. The suspension of disbelief is easy, and our 7 and 12 year old girls enjoyed it as much as my husband and I did. (Sorry for the length, IMDb requires 10 lines.)
