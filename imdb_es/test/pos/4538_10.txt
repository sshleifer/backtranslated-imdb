I do not know why all the critics say that this was a bad movie, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Tommy (Chris Farley) and Richard (David Spade) are a great match. Tommy is the stupid guy who spent seven years in college, finally with a D +. Richard is the smart kid who was hated by everyone at school. How can you not laugh when the two are passionately singing "Superstar" by The Carpenters and suddenly the bell appears? In all this is a great movie, I recommend it.
