Faqrscape is really one of those programs that has it all, excellent acting, great cast, great writing, sets, chemistry, muppets ... it has everything and some, except a home. This fantastic series seems to have everything except the end. TPTB seems to think that it is a series that consists of series of consecutive single series, when anyone who looks knows that it is a continuous, epic love story that has an end that must be seen. If you've never seen Farscape, do yourself a favor and check it out on DVD when season 1 is released in October ... and season 2 is the best there is! Watch the reruns on the SciFi channel to catch up and then the new season will start from January to March, when most of the shows go to hiatis and make sure you watch them. If everything goes well we will have our end!
