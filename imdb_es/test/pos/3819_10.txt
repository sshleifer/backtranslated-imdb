I started watching The Outer Limits at 95 when I was 10 years old, and it just amazed me every week with every episode, every episode had a turn and every week I could not wait for the next. How the writers managed to do each episode so well and make it different from each one in a 7-season course surpasses me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, encounters with aliens and humans, and a vision of more of the paranormal and how it affects people. What really makes this a good show are the characters in each episode, they really show emotion and are really good actors. What you will also notice every week is an actor / actress who will know from a previous show that he is quite good in his own way. <br /> <br /> If you want to relax, sit down with a good time. Sci-fi show, then the outer limits are for you
