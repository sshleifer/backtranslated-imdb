The largest crowd that has ever seen a wrestling event in the United States took place at Wrestlemania 6. More than 93,000 people showed up to break the record inside the Rolling Stones, and this event did not disappoint at all. Perhaps the most important game of all time took place when the Immortal Hulk defended its world title against the Ultimate Warrior. There are more than 12 parties in total, so you get tons of action
