Like most sports films that have come out in the past, this film is similar in terms of aspects, which is based on facts. What distinguishes this film is that it is a rugby team, a sport that not all Americans are familiar with. Leaving that aside, this movie is a very rewarding piece of black cinema. It reminds me of "We Are Marshall," but with a smaller budget and an independent movie feel. It's a good effort by director Ryan Little to bring us a story about a rebellious teenager played by Sean Farris (Never Back Down), like Rick Penning, who finds himself in a strange place, both on and off the field. Despite a few holes in the plot, this film has a heart, rewarding each of its viewers with good characters with whom we can identify. Also good performances by actors Gary Cole as coach Larry Gelwix and Neal McDonough as coach Penning (father of Ricks). I felt going through many different emotions when watching a movie, in the end I was left with a feeling of faith in humanity and a hope for the future of my children, especially if there are coaches like Gelwix.
