I loved the story of a boy trying to get his girl back ... I was there, I did that, so I can relate ... Anyway, I love working with the camera, how occasionally the camera is "left on" , and they're just sitting there talking about the scene, or other things ... or how the camera follows it to find the cast and what not ... I saw it at IFC last year and I loved it, so I told a some of my friends have seen it, and some saw it, and they also loved it ... take a look if you can, a little feminine, but it's still a good movie ... I gave it a 10/10 for two reasons ... one: I can relate ... but anyone who has ever fallen in love and made a mistake can relate ... two: it's a really creative way of making a movie, it's like you're constantly there, right? in the middle of filming ... as I said, great movie
