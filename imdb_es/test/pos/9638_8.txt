In my personal opinion, "The Patriot" is one of Steven Seagal's best films. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say it's the worst of all, it's not like SS, etc. I do not agree. As a highly spiritual person, a great Seagal teacher established a good tradition in action movies. He always has a good track record, great action, great professionalism and a smart message. This movie has it all. You have good shooting scenes, great aikido. Although there is not much of that, it shows us its peaceful side. This change in his filming only proves his spiritual growth (in the end he does not kill Chisolm's friend). <br /> <br /> "The Patriot" is definitely one of the best movies from Vista's "filmmaker" point that I've seen lately. You have excellent panoramic photographs of Montana, we see the true American nature and the beautiful wildlife (among others, horses and flowers). The soundtrack also deserves a few words. During the film I had the great opportunity to listen to classic American-cowboy-western music (although not from Country). Similar music was heard in "Back to the Future Prt.3". The performance of SS has improved a lot since his last films. His role is not familiar to him (unlike the police and the commandos), but he does a good job interpreting the doctors retired from the government. His performance is convincing and his lines are good. <br /> <br /> I was really satisfied with the cast. LQ Jones shows that life and death walk the Earth together, Whitney Yellow Robe plays a beautiful and intelligent scientist, Camilla Belle makes a great appearance as the daughter of McClaren. <br /> <br /> Mr. Seagal talks about the much debated «Real American» Tradition and militia squads, offering his own point of view (he likes the Constitution, but bearded and chubby men they have nothing to do with that). Positive points are also raised with respect to the Eastern-Western medicine system and nature. <br /> <br /> The best of Seagal. And opening new horizons in his cinematographic career. <br /> <br />
