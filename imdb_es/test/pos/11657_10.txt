The biggest effort and the best cast ever assembled in a film by Director Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn in the front row. Someone said that this movie is good because it is directed and written by Tim Robbins, but I convince you that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon gave me a really excellent performance that I cried with all my heart. His acting is so real! There is no doubt that this movie has a rating of 4 and 3/4 out of 5!
