This was a romantic movie, simple and fun. I really enjoyed it and I would definitely say that to watch it and enjoy it, Will Smith was funny, awkward, nervous, sweet and just a simple guy who was hit by Love. It was nice to see him fall in love with someone and be so nervous and lost in what to do or say. It was great. It was great, fun as always. Eva Mendes was better than I expected, so I thought there were moments in the movie that Will took over, he was doing everything possible to be a good guy and still be treated badly. The ending was romantic and happy and it was great. I have seen it several times, and I would see it again. A funny movie, something that you do not see much anymore. He had the feeling of yesteryear with a fresh new look.
