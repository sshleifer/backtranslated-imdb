I just want to inform you that this movie was really good! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a little movie, but not quite, many moments in this movie were pretty creepy. <br /> <br /> This movie has enough blood, blood and some sexy make-up scenes, of course, to keep any horror fan like me 100% satisfied! The cast was also pretty good from IMO. <br /> <br /> Even though it's not a high-budget movie, the effects definitely got a little spooky at times. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you like a horror movie that you like, that's for sure !! <br /> <br /> - Tom
