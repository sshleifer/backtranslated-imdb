Martin Ritt seems to be a director who was always interested in social issues (as the son of immigrants, he had all the incentives to do so, especially since he was included in the blacklist in the 1950s). "Conrack" is based on Pat Conroy's novel "The Water is Wide", about his own experience in 1969 teaching a school of poor black children about the outside world, much to the displeasure of the right-wing superintendent (Hume Cronyn). What added to the strength of the film was the cultural and historical context: Conroy (Jon Voight) tells another teacher in frustration that many of the children do not know about Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, the Vietnam War or even where There is Vietnam. He proceeds to illustrate them on all these factors. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, I read a complaint that when Conroy played music for children, he only played white music. The truth is that you can not blame the movie for that; It was based on the real experience of Conroy. Either way, the movie is a real gem.
