This is a very nice, fluffy and glamorous musical of the 1940s. 'Cover Girl' turned Rita Hayworth (formerly dark-haired Latin lady Margarita Cansino) into a truly American star. He confirmed the incredible talent of Gene Kelly as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It represents the exuberance and color of the musical genre. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth is great as Rusty Parker, it's her image and her presence is always at the forefront. His singing is bent, but his dance is absolutely brilliant and combines very well with Kelly. I think Rita was highly underestimated as an actress, she magnificently interprets all the scenes here. Gene choreographed the dance sequences (basically, here he was granted almost complete creative freedom), and his dance number of 'Alter Ego' is incredible. Such art. The highlighted melodies are "Making the road for tomorrow", "Putting myself to the test" and, of course, "A long time ago and far away". The plot is quite thin, but it has a moral. It's about the dangers of fast fame and quick money, and how any happiness with just these factors will eventually be doomed. This will cheer you up, lift you up and make you laugh. <br /> <br /> That said, 'Cover Girl' is not the best musical ever produced, it has a series of flaws that must be addressed. It can be said that a bit of Phil Silvers goes a long way. Your character becomes tedious quite quickly. However, I was impressed by his ability to dance and how he could keep up with Gene and Rita. Another important problem is that too many songs are not so good. The 'Cover Girl' number looks fantastic, but I'm not a fan of lyrics or singing. "Poor Tom" is a big disappointment. I think it's one of the worst numbers I've heard in a musical of the 40s and 50s. It stinks. The subplot of the grandmother limits with being ridiculous. But that's just my opinion. Others may like these elements. <br /> <br /> However, apart from its faults, it is a very, very good movie, much better than most of the products produced today. The dance and singing are sublime, the production values ​​are excellent and their mood is contagious. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
