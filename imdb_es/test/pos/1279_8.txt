A messy man, known as Bill, lives in a dingy little apartment, with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall and his typewriter for the company. Only man can not think of anything to write about. Roam the streets following people, just to see where they are going. Maybe this will give you some inspiration to write. Start following a well-dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. While in a cafe, the well-dressed man sits at a table on the opposite side of Bill and asks him why Bill is following him. The well-dressed man says his name is Cobb. Cobb then surprisingly informs Bill that he is a thief, and even begins to take Bill with him to the houses to steal things; although Cobb insists that he does not go to other people's houses to simply steal. He says he likes to let people know that he has been there, and interrupted the things they take for granted. Put the panties of another robbery in a man's pants, for example. <br /> <br /> The movie is also told in flashbacks sometimes. The director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent article Memento. Bill finally decides to cut his hair and wear a suit, on the advice of Cobb. Meet a blonde woman in a club, who used to go out with the owner, a bald man, who is very dangerous, she says. We see a scene in which a bald man uses a hammer, therefore, men on the fingers of a man in the blond lady's apartment. These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us, and they will all fit into place when we reach the surprising conclusion.
