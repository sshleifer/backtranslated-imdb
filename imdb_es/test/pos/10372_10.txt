After The Funeral was absolutely excellent, and by far the best episode of the season. I was disappointed with Cards On The Table, which started very well but I was disappointed considerably in the last half hour, and I did not know what to think of Taken After the Flood, although I do remember that I was confused at the end. After the Funeral, as I said, is one of my favorite episodes of Poirot, with Five Little Pigs, Sad Cypress and The ABC Murders. He was afraid that they would ruin the story, but instead he is very faithful to the book. Now I will say that I do not care about the changes in the books, and I will try not to compare films and adaptations of television with their sources, except when the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation does not do it justice. That's why I disliked some of the Marples like Nemesis and Sleeping Murder, and so far, outside the Poirots, the murder of Roger Ackroyd, Taken At the Flood and Cards on the Table are the only ones that really disappointed. Everything else varies from good to exceptional, even the recent Appointment with Death, despite the many deviations from the book, which I admit is not a favorite, was surprisingly good, thanks to the wonderful production values, the stellar ensemble performances and the outstanding music. . Back to After the Funeral, the production values ​​are fantastic. It has a really cinematic feel, and the stunning photography and the splendid scenery and costumes made it a visual spectacle for the eyes. The music was very moving and even disturbing, and the whole cast gave wonderful performances. David Suchet is as impeccable as ever as Poirot, and Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are so great. But for me, the highlight was Monica Dolan as Mrs. Gilchrist, she's up with Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker as the best supporting actress in an episode of Poirot, so good was her performance. In general, one must see it, one of the best episodes of Poirot by far, and one of the most faithful too. 10/10 Bethany Cox
