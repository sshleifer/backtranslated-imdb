I really enjoyed this movie and I usually do not like animated images. But I thought cats were attractive and the story was lovely. There is a good song called "Everyone wants to be a cat", which is very funny. It has some comical moments and it is an interesting adventure. I think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this movie.
