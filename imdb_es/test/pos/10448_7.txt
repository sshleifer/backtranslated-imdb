Ahhh ... the 80's. 1982 reminds me of the really crazy moment we were facing in the United States. Fresh out of the 70's "Do what feels good," "The Last American Virgin" comes as a wolf in sheep's clothing as another "teen sex comedy" of the glory days. Oh, sure, there's sex, but, I can not think of another movie, it's okay, this and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," which did not really kill the time between scenes of topless teens, there were some pretty good things. the neckline. <br /> <br /> The movie follows three hormonal friends. Gary (wanting to lose his virginity), Rick (red stallion) and David (overweight, but not inexperienced) as they desperately try to make sure that Gary joins the world of humanity. But, something funny happens on the way to the kegger: Gary falls in love with Karen (a pretty brunette who loves bad children), and it seems that she can not continue with any sexual conquest that David and Rick can facilitate. The only problem is that Rick and Karen get hot and heavy and Karen skips a period. It's Gary who is at his side while he's going to have an abortion, and it's Gary who really cares. But who Karen dances with at the end of the movie ... Rick. Subtract the "R" and add a "D" when necessary. <br /> <br /> What separates this film from other 80s we think about is that, by God, they try a real drama here, and not "my parents just throw in the variety of input" . And you know what? I bought it. <br /> <br /> It was not neglected. It was not implausible. And, when Gary sees Rick dancing with Karen at the house party at the end of the movie, I felt sorry for the boy. Our teenager Romeo really believed in unrequited love, and when his heart broke in the end, everything moved me. <br /> <br /> So, apart from all the T & A, there is a really pretty believable and attractive story here. Oscar worthy? Not for a mile, but I do not know if I would put it in the "let's have sex" category. Like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," they were actually trying to make a real movie here, letting the hi-jinx in between where possible.
