This was the best movie that was seen in "Germen's Cine Club" (Buenos Aires). This film is a realistic critique of the society of the past and the next century. It makes a very good impression to all the partners of "Germen's Cine Club". I recommend this movie to all Troma fans and to all people who like good movies, not commercial ones.
