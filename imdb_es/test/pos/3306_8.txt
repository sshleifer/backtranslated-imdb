Great vintage piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, sexy stars, big lines ("Miss Bender, I do not care if you hit it with a native drum!" Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow says to Hope Lange when Lange asks in disbelief how she's expected to read a summarize a large number of manuscripts in a very short time). If you have seen this movie on TV and not in the pay-TV version of the pay TV or AMC (American Movie Classics), you have not really seen it. Hopefully, this guilty pleasure of a movie will soon be available on DVD in a mailbox version and with its original 4-track stereophonic soundtrack. Great sequence of opening titles that really captures the atmosphere of 1959 in New York, while Johnny Mathis sings the theme "The best of everything" in an echo chamber surrounded by a chorus of violins and another chorus of screams in the background. Miscarriages! Madness! Office romance Bitchy cold heart bosses! Frustrated love! Everything is here to enjoy.
