Originally I saw this because I thought it was going to be the sequel to League of EXTRAORDINARY Gentlemen and this movie is something completely different, a comedy! However, I loved it anyway! <br /> <br /> The League of Gentlemen is apparently a British television series with some rather strange characters and some sharp humor. This is a British comedy, so it revolves around being very silly, dressing up in costumes and making fun of Germans and Frenchmen. Homosexual references. In short, it's very, very funny! <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the writers of the television program who decides to cancel some of the characters that come out of their dimension in the dimension of the writer to prevent that from happening. It's a funny turn and there are many great scenes in this stupid adventure. I laughed out loud numerous times and applauded the brazen style of humor. This makes Mr Bean look like the weakling he is. (Rowan is much better in Black Adder series by the way) <br /> <br /> This is not Monty Python, but you can never escape comparison when you speak British. humor, and there are some similarities but not so many to prevent it from being something own and fresh. He leans more towards the young and Guest House Paradiso in his comedic style. <br /> <br /> If you liked this, look at the series The Young Ones and the movie Guest House Paradiso, and of course, I play television. The League of Gentlemen series should also be quite fun.
