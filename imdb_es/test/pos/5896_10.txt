One of the wonderful things about The best years of our lives is that, although it fails quite firmly in the post-World War II era, the issues it talks about are as real today as they were in VE or VJ the day 1945. The problem The way to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet. <br /> <br /> And although we do not often learn from history, we can thank you for the United States of America for once. Learn from what happened to your veterans after the previous world war. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing in The best years of our lives was possibly the most important social piece of the last century. So many veterans took advantage of it, as did veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell, whom you see here. <br /> <br /> The three actors played archetypal veterans, characters from all corners of the world. USA could identify with. They are all in an army transport plane that flies to their hometown, Boone City, Iowa. <br /> <br /> War is a great leveler of class and distinction. March, the bank employee, Andrew Soda and the football star of Russell High School would probably never meet in real life, even in a small city like Boone City. But they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken. <br /> <br /> March is the eldest, a man with two children and the perfect Hollywood wife, Myrna Loy. It is installed in the first and the best. He has some wonderful scenes, got drunk on his return and then with some liquor in him, he tells the bank officials at a banquet in unmistakable terms. <br /> <br /> I also love your scene where another returning veteran, a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own land. Watch March's expressions while listening to the man's tone for money. You can feel it read the soul of man. It's what got his Oscar for the second best actor for this movie. <br /> <br /> Harold Russell was a true veteran who lost both hands during service in the Pacific. He won a special Oscar for his performance. Because of that, it was probably unfair to name him in the category of Cast Actor in which he also won. His performance, especially his scenes with Cathy O'Donnell as his girlfriend who loves him with or without his hands, is beyond anything that can be. described as acting. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three, a bomber in the Army Air Corps. Of the group of them, maybe he should have stayed inside. It also comes from the poorest background of the group and was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. That uniform and those monthly assignation checks are what made Virginia Mayo interested enough to marry him. The problem is that he is considerably less in his eyes as a civilian. <br /> <br /> While Mayo is playing with Steve Cochran, Andrews is very lucky that March's daughter, Teresa Wright, is interested in him. They are the main story of the film, Andrew's adjustment to civilian life and the fact that he married the wrong woman. Not all the veterans' problems were solved with GI Bill. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy receives little recognition for the best years of our lives. I guess it's because her role as a wife was a lot like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented at MGM. Still as March's wife and Wright's mother, she really is the glue that holds that family together. <br /> <br /> The Best Years of Our Life won for Best Film for Sam Goldwyn, Best Director for William Wyler and some Others, plus the two acting Oscars he got. It was a critical and popular success, possibly the best film that Sam Goldwyn produced. It is still a classic endearing and lasting, and will be for centuries. Its duration is almost three hours, but your interest will never be lost. <br /> <br /> The best tribute this film received came from Frank Capra, who had his own movie in that year's Oscar draw in various categories. In his memoirs, he said he was disappointed that he had been mocked at the Oscars that year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created a masterpiece that deserved all the prizes he could get for it. <br /> <br /> By the way, the movie that Capra had hopes for was It's A Wonderful Life. The Beat Years of Our Lives can not receive better praise than that.
