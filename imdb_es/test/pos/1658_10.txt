For starters, I researched a little more about the movie. Firslty, Jules Dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different black crime film. Secondly, this was a very low budget film, created in the Renaissance of the primordial moment of the black cinema. Third, the jewelers where the theft was attempted is a real jeweler. The Rififi producers asked them to film them, surprisingly, (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on the subject, "surprisingly, for some obvious reason, they loved the idea of ​​filming a movie about the crime in their store.). <br /> <br /> They are impeccable characters and plot that fit very well with their environment.To complement my compliments, I tell you this, some might say that this was a typical Hollywood movie, on the contrary, this establish the basis for the regular plot of a movie about Hollywood crime. <br /> <br /> Laslty, I would like to say that I support this new idea of ​​a movie in which not only wins one side, and that side does not It always has to be good For once, I can say that a movie is not predictable Ten stars!
