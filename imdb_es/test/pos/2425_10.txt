This movie requires a lot of patience. Because it focuses on the development of humor and character, the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same stage, in the apartment of Frances Austen (the character of Sandy Dennis). But the film unfolds to a disturbing climax. <br /> <br /> The characters create an atmosphere full of sexual tension and psychological tricks. It is very interesting that Robert Altman directed this, considering the style and structure of his other films. However, the audio style of the Altman brand is evident here and there. I think what really makes this movie work is the brilliant performance of Sandy Dennis. It is definitely one of his darker characters, but he interprets it so perfectly and convincingly that it is scary. Michael Burns does a good job as the young "dumb". Altman's regular player, Michael Murphy, has a small part. The solemn and bad-tempered ensemble fits very well with the content of the story. In short, this film is a powerful study of loneliness, sexual repression and despair. Be patient, soak up the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written script. <br /> <br /> I congratulate Robert Altman. This is one of his many films that deals with unconventional and fascinating themes. This film is disturbing, but it is sincere and will surely provoke a strong emotional response from the viewer. If you want to see an unusual movie, some might say weird, it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find it in video stores. You may have to buy it online.
