I have seen this movie many times and I never tire of doing it. It is a man who comes out of the closet, who does not know what is inside. The character of Kevin Kline is a teacher and when one of his former students announces that the character of Kline is gay, the people of his city begin to speculate if it is him. heterosexual or homosexual The character of Kline begins to wonder if he is also heterosexual or gay. The acting is absolutely fabulous and hilarious for the entire cast. I found the film very funny and comforting. I love this movie, it makes you laugh and it makes you feel good while you watch it. I recommend this movie to everyone, you will have a great time.
