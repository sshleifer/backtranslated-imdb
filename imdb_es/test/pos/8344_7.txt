Apparently, this film is aimed at a young Christian and evangelical public as a teaching tool. For that I give a vote of 7 out of 10 points. It's a decent movie to show a group of young people, but I do not think it's very welcome beyond that. For any other audience, I would rate it much lower. <br /> <br /> The critics who saw "It's a wonderful life" in this were right, although I did not think about it until they mentioned it. I remembered more than one "Chick Tract", those little 3 "by 5" gospel comics. If Jack Chick ever made a movie of one of his treatises, it would probably look a lot like "Second Glance." It has a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence that each of us has on earth, but it is somewhat hampered by Christian stereotypes. All Christians are very nice, somewhat passive and absolutely clean, while all who are not Christians seem to be bad people. <br /> <br /> Muriel the angel plays an important part, and he is the most horny and cheesiest character in the movie. It's the most unpleasant angel I've seen in any movie, and the biggest negative. I do not know if the directors tried to make his personality go away so badly, or if he simply caught my attention in that way. (I admit he reminded me of someone I know). Dan's love for a very mundane girl who is not quite his type drives the plot in this movie. The reason he fell in love with her in the first place is the only question I would have liked to answer. <br /> <br /> But the film shows positive Christian values, and your group of young people will entertain themselves when they see something healthy. with a good lesson.
