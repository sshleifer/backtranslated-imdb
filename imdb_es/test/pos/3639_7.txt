I know Gerrit. Currently lives in the USA UU This film is based on events in the lives of Gerrit and Celeste Wolfaardt. It is a remarkable story. It inspired me to read "Cry, Beloved Country." The movie is well produced. The music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashbacks. You learn the stories of a South African racist (Gerrit) and a South African black (Moses). Their lives cross violently. The ending is not typical of Hollywood: it is unusually realistic and ends with a note that encourages you to think about the characters and the themes. <br /> <br /> Be sure to look through the credits; See images of Gerrit in real life.
