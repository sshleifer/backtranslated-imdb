This movie deserved better. The satirical wit of Mike Judge brought to light something that many in this country are trying to deny ... we are becoming more foolish as a society. <br /> <br /> Could Anna Nicole's coverage be 24 hours a day? More tests? Mike Judge paints a terrifying future, where the dumb survive and thrive. It makes you stop and think, and laugh. Can you look at the world and not ask if we are becoming more foolish? Are we being overtaken by human garbage, as well as our own garbage? (Beware of landslides). <br /> <br /> The movie is very funny. I would tell you more about the plot, but I do not want to spoil it. <br /> <br /> So, why launch this movie with the ZERO promotion? Could it be that the stupid ones are already taking charge?
