This is an amazing film: a romantic thriller with a complicated but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot, brilliantly supported by the use of recurring visual motifs. Everything is beautifully filmed: the women, the apartments; But more surprising is the devastating juxtaposition of images, almost all the scenes have the echo of another. This is a story told in light, in color, in many almost parallel. Every time I see it, it fills me with joy. <br /> <br /> The acting is also great. Romane Bohringer is impressive as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: all about her changes in her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role from his role in La Haine; but no less excellent: astute and friendly at the same time. And Monica Bellucci: ah! Monica Bellucci, well, in a few words, she plays (is she?) The most perfect woman in the world. There is a small scene three quarters of the way where she does nothing but smile; however, at that moment, it says more than hours of Hollywood crap. <br /> <br /> You can not do justice to this movie without mentioning at least the excellent and sequential climax: sad, surprising, ironic and subtle in turn. But if one moment captures the brilliance of this work, it is the scene at the beginning of this fabulous outcome, whose perspective has mockingly presented itself to us throughout history. However, when the time comes, it is handled so delicately, so briefly, so skillfully, that on reflection it leaves you breathless. Only a director of amazing confidence would dare to underestimate this vital point. But trust is justified. The cinema does not come much better than this.
