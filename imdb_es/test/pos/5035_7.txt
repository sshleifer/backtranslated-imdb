I caught this movie on television and saw it again. I said to myself, I have not seen this movie for a long time, why not? And once again this movie moved me. It is so easy, so observable and so human that I do not know why some people dislike it. <br /> <br /> John Travolta shines like Michael (his dance and every movement), an angel that can hardly relate to this word. He smokes, drinks and eats like a savage, but he has a big heart. On his way, Michael helps everyone he meets. Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) singing and finding the right man. Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) in his development as a good and decent man. Michael even helped the dear old Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton): the last scene is beautiful when they dance on the street. <br /> <br /> Travolta had a great help in other actors. Andie MacDowell is so beautiful and nice, William Hurt is great as always, the last Robert Pastorelli shows his talent. Jean Stapleton and Teri Garr are also good, but my favorite supporting actor in this film is Bob Hoskins, the owner of the magazine. <br /> <br /> So here we have a solid movie about people with a warm story too. Attractive cast. Just do not take this movie seriously and I can guarantee you'll have fun.
