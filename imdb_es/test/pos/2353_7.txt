What makes this one better than most "movie movies" is that it does not feel fake. The film The story of the head-hot director and his rise and fall and rise, through the use of recognizable real names and events during the silent and early sound ages. Instead of the generic business of "the sound will take us out of business", they will actually SHOW Jolson and "The Jazz Singer". The performance is quite good, with performances by Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg in particular.
