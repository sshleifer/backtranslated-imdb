IN AGREEMENT. This is how it can be done! Here we have the perfect vampire movie. Gothic, beautiful. With all the ingredients. A realistic vampire. A wonderful story Take note: I'm from Transylvania and I assure you that this film respects the tradition of vampires. It's exactly like the stories I heard in my childhood. For a Transylvanian, it's quite ... credible. You must see, if you are interested in real vampires, as described in medieval chronicles and not how they are made in the latest Hollywood movies (as far as I can guess, the problem with Hollywood is that they mix vampires with incubus, which is very funny Vampires are never handsome or attractive, they can only inspire horror and repulsion, the incubus, called in my country The Night Flier, is the only beautiful demon that kills its victims by loving them. I recommend this to any goth person out there See also the sequels, they are all 4 very good! And of course, do not miss the shadows of DArk! Something similar is Nosferatu in Venice with Klaus Kinski.
