Should we take the opening shot as a strange picture? I guess we have to do it. Anyway, two women are behind a closing umbrella, they walk to the talent agency and we accompany them ... and they will never be seen again. Okay, how not INSIDE the place, on the piano, or even outside with the SOUND of the piano, and then the track inside and above, to the Hitchcock? So I guess Clouzot is already telling us in a not very subliminal way that we are following a segment of postwar society: especially how he uses a song like Citizen Kane = cut into about five pieces to show the lady singing while traveling from the talent The agency reached its first roses and the applause of its debut in Vaudeville. <br /> <br /> After that, we are relentless observers of more or less small and unpleasant details of a defeated country that gets rid of its shattered knees destroyed by war. And nobody handled the disgust a little more than Clouzot. In fact, it's a pity he never tried Sartre's nausea. Almost everything we see after the first few minutes makes us a little dizzy. ... okay, okay, I'm exaggerating too much in that, let's settle for a general idea of ​​much of the movie. Look carefully, in fact, and you'll even see one of the cops picking up his nose. And in how many movies has anyone ever done that. Then, there is a very loud speaker in front of the main police photographer's lesbian photographer, and he notices that he literally does not blink or raise an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> The point of all this is an almost febrile immersion in contiguity, apparently, until you can practically smell every scene, as well as see and feel it. <br /> <br /> As for the other aspects of the film, others here have covered them with much more detail than me. But forget the mystery here: this is the ultimate McGuffin. Clouzot is as interested in the real murderer as those two women who come out of the rain in the first seconds of the film and never see them again. From the beginning to the end, all I wanted was to follow a group of people, not even particularly interesting, and say: look at the contraction of this woman, the hitch of that man from his pants in all his insignificance, years and years before. Tina Turner was singing, we do not need another hero. \ <br /> <br /> Even the forced lightness of the end is made grimly in a dilapidated part of Paris, and a bare-walled apartment rather cold. With only couples they love each other to see them through, as if to say that there should be two or three million like you in the whole city, working the fingers for a day for a bit of love at night. <br /> <br /> From this, it was only a small step towards Wage of Fear and the last in despair. <br /> <br /> They do not even know how to make movies like this in the USA. UU Actually, they did not even know how to do it in France, much less now. The implacable detail of the gesture makes even the neorealists of Italy look like bad psychologists. What I suppose makes Clouzot a kind of Rosselini in speed. <br /> <br /> Very nice nonsense, this movie. The only flaw, I think, and as another viewer pointed out, the female leader is not quite right. Everyone else in the movie is perfectly distributed.
