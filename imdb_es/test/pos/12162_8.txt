The Frozen Limits is a large-screen vehicle for artists known as The Crazy Gang. They were a group of British artists who formed in the early thirties. In general, the six men in the group were Bud Flanagan, Chesney Allen, Jimmy Nervo, Teddy Knox, Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold. Very popular in the variety rooms, the group was also loved by the then Royal Family. The plot here sees them as the group of Wonder Boys who left to seek fortune in Alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper. The only problem is that when they finally reach Red Gulch, they arrive 40 years too late. <br /> <br /> I often shudder when I see the phrase "it's very British" because it implies that those who are not from the British Isles can fight to get it. The reason why it bothers me is because in this age of internet / internet I have brought together a number of non-British movie lovers who are known to have divided themselves into the best of Ealing, Will Hay and the imperious Terry-Thomas. So, is it true that it is unlikely that a non-British public will appreciate something like The Frozen Limits? Well, yes, it's true, so much here is topically British, but it really has to be said that the fan of classic films is well versed in history, and when everything is said and done, the visual joy here is universal. With the anarchic "no", the wild west makes more than an absolute winner. A winner who has every chance of being more appreciated by an American audience now than by a British audience. Not all comedies work, and in truth the "big 6" are surpassed by a movie that steals the Moore Marriott. But here there are parodies and parodies that deserve respect and a gesture of approval of more illustrious acts of comedy. It is unlikely that you will fall off the chair as I did due to an Ovaltine gag, but are you a fan of classic comedy? I am sure that, in the worst case, you will recognize that there are some very talented people at work here. <br /> <br /> Now, then, do the Mounties always receive their man? 8/10
