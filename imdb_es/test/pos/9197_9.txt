This is probably one of those films that many commented but were not discovered ... This is probably a masterpiece of Spanish cinema, like Bu√±uel's masterpiece. "15 days with you" could be the best "now and they" the re-visit of other films of a long time ago: it could be "Midnight Cowboy", but it could also be "Les amants du Pont-Neuf" or a realistic and no-point of view (but more realistic) "trainspotting". This hard story takes place for humor, love and, obviously, the dramatic sense. In the new Spanish social cinema, this little diamond could be the resurrection of the Italian neo-realism mixed with the best films of Ken Loach. <br /> <br /> Probably the best movie I've discovered in the last 10 years.
