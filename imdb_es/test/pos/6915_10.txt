Inferno gives Los Angeles what it deserves: a baptism in fire, death from above. An excellent cast of obsessed characters could survive and sweat the passage of coronal mass ejection, but that would not be fun and certainly not dramatic. A really unconvincing criticism in Variety criticized the characters for caring about their personal redemption instead of forbidding them together to save the world. But what is refreshing about this great heat is that there is nothing anyone can do about it. Therefore, fortunately, we are not subject to the "warming" scenes of the fascist presidents and other great statesmen, as they create implausible conspiracies to save a chosen remnant of humanity (wing Deep Impact). Here, the soaked sweat and the luxurious half dozen dirty of lust resolves its own redemption or confronts its old-fashioned personal oblivion, together as individuals or ... alone with the Solo. Excellent television movie in general. Clearly it is not denatured by the destructive intrusion of the exaggerated executives of the network. I highly recommend it.
