The only Zeppelin recording I've seen before this DVD is the movie "The song is still the same" from 1976. We used to spend hours at the house of some friends watching this, but I never really liked and hated the fantasy sequences. .. <br /> <br /> So, what about this DVD? I did not know it existed until I was looking for the Physical Graffiti CD ... "When did this come out?" I thought <br /> <br /> For some reason, I thought that Page was not a great live guitarist, but to say that watching this DVD has changed my opinion is a huge understatement. <br /> <br /> There is 'White Summer' since 1970 - 10 minutes of magic with the guitar. <br /> <br /> There is an acoustic set since 1975 - 'Bron-y-aur Stomp' has a bright finger- Selection of the improvisation section. <br /> <br /> The performances of 'In my Time of Dying' and 'Trampled Underfoot' (also from '75) are impressive, with Page and Bonham smashing things like no one else has. Demonic possessions of rawk! <br /> <br /> The magic continues in the section of Knebworth 1979. The version of 'Achillies Last Stand', taking into account its diverse states addicted to drugs, is simply a begging! A song of complex guitar dubbing, Page arranged it in a way that would allow him simply "punk", the effect is totally fascinating. 'In the Evening' - I never liked this on the album, but it moves along here. 'Sick Again' - great piece of sleaze-rock. The Knebworth footage is very interesting, with great effect between large screen cuts, faces and pirated images. <br /> <br /> The plant is amazing in all presentations. Page, despite being painfully thin, looks like a six-year-old boy who has more fun in his life at the Knebworth concert, and makes a contagious vision. <br /> <br /> One thing that puzzled me: the 'Black Dog' The performance of 1973 sounds very 'camped' !! Robert Plant always loved a little 'stick' and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous, and today would justify an arrest. All very different from the studio version kick-a $$$ of muscular. <br /> <br /> I love this DVD. It reminded me how good they were and the Zeppelins are.
