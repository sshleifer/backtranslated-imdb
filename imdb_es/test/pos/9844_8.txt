James Cagney, delinquent and broker of the political room, becomes a Deputy Commissioner of Corrections and visits a children's reform school. The problem is that Cagney is not in this because of the graft, he really wants to make a difference in the lives of the children there because it comes from a background like theirs. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is Dudley Digges, who is a grafting chisel and a hypocrite starter sanctifier. One of the subtexts of the plot of the mayor of hell is that these children are mostly immigrants and those who judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here a few generations. Keep in mind that, in the dining room scene, Digges offers a prayer of thanks for the food they are about to receive. Digges is eating well, but children get a quality that would not feed their pet. <br /> <br /> Cagney has his own problems in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take risks. That puts Digges back in charge and preparing the film for its climax. <br /> <br /> The mayor of hell was a typical product of the study of the working class. And because it was a previous code, it sometimes gets pretty scary. A later version of this, Crime School, with Humphrey Bogart and The Dead End Kids, was a new, more sanitized version. <br /> <br /> Although Cagney is well in the lead role, like Madge Evans, the school nurse, the actor The honors go to Dudley Digges. It is hard to believe that the same man could represent the surgeon of a drunken ship, but with kindness, a leg in Mutiny on the Bounty. But Digges is a good player and it's a pleasure to see him in every movie he's in. <br /> <br /> This film is not often shown because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays. A lot of minorities would be offended today. It is still a good movie. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, it's interesting that the movie Sleepers came out and played some of the same themes. I suppose that the films about reform schools do not change at any time.
