I could not disagree more with those who say that this is a terrible movie. My friend and I went to see him during the Stockholm film festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival. The dolls that are used in horror movies are not new, but I have not seen many of the films performed as well as in this movie. The atmosphere, the stage, the actors, the camera work ... everything is just beautiful. And they really work well with each other. Now, if you expect this movie to be another of Grudge or Ring, then you probably will not like it. But if you're looking for a good scare, stylized, then it's perfect. Although it is quite predictable and sometimes ridiculous, I still recommend it to anyone who likes horror movies. Go see it. Now.
