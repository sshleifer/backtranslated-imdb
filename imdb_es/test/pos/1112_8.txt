We see a man move out of the city to "retreat" and change dramatically; His family asks questions, but he goes crazy. <br /> <br /> It's a strange and brilliant film to project here in Israel. Wonderful places, great actors, a film that poses as a "thriller" but that is more a case study of madness in the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The film was well above the other films shown as part of the AICE festival here in Israel. Good luck to the team that came to this movie. It is a Grand Guignol, a small masterpiece of noir. <br /> <br /> My only criticism that prevents a "10" is that sound and music sometimes exceed. It tends to interfere with the images, which speak for themselves.
