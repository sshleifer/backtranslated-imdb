* Flat SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Five medical students, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) and Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) they decide to try an experiment; die for exactly 5 minutes (this is the maximum amount of time someone can do this before being at risk of brain damage). <br /> <br /> Almost everyone does this experiment, Randy is the only exception, but they start having unwanted visitors; David sees a little black girl yelling insults at him, Joe sees all the women he has had sex with (and with whom he recorded on video) asking him why from the television screen, Rachel relives the suicide of his father and Nelson faces a child with murderous intentions. . <br /> <br /> Why are you here? And how will they get rid of them? This tense and interesting film, set in a hallucinated city and a gothic medical school, is an experience, both for the story and for the characters, played by budding stars like Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon . and William Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The director is Joel Schumacher, who had already worked with Sutherland on 'Lost Boys', and this second cooperation is even better than the first one. <br /> <br /> A must for psychological outbursts of suspense and terror and for lovers of metaphor (this story is about forgiveness and the correction of past mistakes), this is one of the minor classics of the the 80s that receive respect even today, such as the mention of Rebecca Gayheart in 'Scream 2' or the episode of Tru Calling that used the premise of the film. <br /> <br /> Flatliners: 9/10.
