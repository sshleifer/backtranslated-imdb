Well, first of all, I'm a big fan of horror movies, but nevertheless, I'm pretty fed up with all those damn horror movies in the United States. It's about the same: blood and violence. It is not even creepy. Well, it's not bad with blood and all that, it does not even bother me, but that's not what makes a movie scary! That's why this movie seems entertaining: it's fun to see a satire that makes fun of the "main horror USA" koncept. American splatters / gore-movies, are not supposed to be creepy, just fun. It's okay. But when they are supposed to be "spooky", it mostly becomes pathetic. However, there are some great American horror films (Poltergeist, Psycho, Birds), but in the end everything is the same. That's why this movie came as a relief. Evil Ed is not just a cult movie, it's a classic! I can not wait until master director Anders Jacobsson makes another damn splash movie! Until I have to see Evil Ed again, and again, and again! But I do not care, it's such an outstanding movie!
