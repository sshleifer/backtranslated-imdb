I really liked this one. I know, it's rampant with what are now clich√© plot lines, and an excess of overacting, but it was really fun. <br /> <br /> In our search for the horror cheese of the 70s and 80s, we found many films that are so bad that they are good. We also have some that are so "good" that they stink, and then, we have some They are so bad that they are just bad. Definitely, this is so bad that it's good. <br /> <br /> Some teenagers who travel find themselves with an 'oasis' in the middle of nowhere, a forgotten part of America, and decide to "check it out". They cross all the lines of the inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay it. They pay dearly. <br /> <br /> Normally I would not give a movie like this to a 9, but the girls in this one are the kind we miss in the 1970s: ditzy, scantily-clad and FIT. These are not the anorexics of today's horrible horror; They look great in short booties. <br /> <br /> I give a 9 out of 10 children.
