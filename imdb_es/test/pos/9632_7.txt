Man, I think people have forgotten how to watch a movie. Everyone thinks they are critical. They comment on things that the average viewer does not even know or think about. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie. It was what I expected, so I was not disappointed. Steven has a bad reputation for putting his views in his films, but that is also a reason to see. What is even more fun is the people who complain about their movies, says that he is the worst and that we should not watch his movies, however, watch his movies anyway. Everyone so they can comment on how bad they are. Who is the mannequin? If you do not like your work, do not look at it. Then you will not have to submit to this supposedly painful event. <br /> <br /> Stop comparing movies with other movies and watch a movie individually and you can start enjoying the movies again.
