The main advantage of this film is the combination of Chris Farley and David Spade. This was the first film in which this comedy duo showed their brand of humor Laurel-and-Hardy-esque. The obvious skill of Farley's physical comedy is perfectly augmented by Spade's sarcastic take on every situation in which they find themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is distinguished from other comedy movies. Tommy Boy is aligned with Blues Brothers as a comic work whose scenes and individual fragments are derived from the plot, instead of serving to break the plot and give the film a disconnected feeling like so many other comic movies. Thanks to the excellent direction of Sagal, each scene is tense and immediately presages or represents the story that is told. He is so worthy of credit for the joy of the movie as Farley and Spade. The performance of Dennehy, Lowe, Ackroyd and many others (see the operator of the gas station 22 miles from Davenport) reinforces the film. <br /> <br /> The film guarantees multiple presentations because the film has many fine nuances. It can be overshadowed by Farley / Spade. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is very well made and it's the funniest movie I've ever seen.
