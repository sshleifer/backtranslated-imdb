Oppenheimer was a GREAT series (it was the first thing I saw Waterston) and it is very bad that there are no copies available. A similar situation exists for "Glory Enough for All," a British series of about the same time, about the discovery of insulin. I would pay a good price for both on DVD. Is it really that difficult to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that can be played in the United States? Another very nice series, again almost at the same time, was "Danger UXB". A series about the deactivation of UneXploded Bombs, hence the name. That you can get from your local library. <br /> <br /> Pete
