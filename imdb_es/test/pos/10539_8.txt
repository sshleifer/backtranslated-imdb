What the hell do people expect in horror movies these days anyway? Does it have to be something spooky like 'SAW' or is it just crap ...? Now, I do not pretend to be an omniscient expert, but I am around 47 years old, I have seen and I have literally thousands of movies and, honestly, I think that this director really gave this film a good and sincere effort. Believe me, I was preparing to shrink as soon as the dialogue began, ASSUMING that it was going to be horrible and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not a mamet script, that's for sure; but FIND IT !!! With all the HORRIBLE trash out there, ESPECIALLY in Horror, I thought this was MUCH closer to the top of the pile than most. <br /> <br /> The director used many ingenious and intelligent camera angles; The soundtrack was excellent and in a bad mood, perfect for the atmosphere necessary for this type of film. The edition and the calendar were very good. And he did not resort to the tired and worn clich√© of excessive "slasher" violence; for example ***** MINOR SPOILER ***** During an absolutely enchanting nude shower scene and totally free (but tasty ..., uh, I mean gladly), I HOPE COMPLETELY that it is cut and cut into cubes ; But, INCREDIBLY, we can only enjoy its heavenly charm and that's it. ***** END LESS SPOILER ***** Also, the tension developed very well, leading to a very ambiguous ending where you are not sure what is what ***** SPOILER ***** Especially in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; We see the doll really talking to her, but in the video recording we do not. In addition, mom sees Pinnochio move and be quite unpleasant; So, BOTH are the mother and her daughter mentally ill ...? There is also the original "murderer" and what the mother had supposed about a possible influence of the evil. But even with all that, we are still not sure WHO is committing the murder ***** END SPOILER ***** So, in general, I think it was a good, strong and sincere effort to create something. Good Style style of the Early Full Moon and with MUCH restriction on violence. And without a typical SLEAZE without any reason (only the beautiful, innocent and beautiful scene of the shower, which I will remember until the end of my days ... :) Compared with absolute MINDLESS nonsense, a definitive, strong 8/10! !!
