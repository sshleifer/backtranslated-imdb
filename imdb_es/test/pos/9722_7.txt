Despite its pedigree, the most interesting things in this series are not the animatronics or the puppets, which, although they are charming, are little more than exhibitions, at least in the story I saw, A STORY SHORT. In fact, although I hate to admit it, the main pleasure of the program lies in the oldest art, the narrative. <br /> <br /> John Hurt, in Rowley Birken QC-mode, grotesque, medieval makeup, tells A story about storytelling, sitting by the fire, accompanied by a cynical dog. One winter day, hungry and poor, sees a beggar expelled from the Royal Kitchen by the unpleasant cook. The Story Teller deceives the latter to give them an excellent soup. Furious, the cook asks the king for permission to boil the villain, but, satisfied with the wit of the narrator, the monarch offers him a pardon: for 100 nights, he must tell a new story to the king: if he does not. , he will deliver it to the cook. <br /> <br /> The story may be old, but it has great enthusiasm. Anthony Minghella's script is excellently dramatic (as befits a playwright), witty, and with some disquieting concerns under the fun, such as fears for oneself or the culturally self-generating power of storytelling, linked to the continuation of ideological power . For a program aimed at children, he is incredibly self-reflective (with little nonsense about the film being the new oral culture); Despite the Americanized style, there is a charming sense of medieval bustle, its grotesqueness and arbitrary terror, as well as its magic and power.
