I really enjoyed this short, even as a Toronto Maple Leafs fan. <br /> <br /> Director Sheldon Cohen and narrator Roch Carrier captured perfectly all the emotions of the child. From the feelings he had towards his hero, Maurice "Rocket" Richard, to the excitement, anticipation and hope of getting a new Montreal Canadiens sweater soon, to the expression of horror on his face when he received his mother's sweater ; A Toronto Maple Leafs sweater was priceless and embarrassed to have to wear this terrible (in their eyes) blue and white sweater from Toronto Maple Leafs; Not the rouge, blue and white of the Montreal Canadiens with Richard's number nine, like his old sweater. And worst of all, his mom made him wear this Maple Leafs sweater outside the house. You could imagine and anticipate the ridicule you would get from your friends when you hit the ice with that sweater before you got there. <br /> <br /> I laughed all the time and this is one of the best animated shorts I've seen. I've seen. <br /> <br />
