I did something a little daring tonight when I saw this movie. I tried to get away from the silent film scores. Of course, when this film was originally distributed, a piano score was probably played with it. Often, the director would choose the score (Charlie Chaplin often composed the scores of his last silent films). But most of the music you listen to on VHS tapes about silent movies is by no means the same music that was supposed to be played when the movie was released. And, again, there were many silent movies that were played without scoring. I do not know the history of the Potemkin score, so I decided to see it in the medium in which this piece of art was produced: the film. <br /> <br /> Shortly after I turned off the music, without help (or should I say unimpeded) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on the screen, I became completely attached to the movie. Visually, it is easily one of the most impressive of all the movies. Eisenstein was a master of composition. The edition, possibly the cinematographic technique for which Eisenstein (montage) is famous, is extraordinary. The mood of this movie is anger, and violently stirred my passions. <br /> <br /> It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent movie, especially a drama, but films like Battleship Potemkin show that this effort is worth it. Come on! You owe it to yourself to watch this movie! Your education is incomplete without it.
