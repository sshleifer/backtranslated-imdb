Here in Germany, "King of Queens" has a great cult status. Almost all teenagers (and adults) see this comedy. It's really amazing!! Better than the other horrible American comedies like "Full House" or "Set by Step" (the only series, which is still fine, is "Al Bundy"). There has not been an American comedy in Europe that was as effective as this really fun show! Kevin James and Leah Remini as Doug & Carrie Haffernan are the craziest couple I know, Jerry Stiller as Arthur is the funniest "grandfather" I know, and Victor Williams and (especially) Patton Oswalt as Deacon and Spence are the most different, but fun kids I know I see it as often as I can, and I still do not have enough, good mood!
