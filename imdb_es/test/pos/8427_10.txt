I finally found a version of Persuasion that I like! Anne does not look like a maid in this version, just a very thin, aged and beautiful woman, as described in the book. Captain Wentworth does not appear to be 50 years old, nor is he perpetually angry, but, as described in the book, he has not aged as much as Anne and is quite handsome. And they play their role with such conviction and realism ... that's what acting is all about. They were credible. They created real characters, and it was as if the characters in the book came alive. If you have not seen this version, I urge you to find it, request it or request it in a library or library if necessary. It's worth the price and the wait. <br /> <br /> I saw the 1995 version, and the 2007 version and this one rises above the other two. Why it does not qualify higher is beyond my comprehension. The book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this film makes the book come alive.
