Two funeral directors in a Welsh town? The English humor unlike other things on the other side of the Atlantic? How could I resist? My wife and I saw him on March 6 at our late Valentine's Day celebration and we both enjoyed a good laugh. We were going to see another movie later, but we decided not to do it because we wanted the experience of THIS movie to stay with us at night. <br /> <br /> The death scene in the last 20 minutes of the movie is worth it. I waited. It raises issues that are seldom talked about in the community, but I know three funeral directors, and humor is right in the money. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended and congratulations to the writers. Without you, all the actors, directors and others do not have a job on any Monday.
