GUTS OF A BEAUTY is a little better than its predecessor GUTS OF A VIRGIN. Although this movie is not really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment, I found BEAUTY a bit stronger and better armed in every way than VIRGIN ... but on the other hand, that's not it means a lot. <br /> <br /> BEAUTY begins as a fairly rude and frank exploits movie. A couple of Yakuza cats are arresting a young girl and start raping her brutally. While this is happening, the boss tells the girl that they did the same with her sister and sold her into slavery in Africa, and that they will do the same with her. Then they shoot her with some drugs and rape her a little more. She somehow escapes and ends up in a clinic where the nurse hears her sob story. The victim ends up going crazy because of the stress of his previous experience and commits suicide. The clinic worker, moved by the story of the young woman, decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower level men and trying to hypnotize him to kill the Yakuza leaders. This whole plan is counterproductive, so now Ms. Vigilante-Clinic-Worker is exposed to almost the same treatment as our original rapee, only worse (something like the massive violation of prerequisites ...). She is also drugged, but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim, which makes her a furious hermaphrodite. DEMON OF BLOOD! (No, sh! T, that's what really happens!) This is when BEAUTY really takes off with some incredibly nice killing scenes, including a very classy chest rape that looks like a cross between ALIEN and a bad one. Pornography, and my favorite - a demon-vagina death wrapped in the head (complete with vagina-slime demon ...) that must be seen to be believed ... <br /> <br /> Definitely something promising things that happen in GUTS OF A BEAUTY, but with a very unconnected feeling. BEAUTY almost feels like two different movies forced together in a non-compatible way. Still, I have to give the film credit: the rape scenes are very hard and misogynistic, and the killing scenes are totally out of place. A solid 7/10 for another crazy "classic" horror.
