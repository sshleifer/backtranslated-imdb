After watching this movie, I realized that Drew Barrymore is a great actress. This movie would not have been visible without Drew. The fact that someone as attractive as Drew could drive me crazy, and he did it when he was "Josie Grossie." Her attempts at "transition" as the great girls called her were very funny, especially when she tried to dance in the nightclub. <br /> <br /> We also had the SNL's favorite, Molly Shannon, who played an important role as Anita, Josie's. best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the movie was Anita trying to teach sex education class. This was one of Molly's funniest and best performances. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski also had a big part and I really felt for her, because I know that people like her were tortured in that way. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must see for Drew Barrymore fans, because Drew makes the movie.
