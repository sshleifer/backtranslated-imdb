A letter to the boys. I tried guys, I really tried! I tried so hard not to see this movie. He left the room when it was on or jumped on the computer when the wife watched her. This is his second favorite movie, the Godfather is the first (which I love). <br /> <br /> I ended up capturing small fragments of this film and, finally, after a year maybe I was sitting watching her with her. I can not believe I'm saying this, but I loved this movie. Dalton plays a great Rhett and has his arrogance. Whalley plays a charming Scarlett. Filled with fire and brimstone and NOTHING is going to stop it. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when she is abroad (Ireland?) And the government is going to tear down a peasant's house because they are behind in the rent. Scarlett gets very angry about this and pays all the debt, so she makes a huge name in this small town. <br /> <br /> All I'm saying is that you might want to try this movie ... especially if you're a fan of Gone with the Wind. It takes a while to get used to the new actors, but I think you'll find them refreshing.
