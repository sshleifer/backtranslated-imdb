I've been looking for this miniseries for a long time. I saw this movie when I lived in Russia many years ago. I'm curious if someone who has the recorded copy of this film can send me the copy. I am willing to cover all expenses and pay additional tapes or DVDs. This is one of the best television series I've seen. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of Israel and in world history after the Second World War. I'm also trying to find a book (I've heard it's even better than the movie) however, the new one costs around $ 50 at Amazon and I've never bought a used copy. My email address is yurets777@hotmail.com Thank you very much for your help.
