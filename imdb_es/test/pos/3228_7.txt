The Gilmore girls are about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 years old. Now the daughter is 16 years old (in season 1) and they live as sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely. <br /> <br /> I like Gilmore Girls, but I'm not sure why. The mother, called Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are very beautiful women, both are funny and charming in their own way. There are some funny supporting characters, like Luke (Scott Patterson). He and Lorelai, like everyone else, can even love each other, but none of them really acts on it. They have their little moments. There are some other secondary characters, most of them very funny, and with their emotional moments won. <br /> <br /> What I like most is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is becoming an adult. The dialogue between them is quick, sharp, funny and, at times, also moving. The band they have is beautiful. The Gilmore Girls make you feel good, so give it a go.
