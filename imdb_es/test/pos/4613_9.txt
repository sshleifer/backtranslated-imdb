Good pity sethrp-1, you completely missed the point. The girl was only seen briefly, specifically, because she was the one who was going to kill herself ... everyone else was so wrapped up in their own stories that they did not notice her, and neither did we. As one of the other students says at the end: we are all so wrapped up in our own problems that we do not notice what is happening for someone else. <br /> <br /> The director himself said that if he had killed one of the others, he would have suggested that his problems were worse than someone else's. The central point of killing Kelly was that we all went unnoticed. Get it now??
