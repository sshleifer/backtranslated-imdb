A heroic young tracker leads a large group of pioneers along THE BIG TRAIL to the west, with Indian attacks, natural disasters and romantic complications that are part of the adventure. <br /> <br /> As overwhelming and magnificent as its history. THE BIG TRAIL by Raoul Walsh is a wonderful movie, as entertaining as it was more than seven decades ago. With very good performance and excellent production values, it lives up to its reputation as the first Western epic of speech fans. <br /> <br /> John Wayne, brought out of the dark for his first major role in a movie, looks incredibly young, but immediately impresses with the natural charm and masculine authority he brings to the role of the hero; silently dominates the movie with the attributes that would one day make it a great star. Marguerite Churchill is becoming a charming southern beauty that slowly heats up with the duke's attentions. The dialectical comic El Brendel is very funny as a Swedish immigrant harassed by the problems of the mule and the mother-in-law; his appearance in a scene signals laughter for the viewer. <br /> <br /> With a look and sound like that of a human brown bear, Tyrone Power Sr., vast and repulsive, is a wonderful villain. Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a sophisticated bad guy. (His famous physical similarity to John Gilbert is very evident here.) The silent actor of movie characters Tully Marshall is impressive as an astute mountain man who helps guide the wagon train. The burly Russ Powell, as a friendly fur hunter, puts his vocal talent into practice to make senseless noises. The geniuses of the sharp-eyed movie will see Ward Bond as one of the Missouri settlers. <br /> <br /> What will surprise many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL was filmed in a widescreen process at the beginning, called Grandeur. More than living up to its name, the image looks wonderful, with Walsh showing a mastery of the new technology. Fill the screen, every part of it, with action. Observe during the scenes of the crowd, how everyone is busy doing a real job, which greatly increases the likelihood of these sequences. Walsh deserves great recognition for being one of the first directors to use widescreen. In addition, the film is happily free of the rear-projection photography that affects so many old movies. It should also be emphasized that it is natural for the soundtrack to sound a bit primitive; The fans were still in their cradle. The fact that Walsh has been able to use a microphone, with most of the scenes filmed at the door, is more praise for him. <br /> <br /> THE BIG TRAIL was not a blockbuster. In 1930, the comedies of William Haines were the ones that made the most money and the public looked for other rates that were not intelligent Westerners. The majority of the cast slipped into the darkness, including Wayne. It was not until 1939, when John Ford rescued him at STAGECOACH, that the legend of John Wayne would begin in earnest. And despite its magnificent and expansive views, it would be another 25 years before the widescreen took over Hollywood, largely in response to the economic threat of television.
