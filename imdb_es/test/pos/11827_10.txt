This is one of the best and funniest comedy series I've seen! All the characters are brilliant. <br /> <br /> Mr. Slatt (David Bamber) is a very irritated man, irritated by everything and by anyone. <br /> <br /> He wants to do things and handle situations as best he can, but he never does it well and only gets it. he himself deeper and deeper in problems. Not supported by his wife Janet, who only tries to get him more and more into the problem he's getting into (and he really does not need help!). <br /> <br /> All the characters are interpreted / brilliantly portrayed Imagine sending your child (ren) to a school like this. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that people do not like it (maybe some do not like the many word games, which often occur per person). episode). <br /> <br /> It's also amazing that there is not yet a DVD release of this one. There are only 2 series! <br /> <br /> So, let go of it, let it go! So fans can and will enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Try it, maybe you like it! <br /> <br /> Just a few names and words from the series: Pumpman, Man Helmet, Hot Bitch, Mount Suzy, Travis Fellatio, Cockfoster, Arshead (and many more).
