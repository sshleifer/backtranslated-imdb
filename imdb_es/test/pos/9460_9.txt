I caught this movie in my eyes when I passed by a poster room at the nearby movie theater. The line of the label was a little confusing and immediately after reading it, I thought about the possibility that it was similar to Dormil of National Lampoon's Daze. I liked that movie, in addition to having a large collection of such genres, I decided to go to the movies just after my exams to relieve tension. <br /> <br /> Deliciously, I left smiling from cheek to cheek. and had a lot of laughs in parts and points of the movie. Amanda Bynes definitely started it better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. Being male and female actor is definitely not that easy, especially having to face the similarities of life, along with the reactions to which the actress has to respond. This movie requires a lot of confusion to get confused with the viewers at the same time. The only way to achieve it is through this movie. <br /> <br /> The director is obviously hilarious and sickly in a serious way, the girls are equally attractive and beautiful, as are the actors. I would recommend this movie to all those who need a weekend of rest and do not worry, they will laugh throughout the film. It is a definitive guarantee.
