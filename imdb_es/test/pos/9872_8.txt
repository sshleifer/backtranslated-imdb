This sequel is brilliant and it is the last film in which Donald Pleasance (Dr.Loomis) worked before his death. I loved the new direction the movie took with the story instead of only Michael Myers wanting to kill his family. I love all this series and, apart from the first and the second movie, this is the best by far.
