The famous and mysterious prisoner Raymar, who is a kind of lethal telekinetic psychic vampire, dies abruptly in strange circumstances. Nice high school student, Julie Wells (a warm and compassionate performance by the lovely Meg Tilly) wants to be desperately accepted by the Sisters clique (played to perfection by Leslie Speights, Robin Evans and the always huddled Elizabeth Daily), Then she agrees to spend a night in a spooky mausoleum where Raymar's body has been buried as part of a rite of initiation. Naturally, Raymar still has his extraordinary powers, so it will be a very long and harrowing night of pure terror for poor Julie. <br /> <br /> Director / co-screenwriter Tom McLoughlin (who later gave us the pleasant "ironic 13 Friday VI: Jason Lives", which says nothing, avoids the graphic gore in favor of creating a disturbing atmosphere and strange, but fails to do this feat in particular because the first hour is too slow, full of words and without incident to be remotely frightening or suspense.However, I still think that this flaw in the movement of fear is strangely attractive and entertaining Big hairstyles and hairstyles, a ridiculous sequence of music montage, poorly programmed false alarms (including the ubiquitous hand on the shoulder gag!), A scene in a gaming room gleaming, children cheerfully smoking marijuana and hilariously lingo silly "brain"!) give this image a charm of a period of 80 in particular charmingly picturesque.The beautiful and polished cinematography of Hal Trussell (especially the steadicam tracking shots that glide smoothly), Bob Summers' hum -n'shiver synth score, spooky and funky, and Tom Burman's splendid macabre makeup, everything is up to the task. The ever-robust Adam West of television's "Batman" fame simply occupies space in a non-secondary part. The mausoleum makes it an impressively vast and disturbing main location. The grand finale with a bunch of dreadful decomposing corpses that come out of their coffins and float around qualifies as a piece of marvelously macabre shock set. Of course, this baby is definitely not a gem unjustly forgotten, but still offers a lot of fun and funny fun.
