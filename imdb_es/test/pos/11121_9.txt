I saw Fame when it first came out. This is the high school class of 1980, which happened to be my graduation year. I watched the movie in the summer between high school and college and, being a performer, it has a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The biggest criticisms of Fame generally have to do with continuity, and there are definitely some story lines that are either not complete or have no meaning. However, those problems are more than offset by the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music. <br /> <br /> I saw him again recently and I was surprised that I still liked him as much as I did. first time. Fame is often compared to Flashdance, which I do not think is fair. Although Flashdance has good music and Jennifer Beals is beautiful, I think Fame is far superior in the development of her characters and in the complexity of her stories. For anyone who really loves the arts, this is a must-see movie.
