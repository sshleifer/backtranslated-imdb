I have not read a single book by Dan Brown yet, but I saw all his film adaptations. I will not fall into the game to qualify this with the previous one because the scope is not really the same: in reality, this is a thriller, a race against time full of puzzles. <br /> <br /> The plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I've never been a big fan of Hanks, but he does well. I noticed his jeans shirt (the one that spilled with blood) because I look for one like this in vain! The Italian search engine is a brilliant newcomer to me, but I really applauded the interpretation of Ewan MacGregor: his inner faith and his calmness are truly impressive. <br /> <br /> I really like the debate between science and religion. The action that took place in the Vatican, felt like a vacation. Finally, I'm not sure it helps to add new converts to Christianity. With all the gold and man's presence on display, anyone would ask what charity means and why women are so excluded from the life of the church while representing half or more of the believers.
