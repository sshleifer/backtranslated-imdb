Talk about your classics! Ernie Fossilus (the Foss hereafter) came up with a creative and cute trailer that completely simulated Star Wars. This gem is so full of tributes and jokes that I laugh all the time! Not only that, when Star Wars did a reissue with new special effects, Hardware Wars did the same! Talk about a parody that simply will not die! There is a reason why George Lucas calls this his favorite parody. He was so impressed that he even hired Foss to work on "The Return of the Jedi" (Do not believe me, check his entry in IMDb!) <br /> <br /> This has to be the first, and in my opinion, the best parody ever made. I think the Special Edition was a bit exaggerated, but in the reflection, I think it's PERFECT for the modern re-launch of Star Wars, and it shows that sometimes, it's a mistake to mess with perfection. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's well worth it. <br /> <br /> You will laugh, you will cry, you will be fired for $ 3! Well, maybe 15 for the DVD, but you'll be really happy to have done it.
