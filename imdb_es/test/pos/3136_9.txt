This small image succeeds where many of a large image fails. Because it was a small picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio's big wigs. He was happier with this movie than with any other because he could do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of actors of gifted characters who had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them, like Ben Johnson, had been discovered by Ford and given the opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic Oklahoma cowboy who usually did his own job. Years later he would win the coveted Academy Award for his brilliant performance in "The Last Picture Show." Ward Bond even beats Ben Johnson in this movie. He is not the wagonmaster, that role is played by Johnson, but because of this film he was later given the role of wagonmaster in the classic television series "Wagon Train". Ironically, one of the bad guys in "Wagon Master," James Arness, would star in the hit television series "Gunsmoke" in a rival network of "Wagon Train." Ward Bond plays the leader of the Mormons heading west, who often retreats to his sinful days, cursing only to be shot down by his Mormon companion Adam Perkins (Russell Simpson). When an upset situation arises, Elder Wiggs (Ward Bond) shouts: "Sounds the horn, sister Ledeyard!" The Mormon sister, played to perfection by Jane Darwell, blows so hard and strong that even the devil must have been shaken by the sound. Darwell and Simpson were famous for playing Ma and Pa Joad in Ford's classic version of John Steinbeck's novel "The Grapes of Wrath." <br /> <br /> Another of the great actors of Ford's company was Hank Worden, who plays one of Uncle Shiloh's children. Clegg is notoriously bad but not too bright. Worden would become famous a few years later for playing Mose in Ford's "The Searchers." Worden was 91 years old. I was still making movies when he died. <br /> <br /> Car teacher Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and his partner Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) are horse traders who never take their jobs. Seriously, have a lot of fun on the road, especially with the local sheriff. They mix with a Mormon wagon heading west. Ford's beloved Monument Valley is the setting for most of the movie. The main reason for the team is the Mormon redhead beauty Prudence Perkins (Kathleen O'Malley) that catches Sandy's attention. Along the way, the train picks up a hoochie coochie show that includes a charlatan doctor (Alan Mowbray) and two dirty angels (Joanne Dru and Ruth Clifford). He also joins the Clegg family, wanted for murder and armed robbery. Ford shows how arduous a trip to the west by car was in those days. <br /> <br /> The songs in the film were written by Stan Jones of the legendary Children of the Pioneers. Jones' writing was almost as good as that of Bob Nolan, who had previously done much of the writing for the group. The most famous song by Jones, not in this movie, is the highly recorded "Ghost Riders In The Sky". The Children of the Pioneers make the background song in "Wagon Master". This adds to the overall impact of wagons moving west. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that acclaimed Native American athlete Jim Thorpe of Oklahoma plays the role of Navajo leader. This was his last appearance in the cinema. He died shortly after "Wagon Master" was released.
