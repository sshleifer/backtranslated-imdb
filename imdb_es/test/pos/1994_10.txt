David Cronenberg, like his colleague David Lynch, is an acquired taste. A director who plays with issues such as reality, perversion, sex, madness and death, is bound to get the most extreme reactions from the public. He showed it with films like The Fly, Naked Lunch, Crash and eXitenZ (capital X, capital Z) and, more recently, Spider. It is better to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Try not to read much about the plot, or it will be ruined for you. What I can say is that Cronenberg takes him on a journey through the world of video games that acts as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behavior. Living fantasies is something that people always dream of, but how far can you go before reality becomes blurred and fantasy becomes a nightmare? These are the topics covered in eXistenZ, an exploration of identity, the human psyche, physical bodies invaded by disease and, more importantly, reality itself. <br /> <br /> The history and direction are excellent. Cronenberg knows very well his craft and gives life to an artificial world, avoiding the usual traps and clich√©s related to stories like this one. The film shows some rather unpleasant things, but it is unusually discreet in the gore department compared to other Cronenberg works. The effects of shock in which he plays are never exaggerated and the progression of the plot is very intelligent and creative. It is not the most intellectual movie in history, but it will leave you thinking about it, wondering and quite confused. <br /> <br /> The performance also has two thumbs up. Both protagonists, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, interpret their roles perfectly and intelligently portray the mood and identity changes of their character. The dialogue may seem a bit stale and clinical at times, but that is part of the effect that Cronenberg was looking for, to create a strange and disaffected atmosphere that makes him quite uncomfortable. Supporting actors such as Ian Holm, Don McKellar and Willem Dafoe, especially spooky, further elevate the film with its disturbing family performances. <br /> <br /> This movie takes a while to get used to, but if you can appreciate the dark tone, the bloody images and the history of existential deformation, you'll love it.
