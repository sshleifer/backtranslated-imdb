I love this little movie, which reminds me a bit of the original Japanese jewel, SHOULD WE DANCE? (It's not the exaggerated remake of Gere / Jlo ...) Fortunately I found it and recorded it when it showed up on a STARZ promotion weekend, because as far as I know, it's not available on DVD. I'll watch almost anything with Yancy Butler (does anyone remember the short TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???) in it, and she shines positively on this. She does a dance routine for a disco song that is very hot HOT !! I loved all the other characters, especially those played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (where has she been all these years?). This is one of those movies that I take out from time to time and I always leave smiling after seeing them. Highly recommended!
