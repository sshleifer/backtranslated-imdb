The evil warlord puts a city through pain and suffering. Not long before, they ask for help from the giant stone samurai Daimaijin. Daimaijin soon comes and really gets the warlord with all his slimy strength. The climax of revenge is really funny when Daimajin crushes the men under his feet and crushes them with his fist and even manages a point through the heart of a man.
