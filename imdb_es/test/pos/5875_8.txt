This movie has entered and gone out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. A triumph in the post-war period was practically forgotten in the 1970s, except for film students. Recently, it has begun to gain recognition as perhaps the most impartial representation of the integration of soldiers in post-war life (and that definitely includes films like "The Deer Hunter"). I like it, but my general opinion is that evaluation is somewhere between those extremes. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Three very different military men who have met after the Second World War (The Big One!) Fly to their Midwest city and try to resume or create civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a comfortable job waiting for him, and the other has nothing but determination. <br /> <br /> There are some good performances but unfortunately unequal. Fredric March won the Oscar for Best Actor for playing an old sergeant who returns to work at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for "It's a Wonderful Life", which also won the Best Film Award, but clearly this movie moved the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has a fantastic scene, a humorous speech that reminded me of a similar incident involving the real hero of World War II, Pappy Boyington, and who is otherwise solid but not spectacular. <br /> <br /> I'm going against the grain here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was just ignored by the Academy. I sensed just a touch of heat from her. In fact, I kept thinking I was going to slap Frederic March for bothering her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Definitely something was missing there, in their forced smiles and their air of tolerance instead of joy. I think all this nonsense about her being the "perfect wife" is correct only if you think a 50-year-old housewife without passion is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but the voters of the Academy apparently did not. She is a big problem with this movie, terribly grumpy. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews, as a former soda exudator who became a war hero, then ends up behind the counter again, is amazing. He is burdened with a wife who evidently married him just before going to war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he takes a risk with March's daughter, Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), and the fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes that inequality again that permeates this movie. Some pure telenovela moments get in the way, marked by the classic line of all times, "I'm going to burst that marriage!" The romance is exhilarating and reflects a common condition after the war, that the returning military will find love when they return. <br /> <br /> Speaking of uplifting, now we go to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality in his performance, or he does not act, which sounds as true today as he certainly did then. Taking a sensible approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in the whole cinema, is when he takes the girl he likes to his room to show him the truth of his condition. "I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the guys." Really a great thing. <br /> <br /> The movie has some moments that shoot up. It also has some moments that belong to the afternoon soaps. Take the good with the bad and see this for the high points.
