It's an amazing movie that puts you in your chair waiting for the last minute of the movie, leaving in your jumps a sweet taste of: ... I want more! There are very good actors, Portuguese actors who have a lot of experience in the world of theater and cinema. It is not a budget film of a million euros, but we can still see the destruction of a car in an excellent perspective that puts it in the film. If you have the chance to get this great movie, do not wait another minute: just watch the movie! I think that Portuguese cinema is increasing the quality. Beware of Spanish producers ... The Portuguese are obtaining high quality standards. I saw the movie and I'm waiting for more ...
