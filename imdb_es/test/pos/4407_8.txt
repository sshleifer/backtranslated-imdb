The first time I saw "The Knowledge" during a Thames Television marathon at one of the independent local stations in Los Angeles was when I was new. I enjoyed it very much along with the danger of UXB. <br /> <br /> That a film I saw more than twenty years ago should remain so well in my memory is a testament to its originality and the quality of the cast's performances. . <br /> <br /> I searched for a DVD copy here in the United States and found none. I finally bet and bought a UK DVD on Ebay and I was delighted to discover that it does not have a region code. So those of us who would like to see this little gem can get a copy.
