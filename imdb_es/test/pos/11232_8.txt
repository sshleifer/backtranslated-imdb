When Northfork debuted at the Cannes Film Festival, many people did not like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. While I agree that it was slow (one of the slowest movies of the year), it was by no means boring. As Roger Ebert said, `there has never been a movie like Northfork '. I generally disagree with Ebert, but for once he tells the truth. Although the state of the sun by John Sayles may have some of the same immediate issues, nothing he has seen or known can compare with the surprising originality of Northfork of the Polish brothers. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a perfect example of how many times it is better to walk a few more minutes to go to an art movie instead of the latest Jack Black movie. The plot is not a hackneyed plot, cookie cutter; It is so surprisingly original. A small town in Montana called Northfork has a dam nearby that is about to be torn down. Therefore, all the people must be evacuated. Some people, however, simply do not want to leave. In a plot, a young orphan (Duel Farnes) is very ill and bedridden; He is being attended by Father Harlan (Nick Nolte). The child imagines himself as a fallen angel, so to speak, who helps him in his moment of illness. <br /> <br /> Although much of the film is direct, part of it could give David Lynch a run for his money. There are strange weather patterns, something strange, of wood, a huge dog, and a symbolism that would make Fellini proud. It's not as confusing as a Lynch movie, but it's still pretty strange. That's what makes Northfork so great: it's so out of the ordinary and, at the same time, so simple and plausible. <br /> <br /> Northfork has a magical feeling: it's almost like you're watching something you're not entirely sure of. What it is but you feel fascinated by it. As I said before, I agreed with Ebert that this movie is different from any other. However, I do not agree when he says that "it is not entertaining". He goes on to say that it is simply 'exciting'. Maybe he just thought he should give him good reviews because everyone else is, but instead of how slow he was, he still thought it was very entertaining, something that many dramas can not do now. <br /> <br /> Northfork It may not be the fastest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can do it, you will be extremely surprised, as it was. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Rated PG-13 for brief sexuality.
