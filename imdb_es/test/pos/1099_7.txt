This was a good movie. I had an interesting story, which ran pretty well in the back of the movie. The story reminded me a little of The City of God. But this is done in a more pleasant way in comparison. He had what he really loved: a tinge of surrealism. A very interesting cinematography (through the wooden camera) I'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but definitely expands the view of South Africa. The actors were good (for beginners, most of them anyway), I especially liked the character of Estelle, which made this movie quite pleasant. However, what is interesting is that it makes you ask about your own life. Are you really doing what you really love? Or accept the norm, the conventionalism that surrounds you. Definitely worth a watch.
