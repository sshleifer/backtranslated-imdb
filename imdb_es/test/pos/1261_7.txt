This film was the introduction for many of us of the works of K Gordon Murray. That's because it was easy to find. It was on all public domain labels in the VHS era, and before that, one night at night. Classic cult, double knee slap slap. Also, HOW do you resist the title? <br /> <br /> For those who arrive late, a brief explanation of their merit: the Florida vehicle dealership K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror movies, dubbed them into English and then made a mint with them in the entrance way. The Mexican ORIGINALS were strange enough to begin with; American borders and the accepted conventions of horror movies were blithely ignored. Great, excellent set design and lighting were placed next to strange or ridiculous special effects. NOTHING in Hollywood was as close as out. Now, mix the social conventions with catholic influence, the Mexican popular tradition and we are no longer in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Add to ESO the English scripts in which they were dubbed. Most were written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted the words to coincide with the movements of the actors' lips ON SCREEN, not with the literal translation. As a result, the soundtracks of the United States tended to go from the most sober to the lowest. There is even a website for fans of Murray that prints the best, more in the upper lines of each film. For the first time, the moviegoers complain about the rhythm, the purple prose, the production values ​​and they are told that it MUST be like that ... while people laugh enjoying things that are normally considered fatal flaws of the movie. Everything must be very confusing if you do not like it. <br /> <br /> This was made in 1957 with the two previous films of the series; THE MOMIA OF AZTEC AND THE COURSE OF THE MOMIA OF AZTEC. All three are now available on the 3 disc AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) and it's about time. It has the K Gordon Murray version on one side, the original Mexican production on the other side. The contrast between the two is fascinating. Many times, the original Spanish is not much more sensible. <br /> <br /> ROBOT / MUMMY begins with a long and pleasant flashback that brings it up to date in the previous episodes, something like ... the continuity was removed from the Window at number two, and it's downhill from there, logically wise. Do not even recover The Angel, or any mention of him in this final episode. Names, places, even family trees change between movies. After a while, you start to SEARCH the continuity changes. <br /> <br /> At this point, the villain of the Doc Krupp series is totally crazy, almost drooling over dementia and STILL wants to steal the Aztec shell. Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another nice edition of AZTEC MUMMY's floor show, and she wanders in the darkness in her nightgown to help find that dueling breastplate. The mummy is not happier with this than the last time he was. <br /> <br /> The robot actually has a production credit. It was made by 'Viana & Co S.A.'. I mention this, because it seems that the seizures occurred to him between shots on a slow afternoon when the real disguise came walking. No. <br /> <br /> This was PLANNED. <br /> <br /> Wait until you see the controller from where it is running. X box, where were you when Krupp NEED YOU ??? The robot is crushed to death at the end, but actually returned in two more Mexican films ... had a fan base ... <br /> <br /> In general, a quirky and funny ending to a series of three movies. Sit and enjoy.
