This is one of the best horror / suspense movies that Hollywood has done in years or even decades. Although in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts, it has everything that a good movie in this genre should have: CHILL, THRILLS, AND If much GORE !! THE CERA HOUSE THAT OFFERS! In some parts it was a bit unlikely, the performance was not so good, but my overall rating for HOUSE OF WAX is eight out of ten ... If you like to be on the edge of your seats, this is I must admit it was the movie suitable for you. It was nice to see the whole city made of wax ... I myself enjoy these museums, but after seeing this movie, I will see them in a new and different way!
