One of the best "boy" movies I've seen in my life is the wind and the lion. Gad, the scenes ... <br /> <br /> Raisouli's bandits swarm on the wall ... A serious British gentleman quietly gets up from tea with Candice Bergen and drops three of them with a Webley revolver her coat. A whisper of the ghost of the Empire ... Let's not forget it! So we do not forget it! <br /> <br /> U.S. The Marines disembarked from the long and long road to _Brooklyn_. They wore Krags, it should have been Lees, but, oh wow. And the Winchester 97 making big holes in the stubborn natives and even in the most obstinate Europeans without faith ... <br /> <br /> Raisouli - Sean Connery, or, Wow! - Wondering 'What kind of weapon does Roosevelt use? "<br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt - Brian Keith, or, Wow! - wondering" What kind of weapon does Raisouli use? "and writing another letter of anger to Winchester about the stock of his Winchester 95. <br /> <br /> Raisouli, armed with a sword ... A Prussian cavalry officer, ACCEPT his pistol and take out his sword .. Honor, that's something that died a long time ago, of a world that no longer exists, but Raisouli would never have flown an airplane full of children to a building ... <br /> <br /> Milious was the best of Milious , and now it is available on DVD.
