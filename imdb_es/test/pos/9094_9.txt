It's worth the admission price for the Rock-off alone !! Any D fan will LOVE this movie (albeit a bit short) and the cameos by John C Reilly, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Meatloaf and Dave Grohl (almost recognizable) prove that the D is strong enough for anyone. Even Dio ... The sasquatch / mushroom scene will become an instant classic (I do not want to say anything else and be accused of putting spoilers here). Fans of the original HBO series will see a couple of winks at the first screen appearances of the D in characters like Lee and the open mic presenter. I wish they had played some of the songs from the first album and the omission of "the government totally sucks" from the POD album is also a shame. Apart from that, this movie is cool. Obey the D!
