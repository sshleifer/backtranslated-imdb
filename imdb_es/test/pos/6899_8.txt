I saw it at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival and I really liked it. It worked for me as a bit weird comedy, because I do not like horror, but I only had a couple of minutes to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was good, the costumes and settings were not far from the quality of the BBC, which is amazing for an independent film. I liked the way the plot twists and even snakes, I was still surprised in good manners. I even got excited about the character of Willy Grimes, who I did not like very much at first. It would have been better if there had been some motivation for the woman to be so interested in going to the island: that looked a lot like a plot device. <br /> <br /> I like Dominic Monaghan, and he did a good job in situations of horror, horror and at the most reflective moments. Good voice in the narrative, too. <br /> <br /> This would be a funny and unusual movie.
