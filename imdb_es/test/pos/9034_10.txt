Hello; I would just like to say how much I enjoyed your review and comments about that excellent movie 'Intruder in the Dust'. I think the points you mentioned were insightful, intelligent and totally valid. It is also a pity that this movie almost never shows on TV these days and that it is not available on DVD region 2, I live in England. Once again, thank you very much for your comment. The actor Juano Hernández participated in another brilliant film, 'Joven con horn', which also starred Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall. That was a very evocative and elegant film with excellent music. I would like someone with influence to be able to publish the full catalogs of films like "johnny belinda", "I remember Mom" ​​and "the year" in DVD region 2, we love these movies in Britain. I do not have retirement age, I'm still quite young, and my family, and I love classic movies! Films like these were made in such a beautiful way and they bring me wonderful memories. anyway...! Thank you very much for your comments!
