When I heard there was going to be an ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corporation] miniseries based on life in the Changi camp [WWII POW] ... with a focus on "comedy elements", I was deeply skeptical and somewhat critical. <Br /> <br /> My father had served in the Second World War. Such was the barbarism of the Japanese, who was able to talk about the horrors in Labuan and its surroundings (where it was stationed), until very recently. Together with my father, they had given me the fortune of meeting many great men (of character and spirit stronger than ever), who had witnessed acts of indescribable barbarity at the hands of the Empire of Japan and who had never fully recovered. . The name 'Changi' is destined to conjure up horrible images for the coming ages ... <br /> <br /> But seeing it, I was very impressed with the cast, the characters and the complex plot of this wonderful series. . Now I consider 'Changi' as the highlight of my week, (note that I have only seen three episodes so far ... I hope the remaining episodes adhere to the standards set by the first three). <br /> <The black humor works incredibly well (however, the jokes of flatulence are a bit exaggerated), and although much of the horror has been suppressed, the series is quite close to the transmission of the implacable spirit of the survivors that could continue later. with their lives despite the inhibitory memories. <br /> <br /> The "flashback" format of this series will be hard for some to follow, <br /> <br /> but I can not think of anything better. A way to do justice to the men who suffered a deep emotional healing in the process of internment ... when they remember painful repressed experiences, sometimes years after the horror. <br /> <br /> One of the darkest chapters of the Second World War. the 20th century, and, (dare I say), in the history of humanity, is being transmitted to a new nation through this series, and I hope it serves to convey the overwhelming adversity that supports the generation of times of war. <br /> <br /> Proceeding to 'Changi', I do not think I can hear the touching melody 'on the way to Gundagai' in the same way again. Tune in...
