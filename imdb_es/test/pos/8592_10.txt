When it comes to political films I usually leave feeling empty. In general, they adopt a moralistic stance and have a clear history of good and bad history as if it were some kind of Batman movie. <br /> <br /> But with Lumumba it's the first film I've seen that showed politics for what it is, and the real problems of trying to govern a country of broken people who have not known any other rule than violence. There was nothing good or bad, there were only interests and conflicts of interest. This is the only political film in my opinion that you can really get away from it by learning something. Especially for anyone who has an interest in politics as a career, this film shows you that you can not decide what you want for a country, but what the country wants from you. <br /> <br /> That's why I do not agree with many things. of critics who say that everyone comes badly, I think they come from too idealistic (the Belgians want the perfect colony, Lumumba wants a perfect unity in the Congo, Tshombe wants wealth and riches, the United States wants the perfect ally against communism, Russia wants the perfect helper for communism). And the Congolese? They go out used and abused, (the best example in the film when Général Janssens tells his black troops that his government lied to him and leaves them all in an uproar) are always being dragged and pushed to support this person or another . <Br /> <br /> This movie shows in the policy that an error can cost you dearly and this film all make mistake after mistake until it intensifies and ends up destroying the country. Their intentions may be good (or at least in the opinion of the characters), but they are the mistakes of all those that lead to the fall of the Congo. I do not think anyone is bad in this movie, I just think they want too much from people who are tired of giving and want to start drinking. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not just the best political movie, it's A great movie in general. Acting is fabulous (Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba was a perfect cast, I really believe it). An impeccable script, editing a perfect rhythm and a production value higher than what I expected for a film from Central Africa. A must see
