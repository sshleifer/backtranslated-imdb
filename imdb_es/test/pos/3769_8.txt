A crazy and carefree comedy in which comedian Mark Blankfield plays Jekyll as a doctor tense and deeply committed to his research. Once he snorted his experimental formula, he became the Hyde that devoured the landscape, causing endless problems for all those around him. <br /> <br /> This surprised me pleasantly. It has a truly crazy, crazy focus; It's full of steam ahead with a scandalously stupid joke but no doubt hilarious after another. Fun lines and visual gags abound; Blankfield plays every role for everything that counts. A climax has Hyde on the verge of bursting; "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hyde" is pretty catchy and even now I can hear it in my head. The climax even gets to fake old b & w horror movies. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is also quite animated, with Bess Armstrong as the promised Mary, Krista Errickson as the brave ivy, and Tim Thomerson as the extravagant Dr. Knute Lanyon. I wish we could have done more with the Thomerson character, since I'm a man fan, but it's always nice to see him in something. <br /> <br /> A variety of familiar faces parade before the House: Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson, Peter Brocco, Liz Sheridan, George Wendt, Michael Ensign, John Dennis Johnston, Art La Fleur, Lin Shaye and George Chakiris in a cameo like himself. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that if you prefer intelligent and intelligent comedy, it is better to avoid it at all costs. But for those who enjoy a quirky, politically incorrect moment, cheerfully and with much enthusiasm, this could be the trick. <br /> <br /> One of the best bits is saved for the end. <br /> <br /> 8/10
