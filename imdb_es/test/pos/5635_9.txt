When we are young, we all choose an ideal occupation for us: artist, actor, writer, space scientist, etc. While most of us grow out of our dreams, American Movie's main character, Mark, is not over yet. Release your (and also in your mid-thirties): to become an acclaimed and wealthy director. Despite the fact that Murphy's Law will not leave Mark alone and that something always seems to go wrong, Mark can persevere during every dissuasive incident with an even greater push to achieve his goals. Your desire to be a director controls your character so much that you see any person or thing in your life as something that you must exploit to reach the goal. While I noticed that other IMDB commentators are criticizing Mark's selfishness, I think it's a kind of almost justified selfishness because for Mark, not becoming a famous director is tantamount to death. He talks incessantly about leaving some kind of brand in the world, and sees the making of films as a way of doing it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any viewer of this film soon realizes the fact that Mark has an almost zero chance of achieving his dream. Are you aware of this? No, not in the least, and none of your family or friends wants to let you know the secret (in fact, even some of them believe in it). However, oddly enough, the disappointing future that the viewer believes will occur for Mark does not impede the ability to find humor in the film. This is a very funny documentary. Most of the laughter comes from when Mark is filming scenes for "Coven." There is a scene in which an actor has to break his head in a closet, and it just does not work. In another scene, Mark's very old uncle, Bill, says a few lines to the camera; Needless to say, after 20 shots of a lot of headcatching and stumbling, Bill finally decides that he has had enough. Much humor comes sadly from Mark himself. His writing of scripts, which he believes is worthy of a Pulitzer, is ridiculously bad: "It's okay, it's okay, there's something to live for, Jesus told me." <br /> <br /> "American Movie" is, contrary to what people might think, a documentary that anyone can enjoy (even though my sister, who saw some scenes, seemed to think it was downright strange) . The fact that Chris Smith can successfully bring to the screen a film that inspires both the sadness of Mark's depressing lifestyle and the hilarity of the scenes with Bill (who unfortunately died before the film was released) says a lot about the. I wonder how the dreamer Mark refers to this documentary. Do you realize that you throw it in a bad light? Or that is configured to show him as a fool in many scenes of the movie? Or do you see it as something that will be shown before your own segment of Biography A & E? It is a subject of intriguing wonder, and I hope that the latter will come true for him someday. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie: 9/10.
