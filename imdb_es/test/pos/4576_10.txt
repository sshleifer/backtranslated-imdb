I recommend idiocracy to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, the film is insightful and it made me laugh so much that I had tears running down my face several times. Until the end, when I took a breath and realized how close we are to Mr. Judge's vision of tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Look out for a cameo from the Mac commercial guy (Justin Long) like Dr. Lexus. I think his performance is worthy of an Oscar, especially considering what the Oscars were delivered in the recent past ... besides, it's nice. <br /> <br /> In summary, Idiocracy is a fatally funny vision of a possible future. where people carry names of product brand names (the president's second name is Mountain Dew), hospital visits cost $ 5 billion, there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with All this, and nobody cares Anything less money. All because only stupid people are reproducing. It sounds familiar to me, in a way. Oh yeah; is what I think when I see professional wrestling ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, watch this movie. It's a good laugh and it will make you think.
