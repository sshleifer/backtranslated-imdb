First of all, I never went into Dr. Who until recently. Honestly, I never had the opportunity to see any of the previous incarnations (intentional pun) since it was never "big" here in the United States as everywhere. <br /> <br /> That said, I must say (obviously) that after finishing the second season, this is one of the best science fiction shows I've seen. <br /> <br /> Now I see many science fiction programs from all over and this The show stands out. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the first season was the best, with Christopher Eccleston in the lead role and I thought it was fantastic. Of course, so was the lovely Billie Piper, who only adds such humanity and warmth to Rose's character that no one could have done it better. Let's not forget Camile Coduri as Jackie and Noel Clarke as Mickey / Ricky who are incredible to watch. Then there's David Tenannt. At first, I thought he looked too ungainly to play the character (his ears!), But after seeing the second season, it fits perfectly. His sharp acting and physical comedy is almost perfect. It's great with quick dialogue and can turn serious without blinking. <br /> <br /> Apart from the great performance of the cast, there is the performance of most of the guest actors that have appeared. Many of them are veteran actors, but some are new to me and they are very good. <br /> <br /> The production and direction of the show is first class. From time to time, there will be some cheesy effects here and there, but that has always been a factor in the original series and, like those episodes, it's insignificant. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about everything about the series: The stories. Writing people is always the key to great entertainment. Russell T. Davies has written many of the episodes along with some other writers and they have done an excellent job. They have managed to bring emotion, ingenuity, intelligence and fun with intelligent concepts and a great dialogue. I also appreciate the fact that they can violate the story lines and the enemies of the older doctors (my friend explains a lot about this while watching the program) and with respect. <br /> <br /> I will not mention anything about the second season and how it ends since the science fiction channel began broadcasting the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil it. It is very fun and exciting. You will never want to take your eyes off or miss a word of dialogue. <br /> <br /> It really is so good. <br /> <br /> PS: Thanks to the producers for the return of Nicholas Briggs! **EXTERMINATE!**
