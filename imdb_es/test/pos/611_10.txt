For me, "Late Chrysanthemums" was interesting not only because it was the first Naruse film that I completely enjoyed, but because it was technically as modern and innovative as its work from the 30s that I've seen. This does not mean an innovative edition in the way that Godard would present it with "Breathless" in 1959, but quite the opposite. <br /> <br /> The editing was as fluid as in the best Hollywood films of the 30s / 40s, but at the same time incredibly appropriate about the way he was telling his story. Unlike them, he never accentuated anything on purpose or tried to make himself "invisible" but, along with the cinematography, he made me feel like I was traveling in a gentle stream, constantly feeling the waves below me, like a gentle stroke of the hand o The almost imperceptible swing of a crib. In this sense, the film was comparable to the work of Ozu and Mizoguchi, but somehow even more subtle. <br /> <br /> What was so modern was the fact that the edition seemed almost a character in itself, similar to the remarkable camera. work in Dreyer's Ordet (1954) or Vredens dag (1943) that reveals a deeper understanding of the film and its characters instead of just showing us. <br /> <br /> I feel Naruse's edition and cinematography are The most interesting aspects of his films, they raise the meaning of the stories beyond the obvious. The wonderful sets and settings should not be forgotten either! The story itself seemed quite conventional. <br /> <br /> The narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way, and I thought that the first half of the film was shaping a delicately witty spectrum of emotions. and interrelations. Unfortunately, the second half of the film and its resolution were quite didactic and formulated compared to the set-up (although, on its own, it would have fit perfectly into any other (less complex) movie). Somehow I felt that it failed a little when trying to dissolve the many layers that I had woven. Maybe I should have kept them intact. This criticism may seem a bit harsh for a viewer of this film, especially because the procedure once again reminds the way in which Ozu treated the plot in his films. Unfortunately, I still do not have the feeling that Naruse could elevate the story and its characters in the conclusions of his films in an equally sublime way. The best efforts I have seen to date, Ukigumo (floating clouds / 1955) and Midaregumo (scattered clouds / 1967), sustained the energy that had accumulated throughout the narrative, while offering moving and resonant endings. <br /> <br /> This is already more than most directors can do, and in my opinion, the basis for a true mastery of the film environment. In this sense, and considering the resonance of the last two films I've seen for him, it may have already become one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have right now is that I'm going to watch more of your movies on the big screen.
