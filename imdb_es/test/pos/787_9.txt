It could be said that Buster Keaton was more pleasant when he made short films of 20 minutes, and they are not more fun than this gem. The Dead Pan comic gets involved in a photographic confusion with a wanted criminal. This leads to his elaborate evasion of several street police and other passengers who recognize his face by the signs of "Wanted". The Goat is a choc-a-bloc with bright site gags, from the opening scene in the queue of bread, to the wonderful pursuit of the elevator at the end. A Keaton movie never feels that its silence is missing, since sound is never something you need with it. His films explain themselves through the wonderful (though incredibly dangerous) things he did to himself. It is not difficult to see how influential he really was: man is as amazing today as he was in 1921.
