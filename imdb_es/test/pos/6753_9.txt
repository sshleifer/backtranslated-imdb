I agree with most of Mr. Rivera's comments, and I just want to make a couple of caveats. This movie, "The Pet", is criminally neglected in its current form. For that matter, so is "Vampyr". "The Mascot" is not a "bonus feature", it is added as a chapter in "Vampyr". Although it is very clear that this is a separate film, manufacturers should have treated it as such. And while I'm at it, "Vampyr" needs something of that same respect and cleanliness as well. I have the feeling that the decision to put the pet there was something like this. <br /> <br /> Dude A: "We just transferred Vampyr to DVD, but we need about 20 minutes, we need to put something there that does not cost a lot of money, can you believe that movie critics want to be paid for? talk about movies? "Dude B:" Do not worry, I have this little animation thing that I've been sitting in my drawer in. Go ahead and put it as an additional chapter. " Friend A: "You are amazing, Friend B." The animation of The Mascot is great, and it is not necessary to repeat what Mr. Rivera has done so well. However, this needs a major cleaning and restoration, especially audio. The plot appears in the dialog. And in my copy there were many whistles, bursts and places where the sound just disappeared (I would have had no idea what the dog was chasing without having read the box). No amount of volume would make the words more understandable, it only evoked the tinniness and made the whistles and bursts louder. <br /> <br /> It is: Starewicz films should be included in a respectful collection, cleaned, tuned, line notes and the full nine yards. In other words, 9 out of 10 for the film must be "Criterionized", not the product that would get only 5.
