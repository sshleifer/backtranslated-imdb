One of the greatest French hits of the year 2002, "l'auberge espagnole" was also very well received abroad, which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons for this success. This film, made by one of the most interesting French filmmakers of recent years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students from all over Europe and all gathered under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described as what you imagine or see in everyday life: disorderly, serious or with a sense of humor. I suppose if the movie worked so well, it is because many students must have recognized themselves in the portraits of the main characters and especially in those of Xavier. <br /> <br /> We follow the film and, therefore, your experience abroad as an Erasmus Student through your eyes. Xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities, his faults. An intelligent take with many ingenious ideas perfectly expresses your lost mind and your anxiety for the world and for being an Erasmus student. On that subject, the best examples can be found in two sequences. The first is when Xavier asks a woman at university for the documents she must send to prepare her DEA. When the same woman informs you about the different necessary procedures, all the documents appear on the screen when you name them! In the following sequence, Xavier's voice-over entrusts the viewer with his vision of the modern world. Now, where to find the second example? Well, the scene in which Xavier has a complete medical examination during which Klapisch films his visions is enough to talk about himself. <br /> <br /> In addition, the director was not really interested in the studies of his main character. He left this point discreet. He preferred to make a great effort in Xavier's private life, of course, in his love affair with Anne Sophie, but also in his relationships with his fellow tenants. It is a true friendship story that Klapisch shows us with his moments of happiness but also with his arguments and his tensions. Through Xavier's adventure and at the end of his stay, he will have started in life, which will make him more mature. The message that the author wanted to convey is not difficult to guess. You think naively that you live in a messy and complicated world. You should not give up, but search intensely to get what you want, even if it is difficult. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, we can also fear that with the theme, Cédric Klapisch would not avoid a trap: The clichés. Let's be frank about it: they are included in the script, but the director does everything possible to not spread them too much in his film. Then, the script contains convenient and predictable moments: at the airport and before boarding we see Xavier shedding a tear after he left his family. But, fortunately, the shortcomings of the script stop here. The quite funny dialogues and the great young actors, perfectly comfortable in their roles, make up the whole. <br /> <br /> Despite its weaknesses, "l'auberge espagnole" must be taken for success in the youth film. people. In addition, all the environment that stands out allows us to think that this film is mainly aimed at a young audience. Ultimately, the end of the film and its great success allow us to suggest that Klapisch succumbed to a fashion that is good for American cinema: the making of sequels. And, in fact, the filmmaker is currently working on a sequel entitled "les poupées russes". Hopefully it's as good as "l'auberge espagnole".
