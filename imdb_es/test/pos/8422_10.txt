This is a very moving movie. This is a story about a special bond between a child and his grandfather. A villager (Arun Nalawade) takes his grandson, Parashuram, to the city to have his eyes treated. But he comes to know that Parashuram (Aswin Chitale) has a rare eye cancer and has to undergo an operation and will lose both eyes. The film has to do with the emotions and turmoil that both go through and how they accept the whole thing. The film avoids any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Although the movie is in Marathi, language is not a barrier at all. This shows that to make a good movie you do not need songs from articles, superstars and regular masala. Excellent performances This is the entry of India for the 2004 Oscars. I hope you get the nomination at least. I would rate 10/10.
