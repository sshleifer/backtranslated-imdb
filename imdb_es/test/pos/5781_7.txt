I have been very fortunate this year to have seen several films in the art museum of my university. Sometimes, well, about half the time, I can not watch the movies there. I have systematically tried to see each of the films that I have missed. Up to now Plagues and pleasures in the sea of ​​Salton and Who killed the electric car? They are the other films that I have had to see in this way. The film covers an intriguing theme and is well theorized (it focuses on this later) but not as successful as Plagues and Pleasures, but far superior to Electric Car. <br /> <br /> The thesis of the film is about the Future of the American concept of suburban life. It questions the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. Then, the film discusses the origin of the suburb and its evolution until the early 2000s. One issue that the film discusses in detail is the alienation that the suburb creates among its inhabitants. Although several people can live together, they do not "know" each other as we define the word. This, to me, represents the strength of the film: its appeal to real human emotions. We can understand the argument of the filmmakers much more easily because they do not have to convince us of the legitimacy of their argument. This is also one of the reasons why Salton Sea is such a wonderful documentary. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Suburbia loses its message in the explanation of the brand of fire in support of its central argument. As the interviewees speak, their arguments become progressively more similar to those of the militant ecologists. We are told that oil production will peak in this decade, but we are not given scientific evidence (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc.) to support this claim. We are given little information on how this date was calculated. Fortunately, this was the only significant flaw I could detect in the plot of the film, however, it is flagrant. Another less important discrepancy I noticed was the liberal (political) bias that could polarize some viewers. However, this bias is revealed through clips from various events and not from the filmmakers themselves. The clips, especially those from the 1950s, seemed a little unnecessary. The movie was not better with his presence, and would have been more concise in his absence. <br /> <br /> As I thought more about this film before writing this review, I thought about why I found its argument more compelling than other documentaries I had recently seen. Finally, I realized that the filmmakers actually offered an analysis of the suburban problem. They propose a decentralized village system in which groups of people coexist. They argue that this practice would reduce the need for fossil fuels and reduce the waste of space. They define the wasted space as the long stretches of parking between shopping areas, for example. The incredible thing about this assumption is that it is actually conceivable. Most documentaries vaguely claim that some problem should end, but they do not offer any method to do so. Thinking more about the film, I decided that this analysis is what saved the film and why I give it a favorable opinion. <br /> <br /> Although it is not perfectly convincing or fluid in its presentation, The End of Suburbia is a valuable investment of its time. It not only addresses the contemporary problem of expansion, but also provides a realistic view of how to amend it. The audience can also enjoy the high production value with several clips from the 1950s spliced ​​with modern arguments. People who live in Atlanta, Georgia or the Triad region of North Carolina will especially enjoy this documentary, as the expansion is the most established there.
