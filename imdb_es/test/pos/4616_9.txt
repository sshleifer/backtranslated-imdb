At 2:37, a high school student commits suicide. It is not shown who has taken their lives or known reasons, time goes back to the beginning of the day. From here we follow six separated students; Marcus, Melody, Luke, Steven, Sarah and Sean. Each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas, all reaching a boiling point, coming to an end in one. <br /> <br /> After losing a friend to suicide and surviving his own suicide attempt, writer / director Murali K. Thalluri has created a revision drama focused on teenage life and the horrible act of suicide . Suicide has been a topic that has remained in the shadows, 2:37 is Thalluri's attempt to bring it to light. If you have been moved by the act of suicide or someone who has done it, 2:37 becomes harder to see. <br /> <br /> With heavy and difficult issues, Thalluri also addresses the crises of teenagers' everyday lives. Thalluri manages and shows sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, intimidation, friendship in an extremely realistic way. The factor in Thalluri's talent is his subtlety. Respect their subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered at some point. Sometimes it approaches the documentary, it has such a painful realism; Interviews with each character spliced ​​through the movie only increase this. <br /> <br /> 2:37 has a distinctive similarity to the Gus Van Sants Elephant movie. While the core of each film is different, both address adolescent life. Like Sant, Thalluri uses long tracking shots, eventually jumping from one side to the other, to show the interaction of each character from different perspectives. One point that defined Elephant was its ethereal environment. With an extra conversation, little character development and long follow-up shots, Sant created a fascinating and fascinating atmosphere for an imminent fear. While this fear resides in 2:37, the emotional connection with the characters reaches a higher level than Sant could not reach. As time passes, the fragility of each character creeps, dragging you along your emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> The real success of this film comes with the inevitable suicide, announced at the beginning. The difficult part of this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort that we have as a public to see how someone's life ends in a terrible way. Although many films have shown suicide, they overlook the act or romanticize it. Thalluri shows the pain and agony involved in this act and that is not the best solution. With unknowns in the leads and their first main roles; Teresa Palmereach, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marni Spillane, Charles Baird and Sam Harris show immense talent and a promising career as an actor. <br /> <br /> Charming and revised, 2:37 is an absolutely must-see movie.
