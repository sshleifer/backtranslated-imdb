Being in the suburbs of New York when the Z-Boys created the story in Dogtown, I was only exposed to a glimpse of what was happening. I had a P-O-S Black Knight skateboard with clay wheels. It has been gone for a long time, and in the pile of ashes of my personal life. But I never forgot it. It's like seeing brothers and friends lost a long time ago, and it hits me right where I live. I can not see this movie enough. Every time I see it, some other aspect goes up to the top, some other point of view is sharply focused. The old images, the incredible still images, the current personalities intermingle with the vivid shadows of the brightly lit past, the sincere and not exaggerated narration, all beautifully edited in such a way that they make a historical documentary of an authentic portion of American History. In the words of Glen Friedman: "It was incredible."
