I used to see this when I was very small, and then I used to watch my videos. Now I watch the DVDs, I love this. Ray Winston is 'The Dude', the rest of the cast is good and even with the Robin Hood change everything works. The great stories, the twists and the way they shot - for the untrained eye (not that mine is trained) can be misinterpreted as if they were strings, but they increase the audience's absorption by the movies. With the green slopes and the contrast of the leafy and sunny forest illuminated with the dark corridors and dungeons of the castles, it's great. Personally the definitive interpretation of the legend of Robin Hood. I can not emphasize how much I think you should see this, if you have the opportunity, YOU MUST LOOK AT IT.
