The blue planet of the BBC is simply amazing. I do not think I'm exaggerating when I say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured in the movie. From familiar creatures on and near the surface of the ocean to some stranger and simply strangers in the dark depths, almost nothing is left outside. With a weight of 8 hours, it is possible that some people may want to see the edited highlights that are presented in the movie "Deep Blue", but I sincerely recommend that you try the series. I do not think it's disappointing and if your children enjoyed the aquatic world that Pixar's Finding Nemo brought them, I'm sure they will also love it. I just wish that all the television was so entertaining.
