Written by the brilliant television writers of Monkees, Gerald Gardner and Dee Caruso, WHAY WAY TO THE FRONT was the last of the "Jerry Lewis" movies until "Hardly Working" almost a decade later. Jerry's comedy is evidently an acquired taste, and it must be admitted that occasionally it can be his worst enemy when he goes as producer / director, but even in the saddest of his films, there are always moments of brilliance. <br /> <br /> WHICH WAY manages to be fun, entertaining and yes, quite fun. It is a little different from any of the typical Lewis movies. The pace is very optimistic and there are many excellent support players, a kind of JERRY DOES HOGANS HEROES. Everything looks like an unsold television pilot and you'll love it I hate it or you hate it, but I hope you laugh.
