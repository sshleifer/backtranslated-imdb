The son of Hercules is seriously injured during a lion hunt that goes wrong. Hercules (a solid and attractive performance of the robust Reg Park) has to venture into a mysterious and dangerous alternative dimension ruled by the evil and vengeful Earth Goddess Gia (a deliciously evil representation of Gia Sandri) and fight against several monsters to save the soul of his son. Meanwhile, the equally unpleasant son of Gia, Antaius (a perfectly odious turn of Giovanni Cianfriglia) poses as Hercules and seizes an entire city as a cruel and ruthless tyrant. The director Maurizo Lucidi tells the fascinating story at a constant pace and maintains a serious tone at all times. This movie starts a little slow, but really begins to cook once Hercules enters the misty and dangerous underground world: the highlights include Hercules fighting a humanoid lizard beast, Hercules climbing a giant knotty tree and Hercules being attacked by a handful of terrifying rot zombies Better yet, the strange world of spirits only reeks of a spooky atmosphere (you have to love that thick and persistent fog!). The strenuous and rough hand in hand and the greatest physical confrontation between Hercules and Antaio are also incredible. Of course, we also get a great climatic volcanic eruption of great destruction. The widescreen cinematography of Allvaro Mancori gives the film an impressively broad sense of scope. Ugo Filippini's robust score has an ingenious sweeping majesty. Okay, then this movie is an obvious economic work that includes a lot of images of "Hercules in the enchanted world" and "Hercules and captive women", but it's still a very lively and entertaining game.
