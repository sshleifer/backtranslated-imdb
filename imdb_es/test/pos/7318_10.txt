This is one of the best Stooges shorts. He was the only one of his shorts nominated for an Oscar. In this short film, the Stooges play with the doctors, who cause some problems as usual. This short has visual jokes, puns and jokes without stopping. The part at the end, where the Stooges are breaking the machine. This is definitely a classic. I highly recommend this short of three stooges.
