This may not be considered a review of any movie, but only a comment about a movie I saw when I was a girl. I remember coming home one afternoon full of amazement at what I had seen. I tried to retell a part of the story to my parents, but they listened without understanding well what was so strange about two children stranded on an island who fall in love, grow together and have a child. As you may have guessed, I refer to The Blue Lagoon (1949), which has left me baffled and confused over the years (almost 50) and now I wonder full of anxiety and disgust of who or what has prevented the film It's available on cassette or DVD or whatever. I've spent a lifetime chasing the chance to get it one day and nobody knows anything about it. What a waste really! I'm sorry if my English is not technical or scientific at all, but my mother tongue is Spanish. I'm doing my best to make myself understood. Thank you, my name is Juan and I am writing from Uruguay in S. America.
