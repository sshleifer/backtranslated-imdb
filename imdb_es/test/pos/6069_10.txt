I chose "The English Patient" for an extra credit history assignment. I thought that this movie would be incredibly boring. Instead, it has become one of my favorites. It depicts life in World War II quite accurately, and the love story is incredible. The love story made the movie so incredible. I felt this interesting feeling, of passion or something like that. It made me want to see the movie again and again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are incredible actors and the way they played their characters is incredible. The wonderful look together and in reality seemed to be in love. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie to see as a leisure activity or for a task.
