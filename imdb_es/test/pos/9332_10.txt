I'm not a big fan of music videos. I think that music videos remove personal feelings about a particular song. Any song. In other words, creative thinking goes out the window. Similarly, personal feelings aside about MJ, toss aside. This was the best music video of all time. Simply wonderful. It was a movie Yes, friends, that's how it was. Sparkly! You had an incredible performance, an impressive choreography and an incredible singing. This was spectacular. Just a plot of a beautiful young woman dating a man, but he was a man or something sinister. Vincent Price did his thing by adding to the song and the video. MJ was MJ, I said enough about that. This song was for video, what the Jaguars are for cars. Top of the line, PERFECT. The best thing about this was that we got the real MJ without the thousand facelifts. Although ironically, there was more than enough makeup and costumes for everyone. People go to YouTube. Take 14 minutes. Get out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is.
