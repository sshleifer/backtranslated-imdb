At first glance, any teen comedy runs the risk of being sophisticated and obvious, and fair enough, most of them are. There are some that have risen above the usual banality of the source material (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and give me the hope that others can join that multitude of teen comedies that are really fun and not just an excuse to appear. Some star tits or being a vehicle for some was never like Tom Green. <br /> <br /> Enter Accepted, directed by John Cusack, friend Steve Pink and directed by sympathetic Justin Long (the smart nerd guy from Galaxy Quest and more recently, in Apple computer ads), about a group of children who are not accepted in the university and decide, as it is revealed in the trailer, to falsify a false one so that their parents do not see them. When they go a little too far with the website and other children end up signing up, the children have some problems to solve. <br /> <br /> Well, the setup is obviously absurd, but most of the comedy lives or dies. In the execution, and here, Accepted does it quite well. Bartleby Gaines de Long (mostly shortened to 'B') is accompanied by enough comically acceptable friends with good intentions to help him share the burden, but probably the best supporting character is 'Dean' Lewis (no doubt named as a tribute Dean of Rodney Dangerfield Martin), also known as Uncle Ben, Lewis Black, who is wisely restricted to short bursts where he can quickly shoot his unique brand of irritable-looking humor. Black is great here, frankly telling children what life really is (its final line full of explosions is hysterical) and it provides the adult face to the fake university for parents. <br /> <br /> But Long has to carry most of the film, and he does it, in spades; Bartleby easily identifies with and brings him to him almost immediately. The character of Columbus Short, Hands, an athlete who loses his scholarship due to an injury and ends up becoming the de facto art teacher at the fake university, took a good turn. Also notable as the hyperintelligent and sarcastic sister of Bartleby is Hannah Marks. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie feels familiar in some places; There is a debt here that is due, of all places, to Revenge of the Nerds. Those who are rejected by everyone else find a home with Bartleby and his companions, and, of course, the villains are conformist types of Master Race who have steroids and run a fraternity (well, it's okay, the fraternities are evil) and They seek to humiliate and bury strangers. For him ?? panting? The crime of being different. But apart from that, Accepted has fun with the material and even asks some decent questions about the expectations of college students and the course of higher education. It's not that it's an enigma, by any means, but Accepted is not just another mindless teen comedy (or Owen Wilson's vehicle). They are 90 fun and intelligent minutes that, while they are not a big departure from their gender, are smart and creative enough to be very nice. <br /> <br /> There is at least one moment of unadulterated brilliance in the film, when Bartleby visits a nearby university in an attempt to collect ideas for his own school's curriculum. When he sees that all the children are stressed at the other school (several refuse to talk to him during class for fear of missing something), he shakes his head, thinking there must be a better way. When he moves to leave, he encounters a stream of children going on the other side, a person moving against a human tide, while in the background, they play the first lines of Eleanor Rigby. Maybe it's an unplanned moment of brilliance, but brilliance anyway.
