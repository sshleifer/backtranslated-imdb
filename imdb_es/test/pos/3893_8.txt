It's not a wonder, but a good movie to watch once or twice. Bill Macy shows that he can do more than just act; His writing was pretty good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the private extortionist eye. <br /> <br /> The greatest strength of the film is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his role as Jerry Lundergaard in Fargo. He has numerous scenes in which he is extremely funny as a viscous, manipulative and deceptive character. It's nice to see him being a weasel, and for a while I was glad things were going well for him. *** of four.
