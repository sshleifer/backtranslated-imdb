This is a fantastic movie. Hana is a very old man with a very young heart. He knows how to live his life fully every day by associating with his friend by making jokes about almost everything, including his own death. While his wife can not cope with his "irresponsible" behavior, he also knows that this is exactly why he loves her husband for almost half a century. I would love to go out with this old man because he knows how to enjoy live and never fear death. He is cheerful, witty, naughty and never bored. Vlastimil Brodský played Hána brilliantly at the age of 79. Every look in his eyes and every movement of his aged muscles offer much about the character to the public. This is a movie that leaves a big smile on my face afterwards, and makes me see my own life a little more closely. Tomorrow I'll go buy a mansion and have some fun. If Hana can, I can too. But I think I'll skip the smoking part.
