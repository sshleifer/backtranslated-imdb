There are many familiar elements of Hitchcock (from previous and later films) and this time they mix with a piece of cheerful entertainment, but almost without suspense. It can be said that Dorothy Parker had a hand in the script, the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of the hero Cummings with the blind man and his encounter with a quite strange group of circus people. The famous climax of the Statue of Liberty seems to be a bit clumsy, judging by current standards, but also in comparison to other late monuments of Hitch (for example, Blackmail, North by Northwest).
