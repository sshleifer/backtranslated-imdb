I'm from Germany, please excuse my writing style. As I saw Chucky 4 for the first time, I was a bit surprised, I knew Chucky as a regular from the 80s, but Bride of Chucky was very different from the previous ones. First there is the work of art by the very good director Ronny Yu, whom we still have in mind of A History of Chinese Ghosts. His visual style is similar to that of Francis Ford Coppola. Also the voices of Chucky and Tiff are very impressive. I also liked the script, especially the scene where Tiff throws the Champaignbottle on the mirror ceiling. <br /> <br /> I give you a 9.0 vote for fun, bloody and progressive entertainment. If you have any comments on my opinion, just send me an email. MFG Schawez
