This is one of those movies when you're watching it, you wonder if it's documentary or fiction. After the movie, Ramin Bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the movie has a script. <br /> <br /> Bahrani's camera is silent, it does not judge, it almost erases the director of the film for its purpose, the background is not. organized to make the beautiful image, however, do not get me wrong; There is a lot of preparation for this movie. Start at the personal level, be part of the environment, be ignored when filming. <br /> <br /> The main character is a "real" actor in every way. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank the entire team for this film, showing us another country within New York. I strongly suggest if you like the stories of others. <br /> <br /> Bora Kizilirmak
