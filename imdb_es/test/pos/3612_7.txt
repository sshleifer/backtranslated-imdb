Here is a well-made war story, well filmed and well acted. The portrait of the Italian and German occupation of the Greek island Kefalonia is well done. John Hurt as the father of Pelagia and the doctor of the island is excellent, Nicolas Cage does a good job as Captain of the title, Penelope Cruz does a beautiful job of beauty and hits her eyelashes on Cage. There is heroism and humor, there is drama and romance, and everything is set in an idyllic island. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, a very similar story, or should I say almost identical, with the same characters that go through The same series of events, is told in a novel with the same title, written by Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of the beautiful Pelagia, daughter of Dr. Iannis, and her life in Kefalonia during World War II. Pelagia's fianc√©e, the local fisherman Mandras, enlists when the Italian army invades the north of Greece from Albania with false pretexts. When the Axis finally prevails, with much help from the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and Captain Corelli plays an important role in maintaining the occupation in a moment of peace. When Mandras joins the partisans, Corelli and his mandolin are separated from the doctor and his beautiful daughter. Of course, this is a novel about love. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, an account of the communist uprising in post-war Greece, a portrait of Mussolini's madness and, most importantly, an ode to the life of the island in Kefalonia. <br /> <br /> Some of these elements come back in the movie, but in general, it is an impossible book to film. I'm glad nobody tried. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth watching the movie 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin'. Just make sure you read the book * after * you watch the movie.
