The whole movie made me think of the first circle of Dante's Hell, where the souls go that deceive themselves believing that they are happy. They never realize that they really are in hell, but nothing is nice, they simply move without any emotion. In that sense, Dante thought they were in the worst part, since they would never actively try to change their situation. No one can die in that place, but try to hurt, certainly. I'm not sure if the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript or not, but the resemblance is absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy the movie when I was watching it, as I was expecting a climax that never came. However, it made me think later and now I really think it's a good movie, it will surely remain.
