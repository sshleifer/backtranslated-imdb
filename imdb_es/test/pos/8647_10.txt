There's a sign on The Lost Highway that says: <br /> <br /> * HIGHER SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> (but you already knew that, right?) <br /> <br /> Like There are many people who apparently did not understand the point of this film, I would like to contribute with my interpretation of why the plot makes a lot of sense. As others have pointed out, a single visualization of this movie is not enough. If you have the MD DVD, you can "cheat" by looking at the "10 main tips to unlock MD" by David Lynch (but only on the second or third display, please.);) <br /> <br /> First of All, Mulholland Drive is downright brilliant. A masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuses to leave your head. It is not often that the comments on the DVDs are very accurate, but "It comes inside your head and stays there" of Vogue really succeeds. <br /> <br /> David Lynch deserves to be praised for creating a film that not only has beautiful beauty. Elegant appearance: cinematographic, has a great performance (especially Naomi Watts), a disquieting soundtrack of Badalamenti and a dream quality, but, in addition to everything, also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before. (After all, when was the last time you saw a movie that you just kept thinking and that everyone felt compelled to speak and write, regardless of whether they liked it or if they hated it?) <br /> <br / > All right, enough of that, it's time to justify those claims. <br /> <br /> Most of the people who have made an effort to try to put together the plot together have come to the conclusion that the first half of the image is an illusion / a sequence of dreams. <br /> <br /> Of course, that is very bad for all those who try to make sense of the film by waiting for "traditional" methods in which the story is presented in a timely manner, in a logical and linear way for the viewer . But for those who expect that, I urge you to review the name of the director and come back again. ;) <br /> <br /> MD is the story of the sad demise of Diane Selwyn, an aspiring actress who is hopelessly in love with another actress, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career, and feels that she could not live up to her own and her parents' expectations. Realizing that Camilla will never be his (C. engages with Adam Kesher, the director), hires a hit man to get rid of her, and then has to deal with the guilt it produces. <br /> <br /> The first movie starts with what may seem like a strange opening for this kind of thriller; that is a contest of dance / jitterbug of the 50, in which we can see the protagonist Betty giving a great performance. We also see an elderly couple (which we will see twice more throughout the film) along with her, and we applaud her. <br /> <br /> No, wait. This is what most people see the first time they see it. Actually, there is another very important fact that occurs before the credits: the camera moves towards an object (although blurred) and the scene quickly vanishes. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream. <br /> <br /> The main characters seen in the first half of the film: <br /> <br /> Betty: Diane Selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the film that constitutes the "sequence of dreams", a positive portrait of a young aspiring and successful actor (quite the opposite of Diane). 'Betty' was chosen as the name, since that is the real name of the waitress in Winkies. Notice that in the dream version, the name of the waitresses is 'Diane'. <br /> <br /> Rita: The fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes that, through Diane's dream and with the help of an imaginary car accident, is turned into an amnesia. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on the love of Diane. Then it is placed in the luxurious home of Betty / Diane's aunt, who has been allowed to stay. <br /> <br /> Coco: In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream part, the woman in charge of the apartment complex where Betty stays. He is mainly an authority figure, as can be seen in both parts of the film. <br /> <br /> Adam: the director. We know from the second half that he is committed to Camilla. Her sole purpose of being in the first half of the movie is to serve as a punching bag for Betty / Diane, since she develops so much hatred towards him. <br /> <br /> Aunt Ruth: Diane's real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she's actually dead. Diane inherited the money her aunt left her and used it to pay for Camilla's murder. <br /> <br /> Mr. Roach: a characteristic Lynchian. Unreal; It appears only in the sequence of Diane's dream. He is a mysterious and influential person who controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair. It has much of the same function as the dwarf who talks back (who also plays) in Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> The hit man: the person who murders Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the film, although it is presented in a slightly more foolish way in the dream sequence (more on that later). <br /> <br /> Now, having established the different versions of the characters. In the movie, we can start to delve into the plot. Of course, I will not go into all the little details (I will not expose it chronologically either), but I will try to explain some of the important scenes, in relation to the "tip sheet" by Lynch. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, Camilla reproduced herself as an amnesia through her unlikely survival from a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie, leaving her completely vulnerable. What I found very interesting with MD is that Lynch constantly gives clues about what is real and what is not. I already mentioned that the camera is moving towards the pillow, but note that there are two cars in each lane that approach the limousine. <br /> <br /> Only one of the cars arrived in the limousine; What about the other Even if they kept themselves away from the accident, would not they try to help others, or at least ask for help? My theory is that, since this is a dream, the presence of the other car is left aside and forgotten. As Rogert Ebert eloquently puts it, "As in real dreams, he does not explain, he does not complete his sequences, he stops at what he finds fascinating, he throws away unpromising plots". <br /> <br /> Shortly after Rita crawls down Betty arrives at the crash site in Mulholland Dr., and descends down the side of the hill and furtively sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment. We see this spooky couple walking away, looking at us with a macabre expression and smiling at themselves and at the camera. This is the first indication that what we are seeing is a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Although the old couple seems to be unknown to Betty, I think they are actually her parents (since she was applauded in the jitterbug contest). Maybe I did not know them very well, and I really did not have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, so the couple is very nice and useful to her in the dream. They also represent her feelings of guilt for the murder, and Diane's sense of dissatisfaction with her unreached goals in her life. <br /> <br /> A fairly long and hilarious scene is what involves the hit man. Diane apparently sees him as the main force behind the campaign that tries to pressure the director to accept the role of Camilla in the movie (of Adam's party in the second half of the film), and therefore, occupies a part important of his dream. Due to his feelings of guilt and remorse for the murder of Camilla, a part of her wants him to be lost, making him a foolish criminal. <br /> <br /> This scene, I think, is also an attempt by Lynch. by totally screwing up your audience, since they are given a false pretense to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I have to love that line "Something bit me wrong". :) <br /> <br /> The next interesting scene is that of the two people in Twinkies, who talk about how one of them still has this recurring nightmare involving a man who sees through a wall. outside the restaurant where they are sitting. After a small talk, they go out and walk to the corner of a fence, accompanied, of course, by excellent music that matches the mood of the scene. <br /> <br /> Upon reaching the corner, a character similar to a bum with a disfigured face appears from behind the corner, scaring the living shit of the man who has the nightmare. This nightmare only exists in Diane's mind; She saw that guy at dinner when he paid for the murder. So, in short, his trades translate into the nightmares of that poor man. The tramp also represents the bad side of Diane, as can be seen later in the film. <br /> <br /> The Cowboy is (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters that are always present in the Lynchian landscape: Diane I only saw him for a short time at Adam's party, but like our own dreams can grant insignificant people who barely know an important part in our dreams, you can also be granted an important part in your dream. They also give us more clues during their scenes that what we are seeing is not real (its sudden disappearance, etc.). <br /> <br /> The Cowboy is also used as a tool to make fun of the Director, when he meets he in the strange place (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). Also note how he says he will appear once again if he (Adam) does it right, or twice more if he does it wrong. Throughout the film appears twice more, which indicates to Diane that it went wrong. He is also the one who awakens her to reality (that scene is probably an illusion made to fit his requirements that he appears twice), and shortly after he commits suicide. <br /> <br /> The espresso scene with The Castigliane Brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, like Luigi) is probably the result of the fact that Diane was taking an espresso just before Camilla and Adam did his announcement at Adam's party in the second half. At the same time, it could also be a statement from Lynch. <br /> <br /> During the scene in which they enter Diane's apartment, the body lying on the bed is Camilla, but notice how she assumes Diane's sleeping position; Diane sees herself in her own dream, but the face is not hers, although she had the same wounds on her face that Diane would have after shooting herself. This scene is also full of a true Lynchian chill. Since Diane did not know where (or when) the hit man would reach Camilla and end her, he simply put her in his own home. <br /> <br /> In real life, Diane's audition for the part of the movie was bad. In his dream, he offers perfect hearing, leaving the entire crew ecstatic with his performance. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting that the money that in real life was used to pay for Camilla's murder now appears in Rita / camila bag. This is part of the way Diane undoes her terrible act when she actually receives the money back, since the murder has not yet taken place. <br /> <br /> When your neighbor arrives to get her ashtray in piano form, another clue is given; She takes the ashtray from her table and leaves, but later, when Camilla and Betty meet on the couch, we see that the ashtray appears again when the camera moves around the table, suggesting that Betty's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy. <br /> <br /> The key phrase of the movie Adam is the audition of actresses for "She's the girl"; which are exactly the same words that Diane uses when she gives Camilla's resume as the hit man. <br /> <br /> The blue box and the key represent the main turning point in the film, and that is where the true identities of the characters are revealed. Here there is a lot of symbolism; the box may represent Diane's future (it's empty), or it may be a kind of Pandora's box (the hit man laughs when he asks what will open the key). Either way, it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key (which is placed next to it after the murder has occurred). The painting is also seen at the end of the film in the hands of the disfigured wanderer. <br /> <br /> Club Silencio is a small addition to remind the viewer even more that what he is seeing is not real. It also means that Diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality is a nightmare from which she can not escape, even in her dreams). <br /> <br /> During the chilling scene at the end, where the spooky old couple reappears, Diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out to escape the screams and avoid being persecuted for her fears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's my $ 0.02. I hope this can help people criticize this movie and call it "the worst movie in history" or something, without realizing the plot. <br /> <br /> As usual, Lynch tries to create irrational fears, and he certainly succeeds with this image as well. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
