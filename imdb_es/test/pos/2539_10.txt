The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva, only eight years after the completion of this film, only adds to the commotion of the powerful message of the BAbenco Dierector. The film is divided into two parts: the first in a reformatory where a group of young people are mistreated and raped by the violent law enforcers and guardians. The second backdrop is the city where they are confined, however, by their own actions and morality, which includes robberies, pimps and killings of different characters that enter their lives. <br /> <br /> The different sex and gender roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people. Particularly interesting is the character of Lalica, a transvestite who is a mother and lover of some of the children. His reaction to the arrival of Sueli, a prostitute, is both touching and tragic. <br /> <br /> There is no happy ending to this story and I recommend watching it with caution as there are some very uncomfortable scenes to watch, especially at the twenty minute opening. But as you look at it, it is important to remember that this is not just a fiction story. The actors are not trained professionals, but selected boys from the streets of Sao Paulo. In fact, they lived this life that is shown so vividly on the screen and, in the case of Da Silva, died at the hands of the police, who are so brutally represented. A documentary? A piece of fiction. Limit with both, but it is certainly a heartbreaking material and it is a movie that really leaves you breathless and thinking long after you have seen it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
