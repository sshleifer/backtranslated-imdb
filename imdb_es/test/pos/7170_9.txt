I thought I wrote a comment on this movie before, but I can not find it here. Anyway, I'm writing it again. I accidentally found this movie from the library collections of my university. It was free to see, so why not? <br /> <br /> I'm really glad I saw it. I love this movie. I've seen some Russian movies before, most of them have serious themes. I'm surprised that this was a good comedy. I laughed a lot while watching him. And this is a movie that I want to buy. this thing is so funny and not only fun, those plots were very original and well thought out, so they do not seem so silly. I'm surprised that this movie has not attracted many viewers. This is a classic that you can watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> those actors were also very authentic, their performance is real, not false. If you have not seen it, get a copy soon! Definitely recommended.
