Barney is about "IMAGINATION" what you do not have if my preschooler never wanted to play to pretend that they do in that program, then he would be worried. What the child of 2 or 3 years really gets from everything is that everything is about colors and singing. For those of you who say that all they do at Barney is eat junk food and recommend Sesame Street better, what about the "cookie monster"? That's all he eats, but I have not seen anyone comment that. I agree that Sesame is a better educational program, but Barney is like a program to have fun. Do not be too serious if you did not like your child watching television and being concerned that they understand things they do not believe, then they should not. First of all, support them in front of the television, because all that is false, everything is false. The actors are false. Why do not you take your fake brains and put them to use and think if you have a problem with a fake TV show for kids, then turn it off and play with them and teach them what they want them to learn, not BIG BIRD or Bert & Ernie or Barney, someone who used to watch all those shows and it turned out well.
