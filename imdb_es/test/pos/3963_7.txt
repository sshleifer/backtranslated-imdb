This movie has something that most other movies of its genre do not have: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, it is the story of a boy named Bartleby (Justin Long) who is rejected by all the universities to which he is nominated. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. Then, Bartleby and some other students facing similar problems start a fake university, to pass themselves off as their college students. Not everything goes according to plan, and the film is about them. But behind this plot that sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, moral and a new perspective on the American educational system. The university that creates "South Harmon Institute of Technology" accepts those who were not accepted anywhere else. The message is that he does not need "money, tradition or fantasy books, he just needs a desire to improve himself". they are a completely unorthodox school, but what the film teaches is that it is still good, and different (whether it is a person or a school) is not necessarily bad, and that everyone, no matter, should be given the opportunity to improve themselves despite whether they are 'strangers' It is a message of nonconformity and also has indications of anti-authority. But not only the messages are great, it's very funny! haha I laughed very hard. Humor can be subtle, but it can also be shameless, and it's a great mix. Beware of fraternities.
