For the guy who came up with the idea of ​​Lifeforce, I have one thing to say: Thank you, sir! Lifeforce combines the big budget sci-fi pomp of Star Trek: The Motion Picture with the cheap horror thrills of Phantasm and completes it all with t-ts-- and some real meat hangers on that ... And the best of everything, is actually a good movie! It surprises me that someone really justifies a conventional movie that is a vehicle for a hot girl to appear nude on the screen for an hour and a half for the producers. God bless all of you who were involved. <br /> <br /> Steve Railsback (Helter Skelter) plays Colonel Carlson, the American commander of an international space mission sent to investigate Halley's Comet. The crew of Carlson finds an alien vessel inside the comet and inside finds three naked people in suspended animation: two types and a hot woman (Mathilda May). Well, to summarize, they are "space vampires" ... "space vampires" naked. They destroy the crew, except Colonel Blueballs, who decided that he had to let the hot girl out of his lucite showcase because the part of his brain that controls his nuts fluids told him it was the right thing to do. The colonel returns it to our big blue ball in an escape pod. Meanwhile, another space shuttle team has discovered that its spacecraft was floating dead in space and has brought the three space coffins of the Martians of the undead to London. And that 's when people start turning into pork rinds and, in general, t - t starts to get out of hand too fast. <br /> <br /> Carlson joins the relentless Col. Caine (Peter Firth) of the British SAS to track down our naked girl, who is having a good time sucking guys from left to right. Carlson discovered that she has a mental link with Vampira that allows them to track her, with the ultimate goal of blowing her ass and destroying her and her friends' large space umbrella that absorbs the energy of the people attacked by the vampires. . Will they succeed on time? MINOR SPOILER: Yes. <br /> <br /> Wow. What can I say, but "Wow"? This damn movie really works. I can not believe they had real British actors like Aubrey Morris (A Clockwork Orange) and Patrick Stewart (Sexiest Man Alive or a similar title) to appear in this film. All the actors are good. The direction is good and it really shines during the last half, where we see the fantastic devastation of London. The special effects are not left behind either. By 1985, this movie must have been the s - t in terms of fx. All the effects are quite impressive and there is a wide range of talents on display here in animotronics, make-up effects, light shows and very nice space scenes with some old models and matte paint, very well done. There are even some bloody and bloody shots for all horror fans. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a great movie for anyone who feels nostalgic for when the popular movies in the bigsceen were made with 100% love from the beginning to the end. The creators of the film really made sure that all the bases were covered and the end result is a phenomenally fun affair that does not let you go because the procedures are too attractive. A true solid entertainment here: 8 1/2 out of 10.
