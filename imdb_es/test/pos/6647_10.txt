I do not remember a film that shows so cleverly the emotional destruction of war, as reflected in a single marriage relationship. The focus of the film is the union between Ullman and Von Sydow, both are in each scene. Throughout the film, they experience a reversal of roles: one has the strength of survival and the other is reduced to emotional escapism through dreams. Both will lose a measure of humanity, but one more than the other. The characters and the spectator go through periods of fluctuation in regard to the proximity: the camera moves away and disappears, the sound disappears, the words are lost, only for the camera to return to the first pictorial planes of its stars with expression facial. The confusion and fluctuation can make this film difficult for some viewers, but all this is intentional under the master hand of Bergman. I think the use of a "fake" war makes the film timeless, as relevant today as ever, and by focusing on the human relationship through war, makes the film relevant to everyone. The couple could be anyone. The film is not based on place or time, but on emotion. A unique and effective war movie, unlike any other. Bergman's films are virtuous in the presentation of human relationships, which would contribute to a war movie is masterful.
