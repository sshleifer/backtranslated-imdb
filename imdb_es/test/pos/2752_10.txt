I saw Riverdance - The New Show and I loved it from the start! It is an energetic tribute to the Irish dance full of brilliant dances, music and choreography! The drivers, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne, captivated me with their exquisite dance! May they always continue to shine and continue dancing. Their chemistry on stage was incredible, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look as if they were made to dance together! This show is my absolute favorite, and probably always will be. Long live Riverdance!
