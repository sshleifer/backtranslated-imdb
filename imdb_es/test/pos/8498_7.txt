If someone had pushed me about 15 minutes with 'Ray' and asked me what I thought of Jamie Foxx in the lead role, it would be time to go blank. After all, what is this person talking about (fictitious)? That was not Jamie Foxx on the big screen. That was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances of anyone in recent years. Like the soundtrack, Jamie as Ray is totally brilliant. <br /> <br /> The blind Genius of Soul (who took a revolutionary step in mixing the gospel with the R & B) died during production. The film about his problematic life is good, not excellent. The direction of Taylor Hackford and the script of James L. White follow the widely used biopic scheme. The super talented young man fights against adversity, achieves greatness while self-destructing, then gets up from the gutter for a happy ending. The film shows Charles's shortcomings (heroin abuse, chronic womanizer, persistent bastard fatherhood), even as he sucks you with his beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Kerry Washington and Regina King play the leading women in Ray's life. one, his wife suffered and the other, his lifelong lover. Both actresses match Foxx Stride for stride. However, what brings him to a different level is his deep understanding and the strange personification of the great musician. The entire cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren as his stubborn mother and Curtis Armstrong as music executive. It is likely that Hackford stars will be rewarded with trophies and, better yet, more star roles. <br /> <br /> I was not a fan of Ray Charles before 'Ray'. Apparently, the movie has been left a lot (like all biopics), but this image works both to please the old-fashioned public and as a dark investigation of a bright / troubled man. For those who complain that Foxx does not really sing (as if that somehow diminishes his performance), take a walk. No mere actor can sing like Mr. Charles anyway. You can not have everything. What the talented star does in this image is as close to "everything" as we will probably see for a while.
