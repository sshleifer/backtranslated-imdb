This is one of the very few films that are so overwhelming that you are unlikely to see them more than once or twice in your life (other examples are the documentary Shoah and Come and See by Claude Lanzmann, from the husband of director Elem Klimov , which covers almost the same unbearable territory but in a very different way). <br /> <br /> I suppose this is true given the difficulty of seeing a trace. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it's extraordinarily obvious. The Christian symbolism and the admission that there were active Russian collaborators ensured that it was almost never seen in the USSR, and, of course, Soviet Russia has very little interest in the films of that time. <br /> <br /> The only time I saw it in London at a festival of Russian films that was shown during the Glasnost era (that is, probably in 1988); however, it has apparently been seen several times in the UK more recently, so at least one subtitled copy must exist here. <Br /> <br /> As far as I know, it has never been released on t The video is shown in the west or on a DVD, so if you have not seen it, your best chance is probably to join a society of film and annoy them to find an impression and project it.
