First of all, what are some of you thinking? This is the best movie I've seen in years! <br /> <br /> Secondly, I do not see it as a British film, since it is set in Dublin and has mainly Irish actors: Moran, Gambon, Aisling O Sullivan (Rita), Deirdre O'Kane, etc. <br /> <br /> Third, I thought Moran was excellent. It was very funny and fun. Micheal Caine seemed to be alone to get the context of Moran. Each character who assumed perfected it. <br /> <br /> Abigail Iversen I thought it was better than any other children's actor I've seen. It was credible as the intelligent girl and also as a girl and an adult (yes, I know it sounds strange, but well ...). Even she managed to eclipse Caine. <br /> <br /> Iversen and Moran worked very well together and were very funny in the preparation scene. <br /> <br /> Barreler (Gambon) was very funny in his ineptitude.
