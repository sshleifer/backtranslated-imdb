I saw this movie a long time ago, but I've always loved it. The story is about a girl, Sally O'Moyne, who discovers at an early age that when she prays to Santa Ana, her prayers are answered, therefore, the bottle of food is missing and a bad neighbor caresses her and she prays. Someone give him a black eye to touch her. Well, a minute later something hits him and he has a black eye. Sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for good. She is well known and loved throughout the neighborhood as she has notebooks / diaries filled with all the requests of her friends to St. Anne. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a local boy returns home from college (I think) and Sally is amazed at how much he has grown. Sally is in love with him, but she is so shy. Should she use her power of prayer to St. Anne for her own selfish desire or just watch as the most popular girls in the school try to catch the man of her dreams? This is a fun-filled movie with a grandfather who is so charming and Irish, a brother who is hilariously annoying and an Irish sworn neighbor-enemy who fights big pop every day. He has his own story of wanting to buy the property of O'Moynes, which is a small house in the middle of two large apartment complexes (his), in other words, the house of O'Moynes is a pain in the eyes for his charmers buildings . <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth watching, it's good enough and weird enough to add it to your movie collection. Hope you enjoy!
