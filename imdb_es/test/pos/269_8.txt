"Prime Suspect 4" continues the feats of the inscrutable and tenacious seeker of truth and justice, Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; The first of the three miniseries (PS4, PS5 and PS6) with the notable absence of the founding writer Lynda La Plante in the credits. Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second series confronts Tennison against the forces of evil while facing middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a series of personal and professional problems, and resolutions that sometimes They are less than ideal. PS4 evokes two stories, while PS5 and PS6 are unique episodes that find Tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally harmed as they wage war against institutions that are willing to sacrifice the interests of their victims for the interests of the greater good. In other words, to prevail, Tennison must defeat both evil and good forces, something that makes the ever-gray scenarios of the PS series even more gray and Tennison's wars both a matter of principle and of quest for murderers Very good things that only improve from one series to another.
