Peter O'Toole is a pleasure to see in the papers where the lines he speaks are good and offer him the opportunity to boast of drunken stupor. The charming Susannah York provides a good picture of the dramatic presence of O'Toole. <br /> <br /> The film alludes to incest, without a single explicit scene, but it is capable of entertaining the spectator in his scandalous social commentary. Although it is not an important film, it will be remembered for its entertaining performances. <br /> <br /> Even York, when signing the papers at the end, it's a pleasure to see, exudes tragedy in silence. The possible weakness here is the relaxed direction of Thompson. But the movie floats for the actors and the script. <br /> <br /> I watched the film twice in a period of 20 years, both times with the name "Brotherly Love". "Country dance" is a pretty ridiculous and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it premiered as such.
