Gary Busey is excellent in this musical biography. Great singing and excellent soundtrack. The Buddy Holly Story is a much better movie than La Bamba. From reading other comments, there may be some historical inaccuracies. In any case, it's a fun movie that touches the toes and is a good introduction to the music of Buddy Holly.
