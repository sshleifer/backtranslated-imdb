The "seasoning for rabbits" of Chuck Jones, the second of the much-loved hunting trilogy, is often considered the best of the three. While I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons, I must admit that "Rabbit Seasoning" is the most refined script. Here, the emphasis is on the language while Bugs and Daffy review a series of complex dialogues in the great tradition of the routine "Who is in the next" of Abbot and Costello. As a long-term Daffy fan, I've always loved the hunting trilogy because it's Daffy who always gets the best lines (the famous "Predicted Problem" is one of the classics of all time) and does most of the work. The errors play the role of a great manipulator, while Elmer, as always, is the dazed trickster. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose such a small threat to Bugs that, basically, he's just simply throwing himself back and with some easy laughs. Elmer falls in every trap that is set for him, but it is poor Daffy who gets worse, he is shot in the face again and again, his beak ends up in increasingly ridiculous positions. Everything is based on the inevitable climate declaration "You are despicable". As intricate as an example of the impeccable Chuck Jones moment you will find, Rabbit Seasoning is a true classic.
