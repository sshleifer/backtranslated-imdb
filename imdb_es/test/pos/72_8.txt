Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth seeing and this is not bad! In fact it is quite entertaining. Actually, it's a fascinating study on how to try to manipulate the personality of a star. <br /> <br /> To break the "mold of the two Goody shoes" by Julie, she plays an actress from the German / English Spy Concert Hall. Subsequently, the upper part of the movie S.O.B was removed. and plays a drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not so good girls usually under the direction of her husband Blake Edward. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly problematic It is difficult to feel its character because it is a German spy. We want to love Julie, but she is on the wrong side of the law. Probably this is the reason why this movie failed. Julie as a German spy? Our Mary Poppins? Is our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German spy? <br /> <br /> The romance seems to happen overnight and comes from nowhere. But it does not matter, it's a musical and it has Jullie. Oh, and did I mention that Hunky Rock Hudson is also in this? <br /> <br /> Julie gives a wonderful and brilliant performance that any musical comedy fan should not miss. Great songs of WW 1 and beautiful melodies by Mancini. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie has plot holes and, sometimes, it does not seem logical. For example, why do the Germans chase Julie and her uncle when she spied on them a minute ago? <br /> <br /> But on another note, who cares? The musical numbers are fun and exciting. The costumes and the extraordinarily luxurious landscape. The cinematography is quite in the mark. <br /> <br /> He has the annoying idiot detectives that Blake Edwards puts in all his movies. (Yawn) <br /> <br /> But Julie is trying desperately to change her image. (You can imagine dinner with Blake and Julie - Julie: "Blake we need to change my image". <br /> <br /> Blake: "I'll turn you into a German spy, then we'll take off your clothes in another" Movie and then a transvestite in another movie, they will not recognize you, it will be the death of Maria Von Trapp. "<br /> <br /> Fascinating study on how to change an image Julie marvelous, a must for fans of musical comedy. Entertaining Star!
