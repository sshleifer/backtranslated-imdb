Michael Radford has done an excellent job of bringing this difficult work to the screen. He has played with a reputation for anti-Semitism, and he showed us that Shakespeare knew the humanity of the Jews quite well. Radford said after the screening, and I agree, that Shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to get rid of a compulsive and compulsive need for revenge. He also points out, rightly, that a man who was anti-Semitic could not have written Shylock's speech of "If they puncture me, will not I bleed?" Radford is of Jewish descent and has selected the good and the bad of all the characters with delicacy and honesty. no character is free of defects; no character is bad Radford placed the work in the sixteenth century, which gives an exuberant background of Venetian politics and the decline on which to project the words of Shakespeare. I recommend you take it, since he gives details about life in the sixteenth century Venice that illuminates many of the choices he made and gives a considerable additional depth to the view. I hope the DVD comes out with an extensive comment. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons makes a magnificent portrait of Antonio, a man who resigns himself to bear the burden of his past bad deeds. Lynn Collins, an unknown stranger, gives us an absolutely impeccable, surprising and detailed work like Portia. Mrs. Collins is not only beautiful, but she also gives Portia layers of intelligence and humor before the test scene that I have rarely seen in any production of this work. the rest of the cast also does an excellent job, with a remarkable performance by Kris Marshall as Gratiano, and a beautifully subtle work by Allan Corduner as Tubal, playing the role of Shylock. Finally, while Al Pacino draws his usual strong (and strong) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and does not say words, but you can see all the emotions and follies that flow in and out of him when he perceives. Your fortunes change. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage movies, I can not recommend this movie enough.
