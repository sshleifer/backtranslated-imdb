I remembered seeing this program when I was a child in Australia in the 60's, and I enjoyed it on DVD again as a father of 50-year-old small children. Although the bad guys are mostly shallow characters and there is a component of violence, I am very happy that my 6 and 8 year olds see this because the central characters are deep, kind and honorable, Japanese culture shines, Violence does not It is bloody, no one glorifies in it, and the program is beautiful to see. It does not promote nightmares, but shows much of the culture that must have mainly influenced the design of the Jedi Knights in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVDs leaves much to be desired. Video perfectionists are not going to like this one. It is reminiscent of something that is held in a 16 mm film and projected on the wall in some basement ... what could well be. The soundtrack also lacks the quality we expect from the home theater. However, my children only realized that it was not in color, and I suspect they only noticed it because we had been talking recently about how old things are usually like that. The beauty of Mt Fuji is evident even in B & W. Something about the configuration of the seventeenth century makes quality part of the atmosphere, as if looking at the past through a window of time. <br /> <br /> In general, this program is better than most things on the air, and much more. Better advertisement for Japanese television than for Pok√©mon, but you can consider it of marginal value if you did not have the experience of seeing it in the 60s. My score of 8/10 takes into account your age.
