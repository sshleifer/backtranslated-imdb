It looks a lot like movies like PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS that it's impossible to think that Tarantino's films were not a source of inspiration for this THURSDAY. However, for a low-cost B-series movie is not bad. The plot about gangsters is captivating and fun, and also has a bit of black humor and sarcasm that we can find in PULP FICTION. The resources were not many, but the film is well produced. The acting is also good. I enjoyed the scene when the girl was sitting on the couch joking with the doctor ... It was hot and fun at the same time! The soundtrack is also beautiful. I did not listen to too many songs, but the ones I heard I liked. I rate it 7/10.
