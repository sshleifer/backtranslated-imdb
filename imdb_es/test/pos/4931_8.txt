In the opinion of this critic, the best time to be a child was in the 1990s, a period in which the cartoons were not very censored and the talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainments to attack waves. The best producers of the Saturday morning animation were at Warner Brothers Television, who experienced a great Golden Age with the dream team of Steven Spielberg, Tom Ruegger and Paul Dini. Along with serious and dark series like Batman, they also revived quirky and extravagant cartoons made famous by the Looney Tunes. Animaniacs was the greatest batter with its dark adult humor and celluloid tributes of yesteryear and today, but Tiny Toon Adventures was equally popular in reinventing Looney Tunes for a new generation, while maintaining the insane violence of cartoons and intelligent comedy. can cling to any age group, no matter how old. Even when the Tiny Toons extended to a feature film with How I Spent My Vacation, it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series, a curse that often affects other feature film adaptations of the most popular animated shows. /> <br /> The Tiny Toon Gang are young people emerged from the classic cartoon characters that made the audience laugh in the 1940s and 1950s and are currently learning comedy cartoons to "get their Toon Degree". Summer vacations have begun and each character has his own idea of ​​what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babs Bunny (Tress MacNeille) start a fight with water guns that finally leads to Acme Acres flood and both navigate the Mississippi. Plucky Duck (Joe Alaskey) joins Hamton Pig (Don Messick) on a trip across the country to the happiest theme park in the world, but Hamton's family proves to be harder than he imagined. Meanwhile, in other scattered stories, Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze, Fifi Le Fume (Kath Soucie) tries to go out on a date with her favorite skunk star and Shirley the Loon (Gail Matthius) goes to the movies with a whiff of Fowlmouth (Rob Paulen). <br /> <br /> While the premise seems slim for a feature film, many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together. The best of them is the unfortunate road trip of Plucky, who takes the opportunity of the golden comedy very well: feel sorry for someone and at the same time laugh at their situation. Plucky's annoying reaction to all the bad things that happen to him is a perfect combination of script and animation, all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork. The story of Elmyra is definitely second only to see how a small, almost innocent girl can cause fear in so many jungle animals. The violence of the aforementioned cartoons definitely comes to the forefront with the story of Buster and Babs, which makes us smile not only for the hilarity of the results, but also for the nostalgia, since Ruegger and company probably do not It will allow to show half of what they do in that segment. Practically half of that segment is played as a parody and tribute to Deliverance, including an intelligent turn in the scene of the dueling banjos, with the unforgettable theme of Tiny Toon Adventures. <br /> <br /> Part of the universal appeal of the Tiny Toons is that the humor turns out to be very intelligent, since it focuses on subjects with a ferocity that shows that it does not deserve at all the title of "rate for children" with the one that people seem to slap him. A complete segment that presents the bad label of Fowlmouth in the cinema mocks the yappers in a perfect way, along with an additional blow to the THX logo of Lucasfilm. That scene is done so perfectly that it should be presented before each film screening. There are also a couple of moments that make fun of Disney World, the holes of the film plot and even the legal department of Warner. The fact that today's cartoons are vapid and uncreative makes those smart moments even more treasuring, as there probably will not be another animated series that comes close. <br /> <br /> After seeing How I spent my vacation for the first time. In many years, I can safely say that they do not do cartoons like they used to. With the censorship that is taking place today's family entertainment, one wonders if ever something like this will ever be done again. This review is not only a recommendation of a truly intelligent film, but also a request for Spielberg, Ruegger and Dini to come together again and bring a magical creation to our mind once again. God knows that children of the 21st century need something with the intelligence of Tiny Toon Adventures. This is not a simple hoarding of cash, it is a wonderful movie full of spirit, madness and hilarity.
