My friend gives me these 3 huge boxes. "These are laser disks from the Flash Gordon series," he says. "I'm going to have some giant coasters," I say. But it's not like that. This series of rocks. (But I had to moan and moan to almost everyone I met to find a laserdisc player for them). <br /> <br /> There is really a bit of everything in this series: there are lion men, hawk men, shark men, men of Earth, and I guess they would call them Mongo men. The suits and suits are combined, Greek, Roman, Oriental, Egyptian and there are even armor like the English knights. Awesome costumes And some of that was a riot. Those horrible stockings with shorts on em worn by Zarkov are beyond description. And the guys in the furnace scene seem to be wearing boxers. <br /> <br /> It's also funny how they changed the name of the octopus to an octosack, from the orangutan to the orangapoid and from the tiger to the tigron. There is even a dragon (a Godzilla-like creature that threatens Flash a couple of times before being killed). <br /> <br /> Do you like Invisible Man? This has you covered. Do you like sword fights, fight (both animals and men), fist fights? A lot for any taste. We have an underwater city, a city of heaven, a city on the top of a mountain, and tons of secret passages and caves. <br /> <br /> Hokey effects? Massive amounts. The city of heaven is supported by revived radio ovens like the old steam ships. The rockets are "propelled" by fireworks and have constant buttresses and / or buzzes. You see many cables that hold things (like food when Flash was invisible and, of course, rockets). There are clouds in space, but none around the earth when seen from Mongo. The "giant" lizards appear briefly. The fight against sea creatures supposedly threatens Flash & co. On the way to the underwater city of sharks. The "gadgets" in Dr. Zarkov's laboratory bother me. And they seem to be the same no matter what laboratory he is in (he worked in the Ming laboratory and in Vultan's). <br /> <br /> And yes, we have romance. Everyone wants Dale; Ming, Vultan, Flash. But at least one person wanted Princess Aura (Prince Baron), simply not the person she would have preferred. In fact, it seems that many of the subplots have to do with the intrigue on the part of Princess Aura to try to win Flash. <br /> <br /> Man, I think the characters are incredible. That fat, laughing horse, King Vultan was very funny. How he got those wings was pure art. And Ming! What can I say about Ming? He was perfect. They must have had it for the emperor in Starwars. Ming has to be my favorite character in this series. Princess Aura was also a rather small character. And she did it very well. I think she's a better actress than Dale Arden by far. Even the cunning high priest had a distinctive role. Zarkov was good, but he was not the strongest character, and he always stayed in the background during the fight scenes in which Dale was. Now we come to Flash: Flash, of course, was the strong point, the leader, the hero, and he did it well. Crabbe is a good actor and this role fits perfectly to him. <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I think I know where George Lucas got the main idea from Starwars. Look at this, you will see what I want to say. <br /> <br /> If you have ever considered watching an old series (or any other series), this should be your first choice. The only reason I did not give this a 10 is because of a few story holes that could have been easily fixed, by the way the giant lizards seemed to be there, and by a couple of weak characters (King of Shark- Men and king of lions-men).
