Hey, what do you expect from a very low budget movie? Although I have not seen "Dahmer" (2002), I can say that after what the media published about Jeff this is a pretty accurate description. I have studied the case of Jeffrey Dahmer and I have learned everything I can about this man. This is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. If you can overcome the gore and see what is the underlying story of a sick mind. I really liked that movie! Just get ready for a low and bloodless budget. It is a story seen through the eyes of a murderer and his actions and thoughts from childhood until his arrest. My favorite line is: "If they had bothered to look in the back seat, it could have saved many lives" Enjoy it!
