This new version of the fabulous five-star finale suffers a terrible performance. Humphrey Bogart plays the manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to increase sinking ratings. The owner decides to have a series of moral works written about a famous murder case 20 years ago. Then they hire the false preacher (Harry Hayden) to locate the murderer, who was acquitted and has been living quietly under a false name. The preacher arrives on the day of the daughter's wedding, but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives. <br /> <br /> Bogart is always good. The viscous preacher is good, and Henry O'Neill is as good as the father. Everyone else is just horrible. Helen McKeller does not gain any sympathy (crucial to the role), Linda Perry is a bad actress, Beverly Roberts is fine, but always looks old, Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh have no parts, Carlyle Moore is as bad as the girlfriend, Virginia Brissac is miscast as the mother of society, Robert Middlemas claims to be the owner of the station. <br /> <br /> It arrives in less than an hour, but it is a pale copy of the original that featured dynamic performances by Edward G. Robinson, Aline MacMahon, Frances Starr and Boris Karloff. But Boagrt is always worth seeing.
