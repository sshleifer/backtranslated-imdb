Nightbreed is not only excellent, it is also unique, even taking into account other Barker films, which never lack originality. An amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. For the horror genre, it has quite a few symbolic symbols and subtle references. It's certainly fun to have, a little to think, if one cares. And, not to forget, a good musical score. Well, special effects, as usual, age faster than anything else, but that's probably the only drawback. I just saw him again after ten years, and I still find something to recommend.
