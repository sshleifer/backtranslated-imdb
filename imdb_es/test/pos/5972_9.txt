Fantastic Russian film of the Second World War. Like most Russian films of World War II, The Ascent is incredibly heartbreaking. It is also dense in its symbolism. The story follows two partisans, Sotnikov and Rybak (Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin), who go on a mission to find food. On their journey, they are seen by German soldiers, who injure Sotnikov. Sotnikov, in turn, kills one of the Germans, which creates problems for the two partisans and for all others with those who later meet. The biggest success of the film is its vivid sense of place. Russia is frozen and snowy, and it's hard not to feel the cold go straight to your own bones. Shepitko keeps his shot close to the characters, examining every rock on their faces. It probably was not the choice, but the film is framed at 1.33: 1, which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia. While the whole movie is a great achievement, I felt that the first half was stronger than the second. My main complaint about the film is that it develops in a very subtle Christian allegory because of its climax. I just do not think that the symbolism adds much to the process, especially when I was already intrigued by the debate between the two supporters. It is not entirely fair. He was weighing the pros and cons of his argument. I began to lean towards the point of view of a certain character, and then the director appears and tells me that it is Judas. Despite some heavy-handed, this is still a must.
