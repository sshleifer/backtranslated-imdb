* THIS COMMENT WILL PROBABLY HAVE SPOILERS! I CHECKED THE SPOILERS BOX IN CASE, BUT I COULD HAVE SPOILERS, BUT IT MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ANY WAY IF I SAY SOMETHING YOU COULD CONSIDER A SPOILER AND I DO NOT! Wow ... the best game since Super Mario 64. I got it on the first day it came out, and before I got it, I went to some game websites to see its ratings (yes, they checked it before it came out) and I was surprised I expected something like Sunshine because lately all Mario games have been getting worse and worse. But this one totally beat the other games. The scores in this game even surpassed Halo 3! It is simply amazing. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: It's not the best, Mario games are never known for their plots, and this is not really a big difference. Bowser, once again, kidnaps Peach, but this time invades the Kingdom of Fungi in a festival that is held once every century and gets a flying saucer that shoots lasers on the ground and then place anchors in the ground and tear the castle and its foundations to the outer space. <br /> <br /> GRAPHICS: Absolutely beautiful, the best Wii graphics so far. The effects of water are also very pleasant, if you ever see the water, it looks so real because the effects they put on it. <br /> <br /> MUSIC: Simply amazing, the music in this game is orchestrated. Not everything, but even those who are not orchestrated still sound very good. <br /> <br /> GAME: very entertaining, makes you want to play more and more, and for me, since I usually tend to be very frustrated with games if I die a lot, I mean, I'm definitely not the only one , but this game for me did not have much. Now I still did it, but not to the point like Mario 64, in which I go crazy and end up turning off the game because I got angry, this one never did it. <br /> <br /> DIFFICULTY: There it is. There are two types of difficulty, since technically you can beat the game with only 60 stars, which I think is quite easy, but to beat the game 100%, you must get 120, as always, and that search is much more difficult, but at the same time it's still very funny. <br /> <br /> LENGTH: Good length, definitely not too short. It took me around 15-16 hours to beat it with only 60 stars, but 120 took me more like 45-50 hours. Now I did not play it much constantly, I played a lot first one day, then the next couple of days just a couple of hours each day, then the next two days I played all day. For me, however, I think the search for 60 stars was a bit short, so if you want a long game, I suggest getting them all. <br /> <br /> PRESENTATION: Now, the cinematic scenes in this movie are excellent. As they are, it is very similar to something you would see in theaters. They are undoubtedly the best cinematographic scenes of any Mario game so far. <br /> <br /> IN GENERAL: This game is definitely a great game, and I advise you not to wait until Christmas, to get it as soon as possible. This game is also a good mix of the old and the new, you will have some levels of side scrolling in which you will move only from side to side, or up and down because they will change in gravity, but even the music has some old classics . So this game seems to be a masterpiece. For me, it's my favorite Mario game of all time, but others may disagree. But it's still a great game. I recommend all players who want to have fun in a game to get this.
