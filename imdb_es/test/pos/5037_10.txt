John Travolta was excellent as "Michael" in the movie with the same name. I do not think that a better representation could have been made. The movie was fun, but moving. Michael is a very "human angel" (if so). Andie MacDowell is excellent in her reporting role, as she goes from disbelief to belief. Bill Hurt and Robert Pastorelli are excellent as fellow reporters, each determined to demonstrate the angel's deception on earth. Each of the supporting actors is wonderful, especially the older woman (I do not know her first name), who plays Michael's mother! One of the most beautiful movies I've seen in years ... I could watch this movie dozens of times!
