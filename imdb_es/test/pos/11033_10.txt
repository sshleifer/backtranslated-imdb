This movie is one of the best memories I have of childhood. Having always loved the tigers, my mom took me to see him. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely incredible. It's one of those movies that leaves a lasting impression on you. The image of the Tigers running through the snow with everything sprayed is still in my head about 25 years later, not many films have made it, As other comments have said, the picture is impressive. You must see it. I've also been looking for the movie for some time without luck. :-( Checking Amazon from time to time does not reveal anything, it does not even appear on the list If someone knows a source, contact me or post here.
