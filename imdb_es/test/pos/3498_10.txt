I do not see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to take your head off your tight ass if you do not find this funny movie! If this is not your "tea cup", so to speak, then look at it for what it really is: a damn funny movie. Maybe they set out to make another drug / T & A movie, but in this case, they have really got it right. It is especially fun for fans of Ali G, because it delivers everything we have come to love and expect from him. So I say BIG UPS to Ali G, and if it's not your thing, do not complain, BATTY BOY!
