This movie not only has a great title, but it is simply the best drama I have ever seen in my life. The viewer is irresistibly involved in the film involving 5 young people who work together to try to overcome insurmountable difficulties, Sean Astin as Billy Tepper is brilliant along with great supporting roles of TERussell, Wil Wheaton and Shawn Phelan, the guidance and leadership of Gosset and The Astins characters make the movie much better. As time passes, the film continues to gain momentum and it is disappointing that none of the young actors have made a name in the film industry after this wonderful movie.
