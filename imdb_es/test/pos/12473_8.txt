SPOILERS The famous character of Edgar Rice Burroughs was adapted thousands of times for the screen until the thirst of one is turned off, especially during the thirties and forties by Hollywood. Its producers made Tarzan one of the most successful film characters. Several years later, Hugh Hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the ape man and is a more natural, wilder and more realistic Tarzan than he gives here. Hudson skilfully avoids the clich√©s you usually give to Tarzan, such as his famous shout or his friendly pet, the cheetah. Not only are we far from the designed and invented character made by Hollwood, but we are also far from the scenario of the movie we use to make their stories. The film was partially made in Africa (more precisely in Cameroon). The film presents two obvious parts: the first, which takes place in the jungle where Tarzan lives among his adoptive friends, the apes and considers himself as his lord. But he ignores his true origins. The second in England where Tarzan discovers English society. Ian Holm personifies the link between the two parties and Hudson avoids everything that could make the film fall into ridicule thanks to an intelligent script. In fact, Holm teaches Lambert the basic rules of manners to behave correctly in English society and the result works. On the other hand, in the second part, nobody laughs at Tarzan and is even very appreciated. As far as the end is concerned, it is a bitter and happy ending. Happy because Tarzan returns to the jungle and meets again with his close adoptive relatives. But bitter too, because this return home means that the Greystoke line will not be insured and is doomed to disappear ... Christophe Lambert finds here, his first (and last?) Great role. Unfortunately, he will never equal the achievement of his performance in this film and will play in poor and tasteless action films. However, as I said before, an intelligent script, a performance of rare quality, some impressive natural landscapes (both the jungle and the English country and we have a beautiful film.) It is also an excellent reading of a popular novel. What, just qualified only (6/10)?
