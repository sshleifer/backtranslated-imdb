I have some good memories of seeing Robin de Sherwood on TV when I was a kid (but I think I only saw the Michael Praed episodes, for some reason). And recently my brother bought the new DVD boxes released from the complete series. It was great to see him again, and it's the best of all Robin Hood's movies and TV series. The cast is great, and the places mixed with the music of Clannad add this very special feeling. Personally I think that Praed is the best of the two Robins, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue with the series. Ray Winstone, Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie are great in their roles as Will Scarlet, The Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne. It is a pity that a fourth season has never been done, and I have also heard that the writer Richard Carpenter had plans to make a film after the events of the series. Robert of Huntingdon (Connery) could finally have married Marion (Judi Trott), or maybe Herne the Hunter could resurrect Robin from Loxley (Praed), and he could take revenge on the sheriff. As mentioned before; if the producers of "Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves" had been smart, they would have obtained the cast of "Robin of Sherwood", and would have turned the film into a kind of sequel to the series. As Ray Winstone put it in the extra material of the DVD, it would have been great to see them as old, as in "Robin and Marian" by Sean Connery. Who knows, maybe we can see more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. In any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again.
