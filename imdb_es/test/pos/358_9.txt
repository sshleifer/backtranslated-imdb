One of the longest films of Chaplin until that moment, Burlesque on Carmen is an intelligent and surprisingly complex parody of the then well-known story of "Prosper Merimee" on "Carmen". I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDb list of 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the execution time, I assume it was the 1915 version that I saw, since the 1916 version is 20 minutes more, and from what I have read, they are 20 minutes unnecessary and not impressive. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it's clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's most complex and ambitious efforts to date, starting with a back story, told through intertitles, about the tragic history of love. from carmen. <br /> <br /> Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies ("A band that put GYP in gypsy"), to seduce a Spanish officer so they can carry out their smuggling operation. It is a band of intelligent and capricious criminals, whose leader, Lillas Pastia, has "spent 50 years learning to steal, thinking that he could be offered a job in politics." <br /> <br /> On a side note, I've seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Chaplin's previous works, but probably none so obvious as in this one. Near the beginning of the film, while the gypsy band is traveling, there is a scene in which mules and women are being charged, and an intertitle explains that "mules are those with long ears". In case you could not say it, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays the role of Don Jos√©, the unfortunate officer who must be seduced by Carmen. He is described as "a brave soldier and lover of women". It's not exactly a stretch for Chaplin, who eliminated any doubt about his ability to play a comedic comic soldier a few years later in the shining Shoulder Arms. And, of course, he did not have to act to be a lover of women. <br /> <br /> What is different here, of course, is his polished military uniform and his disciplined style of direct backup, interspersed, of course. , with some of its traditional slap-stick movements. It seems to me a small guy in a position of authority, struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exerting a brusque and firm exterior. <br /> <br /> Soon Carmen enters ("Loved by all men under the age of 96 ??"), and she immediately starts flirting with Charlie. I must mention that for a good majority of the film, it is surprisingly true to the original story, which was full of jealousy and tragedy. Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover, capable of evoking a jealous passion that I have never seen of him. There is at least one scene where it really is a bit scary. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has some great gags in the movie, like a fun table dance and a classic sword fight near the end. And his youthful charm and the role of a soldier are also definitely a winning combination, although there is another peculiar trick that involves a group of men pushing a huge door from one side to another that, to begin with, was not very effective, but simply He went on and on. again and again, probably five times more than it was worth. Although it was interesting that when it finally fell on him, it was clearly revealed as a movie prop. I always appreciate those flashes in the old movie sets. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is its strongest part. It has a striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet, but just when you think Chaplin is going to do a great thematic experiment by breaking away from his traditional style, there is a hilarious twist that is a Chaplin as classic as any I've ever seen. Good job!
