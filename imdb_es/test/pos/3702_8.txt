At the beginning I did not have much faith, but as a citizen of Costa Rica I can confirm that the film shows the reality that we live every day and shows many things of our culture, like our way of speaking, Our music, our way of defending our rights without fear, without weapons. <br /> <br /> I am really proud of the work they did and how they did not forget the message throughout the film. They wanted us to receive, without worrying about the money, but really working with a short budget, allowing us to appreciate the beautiful scenery and the great photography. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie, you will not regret it. that.
