I saw this movie many years ago (along with another one of the films of Shepitko, Wings) as part of a series of Soviet films in a local film archive. But none of Shepitko's films, as far as I can tell, has reached video or DVD in the United States. Ascent is a great movie for all levels, with an impressive black and white photography, hypnotic direction and actors so deep in their roles that it makes no sense of them simply giving a performance. Although the details of the period of Russian resistance to (and collaboration with) the German occupation are very revealing, the story is timeless. Two Russian partisans are captured by the Germans, and the interrogation tests their integrity and courage. I suspect that the reason why the Russians have not published it on DVD (here comes the problem) is that the Jewish intellectual (and not the Russian peasant) is the supporter who resists both threats and temptation, goes to death with serenity. And it sets a heroic example for the villagers.
