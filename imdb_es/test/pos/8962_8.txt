Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a womanizing Texas congressman, with no discernible legislative records. In 1980, he is interested in the plight of Afghanistan, which is in the midst of a brutal war with the USSR. Under the auspices of her former flame, Texas Socialist Conservative Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) travels to Afghanistan to assess the situation and is stunned by what she sees. Return to the USA UU Determined to help Afghans, only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation, and himself under investigation for allegations of drug use. Undaunted, Wilson recruits Herring and the vulgar, the CIA agent, Gust Avrakotos (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), to start a disgusting arms deal involving Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and a US Congress. UU Ultimately, Afghans defeat the Soviets, but while the United States celebrates its victory, Wilson and Avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of post-war Afghanistan that falls on deaf ears. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's war is a big surprise. A really great movie for the most intellectual viewer and a fun entertainment for the average viewer. The film brings together a surprising variety of talents, both in front of and behind the camera, and fulfills its promise of being a good time. The movie has only one defect, which we will reach later. As an examination of the unlikely way in which the largest covert war of the twentieth century was fought, and, perhaps, the way in which the CIA and other intelligence agencies do things, is fascinating. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting on several levels. The story depicted in the film, with all its extravagant treatment, furtive covert operations and, perhaps most of all, its success, would be as outrageous as a work of fiction, which could easily be dismissed as a satire. But things really worked out this way, at least within reasonable limits. The film portrays our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without hiding their shortcomings. Wilson as a person who does not apologize for his vices (even embracing them), but who is willing to embrace a just cause. Herring is somewhat elitist, and its born-again attitude of righteousness is unpleasant, but it is deeply committed to the cause of the Afghan people. Avrakotos is a CIA stranger with an attitude problem, scorned due to his "street" background; however, his love for the country and hatred of communism are unwavering. The fact that this strange trio can play an important role in the fall of the USSR is not only proof that anyone can make a difference, but also that truth is stranger than fiction. It is also very interesting that all this is reproduced as a comedy, not surprising, given that our writer is Aaron Sorkin, but it is an interesting way to approach this story. <br /> <br /> The movie does. It has one drawback, which is a bit surprising. The film seems to blatantly celebrate the achievement of Wilson and Co. This is fine, there is nothing wrong with defeating the Soviet Union, right? - until one considers that the Taliban and, finally, Al Qaeda emerged from the ashes of the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan. Regardless of the level of responsibility of the EE. UU., It happened, and the film portrait of Wilson's success is almost unmitigated. To be fair, the film tackles this issue towards the end, with a rather clich√©d speech by Wilson about the inability of the United States to clean up after itself, but it is done in such a tertiary way that the average viewer probably will not take it away much . The general impression will be that these three remarkable people helped the Afghans to defeat the Soviets. This is not a fatal problem, of course, but it is a worrying aspect of a brilliant movie. <br /> <br /> The talent of the film is remarkable. The legendary Mike Nichols offers an elegant production and with a magnificent appearance; The material adapts perfectly to his sober and ironic director's style. Sorkin delivers another brilliant script; The film has dozens of quotable lines and classic Sorkin exchanges (the best is the discussion of the "Scottish bottle" between Wilson and Avrakotos), and maintains a political and historical perspective. The cast of the film is wonderful: Tom Hanks offers an excellent performance as the adorable rogue with a cause, Julia Roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as the unpleasant but compromised Joanne, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals each scene (usual pair) as the abrasive Gus. . The always charming Amy Adams takes another step on her way to stardom as the long-suffering assistant of Wilson, and Ned Beatty, Om Puri, Emily Blunt, Christopher Denham and Ken Stott give body to the cast. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is a smart and funny movie, a little more than light entertainment. The fact that you decide not to be more than that should not be rejected; He is brilliant at what he does. <br /> <br /> 8/10
