A bright young man interested in "serious" music (no doubt a fleeing race, who will play the violin when no one can play the violin?) He could find this an interesting fiction about street children and great musical stars. In fact, the best violinist of his generation and the film give him a rare opportunity on the screen to show his technique.The children, especially Gene Reynolds, are fine and, in general, the picture is a good example of the study family First class, late 1930s fare. It's not top of the big '39 list, but it's a good way for a smart family to spend a rainy afternoon with AMC or Video Store --- good luck in Blockbuster!
