Where this film differs from the traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe, for example, we have had years of war and, although one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended up living side by side or WITH the other at the end of the conflict. In the United States, the white population of immigrants exterminated the aboriginal population until almost its extinction. The American citizen never had to live with his enemy. This explains in my opinion the often simplistic nature of the Hollywood movie when they try to explain the struggle of a foreign country. But in this film, the director and the script did not fall into this clich√©. It turns out that everyone in the story has something right and something wrong. It is a great story of morality, hidden truth and commitment.
