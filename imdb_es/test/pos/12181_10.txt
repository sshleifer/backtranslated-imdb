I think the adaptation of Anne Rice's book is enough. While most of the film was filmed here in Australia, it offers a lot of scenery and a fantastic area for filming. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) has recently woken up from a long period of sleep and has decided to betray his vampire oath. revealing himself to a band. When he becomes a popular icon of the film, his fellow vampires, understandably, go crazy and plot his death. Meanwhile, Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), an orphan member of supernatural studies, who has an old vampire family tree, has become deeply obsessed with Lestat. His boss David (Paul McGann) understands his obsession and reveals his obsession with the vampire Marius, (Vincent Perez) who is an ancient vampire and the man who made Lestat a vampire as well. Jesse receives the Lestats diary and reads his first murder and an encounter with the Queen of the Damned, Akasha (Aaliyah). When Lestat holds a concert in Death Valley, he receives news that not only angry vampires will be there, Akasha can also come. Meanwhile, Akasha has other plans. She goes to a coven of vampires, to a bar, and kills everyone on her way. With Lestat tempted with royalty and the loving care of Akasha, the ancient vampires formed by Marius and Jesses, Aunt Maharet (Lena Olin) conspire against them. Join Her Or Die? <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was fantastic, that it had great fighting scenes, good music and great locations. Aaliyah sadly died in a plane crash shortly before the movie premiere, but he looked impressive on set and off sets. <br /> <br /> I gave him this movie 10/10 because it was a fantastic movie and I urge him to see it!
