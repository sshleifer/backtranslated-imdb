This television series is about an unconventional and unconventional English gentleman who faces all kinds of setbacks. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing Mr. Bean with my family in 1990, when I was still a child. My family laughed a lot with each episode, and the contents of which still appear in our daily conversations twenty years later. The memorable scenes that are still in my head include Mr. Bean trying to get out of his parking lot, shoot the lights, count sheep, and him in the pool. We bought all the Mr Bean videos on VHS, no matter how expensive they were. It was worth it because we saw them again and again! It is very rare to see a very funny television series that is suitable for all ages.
