I think there are two angles in the story: first, it is the world satirical view, presented in a Kafkaesque manner, that highlights the sordid spectacle behind some of the most common moments and elements, but also pleasant or comfortable, which are usually enough. to keep man functioning in society. Like: a good job, a good home, a good wife, a good car, and even a good lover. Apart from the so-called common happiness, there are some who can not help but ask some more uncomfortable questions, such as, where they come from or the climate that can have another form of happiness, the weather can be a reason for them to be or climate could have something to they were lost, or, even more sinister, there might be something that the system itself is hiding from them. <br /> <br /> Second, the most interesting aspect of this film, I think, is the fact that it attacks head-on this natural compulsion to dissect the world around us, we question it with our personal judgment and, therefore, Generally, we condemn it because it does not serve us better, because it is not made to measure to be suitable for us. person. <br /> <br /> The symbolism behind the train accident, I think suggests that our own will can be dominated by fate or by some other universal greater power, even in the face of our so-called power to decide when we want to leave. . On the other hand, man can be dismissed by this great power (let's call it THE SYSTEM, because the authors clearly avoid calling it GOD, perhaps underlining that the SYSTEM is made by man and, therefore, can be dominated by man, unlike of FATE, which is a concept closer to religion) on its own terms, not by killing it, but by showing that there is a place for the man who asks / wants too much, suggesting that perhaps, true satisfaction does not come from the outside world, but from within, and if the outside world "decides" to provide some comfort, he must learn to accept it, without questioning the structure of each of the small aspects of it. <br /> <br /> It is uncomfortable, but it makes you reevaluate some existential issues that have become a widespread practice in the last century, as what man can do in a world increasingly loaded with substances, a world driven by the consumer in which man can be exchanged without making a difference in the larger image, but only to the extent that it is of some use to the system.
