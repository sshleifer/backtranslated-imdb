I just sat back in this movie and I can only wonder if we will see movies like this one. The timeless music, the tender voices of William Holden and Jennifer Jones leave this adult man crying through happy and romantic scenes, and I am not someone who cries very often in life. Where have our William Holden gone and they are going to make these moving, wonderful movies, not anymore? It's sad to have to realize that they probably will not, but do not think about it, just try to block it out of your mind. Even so, they will not have Holden on him and he will not appear on that hill again. You can only enjoy this movie and watch it again.
