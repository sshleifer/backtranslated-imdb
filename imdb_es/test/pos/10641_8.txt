This is one of the best movies I've seen in the silent era (I'm sorry to say that I have not seen many yet, with the exception of Chaplin / Keaton). Very bright visually, with an incredibly influential style in editing and composition. Camera angles really unique (especially for their time) and extremely hectic editing. Definitely a must for the nerd of the movie. <br /> <br /> The downside is that it's a bit too much in your face about your policy (I have no problem with politics in the movie, as long as they are subtle or at least somewhat ignorable as a back seat to the history). Also, it's not an "entertainment" movie, which is fine, but it's not something you'll see a billion times. This is art, simple and simple, like it or not. <br /> <br /> It's worth an A + just for influence, but based on personal enjoyment, I give it an A-.
