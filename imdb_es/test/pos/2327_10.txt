The scripts of the subtle comedy are unparalleled with any film in recent years. The characters are interesting, although a little predictable. The comic time written in the script is more than enough to compensate for a lost plot below. When you're sure you know the end ... SURPRISE! Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set probably will not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate a particular galley scene! Great movie!
