Can this really be a Troma movie? Some scenes almost look like an "A" movie. The acting is generally competent (the two tracks and the substitute nurse were especially good, and I liked some of the confrontations between the young Capuleto and Ques); the scenes were edited without problems; The plot is coherent. It is funny. It has an original and modern soundtrack. <br /> <br /> He has the usual nonsense and little humor of Troma, but I do not think Shakespeare would have cared so much. In fact, I think I could have had some good laughs with this. <br /> <br /> It's a good DVD. There is an alternative sound track with a very informative commentary by the director, several deleted scenes and the usual collection of self-critical nonsense of Troma. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to tell you that it was Citizen Kane, but it's a budget-inspired cinema that's pretty inspired.
