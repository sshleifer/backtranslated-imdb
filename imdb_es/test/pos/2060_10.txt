I feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this movie. It is evident that their standards are so high that they can never enjoy a movie just for pleasure. Or, perhaps, its enjoyment derives from the act of separating the films; Are you looking for a reason to not like them? <br /> <br /> Long Kiss Goodnight is an action movie, in every sense of the word. Sure, there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through, but none of them is enough to stop the flow of the movie itself. I've never been a big fan of Geena Davis, but I was impressed how she was able to create two very different characters, Samantha Cain and Charlie Baltimore. In my opinion, it was not even necessary to have changed his physical appearance to differentiate the two ... his performance was more than enough to do the trick. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, however, This movie was by Craig Bierko. In the hands of another, the character of Timothy could have been another interchangeable villain. His decision to play it with a more informal approach was the correct counterpoint for all the action scenes. It is not often that he finds an actor who can express himself so well with just his facial expressions ... in the case: the scene in the freezer with Charlie and his daughter. Where most of the films had saturated the moment of "revelation" with unnecessary dialogue, Bierko's eyes told the whole story. <br /> <br /> The basic plot? Delgado, to be honest. A seemingly average housewife who suffers from amnesia slowly discovers that she had been a murderer. As his memory returns, so do the people who want the murderer to die. Is she really Samantha, the housewife to bake cookies, or Charlie, the cold-blooded killer? Or maybe a bit of both? For me, The Long Kiss Goodnight was a nice trip to discover it.
