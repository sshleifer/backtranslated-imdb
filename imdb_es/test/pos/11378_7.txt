An interesting piece of accompaniment to the true documentaries of John C. Holmes. Unfortunately, it's not about what ultimately killed Holmes, and he certainly could have benefited by doing so. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg got the highest accolades for this, but I felt that the real stars were Julianne Moore as the aspiring mother of a cocaine vacuum cleaner, Don Cheadle as a black man who struggles with identity as a pornstar / stereo-seller in some clothes Wild and William H. Macy, the wife of who is the best bitch. Not to mention an almost unrecognizable Alfred Molina. The eve of Macy's new year and the possibility of Cheadle to have a better life after a robbery of a donut shop that went very wrong, are probably the two best scenes of the film, or at least the two best ones. What this film does best is to show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms. However, none of the characters apparently learns anything from their dark downward spiral as they all recover and return to their normal lives.
