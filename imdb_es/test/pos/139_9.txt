They say that in horror films it is always better to leave things in the hands of the spectator's imagination, hide certain details from the audience to tickle their sense of imagination, immerse themselves in their fears and let their thoughts look darker . <br /> <br /> That was not the case when I saw Bakjwi, under the American title Sed. Now playing in select theaters near you. It seems that the filmmakers did not want to spare you any details. There will be blood in this movie and it will try to look the other way. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the review, visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi.html Thank you and I hope you enjoyed reading above.
