As Custer's story, this is not even close (Custer dies to help the Indians, I am sure that the other members of the Seventh Cav were not consulted in THAT decision). But as a Westerner, this is fun. Flynn looks, and acts, the part of the gentleman who runs. And the "Garry Owen" is always nice to listen to!
