Tomorrow Is Another Day is not the sequel to Gone with the Wind but a story of lovers, and surprisingly alert and moving too. For a supposedly hacked relegated to B-minus features like The Devil Thumbs A Ride, Felix Feist proves to be an expert in filling his work with unexpected and inventive details. Steve Cochran is released from prison after 18 years for murdering his brutal father when he was only 13 years old, and now remains an indecisive and hesitant pubescent who operates inside a man's body. Solitaire, he visits a palace of 10 cents of dance and falls in love with Ruth, who clings to her. But the sudden shooting of her boyfriend, the policeman and the big shot, causes the mismatched couple to hit the road and ends, like the Joads, in a field of workers and migrants from California. <br /> <br /> The Roman revelation; in her best-known role, as Farley Granger's fianc√©e in Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, she was a very little-used woman. Here, she modulates persuasively, from blond taxi dancer to sacrificing the future wife and mother (and a brunette, of course). The Cochran is almost as good, wandering between the suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of a little socialized man. And the end, although it is not convincing, is welcome. Along with They Live By Night and Gun Crazy, Tomorrow Is Another Day shows a redeeming sweetness and warmth that belie their black film pedigree.
