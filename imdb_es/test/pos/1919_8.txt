This is an excellent documentary about a story that I had not heard before. The first solo non-stop race around the world took place in 1968-69 and involved a handful of runners. It is a truly fascinating story about man against nature and man against himself. The story centers on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure of this story. The film elegantly combines interviews with images taken by the sailors themselves aboard their ships. The story is very exciting and sad as we learn the details behind the story of Donald Crowhurst. This is one of the best documentaries of recent years. It has a true human emotion when men face this almost impossible task of navigating the world without stopping.
