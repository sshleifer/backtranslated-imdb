This is an awesome movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like an intelligent and very exciting play (but without the theatrical feeling one really has when seeing people on stage) that plays with everyone's terror of a white lie that rises to monstrous consequences. All the main players are fascinating. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart in the end ... and all the others judge by the amount of clumsy people who looked for handkerchiefs and hands on faces between men and women alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. It is a national treasure. Gosford Park, Vanity Fair, Mary Poppins ... and now this. Can not do anything wrong? SEE AND SEE IT! This is a movie for real adults.
