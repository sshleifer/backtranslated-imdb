We have just seen this anticipated film before its premiere at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was general agreement on two issues: there were excellent performances in a drama of first quality by the two protagonists and others: and, in second place, marketing for this movie will only bring disaster. We saw a poster with chains and suggestive comments that implied some kind of absurd sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, while the film has some depth and some well thought out ideas. What is sad is that people who are looking for close pornography will be attracted to watch the movie and will be disappointed because it will be too "heavy" for them, while the people who would really enjoy it would not be surprised to enter the theater. showing it. Too. A good wasted movie.
