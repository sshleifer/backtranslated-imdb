No, this has nothing to do with the comedy "Seinfeld" or his eccentric and hilarious character Cosmo Kramer. Actually, "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a good drama movie, undoubtedly one of the best of its kind and one of the best movies in history. I'm glad he won more Oscar than "Apocalypse Now" because he really deserved so much glory. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs. Kramer" is an excellent movie, so well made and so perfectly balanced that it would not. Do not change anything about it in any way. There is nothing wrong with the movie. It is the making of films of the highest quality. And it's the test of time, too. Not only does it not seem outdated, its cultural impact is also lasting and its realistic story is still as significant as it was when it was published in 1979. A timeless classic. Today they do not make movies like this. <br /> <br /> This film is dramatic, realistic, simple but bright, intense, powerful, sweet and even tragic and depressing at times. However, he also has good humor. It has no special effects, but who cares? This is not the movie or the place to discuss such a thing. For a movie like this, such a thing would be useless and absolutely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. The chemistry of the actors is simply perfect. All the actors are great, but the top 3 are the best. Dustin Hoffman, a brilliant actor, has his biggest performance here as the adorable and distant workaholic Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is great as Ted's wife, Joanna. And the cute little Justin Henry is fantastic as the lover but sometimes stubborn Billy, son of Ted and Joanna. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is instrumental and wonderful. The opening song (by guitarist Frederic Hand) is brilliant. The rest of the soundtrack is mainly Antonio Vivaldi's classical music and is simply dazzling. <br /> <br /> This movie also has an incredible development of the characters. See character Ted Kramer: a workaholic who becomes an amazing father after having no choice but to take care of his son, trying to adjust these new responsibilities with his work after being left by his wife Joanna. With this, Ted learns about the most beautiful things in life, but also realizes what life is like, the problems in his job and the return of Joanna, who wants custody of her son. But even Joanna changes for the better and the ending is an unexpected surprise when one sees this for the first time. <br /> <br /> This movie also has some ideas, like the scenes of the court where Ted and Joanna face the brutal character. Murders unleashed by lawyers. Another thing to see is when poor Billy falls out of a gym in the jungle with his toy (a plane) and is seriously injured in the face. But, again, the scene is very well done and what follows is very intense: his father runs quickly and crosses many blocks, ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospital. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a movie that is a good lesson in life. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the Top 250.
