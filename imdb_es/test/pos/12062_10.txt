This was one of the few shows that my wife and I agreed to see. It bothered me to hear that it was canceled, especially because I did not realize that the grades were so bad. As far as I knew, I was doing very well with many spectators. Almost all of my friends and most of the people I spoke with saw the show. Now we're stuck watching shit or DVD programs. How bad was the show doing? Does anyone know the real results of the show presentations? I know that when he went to Thursdays, it was harder to catch him. Thanks to G * d for DVR's! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this was a real surprise to know that there will be no more "The War At Home". If any other network sees this, PLEASE COLLECT THE SHOW! PLEASE!
