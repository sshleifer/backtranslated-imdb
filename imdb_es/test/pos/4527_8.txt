Murder Over New York is one of the best mysteries of Chan and I just saw this for the first time. <br /> <br /> In this, Charlie Chan is visiting New York to attend a police convention. At the same time, the people who are involved with the aircraft plants are being killed and he decides to help with the investigation, along with his son Number 2. These murders turn out to be the result of the sabotage in the aircraft plants and Chan helps to identify the killer ... <br /> <br /> Sidney Toler plays Charlie Chan and the rest of the cast includes Sen Yung as their Number 2 son and Marjorie Weaver. <br /> <br /> I liked this mystery and it's worth having it if you like this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars and a half of 5.
