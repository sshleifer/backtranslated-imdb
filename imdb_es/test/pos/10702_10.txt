Canadian filmmaker Ron Switzer offers a solid and continuous journey of implacable terror with the excellent science fiction film of 1991 "Science Crazed". A horrible monster takes revenge on his mother, a police officer and the tenants of an apartment building. The bright practical make-up and the special effects designs create a truly frightening monster, especially when they hide through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the shady configuration of the apartments. The characters develop wonderfully with outstanding and surprisingly moving performances by a cast. Produced by Donna Switzer, newcomer Ron Switzer also wrote the film's face-to-face script, intertwining an attractive roller coaster of twists, turns and terror that keeps you guessing until the last frame. Crazed science will surely leave you persecuted long after the shocking conclusion. Highly recommended!
