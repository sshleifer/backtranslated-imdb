I've been waiting 30 years to see this movie. I played the soundtrack album when I was a teenager and until I was 20 years old. Recently, I located a DVR at a reasonable price and I saw it this morning. It was in widescreen, probably even in a stereo with 70 mm print, the colors were pretty good, very little faded, certainly not remastered, but I'm very happy with this clean copy. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie. It's pretty good. I would not say it's great, although there are great scenes in it. Maybe Premminger was not the right director for that, but I'll say it. For me, the centerpiece of the movie was the hurricane scene. Beautifully staged by Premminger. One of the best climatic scenes of all time. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would dare to say that the scenes that act are better than the musical scenes, not that the musical sequences are bad. No way. They were missing ... something nonetheless. Maybe it was the fact that there are no close ups and very few average shots. It was almost like watching a film of a theatrical production. Maybe that was the feeling that Premminger was pursuing. In the end, it may not have been the right choice, but it is. It's far from being a ruined movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, neither does everyone love the singers on the soundtrack. I always have. They are perfect for this movie. I love singing voices. The actors who sink their lips are excellent for the most part. I just wish the songs were represented more imaginatively. The two issues of Sportin 'Life are fine, but the intimate numbers do not even feel intimate. They just feel ... very far away. Despite that, you can not deny the power of music. And in the end, that's what you hear loud and clear. Once again, maybe what Premminger was trying to do was stay away from the incredible music he was working with. I think he had the right idea, but maybe he went too far in that direction. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. The best congratulations are for the great Brock Peters who acts and sings the part of Crown. He is the last evil one. We just want him to leave poor Bess alone, and he does not. As proud, arrogant and unpleasant as it is, the classic interpretation of Sammy Davis Jr of Sportin 'Life is the very devil and very charismatic. Arguably the best performance of the Davis movie. Poor Bess can not handle two bad men. I'm glad that Hermes Pan has given Davis a dance number to do. <br /> <br /> Dandridge and Poitier, apparently not impressed by being in the movie, are really very sweet together. I do not know about chemistry ... there was more chemistry between Dandridge and Peters than between Dandridge and Poitier. Still, it worked well for Dorothy and Sidney. <br /> <br /> Even so, I think both of you should be proud of the work you did in this movie. Both managed to bring more than one tear to my eye. His characterizations were very 3D and credible. Sidney Poitier's Porgy, however, seems almost out of place in the catfish row. I could not help thinking that it was Mr. Braithwaite in "To Sir with Love", very polite and polite and spoken, in difficult times. It probably would not have been my first choice for the role of Porgy, but hey, at that time I was a big star, why not? Dorothy's Bess was as perfect as her Carmen Jones, in fact, even more vulnerable this time. Carmen was probably the most striking part that she had to do. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's a very, very good movie, it's two clubs away from what I would call a classic. It just does not make the final classic grade. Still, there is no reason on earth why the Gershwin property has decided to keep this beautiful film, even with all its faults, hidden from the public as it has. It is possible that Premminger has made some strange decisions as a director, but the film is not to be ashamed or ashamed of anyone who participates in it. It is what it is and there are much worse movies that are embarrassing on DVD and in today's cinemas. Porgy and Bess is not one of them.
