As a former merchant sailor, I was really interested in this film: personally, I have been involved in a stowaway search when leaving Kingston Jamaica, where a person was found. However, we managed to take it to land since we were in territorial limits. In another boat that was in the stowaway was found and we could not disembark it in any place due to problems of passport / nationality. In fact, he remained for almost a year as a member of the crew almost "honorary" and worked for its maintenance. Africa is known for stowaway pickups. There is a big scene at the beginning of the film when the bulk carrier enters the African port: its size dwarfs everyone. The crew pop on the ground for a bit of intercourse and drunkenness. So far the normal. The drama begins when the stowaways enter the vast cavernous cellars of the ship. Joss Ackland is brilliant as the Captain with a drinking problem that is being harassed by his Nemesis Suchet in top form as the representative of the Company on board. The search for stowaways is classic but we did not have weapons. I question the use of weapons in this movie. This ship seemed to have a vast armory. In my experience, weapons at sea are severely restricted due to customs regulations. Also, having a dog on board was strange. The laws against rabies, especially in Europe, restrict the transport of animals severely. Anyway Pertwee is brilliant as the bitter Mate. The horror that follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable: the shady metallic bottom of the ships is maintained and the feeling that there is nowhere to hide adds to the drama. Some of the freighter crew are not interested in the murder and those who participate are gradually sucked into a world of violence from which there is no escape. The chase through the ship, especially the scenes of the engine room are "advantage in the seat": the feeling of extreme claustrophobia abounds. The sensation of metal pressing and death is only a cannon away. The film is brutal: my girlfriend had to stop watching it during shooting scenes and hit. While this is happening, Suchet in the comfort of his well-equipped cabin gets drunk without realizing the chaos 3 decks below. It is a tense movie, with flaws in some parts, but the real message is that we can all be absorbed by violence in this way. Slowly and surely. Think of the train drivers who brought the Jews to Auschwitz, the employees who drew up the schedule for those trains. I always remember someone who had visited the Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and said that one of the guards of the S.S. he had placed a bird-table outside the camp crematorium. This movie is like this: ordinary people suddenly find themselves in a world of unstoppable violence!
