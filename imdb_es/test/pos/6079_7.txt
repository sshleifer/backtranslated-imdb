The book is better than the film, mainly due to the prose of the writer Ondatje. Before watching this movie, someone who had seen it, told me that the love shown in this movie is not real. After watching this movie, I can see how his suspension of disbelief in this regard could also have distracted other viewers. Frankly, some of the intense demonstrations of love were laughable and seemed to be on the verge of parody. But by the end, everyone must realize that it is a great art message. It is not specifically about love, it uses "love" to reveal dialectically the human division or the arbitrary borders of countries that help to justify wars and hatred. It's about misunderstandings and the blind following of things that supposedly separate us. The critical scene for the real theme of this movie is when the hero or antihero appeals for help for his lover stranded in the desert are ignored and the reasons shown in that scene are ignored. This film is also about hope and forgiveness, the hope that is summed up in the interracial relationship between the recovering character of Binoche and the Indian minesweeper (echoed in the Sikh friend and friend's relationship with his white co-worker that ends up dying without meaning) and forgiveness summarized in the Caravaggio. The first hunt of the character and then the expulsion of what he believes will be the confessions of the hero for his "crimes" of war (treason to the country). I think the movie could have been made even better than it is. I do not know if a more realistic portrait of the circumstances of love would have made the themes and real points of this film even more obvious or not, but I agree that this film is not about realistic romantic love, since people behind this piece of art or film involves in an early scene when casual lovers meet for the first time. The hero talks about how a new car, a broken car, a fast car, etc. (Paraphrasing) is still a car regardless of the adjective you place in front of it. She responds, but paternal love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. They are very different types of love. This is ironic because this movie is really about the love that all humans should want, which is love for (or for) peace (not the materialistic things that are usually the real reasons for wars, personified in something that most of us we want, like the "cars"., say.) Otherwise, we can be stranded in a cave in a vast desert with ancient wall art / drawings of swimmers, suggesting that the seas and waters sustain the life that once were there have almost disappeared, I think "The English Patient" won the Oscar because of these great messages, not specifically because of their representation of romantic love, the prizes tend to go that way. and heroin was necessary to attract the audience, unfortunately, this vision of love may be outdated in the era of divorce and many singles who seem unable to meet on so many levels, such ridiculous versions of It's hard to get involved in love, even in fantasies, in which the love of cinema has always been, especially in old Hollywood. The film may not meet what people expect but 7 out of 10 movies worth watching, regardless.
