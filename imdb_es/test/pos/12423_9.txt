Great horror comedy by Michael Davis. I was laughing so hard I almost peed! Great performance by Eric Jungman as the good guy who saves the day and a great performance by Jack Black-esquire as Justin Urich's performance. He was simply divine in this movie. This guy deserves to be a big star. In addition, Aimee Brooks was good in the movie, as well as the girl in danger, along with the guys of a killer who remembers Jeepers Creepers. The gore was in abundant quantities and I loved it. I just hope that they launch a version without qualification. Great low budget horror comedy. The dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just funny! ***** outside *****
