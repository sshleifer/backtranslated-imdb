"The man with the golden arm" by Otto Preminger is a reference to heroin addiction, something that must have been risky to shoot in 1955, fifty years ago (today's censors still have a problem with the content of drugs in the movies!). br /> <br /> The main role was originally offered to Marlon Brando, then he was captured by Frank Sinatra before Brando could respond. Sinatra portrays convincingly a professional card merchant and former heroin addict who returns home to the city only to find himself fighting the demons of temptation. <br /> <br /> Preminger is one of my favorite directors (his "Anatomy of a Murder" Starring James Stewart is a brilliant and revolutionary judicial drama.) Preminger helped a lot to change the face of cinema in the 50s. " Anatomy of a murder "was extremely controversial when it was published due to its plot and content (references to rape," panties ", seduction, etc.) and" The man with the golden arm "deals with a subject that is equally Volatile. <br /> <br /> However, Preminger does it without being an exploiter.This is like a precursor to "The Panic in Needle Park" (1971) and has more than a few similarities in terms of general reasons to the classical Billy Wilder's film "Lost Weekend," starring Ray Milland, these three films in particular are probably the best movies about alcoholism prior to the 80s and are still relevant today.
