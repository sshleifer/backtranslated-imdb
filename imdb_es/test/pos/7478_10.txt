I really liked that movie! Fantastically original and different! A solid film, intense, hard and full of suspense that has the right touch of humor (dark?). If you're tired of the typical, exaggerated, ridiculous Hollywood B.S. Movies, how many big and terrible explosions and unrealistic gun fights shootings that insult your intelligence we can take, then this movie is for you. Fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and credible, and solid performances by all actors, not a weak character or a performance in the film. The film by Skip Woods is a breath of fresh air and I applaud his originality and effort, his film has the feeling of a cross between a film by Quentin Tarantino and one of the Cohen brothers (in my opinion it is not a bad mix). This movie grabs you by the throat and does not let you go, there is nothing boring or chewing gum in this movie. The only disappointment is that no one seems to know, all that I have recommended have thanked me and have shared my opinion about it. This film is a welcome change / alternative from the canned garbage of Hollywood that is produced today, even with its great actors, big explosions, special effects and big budgets. It is a terribly wild ride, intense, violent, graphic, humorous and crude (I mean, in a good way, there is no false Hollywood enamel here). Thanks to everyone who participated in the making of this film, they did an incredible job.
