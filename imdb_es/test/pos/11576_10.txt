Once again, Almen치bar has provided us with a high quality film. This director is amazing, and has shown that he is equally talented and effective when crossing genres. <br /> <br /> The excellent development of the character of the film, through the dialogue and the peculiarities of the personality, but also with more subtle details (the look of Ram칩n's father), allows the public to identify with the protagonists very closely, making the importance and emotional impact of the events that occur in greater depth. The visual elements are sometimes simple, sometimes impressive (the dream on the beach), and I think the Almen치bar films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music: it corresponded to the different moods of the film to perfection. <br /> <br /> More than a simple film about euthanasia, which in itself is an important topic, this film addresses the duality of a man who sometimes genuinely seems to enjoy life (albeit in a rather limited way ) and, however, one that has not flinched. Your desire to die The overwhelming sadness of the film is marked by jokes of humor, which seem much more fun because they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy you will surely feel. <br /> <br /> Although clearly in favor of euthanasia, this film does an excellent job representing the innumerable points of view of Ramon's friends and family. The most moving thing was Ram칩n's father, when he said dejectedly: "There is only one thing worse than losing a child, that the child wants to die." <br /> <br /> Excellent writing, acting, directing, cinematography, music ... 10/10.
