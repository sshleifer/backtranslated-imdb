Tweety is sent in his cage on a train by the owner of his old lady. In the same baggage car, also in a cage, is Sylvester. <br /> <br /> At no time, Sylvester has grabbed Tweety, but a trainer comes back and slapped the "furtive feline", as he calls him, back in his cage. Puts Tweety "in a safer place", and says to the cat: "Now, remember: there are no tricks!" Sylvester puts his halo and seems innocent. Yeah sure. <br /> <br /> I found things more fun, however, it did not involve Sylvester versus Tweety but the "viscous dog" that is in another cage next to Sylvester. The cat talks to him, and pays a great price in an extremely fun way. Sylvester simply does not learn, but that is one of the reasons why we love him! (I know that many of the IMDb critics do not like Tweety, but I like the two main characters, both criticize me!) <br /> <br /> In addition, the train and the landscape that passes are beautifully illustrated here. - Very beautiful images.
