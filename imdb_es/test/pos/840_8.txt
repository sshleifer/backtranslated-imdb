Many consider that BEAST STABLE is the last of the "true" movies of PRISONER FEMININO, since it is the last of the series directed by Shunya Ito, and is followed by another film (GRUDGE SONG) by a different director. I have not yet seen GRUDGE SONG (but soon I will ...), so I do not know how it compares with the previous FP movies, but it will be interesting to see them. The way BEAST STABLE ended did not leave much room for another predecessor, but I think I'll find out ... <br /> <br /> This entry has Scorpion running away from the police, where she hooks up with a street prostitute who She ends up pregnant with her daughter of late brothers (oh yes, that's not a lie ... I have to love these bad stories). Scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival, but (as she is so good at ...) she ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people who hurt some of her prostitute friends ... <br /> <br /> I am According to some other critics, this is a bit slower in the points and more "serious" than the previous two entries. The story is sometimes confusing and complicated, but many of these movies from the 70s are pink, and I still love them. BEAST STABLE lacks a lot in the area of ​​nudity, which was quite disappointing, but I found it strong in other areas: history, cinematography, some bad words, etc ... Definitely worth it for fans of this kind of stuff , or who have enjoyed the other PRISONER FEMININE movies ... 8/10
