I loved the movie "Eddie Monroe". The film had all the components that interested me while watching it. I especially loved the twists of the plot along the way and the surprising ending. Craig Morris has the potential of Brad Pitt in both appearance and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman. Fred Carpenter took this movie to a new level. I loved the cast. The score, the cinematography, the talent, the places and the script were impressive. I loved seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and talented director. Give your work to 200%. The film has a great texture. I hope there is an Eddie Monroe 2. I would love to see how Nicolette turns out after earning her money. Eddie Monroe, by Fred Carpenter, is at Hollywood level.
