I LOVE THIS MOVIE! <br /> <br /> This beautiful and lovely love story immediately attracted me to its lovely characters and their loving romance. I felt so attached to the characters throughout the film that I felt I knew them personally. The story is very charming and made me cry in several touching moments. Duchovny and Driver have a very nice and chaste relationship in which you can not help getting involved. It's worth seeing more than once and showing it to all your friends. I'm just curious, why was not it a great success? <br /> <br /> I give it 10 out of 10! Spectacular movie! (And this comes from a guy who thinks that 9 out of 10 movies are not worth seeing).
