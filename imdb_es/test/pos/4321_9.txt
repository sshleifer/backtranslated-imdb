The writers of the lost have outdone themselves. The end of the second season is even more heartbreaking and intense than the end of the first season. Locke's lack of faith has not only had spiritual consequences for him, but tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him, but can he possibly escape the island? You will have to do it if you want to stay alive. I do not doubt that one or more of his old friends would be willing to kill him in revenge. This ending has left more questions than the previous ending; and I can not wait for autumn. <br /> <br /> A side note: why publish a comment just to write all the spoilers? Where is the pleasure of spoiling the surprise for everyone else? The current revision on this page is nothing more than a great spoiler festival, poorly constructed in barely legible English for the express purpose of driving someone crazy. Good job.
