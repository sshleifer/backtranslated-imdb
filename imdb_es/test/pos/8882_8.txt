This movie is basically a parody of Hitchcock Strangers on a train, which I thought was overrated anyway. The plot makes Danny Devito go see Strangers and then think that Billy Crystal wants them to swap murders, so that Crystal murders her mother and Devito murders his wife. Both Devito and Crystal are great and so is Devito's mother. This is Devito's directorial debut and it's better than the War of the Roses.
