In the decade of the '60 / '70, David Jason was famous for his many supporting roles in television comedies such as 'Do not adjust your game!', 'Hark At Barker' and the series 'Doctor'. It was in 1974 when he got his first lead role, in "The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs" of London Weekend Television, written by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna. <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs is a secret agent of the 'SIS' ('Secret Intelligence Service'). He really tries to do his job well, but he always seems to ruin things. However, surprisingly, always manages to get to the bottom of the cases, to the amazement of his colleagues: 'Buxton' (Michael Stainton), 'Spencer' (Mark Eden) and 'Cathy' (the charming Elisabeth Counsell). all of which responds to 'The Commander' (Noel Coleman). <br /> <br /> Briggs is married to 'Jennifer' (Barbara Angell), a woman who, like Michele Dotrice's' Betty 'from' Some Mother's Do 'Ave' Em! ', She has the patience of a saint and defends her husband as a liar (but well intentioned), no matter what. <br /> <br /> Like 'Some Mother's Do' Ave 'Em' and 'The Baldy Man', 'TTSLOEB' was completely intertwined with slapstick. In each episode, Jason performed acrobatics such as falling from a high window sill or falling from the top of a staircase while decorating his apartment. Actually, it was a 'cream cake on the face'. <br /> <br /> 'Edgar Briggs' was not a great success, due to the bad programming of I.T.V. A pity, since it was a fun and enjoyable show, well served by its star and the excellent supporting cast. The protagonist, however, did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show. David Jason vetoed repeating the projections of the program because he felt that his performance in it was not refined. Of course, the David Jason who played 'Del Boy', 'Inspector Frost' and 'Pop Larkin' is very different from the one played by Briggs but by no means was his performance unrefined. Most of the actors would have turned Briggs into a ridiculous caricature, but Jason's performance made Briggs a believable and realistic figure. Maybe strange, but not unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Jason's next vehicle was 'Lucky Feller', in which he played with mom's boy 'Shorty Mempstead'. Nor did he manage to make the ratings. His luck took the form of "A Sharp Intake Of Breath" by A.T.V, in which he played in the disaster area "Peter Barnes" for four series between 1977-1981. So, although it is not outstanding as such, 'Briggs' is an easy and worthwhile watch. Nice "James Bond" style melody, too!
