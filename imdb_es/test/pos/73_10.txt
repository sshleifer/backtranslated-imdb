Yes, I'm a type of romantic who likes musicals and comedy, and this fits perfectly! Julie Andrews gives a fascinating interpretation at the beginning and end of this film with the production number of "Whistling in the Dark". The number of sedative to outrageous that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that Rock Hudson has been seeing a striking dancer / dancer and will undoubtedly make you laugh. <br /> <br /> I only wish this film could be found on video or DVD, since I would surely buy it in the blink of an eye for my home library!
