This drama of two characters is extremely good and has a valid message and some moments TRULY shocking (impactful not because they are graphic, but because you are not prepared for them when they arrive). But eventually it becomes oppressive, just as the "A Pure Formality" did, something similar. However, Alan Rickman should have earned an Oscar nomination for his multidimensional performance, no doubt. (** 1/2)
