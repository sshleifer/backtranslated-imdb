This is a pretty good documentary. I'm not a skater, I do not especially like skateboarding or skateboarding culture. But somehow, for about 2 hours, this movie made me interested in the subject. <br /> <br /> I would not call it the most intriguing movie of all time, but for some reason, when those guys talked about how they started their skateboard clubs and skated in those empty pools in Southern California, I was interested. <br /> <br /> I should also add that the music in this movie was also pretty good. I do not feel like listening to more rock bands from the 70s, but I thought it was appropriate for what they were talking about.
