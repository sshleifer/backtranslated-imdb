Down Periscope is not a "great movie". But, again, very few movies are. So if you are looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom, this is a "great movie", without the capitals. No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoils this light comedy about a group of misfits who are assigned to an old submarine. They are willing to fail in their tasks so that a general can get his extra star. They must face the entire US Navy with their nuclear submarines. But they are weak and this is a comedy, so you can guess the result. But you encourage those who do not measure up and this makes for a very entertaining movie. Look and enjoy ******** (eight stars, that's it)
