Finally I saw it on video, after years of listening to it. It is by no means a perfect movie, but it is strangely hypnotic, one of those rare and special movies that creates its own world. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** First, the bad. The scenes in Burkewaite's class are unbearable. Even if the subject is social studies, this guy is way above. His speeches are so exaggerated that they are laughable. And no teacher who has had to roast his students like that, and he would say to those who protest "Shut up!" These scenes are brief, but they break the mood and take the viewer out of the story. Then how the hell did Layne just get out of the police station near the end? Also, what happened to Samson's car after the first scene of him while traveling to the city? Spend the rest of the movie being commented on by Layne or Feck. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Ahhh, Feck ... this guy is great. Dennis Hopper effortlessly steals the film. "The check is in the mail", "I love the company", "You are my friend": each line is a classic. He gives Feck an internal logic that makes the story work. Incredibly, it actually makes the audience feel empathy for this guy, especially when Samson talks about his future (Samson's). <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Crispin Glover is difficult to take sometimes. However, the scenes of him driving through the Beetle are perfect: children with cars in high school always have something to do and shoots to do it. The discreet attitude of Matt is a good complement for Layne: his friendship is credible. Glover's gestures are a little too much, but he is consistent in everything. He manages the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does, just try to imagine this movie if Layne was as zombie as Matt or Samson, snoozefest! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** What makes "River's Edge" unsettling is the fact that Samson is not really bad, in the usual sense. He's a boring guy who got tired of being taken for granted; In other words, it's like thousands of other boring types. After he kills Jamie, he starts to get rid, which creates some suspense while we wait to see when it will break again. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Part of the appeal of this movie is the way the action focuses on teens and their point of view. Parents are comical: Clarissa's mom, Tony's dad, or overwhelmed, Matt's mom. This emphasizes how children come together to get the attention that no one else pays them. He keeps the story focused on relationships within the gang and emphasizes that the only adult he can relate to is Feck. "River's Edge" is a textbook on alienation. It conveys that uncomfortable, mysterious and disconcerting adolescence is not like any other movie.
