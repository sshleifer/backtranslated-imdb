After watching John perform this one-of-a-kind show, I had to share ... It really was something to see an adult man represent himself as a child. I like the fact that with each of the characters in which he "converted", you could imagine his appearance. It is more entertaining when you can understand the individual. "Freak" is what the real "get up" should be. John is a true talent.
