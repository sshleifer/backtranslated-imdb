I would like to buy this and "Thirty Seconds Over Toyko" today if it is available. I also saw this movie after seeing big billboards by Jack Webb in his Dress Blues on the freeway at the age of 12. I always admired Jack Weeb as a type of John Wayne and American at all times. He almost became a Marine just for this movie, but he served in the Air Force, the Air Force Reserve and the Army Reserve for 32 years. I have not seen this movie on TV and I would love to have it on DVD. At least, if he were on TV, he would copy it to VHS and use it until it is available on DVD. I also have a large collection of movies from World War II and the Korean War and I always look for new versions on DVD.
