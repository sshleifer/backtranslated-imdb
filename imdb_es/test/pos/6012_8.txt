After recording five seasons on the small 1976-79 screen, 'George & Mildred' was transferred to the big screen in the mid-1980s. Instead of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke retaining their roles as writers, Dick Sharples was incorporated as the writer. Unfortunately, this adaptation of the film simply did not seem to get to the place with the audience. Shame. I liked it, better than the series itself. It was a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> 'Mildred Roper' (Yootha Joyce) is willing to determine whether her disheveled husband 'George' (Brian Murphy) has remembered his wedding anniversary or not. Obviously, he has not, but to try to convince his wife, otherwise, book a table in the restaurant where he proposed to Mildred several years ago. <br /> <br /> Upon arriving at the restaurant, they discover that The place has changed hands. Finally, seeing the lies of George, Mildred insists that they celebrate their anniversary in a luxurious hotel. Arriving at the hotel, George is mistaken for the thief 'Harry Pinto' (Stratford Johns) with a ruthless hit man, who wants a rival to be exterminated! <br /> <br /> It is not an exceptional comedy as such, but rather a good piece of fun of the same nature. The plans to revive the series after the screening of the film ended sadly when Yootha Joyce died on August 24, 1980 of alcohol poisoning. <br /> <br /> Funniest moment: George talking to his favorite garden gnome. His neighbor, Tristram, crawls behind him and says: "I think it's time we had a conversation." George, thinking that he has developed the power of speech, leaves the gnome in shock! <br /> <br /> Merry Christmas to the other IMDb users, in particular 'AdamFontaine', 'Cyril Blake' and 'TheLittleSongBird'. Have a good!
