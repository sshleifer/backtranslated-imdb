2:37 is an intense and fascinating drama that has some similarities in tone and theme with films like Bully, Elephant and Kids (although, in my view, 2:37 is a film superior to those three). see this Movie, my expectations were neutral, but I ended up taking a very good impression thanks to the intelligent script, the perfect direction of Murali K. Thalluri and the excellent performances of a group of young actors. <br /> <br /> Sporadic instances School violence around the world has inspired many films, television programs and books that seek to find and predict the external or internal reasons for those unrestrained expressions of rebellion, discontent ... and especially madness. Some people may say that 2:37 is too late for that artistic movement; however, I do not think so, because that delay allowed the film to perform a more artistic analysis, focusing on the situation with more subtlety and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish that permeated other films with similar stories. /> <br /> In the characters of 2:37, we can find clich√©s of youth cinema (from the director and screenwriter John Hughes -RIP- to the horror films for teenagers): the beautiful "princess", the clumsy "nerd" ", unfriendly athletes, etc. It would have been very easy to make them become hollow caricatures defined by their function in the script; but it is something admirable that the script transcends the stereotypes to turn them into real people with credible problems that, to a greater or lesser degree, anyone can find on their way to maturity. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is an excellent movie, whose only fault is that the end feels a bit affected, but that makes up for it with many positive elements. It will be very interesting to see the next Thalluri projects, since he had a great debut with this movie.
