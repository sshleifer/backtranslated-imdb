I loved this movie and I see it every day. I think that although the performance is not so good, it's just a group of guys that have fun with a script. I had been looking for this whole movie for almost a year, and when I found it for thirty dollars, I had to get it. Now it's by far my favorite movie of all time. It's about the failure of the relationship and, at the same time, making a joke. I loved all the parts with Don Vito, especially in which Valo asks for a grape when they are sitting on the porch, and He tells him to eat the one that is rolling on the porch. It really portrays him as he really is. The part in "Making Of" really touched me, when they tackled Brandon Novak's addiction to heroin, and how much his friends and family were trying to help him. A new movie is being produced, called "Dreamseller", which deals with the story of Novak's dreams, shattered by his addiction.
