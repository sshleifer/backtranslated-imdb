The channel I navigated beyond this many times, mainly because the synopsis sounded so corny, so "Love American Style". However, it turned out to be quite good, very well done. The two salient features are dialogue and acting. Great cast The premise is really well executed and there are not too many weak moments. I guess what amazed me most was the frequency with which you thought that the wheels were going to fall off the car, and instead, the car only blocks the turns, so to speak, and the movie is still flying. There are some nice little plots, particularly the relationship that develops between the character played by Conan's former partner Andy Richter. Also, I want to mention that the music that accompanied it was good.
