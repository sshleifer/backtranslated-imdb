For my part, I was very anxious to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I knew it was going to be another type of Revenge of the Nerds movie, I was still impressed. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of truth in the fact of this type of learning and we firmly believe that it should be allowed in a "new style of schooling". <br /> <br /> Conventional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or should know or want to know. <br /> <br /> This approach to teaching must be sought in the real academic courses. <br /> <br /> While there was still too much The scenes of the party, obviously had to be thrown there, for the sake of Hollywood making a comedy about the university ... although we all know that life is not like that no way. <br /> <br /> An incredible touch, still fun and with a killer ending. <br /> <br /> Impressive end. Crucial to the whole story and very surprising. <br /> <br /> Without the final scene, the movie would have been half as good. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie and did not have to. They have excessive amounts of insults, nudity or jokes to make it good. <br /> <br /> Great crew and cast, history and even the generic box of the obligatory "members of the Hampton fraternity" was well done. <br /> <br /> American Pie 1, 2 3 and American Wedding or any other clone that does not do so until 1/3. <br /> <br /> Much better than most comedies about the first year of college without degrading the stupid jokes to make someone throw up. <br /> <br /> I liked it, although it was simple ... it was interesting and I even had a heart ... the only thing I regret to see this movie is that it was not anymore
