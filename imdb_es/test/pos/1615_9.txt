Brett Piper again makes a very good movie that was destroyed by the so-called "experts". It is low budget, but fun, and the protagonist is very sexy. I wish I could see more of Irene Joseph. Good visual fun I bought the DVD and enjoyed it. The special effects are stop motion animation, and much better than the computer generated trash they call effects today. I always like Brett Piper movies, and if you liked this, I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and anything else I've done. I hope to see more of your work and more of Mrs. Joseph. I just can not see why this woman has not been in more movies, since her acting is excellent.
