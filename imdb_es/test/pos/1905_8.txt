Certainly, this film is not for everyone, but for anyone with a sense of humor and love for the period film. Buy this immediately! Where else can you get a fashion show from the 70s, a vocabulary from the era, prostitutes trained in karate, crime, a rap about the sinking of the Titanic, gunfights and a co-star named Queen Bee (watch her touching scene of crying from the beginning? in the guardian's office!) With a filming style that is a cross between a porn movie / Dawn of the Dead / and Car Wash, you can not go wrong. This is one to watch over and over again, after putting the children to bed.
