There's not much anyone can say about this movie ... the plan is quite simple: two police officers (who are also lovers) are using a brothel to watch over a criminal, with the help of "Lady of the house" , played by hardcore porn star Chloe. As anyone can guess, there are some twists in the plot and some blurry alliances, but the writing was horrible, even for a softcore movie. <br /> <br /> I have read some previous publications about the accent of Nicole Hilbig (plays the police). Yes, it is difficult to understand what he says sometimes, but I think I have placed it. I did some sniffing ... I think it's from Germany, hence its accent of strange sound. However, it impresses even without speaking ... it has a great looking body. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of "behind the scenes" sex scenes in this movie that were pretty graphic for a softcore movie. ... excellent work there. The three-way scene towards the end was not bad either. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> I knew the police were going to become a part-time prostitute at the end. She really enjoyed her three-way WAY. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> I will not be too worried about the story TOO, as it is a low budget. , direct to the softcore video. However, it seems that I have seen too many movies in this genre with a similar plot type. <br /> <br /> Women: B (Chloe and Hilbig were fine as goodies) Sex: B + (the scenes were a bit short, but good) Story: C (a recycled plot, but what works, huh? ?) In general: B-
