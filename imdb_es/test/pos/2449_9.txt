I feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie. Actually I came across this movie by accident. I was recording another movie on Showtime one night, during the night, and this movie appeared later. So I sat down and looked at him and boy, I was impressed. The performance is absolutely superb. Kathy Bates, who has been my favorite actress since Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes, had an amazing performance as a dominant mother desperately trying to hold on to her old school values ​​(religion, family) at the risk of alienating her family. Martin Sheen is excellent as the "hard" patriarch who really has no control over anything in his life or family. The only thing I really loved about this movie is how it says what happens when the heroes return home. It shows the real damage that is done to our soldiers after fighting in senseless wars to obtain political and financial gains. This movie simply took my breath away and I feel blessed to have recorded and seen this movie accidentally. This is a must for anyone who wants real drama, this is not too melodramatic and predicative, but it attracts their hearts like no other.
