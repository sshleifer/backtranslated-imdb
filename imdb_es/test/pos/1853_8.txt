When I saw the trailer for this film, I did not say aloud to anyone in particular: "This movie is going to be a bomb". I also said that about THE MATRIX and look what happened there. Now I'm not a box-office guru anywhere, but I usually have a good idea of ​​what's going to be good and what's really going to suck. In this case I was blinded by my complete and absolute apathy towards David Duchovney. Let me explain it to you in another way: I do not like his person (from what I read of him in interviews, he is incredibly pre-madonna and is full of himself considering that all he has done is X-Filles) or as an actor . PLAYING GOD was a really bad movie, but he left thinking that for some reason he deserved a lot of money on the big screen. But I'm happy to say that even though those things may be true about man, Return to Me is a delight and has his heart in the right place. Bonnie Hunt has directed a beautiful story and has told it with class and grace. This is one of the most romantic movies I've seen and, although it may seem a bit sad and in its premise, give it a try and you will get hooked. <br /> <br /> It has to be said (and this hurts me to do it) that the reason why this movie works so well is because of the history and the cast. Duchovney and Driver are so wonderful and credible here that I honestly wanted to cry with them. There is a particularly powerful scene when Duchovney arrives home after his wife has died and he collapses on the floor of his house. As he always does, the family dog ​​looks towards the door to wait for his wife to come walking. She does not do it and with the collar of her shirt still stained with blood, Rob (Duchovney) tells her that she will not come home, ever. . Then he calls the dog and he seems to share a scream. The dog lets out a small moan and then Rob cries. And this is one of the most realistic moments of pain I've seen in any character in any movie. You can feel her pain and at that moment I forgot that I was seeing an actor that I do not usually like, and I felt that I was seeing someone who knew that he had lost the loss of his beloved. This is something powerful. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the film is the cast of support. Bonnie Hunt has combined an ethnic melting pot of Irish and Italian characters who share a common bond. They share a pub called O'Reilley's Italian Pub. That's a delicious name for itself. And leading the diametrical scale of the cultures in conflict is Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia. These are two proud elders who love their country but love their granddaughter and niece (I think it is) respectively. And that is the character played by Minnie Driver. This scenario is conducive to comedy and Hunt does not lose anything here. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi also share some fun moments together as the middle-aged couple and Belushi gets the best points while accepting humility with grace and shows off his wide barrel of stomach for laughter. With his family consisting of three or four children, there is very little time for him and his wife to have quality time. And again Hunt handles this with perfect elegance. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful story of finding true love, knowing how fortunate you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family. Return To Me is a wonderful romance and, although I still do not feel a great admiration for David Duchovney, I must admit that he was perfect in this role and I could not imagine anyone else playing his character. He was sensitive and credible and the film was good for him, not only for him, but for his taste. <br /> <br /> If you are a fool for a good romance and you want a good cries, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10 I will see anything that Bonnie Hunt puts with her in the director's chair.
