The chemistry between Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy was incredible. They were completely convincing and genuinely nice in their roles. Imelda Staunton brilliantly played the deceitful Mrs. Sucksby. Despite the fact that she was a cowardly opportunist, it somehow made you sympathize with her in the end. Rupert Evans played the gentleman of the limo ball with pure charm and snark. He was a scene thief. The story itself was very unique, as was the way it was told. The Victorian scene in England with two main lesbian characters was intriguing and charming. There were some fantastic and unexpected twists and turns that really kept the audience involved in the story. A wonderful cast and an excellent story made this film excellent.
