There are few movies that have had me waiting and waiting for more premieres than this one. This is the last film of the group The Dead Gentlemen responsible for the original movie of Gamers and Demon Hunters. This group has not been very active in recent years, but this film is a definitive reason to try to keep pace with their activities following this progress. <br /> <br /> This movie follows a group of players trying to finish a campaign led by a general manager frustrated by his group's indifference to his story. With the help of a bit of new blood, they try the campaign again with the hope of ending this time. <br /> <br /> This film is a breath of fresh air in the film community and a great improvement over the original. The film shows respect for the game as did the original film, but on top of that, this film shows a dramatic improvement in special effects by throwing it above the simplicity of college movies. The acting is pretty decent and the jokes are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, many of the jokes are jokes, so if you're not a gamer, the movie may not be as fun as others. That's why I give the film an 8 instead of the 9 that I initially thought. In any case, if you are a player or you know the games, take a look and you will enjoy it.
