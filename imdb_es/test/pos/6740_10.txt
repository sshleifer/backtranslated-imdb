How many of us have read a book or seen a play, and then, when the movie version came out, we feel terribly disappointed? Well, maybe this is one of those movies for those who also saw the play, but as someone who never had the chance to see her on stage, this movie entertained me a lot. The characters were fun, the music was great and the story was interesting and it made you feel an authentic empathy for the characters, the flaws and everything. Jonathan Silverman has a good comical moment, and his lines are especially funny. I'm not going to give spoilers, it's just a funny and well made movie that shows the inner workings of a middle class family during World War II. So, if you never saw the play, and if you've enjoyed other Neil Simon movies, do not stop because of the couple of negative reviews that are seen here. On its own, Brighton Beach Memoirs is a GREAT movie. I guarantee it (no money back).
