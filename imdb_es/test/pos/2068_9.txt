Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet that has adorned the stage and captures every inch of the character. Each nuance and element of Hamlet is represented and well represented. Some people have complained about their age, but honestly you can not tell when you watch the movie. In any case, it seems drastically under 40 years. I only wish that a more dignified Ophelia has been found. Her acting is passable but she just does not seem the part. The only really exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, who is a great Claudio. The rest of the cast is good, but Jacobi is what really elevates this teleplay game.
