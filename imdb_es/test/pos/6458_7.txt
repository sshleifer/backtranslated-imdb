Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) appears in the shipyards of New York in search of work, but with a hidden past. He gets one on condition that he kicks back the bad-tempered crew chief Jack Warden. While there, he establishes a friendship with the black man Sydney Poitier which, unfortunately, leads to a heartbreaking moral dilemma for a man who, we know, often runs away from his problems. <br /> <br /> The film looks like Oscar the winner On the Waterfront, it feels like On the Waterfront, and most importantly, it plays in a very similar way to the Kazan production of 1954. However, its theme racial is innovative at the moment. The black Poitier and the white Cassavetes are treated as equals in all aspects. It could even be called the first of black and white "friends" photos that would later dominate so many action movies. <br /> <br /> Help the two protagonists play so well against each other. However, the central flaw of the film does not indicate why the Poitier team boss pushes a friendship with the severe Cassavetes in the first place. He really goes out of his way to make friends with the newcomer. But in reality it is never suggested why he would cross racial barriers to do so. One possible explanation is that Poitier wants to use Cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with another crew chief, Warden, but then comes to like him for real. There is a hint of that in some of the suspicious reactions of Cassavetes, but beyond that, the relationship seems unmotivated. <br /> <br /> If there is only one stage in the whole movie, I could not see it. Everything is done in the sordid place of New York, without the usual extras of the film. In that sense, it is an anti-Hollywood production, carefully dismantled even in the scene of nightclubs, which in turn seems to be a real crowd after work hours. I suppose sociologists will call this piece of raw life "a vision of the working poor." <br /> <br /> However, despite all its virtues, which are many, the film is still too close to the Brando- Kazan Film for comfort. Here, a beautiful unknown actress, Kathleen Maguire, gets the role of the redeemer, Warden, the role of the corrupt labor boss, while Cassavetes, like Brando, must suffer a beating before regaining his moral standing and doing the right thing. Still, despite the derivative nature, the dramatic urban drama retains enough original strength to merit a visit.
