This is at least very close to a perfect video publication. The messianic metal group, the rock n 'roll dinosaurs, the biggest and most influential heavy band in the world plays their hit songs and remembers the band's past. What else do we need? <br /> <br /> The video starts from "War pigs" and ends in "Paranoid" and in the middle all the biggest and most significant classics of the original line-up are included: "Funeraria electrico", "Hoja dulce", "After forever", "Iron Man", "Sons of the grave" ... and, of course, my personal favorite "Into the void", I'm glad they did not omit it. Well, how could they do it? <br /> <br /> Even so, this video is more than just music. Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward review the colorful history of the group. The only thing that bothers me a bit is when a live song is interrupted with interview fragments. For example, is it necessary to inform how the song "N.I.B." Do you have your name, right in the middle, one on top of the other? I doubt. It's still a small defect, so it's not too important. <br /> <br /> The members of the band also relax in the chairs and chat together: nice material for a Saturday fan! I admit I have a hard time following what Ozzy Osbourne mutters, but it's just fun. I had the privilege of participating when "The last supper tour" entered Finland and, personally, this video is an ideal way to remember that magnificent show.
