Empire of Passion begins in a deceptive way, that is, if you are immediately waiting for it to be a horror movie. It's like a riff in James M. Cain: The Postman Always Rings Twice, at the beginning: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is the mother of two children and a working and hardworking wife of the rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he is not around, and she is at home with the baby, young Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji), bold and energetic, comes to bring some treats for Seki ... and a little more. Soon they are sleeping together, but after he does something (let's say he "shaves"), he knows that he will find out and immediately proposes that they kill Gisaburo. They drink it, they strangle it and then they throw it down a well. Naturally, this will come back to haunt them, but it is literally, at least for them (at first, Seki, super terrified and then, later, skeptical, Toyoji), changes gear to the 'Kaidan', a story of Japanese ghosts. <Br /> <br /> This is a film in which the horror does not come simply from "oh, ghost, ah", but from the total fear that is generated for the characters. In a way, the mechanics of a black cinema work, even if it is only freely translated through a Japanese people of the 19th century instead of an American city or small city (ie, the spy police, the "evidence" possibly found by another, spread the word, arouse suspicion, etc). It's convincing because Seiko was actually against the plan from the beginning, manipulated by the lustful but ill-prepared Toyoji, and her reactions to the reappearances of Gisaburo are amazing to her. Take the one closest to the poetry: Gisaburo's ghost, his pale blue face and almost silent and chilling look, beckons to Seiko to get on the rickshaw. She does it, reluctantly, and he pushes her on a path that she does not know, in the first hours before dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories want the heavens to get this terribly atmospheric. <br /> <br /> As she begins to turn hysterical towards the end, there is so much here that director Oshima does well to make this a distinctive work. After hitting him enormously in the world of international cinema with In the Realm of the Senses (which, ironically, was banned in his own country), he did something that, according to him, was even more daring than the "senses". Maybe he was right; Empire of Passion has much less graphic content than its predecessor (also starring Tatsuya Fuji, a superbly physical actor with an immense range of scope), but his audacity lies in creating a world of terror. You can believe in the ghosts in this story, but you also have to believe to what extent these two future lovers will arrive. The sniffer detective or the gossip people are the least of their concerns: the fate of their own souls is at stake. <br /> <br /> And Oshima takes what in other hands could just be juicy flesh (unfortunately, he would not). I am surprised that there is already an American remake in the works and crafts taken after a magnificent shot, with the repetition making its way to the mis-en-scene (that is, the shots of Seiko and Toyoji walking on that road, the camera of a Dutchman) Angle, the world bowed and surrounded them with a somber blue tone, as well as some movements that would remain with me long after I finished writing this (ie, Toyoji throwing the leaves of one hand into the pit in slow motion, or how her naked body reveals itself after she becomes blind). It is daring lies in connecting to a level of the spirit, which should not be confused with the spiritual, although there may be something with that too, about life and the connections of death to each other, inextricably. It is a classic waiting to be discovered.
