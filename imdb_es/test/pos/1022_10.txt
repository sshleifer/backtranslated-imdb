I was in school in the late sixties and early seventies and this movie is very similar to my school. The school play where the main actors kiss, what happened at my school. A gang of crazy boys, my school again only when we went running across the country, we were going to smoke! 'Getting hit', someone in my school stormed through a light from heaven and broke the canes! After that they were kept in a safe! And as for certain non-bacterial activities! What can I say ... The movie came out in 1982, I remember it as it was when I bought my house and the film was being shown at the same time. If you like British films and movies about school, growth and period pieces, then this is for you. Another very similar film, 'SWALK', came out a few years earlier and, for my part, I would like to see that again, also 'Kes' is in the genre. Highly recommended (But trust me, 1982 is when it came out)
