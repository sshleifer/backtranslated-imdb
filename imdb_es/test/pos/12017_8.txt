This movie is a coveted member of my movie library. While it is not a conventional film, it is, in my opinion, a highly effective film in which Eric Roberts is totally underestimated as an actor. (I would rate him as a much better actor than his sister, Julia, who is overrated, but that's another criticism ...) Roberts plays the former reporter of bad luck with the perfect combination of narrative precision and jaded. idealism: two ingredients that are part of any effective film. Roberts' first-person narrative improves the quality of the film and keeps us guessing the real motive behind the crime. <br /> <br /> In Palm Springs, everything on the film's stage progresses slowly as it metaphorizes on the issue of oppression: Asch (Roberts) is oppressed by his past; the police are oppressed by the rich residents of Palm Springs who treat them as servants; The rich, meanwhile, are oppressed by boredom (see Johnny Depp's classic as the rich and insightful child who just wants to be loved ...); the isolation of each character is omnipresent and is enhanced by the heat and isolation of the desert. <br /> <br /> There is an audience for this movie if they are looking for a more contemporary version of black cinema. While there are elements of the movie that could have been tighter, I recommend getting a copy of this movie and placing it between The Big Sleep and Chinatown in your movie library. (The film is based on Arthur Lyons 'book, CASTLES BURNING, and if you like Roberts' performance in this one, you may want to get a copy of The Ambulance, which shows his funniest and lightest side). THE BEST LINE ON THE MOVIE: "Careful, careful with what?" I should have asked, "Only fools ignore the strange warnings of the ladies in the caravan park."
