Admittedly, Harold Lloyd's best work ended with his last major silent comedy "Speedy" in 1928. After that, he introduces sound films (such as Chaplin and Keaton and Laurel & Hardy and WC Fields) and does it better than Keaton , but not as good as the other three. Chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as a producer (but he wandered through his films so there were five years between productions). Laurel and Hardy were under the protection of Hal Roach, so the production standards of their short films and sound films were quite good. Fields worked first with Mack Sennett, then with Paramount, and then independently. Lloyd tried the route that Chaplin took, but with less success. <br /> <br /> He produced his own films, but unlike Chaplin, he did not own his own studio. Also his first two options were not good (especially "First Feet"). But he did start choosing wisely and "Movie Crazy", "The Cat's-Paw" and "The Milky Way" were all good choices. These three (and possibly "Harold Diddlebock's sin") were his best sound companies. All are entertaining, but none is up to "Safety Last", "The Freshman", "The Kid Brother" or "Speedy". <br /> <br /> Of the four best sound movies "The Cat's Paw" is the most controversial. The solution of Ezequiel Cobb to rid the city that elected him mayor is very extreme for the tastes of 2005. Or not? When a movie is made, what is political is: "The Cat's Paw" is from 1934. That second year of Roosevelt New Deal (itself quite controversial for more government involvement), the film audiences watched movies like "Gabriel Over The White House "and" The Ghost President ", where our leaders carried out extra-constitutional actions to rid the nation of internal enemies (and to force disarmament around the world). Even Cecil B. De Mille got involved in this act with "This Day and Age", where a group of teenagers use rats to force a gangster to confess their crimes. <br /> <br /> For us, the use of violence to force anyone (including a group of thugs and hairdressers like Alan Dinehart's gang) to confess that it is repellent. After all, the Supreme Court has protected us from confession under duress. What we forget is that the reforms we are thinking about did not happen until Warren Court and Burger Court made them. For example, although the opinion of Mr. Justice Sutherland in the case of Powell ("Scottsboro Boys") of 1932 guaranteed that all the accused had the right to a lawyer, Gideon v. Wainwright did not extend it to the ordination of lawyers paid by the courts until 1962. Miranda Case, with its now well-known notice of anti-incrimination, is from 1963. None of this was considered necessary in 1934. <br /> <br /> If you study other movies from the period up to 1954 (and even 1960) tricks are used to obtain confessions: Kirk Douglas confesses his crimes to witnesses in "I Walk Alone" while Burt Lancaster holds a gun. When Lancaster leaves, Douglas makes fun of having confessed under duress, only to see that the weapon is unloaded. Suddenly, he realizes that (legally, in 1948) he has confessed without coercion. I hate to say it, to any civil libertarian who reads this note, but what Cobb / Lloyd does to Dinehart and his friends in the conclusion of "The Leg of the Cat" was not only legal, but it would have led to their jail sentences in 1934 You can call it a tough, fascist or horrible hand, but it would have worked legally when you thought about it.
