I have read a lot of comments about Showtime in IMDb and many seem to fail. I have noticed that many critics call this the typical "friends" movie. De Niro is by no means Murphy's friend for most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is the reluctance of De Niro to be friends with anyone. <br /> <br /> Murphy really shines in this one. He has done what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a policeman who wants to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect since the heterosexual man who thinks that everything is stupid. I thought they both had great chemistry and they were a perfect choice for the casting. Rene Russo is also great as a television producer. Of course, he loves everything Murphy does and tries hard (along with Murhpy) to make DeNiro go too. <br /> <br /> Many critics have played the hilarious scene with William Shatner, repeating his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy and De Niro on how to "act" as cops. But, my favorite scene involves Murphy in the "confessional" in the hope that he can get a cop like Wesly Snipes instead of De Niro. Man, that was hilarious! Comedies usually depend on your personal tastes. Of course you can make holes in the plot, most of the time you can do it with a comedy. I was excited to see the couple of Murphy and De Niro ... I think he got the best of Murphy, which was nice to see him again at the top of his game. I can only imagine that it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rating 8 out of 10 stars.
