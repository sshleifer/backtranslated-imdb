You really should not compare the thriller to a colorful adventure with elements of suspense, the MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH with Hitchcock masterpieces like VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW or PSYCHO; On the other hand, it is more like funny mischiefs like FINDING A THIEF and NORTH BY THE NORTHWEST. Filmed largely in Morocco and London, the film tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose holidays are interrupted when they innocently face a murder plot, and when their son is kidnapped to be able to secure their silence . <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in their roles of the All-American couple, and the characters get an unusual twist: Stewart, a midwestern doctor, is outgoing but has a touch of " the ugly American abroad "about his personality; Day, who plays a popular theater and recording star who retired after their marriage, has a suspicious nature. These qualities of personality and background play extremely well in the story. <br /> <br /> THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH TOO contains many famous scenes; Both the scene in which Stewart is drugged the day before talking about the kidnapping and the complex sequence of Albert Hall, which involves what seem like hundreds of cuts, are very powerful. Less often noticed, although in my view if they are not more satisfying, are the more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock combines the edge of suspense along with perverse humor, as when Stewart tries to detect something in a taxidermist shop and Day Belts out "Que Sera, Sera" (written for this movie) in the most inappropriate way in an embassy cocktail. <br /> <br /> Although THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH lacks the depth and impact of Hitchcock's greatest work, it remains a nice film and One that compares very well to his work as a whole. It's Hitchcock-light, but recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
