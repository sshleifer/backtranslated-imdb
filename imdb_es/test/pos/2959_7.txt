The Lone Ranger & Fool set out to bring to justice a gang of hooded assailants who have killed three Indians for what seems to be no apparent reason ... that is until the Lone Ranger discovers a conversation with the Indian chief Tomache that each Man had a medallion. The five medallions that Tomache gave to his friends as gifts that we later learn when combined will provide the brain behind the hooded assailants with a map of a legendary city of lost gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the two remaining individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded assailants take him by the hand? Is there really a city of gold lost somewhere in the native land? <br /> <br /> Upon seeing this, I kept knowing what was going to happen in advance and everything seemed very familiar until I finally realized that I had seen exactly the same movie when I was just a child ... suddenly The memories came back and I remembered having a very fun time as a child enjoying this with a group of friends. However, as an adult, the plot is somewhat predictable, but you know it, although it is not in the same category as the 1956 film, it is still very fun to watch. Clayton Moore is perfect as Lone Ranger and Jay Silverwheels, as Tonto steals much of this movie, as he is probably in more action scenes than even in the Lone Ranger. There are some well-known faces among which include Douglas Kennedy as Ross Brady, the gang leader Hooded Raiders, Charles Watts as an intolerant Sheriff and Ralph Moody as a kind Father.
