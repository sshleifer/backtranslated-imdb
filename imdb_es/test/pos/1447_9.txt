If you like your movies to take away your emotions, if you like your movies with a guy you can encourage and relate to, if you like your films in black and white, you have to see this movie! Look at it from beginning to end, because you do not want to miss the rhythm. Sometimes it's slow, and it makes you wonder when something will happen, then when the plot begins to unfold, you'll be on the edge of your seat! I know it was! My mother told me about this movie, since our family had some of the same things as the movie. We love Frankie, who plays the convincing role. Regardless of what you think about Frank Sinatra, leave that aside, in the movie, he is thin and does not sing, so keep an open mind. By the time it was made, it tells a story that is still told today in homes across the country and, possibly, the world. Please, look, if you like old movies, try this one.
