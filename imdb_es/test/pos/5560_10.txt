Farscape is the best science fiction show period, for one main reason, everything the show tries, it does very well. From a technical point of view, the music is original and is perfectly adapted to the show. The special effects are abundance and quality higher than anything else you will see on your television. The performance is also excellent, too many shows today use only the American market of actors for their shows. Remember the first time you saw The Matrix and you said, wow, where did Agent Smith come from? It's the same feeling you have when you see Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tupu, Virginia Hey, and especially Wayne Pygram. These Australians are great and appear in this great show. <br /> <br /> The plot is unsurpassed. The next closest thing I can think of is Babylon 5 during shadow war episodes, but this goes beyond that. It is a real pleasure to be able to see all the episodes sequentially, the complexities of the interpersonal relationships of the characters are well written and executed. The general plot is both original and completely entertaining. I'm always looking forward to the next program. <br /> <br /> The comic episodes are funny, the dramatic episodes are touching and the action sequences are tense. The start of the second season had some great comedy episodes that made me laugh out loud, something that rarely happens while watching television that is not South Park, Sealab 2021 or Seinfeld. The drama is even more difficult, whether Crichton is with his mother or the characters face their mortality, everything is done with heart and intensity. Finally, it goes without saying that the action is the maximum. This is science fiction. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of science fiction in the least, if you enjoy a good television, if you like a good serialized plot, you deserve to see Farscape. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Ben Browder has.
