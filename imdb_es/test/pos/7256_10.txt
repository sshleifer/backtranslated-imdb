Plunkett & Macleane falls into my favorite film genre (historical action adventure with comedy), and is probably the reason why I rate it so much. <br /> <br /> The action centers around a man on the road (Plunkett) and a "gentleman". that is entangled with him and his plans (Macleane). This leads to all kinds of adventures and adventures that are tinged with comedy. There is also, of course, a love interest. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is made up of a series of vibrant characters, larger than life, which add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the rich at this time. <br /> <br /> This is a nice movie with a fairly simple plot that is worthwhile and offers a lot of entertainment.
