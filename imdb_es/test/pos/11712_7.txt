Burt Reynolds directed this action movie and (surprise!) He is actually a good director. This movie starts well when Burt's attempted bust of a drug dealer is flawed, and he is demoted to the vice squad. The ensemble cast has some pretty funny scenes, since Brian Kieth is always eating something, Bernie Casey has more class than all his co-workers combined, and Charles Durning loses control of his squad. <br /> <br /> The vice presidents stumble upon a high-priced call-ring that may have something to do with a series of murders. Sharkey spends days watching Dominoe's apartment (Rachel Ward), and begins to worship her from afar. <br /> <br /> Just as they are approaching the crime leader, Dominoe is killed. I will not reveal any of the surprises in the plot, but the first hour of this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script becomes very clich√© and incredible after that. <br /> <br /> Why would Burt Reynolds confront the crime boss with his big secret? Of course it makes the boy sweat, but he has many more policemen killed. And it is not credible that Dominoe and Sharkey make love after they meet for a day, let alone while their lives are in danger. And in the end, what happened to all the police who run into the building with our heroes? Is not there a SWAT team? Also, the movie never tells you how all the bad guys are connected and why they have to kill so many people. <br /> <br /> There is a very effective torture scene on a ship near the end of the movie, which is probably the only really scathing scene in the movie. It's a pity that the climax is a typical shooting. Still, this movie is certainly entertaining if you like crime and action movies. Do not think about the holes in the plot, and you will have a good time.
