Although I saw this film dubbed in French, I'm sure it lost something in the translation, the lack of an accent, etc., It was an excellent and fun movie for a lonely night in a hotel room: a real choice. -I suppose that she accurately and positively portrayed the complexities of individual sexuality, the role of gender and the search for a place within the communities to which it is supposed to belong: man, gay, urban, 30-ish, etc. I was very proud of the French Television to show such an honest and positive portrait of the gay community. While the fact that the main gay character ends up being something "direct" in the end is a bit disappointing, that's life, and that happens sometimes. This is a great movie, either alone or with a date! A really nice experience.
