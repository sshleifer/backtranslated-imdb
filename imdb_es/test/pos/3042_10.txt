I saw this movie on television in the UK about 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. Recently, my interest has been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head, the next island of "Yamacraw" (actually, Daufuskie), and reading the excellent "Water is Wide" by Pat Conroy. With the benefit of knowledge, I have re-evaluated Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film gives life to the book with a certain precision, a rarity of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Three things still surprise me with this story: 1. The problems of educating the poor and marginalized and being inclusive remain the same. 2. Education is more than reading and writing. 3 .. These children were my companions, I was 6 years old in 1969 when Pat Conroy spent his year in Daufuskie. <br /> <br /> Why this has not yet reached the DVD?
