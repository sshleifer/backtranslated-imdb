"The missing star", which competed for the Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Film Festival, is a film that, when you think about it, the first adjective that comes to your mind is: intense. Intense appearances, intense sequences, the intensity of this film captures the viewer from the first scenes in the steel factory, in Italy (could not recognize the city, maybe Genoa or even Naples), although the pace is quite slow. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Buonavolont√†, the male protagonist, and with him, the entire public, sees a completely different China than what a normal Westerner imagines: horrible high-rise building with about 800 flat owners inside, skyscrapers, desolation, fog, scrapers and cranes everywhere, but also the beauty of the Yangtze Kiang River, which will soon become a large lake due to the controversial dam that will erase many cities. China is a country under construction, but under all these colossal public works, there are still laws of poverty, backwardness and unfairness. <br /> <br /> We can relate more easily to this story because Gianni Amelio, the expert director, chose two phenomenal tracks: Sergio Castellitto, a well-known actor in Italy, and the Chinese surprise Tai Ling, a totally unknown girl who offers an interpretation as intense as that of Castellitto. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect, There are some flaws here and there, but that does not mean it's a mediocre movie.
