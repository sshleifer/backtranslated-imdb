My daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my login ... but I want to add some words. <br /> <br />? National Velvet 'was one of my two favorite movies as a child. (The other one is' The Wizard of Oz ??). The cinematography, the acting, the script and the music came together in a drama so wonderful that it can still bring tears to my tired eyes. Based on a book by Enid Bagnold, the script followed the book quite well. The characters are very well created. It is easy to become emotionally involved with the whole family and the picturesque Irish village in which they live. The premise ... a complete stranger believes in her horse and in herself enough to test the best horse race in the world ... is inspiring for any young person, especially a young woman in the 40s ... a moment in which girls were sometimes ignored as human beings and much less athletes. You should be terribly hard not to appreciate its merit. <br /> <br /> But the perspective that I appreciated most about this film is the total innocence of its moral message. It's almost magical how the 'mom and apple pie' movies were back then. The IMDB critic surprised me a lot and asked me: "Was the world really so confident?" and then proceeded to reprimand the director for his complacency regarding the "unformatted" overnight trips with the two main characters. My answer to your question is an unequivocal yes! The world of the movie was to trust the 40s. <br /> <br /> My grandparents remember taking my mother to this film when it was released. Then my mother took me to see him when I was young, and my daughter was lucky to be born at a time when she could watch it repeatedly on a videotape. Now we have it on DVD. It has been a family favorite for generations, though generations of horse lovers. It was never about sex ... it's about coming of age! It is about believing in yourself and working hard to achieve your goals. Also, so outdated that it was not even the cash prize! It's about the girl who understood that her horse had what it took to be the best. And yes, the director was really worried about the lack of physical development of Elizabeth Taylor because the book highlighted that Velvet Brown (the character of Liz Taylor) had to cut her hair and tie her chest so she could become a rider when she went to the Grand National Steeplechase. This was a unique sport for men back then ... I think that only 12 women have competed in this race. It's almost insulting that someone bothers to think about Lolita about this particular movie ... besides, anyone who had anything to do with a teenager and her horse would know that the only thing they would think about with stars in their eyes is four hooves and a tail. <br /> <br /> And now, for a lot of trivia ... the trick was done by the now famous "Horse Whisperer", Monty Roberts. I think he is mentioned for his participation in the movie credits. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 out of 10! I never tire of seeing him again.
