Those who do not like this movie seem to think that a loved one somehow "belongs" to them and should be discarded if they leave with another person. Fortunately, human nature is much deeper than that; Loving someone deeply inevitably leads to suffering, even if we are fortunate only because of his death. <br /> <br /> This film is true on the stage, atmosphere and dialogue of Nigel Balchin's original novel ('A Way Through The Wood'), and by pointing to a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the silent despair that it hides behind many apparently idyllic lives (and the description of life in the countryside of the English upper class is very precise). <br /> <br /> I loved the movie and I hope it appears soon as a DVD compatible with the UK
