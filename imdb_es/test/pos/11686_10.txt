As a kind of guilty indulgence today, this used to be mandatory when I was in high school. It really is a great illumination of the burgeoning punk scene in Los Angeles in 1980. While the bands play, Spheeris prints the lyrics in subtitles, which is necessary if one really wants to know what is screaming in the microphone. But it also converts the POV of the camera into that of a tourist, passing through this strange world. The interviews of the band reveal an honest approach to music that really does not exist anymore. On the other hand, it is not as easy to get by the closet of the old church for $ 16 / month as Chavez of Black Flag does. How many unheard bands do you know who are not trying like the imbeciles to get a recording contract? These guys just did not care. And who can not love the comment of the little French guy who used to be the "singer" of the Catholic Discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His harsh voice offers one of the best soliloquies ever filmed in the film: "I have excellent news for the world ... there is no such thing as the New Wave". Phew! What a relief!
