This movie was in a dusty pile of videos in my house for centuries before we saw it. We knew he was there, every time someone wanted to see a movie, it was suggested. It almost became a joke ... "I know, let's see Throw Momma from the Train" ... I do not know why it was always rejected, it just was. Little did we know what we were missing. It still amazes me why it took us so long ... I mean it's starring Danny DeVito, Billy Crystal and Ann Ramsy (whom we call "The Lady of the Goonies"), a star cast that should have appealed. everyone in my house But there he sat for almost ten years. Until one day it was suggested and we could not refuse it more ... <br /> <br /> It was like finding the tomb of King Tut ... <br /> <br /> No movie has ever made me laugh so hard , and I doubt that any movie will ever do it. I had to rewind on almost every line because I was still laughing at the line that came before and I lost the ability to listen or pay attention. Not just simple laughter, either ... the kind of laugh that spends more energy than running ten miles in the cold. The kind of laughter that you can not control, that makes you spin and spasm, and tears and snot run down your face because it's so weird. Once I learned the movie by heart, I'll say that this effect has diminished, but I do not think I'm tired of seeing it and finding new peculiarities to appreciate. I think that's all I can say. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you do not enjoy it, do not let me know, I will probably be offended.
