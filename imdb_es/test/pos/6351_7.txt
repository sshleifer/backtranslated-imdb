A moving love story that recalls "In the Mood for Love." Based largely on Chinese poetry and the way Orientals use it to communicate with each other, the story centers on a school teacher who wants to be both a model teacher and a good husband and father. A senior student feels very attracted to him. As the story unfolds, we see the emotions beneath the surface in his 20-year marriage and how he deals with the moral dilemmas he faces. A beautiful and moving story.
