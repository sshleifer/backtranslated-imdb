I was surprised at how good this German version of films like Scream was. Overcoming all modern American efforts in slasher movies. <br /> <br /> It's like what all those movies do not do. Nice characters, genuine mystery, suspense, graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This elegant horror movie is one of the best of its kind that has been released in years. German cinema is getting stronger and stronger. It's a pity that more people are not going to see those movies because they're losing. It's easily available on DVD, so even if you hate the subtitles, I think you should see it. It will be one of the best horror movies you'll see throughout the year.
