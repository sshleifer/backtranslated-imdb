Of course, seeing a few booming mics does not mean anything, right? Sir, Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin really put this together, right? I laughed a lot, as it often happens in this kind of movies, but I do not know what I'm supposed to laugh at because I laughed at so many other things. I am not saying that the movie was bad, but I will say that a little more editing would have done wonders. I'm a big fan of Blaxploitation, so I do not think it was horrible, but I know that "The Human Tornado" was several times better than this. I think those who can survive this movie might need a Colt 45 or two later. I mean, it really helps you not to notice the increase in microphones when you look at it again.
