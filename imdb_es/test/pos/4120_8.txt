Almost all commentators have mentioned how some of the images in the interview overlap the images of the concert in some places. This is true, and it is the biggest flaw of this movie. However, it is not so frequent, or so bad, that one can not see this video. If you're a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. In addition to having seen Black Sabbath in the seventies and early eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headed OZZfest as in this video. The concert was amazing, and very similar to this one, that's why I rented it in the first place. It's just the best geezer-rock there is. Check it out.
