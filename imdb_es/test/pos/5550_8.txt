Stepping on the water is a very beautiful movie. I would put it directly under the wonderful short movie: Beautiful Thing by Fiona MacKenzie. It is not just about leaving, but also tolerance and acceptance in general. I really want to see more of Laurel Himmel's work in the future. The actors, Angie Redman and Nina Landey are pretty good. The relationship of the main characters could have been strengthened a bit, as we understand that there is a very strong link between them, but perhaps this could have been explained a bit. I'm surprised that Angie Redman does not appear much in other films. As a great first step as director of Laurel Himmel, I am sure there is more to do with her abilities.
