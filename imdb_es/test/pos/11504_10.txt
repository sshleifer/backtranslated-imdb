If this film is not selected at least for an Oscar nominee for the best foreign film, I will stop waking up at night watching the event. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson has shown that money is not the key to making a good movie, but originality. From a cold country comes a warm but provocative film of a mentally ill man and his fight against a demented world. After a vision like this, you question whether the man is crazy or the world in which he lives.
