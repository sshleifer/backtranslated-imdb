I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie as a preview in my local theater. <br /> <br /> We've all seen this plot before (Top Gun, GI Jane, an officer and a gentleman) but a good script still works. This story is basically about training a Coast Guard rescue team with a couple of story lines. Kevin Costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader, Ben Randall, who is forced to lead the training team after a tough mission. The film takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both Costner and Jake Fischer, played by Ashton Kutcher. I am pleased to say that Ashton is great in this part. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what will come long before it arrives. However, the use of humor, the exploration of the hardness of training and the fun of watching Ben Randall "do his thing as a coach", kept me enthralled and entertained. I really enjoy watching a movie that makes the whole audience laugh out loud, gasps here and there, and claps at the end as a tribute to the movie. <br /> <br /> We all had a good time (despite a couple of difficult moments in the movie) and, I think, you will too.
