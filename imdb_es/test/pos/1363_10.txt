In short, there are two parts of this series that made me cry until my eyes dropped. First: The part where I was ready to wash the toilet, but ended up drinking the water from the toilet while imagining it was the hot director who was giving him a golden shower! (I laughed so much!) <br /> <br /> Second: The part where he tried to prove himself worthy of a swimming school instructor. He looked like a diving professional, but as expected, he could not swim (at least ^^). However, the funny part of this was when he finally came to the end and said "how was that" or something like that. That was very funny, I could not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this anime series, I recommend it. One of the best I've seen. <br /> <br /> Definitely the most fun!
