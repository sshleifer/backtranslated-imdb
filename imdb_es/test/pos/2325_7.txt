This is a VERY underestimated movie to say the least. As noted in previous publications, this movie has a somewhat lame and highly unlikely script, but you find yourself saying "Who cares?" while shooting milk (or insert the drink of your choice here) through the nose. In fact, it was due to a rare mix of actors in sync. While Kelsey Grammar is obviously a talented actor (reference 'Frasier', this film), supporting actors / actresses play their roles quite well. I found it interesting how they threw in the part about Duane Martin blowing the shot in the 'great game' for the Navy basketball team; If any of you are a basketball fan, you will remember Martin from 'White Men Can not Jump' and 'Above the Edge' and you will know that Martin had a short NBA season with the Knicks. Nice how they launched into credible character attributes like this. The anal-retentive character of Rob Schneider was the perfect complement to the calm attitude of grammar. Lauren Holly played hard enough to make you want her to succeed. This is a movie that will make you laugh even if you've seen it many times before ... the comic bits of this movie definitely last. I still find myself laughing 12 years later. <br /> <br /> "Is that one of my hens?" "Uhhh ... no, this is a parrot ... from the Caribbean." "Well, do not let it fly ... that's dinner." "Arrrrr ..... arr."
