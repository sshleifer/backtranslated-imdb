I know that this movie has had a rough ride from the critics, but I must say that I enjoyed it a lot. The real star here is the fantastic Dylan Moran. He never ceases to be funny and convincing in all his varied costumes. He also manages to radiate a sweet charm that hides his scandalous prowess. Special mention must also go to Michael Gambon, who plays to laugh with a Dublin accent inside Dublin, bright and precise. The only weak link is Caine, who, although obviously has a great laugh, plays the least interesting and least sympathetic character. It probably does not play so well abroad but it's worth watching anyway.
