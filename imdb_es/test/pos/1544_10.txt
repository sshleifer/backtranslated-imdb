This is one of those classic made in the United States for TV movies that are made to watch on a rainy afternoon. Although the script is highly implausible, it is never taken too seriously nor does the cast that leads to a mystery / horror movie that is enjoyed with a bag of popcorn or a box of chocolates. A great advantage of this movie is the fantastic location of the filming and, despite the strange events and even the strangest residents that surround Lake Tommahawk, one would not mind living there! and again
