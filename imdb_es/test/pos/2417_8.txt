This is the 4th film of the Karate Kid series. However, it has nothing to do with the previous one. 3. The only remaining character is Mr. Myagi. On this occasion, Mr. Myagi meets the teenager Julie Pierce (Hliary Swank, before she was famous) Julie has all kinds of problems, including being harassed at school by a boy, belonging to a pseudo military club in the campus. Naturally, she is trained to fight. Anyway, through Myagi, Julie learns Karate and becomes a better person spiritually and learns to respect herself and in the end regains her respect. I like the unique idea that the antagonist is a woman and that he has a man as his enemy. There are also some fight scenes that are done quite well, very discreet and with minimal violence. None of the struggle is graphic. the end is also good and a little surprising. It is predictable but it is not a typical ending for this type of movie. The film has echoes of the original, obviously, especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons learned. It is not as good as the first movement is to say, and certainly not as good as the 2nd. However, it is a big step forward compared to the disappointing third entry. This is a very entertaining dog movie that is suitable for the whole family. 8/10
