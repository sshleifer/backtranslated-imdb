Fulci is one of my favorite Italian splatters directors of all time. He is also a very good storyteller who mixes horror, supernatural and psychedelic themes together. This movie was really his last great story before he directed disappointments like "Voices From Beyond". The story is simple, as interpreted by Fulci, a horror director. After years of filming splashed and bloody movies, it seems that Fulci begins to suffer a collapse in which he begins to hallucinate about the murder of people. He decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes things worse when he convinces Fulci that he is killing people. <br /> <br /> Fulci used bloody scenes from several photographs at the same time. These movies I do not think he directed, but he certainly produced. Some of those films are "Massacre" directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground), "Touch of Death" directed by Fulci, "The Murders Secret" and I can not remember the rest of the films. <br /> <br /> Nightmare Concert is a very underestimated movie, even by Fulci fans. But I loved this movie and I've seen it many times already. It's sad that Fulci did not have the opportunity to direct anything worthwhile after this, however, this is a great movie and I recommend it to any Fulci fan, like it or not. 9/10 stars
