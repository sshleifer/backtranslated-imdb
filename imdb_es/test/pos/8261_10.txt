Let me know of any version of Precious Bane or Gone to Earth in video that people can know. I love Mary Webb's books with all my heart and would be very grateful to have any information on VHS or DVD. <br /> <br /> I have read Precious Bane and Gone to Earth, which are my favorites from Mary Webb, Many times, and have collected other novels for her as well. I was lucky to have found his poetry and essays "Springs of Joy", but I have never been able to see the version of Precious Bane that was in Masterpiece Theater, or the full version of Gone to Earth, although there was a American movie. The classic broadcast of The Wild Heart, which was a fragmented version of the original Gone to Earth movie. <br /> <br /> If someone can help me get copies of one or both of these movies (full versions), I would be very grateful!
