The film does not take itself seriously, and if you follow its example, you'll have a lot of fun (as long as you do not mind that your murders are really bloody and that your horror is covered in extra cheese). <br /> <br /> This movie makes a nod to all horror fans, and then gives them the finger. He knows that he sucks, and because of that, he is by far the best in the "Child's Play" series. <br /> <br /> Increase the angle of the "hunched mood" so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing at it, but WITH IT. And, trust me, all the time you're laughing, it's laughing in your mind again. <br /> <br />
