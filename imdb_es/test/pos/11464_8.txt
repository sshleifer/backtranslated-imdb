Night of the Demons is a great movie and an excellent example of how good the low budget can be. Sure, a lot of that is pretty predictable, but somehow it's a lot more fun than the crap we see these days as "Horror." I give the gore a solid 9, and the Demon phrases are really funny. I'm still scared by "Stop looking at me!" The soundtrack is well done, I was surprised to hear "Stigmata Martyr" from Bauhaus! There are also some very good T & As on display, as well as some Hella makeup effects. The second movie in the series is also pretty good, but avoid the third lower one. The Night of the Demons can be dated, dark and inexpensive, but it still has a lot of potential. Definitely worth renting at least. Give him a chance tonight, stay away from any old makeup! (You'll understand when you see it!)
