This surprised me. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews in advance that rated it as a good B grade movie and I was prepared for the worst. Halfway there, I suddenly realized that I was completely involved in it and enjoyed it very much. There were some really tense moments in which you sat forward, nervously fiddling with the remote control or with any other object within reach. In general, this film definitely does not deserve the grade B label. <br /> <br /> Credit must be given to the Director, Gary Ellis and the writers, Bill Boatman and Todd King for their film debut. I hope these guys continue with bigger budgets and some study support.
