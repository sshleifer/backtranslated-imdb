"Classe tous risques" feels like the grandfather of "The Sopranos" mixing the criminal with the domestic, and the film of friends to feel as contemporary as "Reservoir Dogs." <br /> <br /> Even when these gangsters are lovingly entangled with wives, children, lovers and parents, they are coldly ruthless, and they constantly remind us that yes, it does not matter in what warm situation we also see them. They can smooth a child's hair and then shoot a threat in cold blood. The key is loyalty, and male camaraderie is transmitted beautifully, without ethnic or class stereotypes, even as their network of past obligations and rewards is reduced to suspicion and paranoia, since the old gang is in several stages of probation, withdrawal and exit. Deposit or new less profitable companies. An intense accusation is to send a stranger to perform an old escape scenario. It is a high point of emotion when a wife is told that it is not she with whom the gangster is a friend, while practically the only time we listen to music on the soundtrack is when he remembers his wife. <br /> <br /> The cityscapes in Italy and France are marvelously used, in the light of day to the dark waters and the freeways, from the opening of a couple of shameless thieves, traveling with the wife and two children . The rugged and rugged Lino Ventura immediately captures the screen as the criminal father. And the second bully is clearly a casual presence in their lives, as they smoothly coordinate theft and escape, in cars, buses, boats and motorcycles, in an easy tandem.

The program notes explained that the title refers to a type of insurance policy and it is "tourist class".
