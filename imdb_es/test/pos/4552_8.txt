Well, the day that Rob Schneider immerses himself even more in the black hole of notoriously bad films when starring in the "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" absolutely unwanted in all aspects (hmmmm ... there was no movie called Roadtrip , which was followed by a sequel called Eurotrip? And now there's Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo followed by the sequel Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo ....... I smell a pattern .. Maybe soon there's Spiderman: European websites are more popular ..... or not) I am writing about this film so defamed (at the time of release). I was one of those evil people, I must admit. I turned my head up even when Chris Farley popped the cocaine through his nose and the SNL cast had one of the worst seasons of its history in '94 -'95, despite Norm McDonald's rule. Movies like Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep were published in the two years after this period and we realized that there was a dark future for the caliber of the Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler movies. However, I saw this movie the other day, ten years later and 8 years after Chris died and I could not stop laughing. Yes, it is not particularly sophisticated. Farley does what Farley does (not unlike Manny who is Manny) but his motivational announcer "Van Down By the River" in which he laments that he can not "wash enough" or "wear clothes that fit him" or "using deodorant more more than twice a week" translates well here as the character who is always modest and realizes that he is not the brightest, or the most handsome, and that he could lose a few pounds. " Anyway, he's doing everything he can to do what he's supposed to do, and David Spade just takes off the sneak snips like he did for "Spade's Hollywood Minute" and basically affects Farley's self-esteem. I love that scene in which Farley catches Spade whipping his monkey and then makes a couple of jokes about it, I can not remember what the first one is, but the second one is lying in his hotel beds and Farley says to Spade: "Do you like baseball?" Spade murmured to something inaudible in response and Farley says, "the YANK-ees of New York?" Anyway, Farley makes his clumsiness, awkward, painfully sensitive, frat boy. If you like it, you like it. I could not stop laughing.
