"The China Syndrome" released a series of films about the potentially devastating effects of an inadequate use of nuclear energy, a black cloud of paranoia that would hang over the United States for much of the Reagan years. It is a well-made and effective drama, given an extra blow by its high-powered stars, especially Jack Lemmon, who plays a high-ranking nuclear power plant official who suffers a crisis of conscience. But one can not help thinking that it was the fortuitous moment of the nuclear accident of Three Mile Island that occurred just a couple of weeks after the release of this film that gave it its lasting appeal as a classic of the 70s. As visible as it is It is certainly not a classic. <br /> <br /> With a redhead Jane Fonda as a reporter and a bearded Michael Douglas as his cameraman (and the producer of the movie, by the way). <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
