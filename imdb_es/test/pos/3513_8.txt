I've been waiting for almost 25 years to see this hard-to-find horror thriller and finally I did, since it's the right rebirth on DVD. Of course, it did not have the same impact on me as it did in the 1980s, but director Lieberman (his movie "Squirm" is excellent) makes good use of Oregon's lovely location and takes time to develop the characters, not just to be sent creatively. A high note, the whistle of Brad Fiedel's music is really creepy and adds to the desolate procedures that make this great fun for fans of the genre. A must if you like horror movies underestimated. To describe it, it would be a clever "Friday the 13th" peppered with some tasty fragments of "Deliverance". Leaving that aside, there are some really cool and great moments like my favorite when a couple is swimming in a lake and the boy disappears underwater to make a trap for his girl. Just when you think it's the usual fear, suddenly look towards the shore. and ... honestly I can not spoil it, you just have to take care of it for yourself. Also, is the end only one of those that must be seen to be believed? It came out of nowhere and is weird and wild! The DVD includes comments from Lieberman.
