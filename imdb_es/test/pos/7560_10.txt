This film moved me so much that in 1981, I returned to the theater four times to see it again! Something I've never done for another movie. No film evokes the feelings of growing up in the 60s as Four Friends. That it resembled my own experiences in the 60s is probably something that many will share. Jodi Thelen is radiantly beautiful and unforgettable! I will never know why he did not become an important star after this. The performance of the entire cast is impeccable as is the script of Steve Tisch. I always wanted to know how much of the story was autobiographical. But, unfortunately, Steve is no longer here to answer that question. I've almost worn out my VHS copy of this great movie! Highly recommended!
