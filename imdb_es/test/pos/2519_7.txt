As much as 'The Beginning' showed that we are still going to get "classic" files, Drive showed that the X files were going to explore a new territory. They start giving us a unique advance to Drive, with the images from the news camera. It was an interesting transition from TV to real events. I would have liked it even more if they had kept the camera of the news images throughout the teaser and had not cut the inside of the car. Seeing this episode live in 1998, I thought: "Am I on the right channel?" That first autopsy of Scully flooded me with great words that I do not understand. I think she learned her lesson to ALWAYS wear a mask before performing an autopsy. Silly Scully! What is the treatment with lighting in the autopsy laboratory? It's as dark as a grave there! How are they supposed to see what they are doing there? The assistant director Kersh has his first lines in this episode. I do not have lost love for that man. He is the third recurring character in a row that is presented that you love to hate, the first two are Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender. I guess the producers felt that there was a lot of love for Mulder, Scully and Skinner. So they needed to add some characters to cause pain to our favorite agents and incite our anger as fans. I love the quarantine suits that Scully and her team use with helmet bulbs. Boy. It is very humid or foggy in the dry north of Nevada at night. Can we say the word "effect"? Drive is a great episode, but by looking at Route 36 in my USA atlas. UU., There is no way that Mulder has maintained a speed of 70 to 100 miles per hour on that highway. If I had been on I-80, the highway, maybe. But in no way on a state highway with so many curves. All the filming inside the car seemed very authentic. Excellent work by Rob Bowman. It does not look like the old days of the obvious blue screen or the clip of a stage that passes through the window of a car on a stage. This was a funny episode, but some of the inaccuracies prevent it from being a great episode. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, so grab for a quick trip!
