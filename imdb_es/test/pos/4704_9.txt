This is truly a love documentary about a fascinating character, his vision of life and his extended family. The filmmakers spent three years recording Sister Helen at their home halfway and managed to capture so much wonderful material that she can not help but feel that she knows Sister Helen and her "boys". The house has 21 recovering addicts, each with a story almost as encompassing as Sister Helen's. The final scenes are particularly emotional and enveloping. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen's story about marriage, addiction and loss reveals that a very complex character who has a hard love is at all times fun, touching and endearing. <br /> <br /> The film is amazing in the way it tells its story in wonderful sequences of life sequences that become a story that is almost as clear as if each scene was written and performed by the best. The honesty (and obvious dishonesty) of the "clients" is very significant as he learns from his fears and observes his attempts to grow. <br /> <br /> You will never forget Sister Helen, Robert, Moe or poor Ashish (spelling?).
