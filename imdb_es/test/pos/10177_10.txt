This movie was so comforting. A true testimony of a real life of the actors, daily ups and downs. It was really a wonderful experience to share the actor's passion in the film and the respect for what should have come out of the screen. This movie is a reminder for everyone to go for their dreams! Never give up! Hurray for The Stand -in !!!
