I have done many international trips, both for business and for tourism. For both types I assure you that the best advice is also the oldest one: always drink the country's wine. In this film, the archangel Michael comes to Earth for business, wraps it up quickly and decides to stay for a small tour. Boy! Does he "drink the wine of the country"? <br /> <br /> Could the man be drunk forever with liquor, love and fights? <br /> <br /> I would struggle to get up in the morning and life would go to bed at night. <br /> <br /> These are things you can not do in Heaven, so he enjoys them while he is here! Of course, it turns out that I had a couple of other jobs to tackle and, if it's less direct about them than about the first, it's just as successful. The final scene is a bit clumsy, but it is also wonderful. Jean Stapleton arrives to dance with John Travolta.
