Man, I really enjoyed this, if only because of Fred Willard's comment at the dog show. There are some dead spots and some gags that do not work, but in general the movie works very well. When I was younger, my parents raised dogs and the people I met in those shows were not much less strange than the monsters of this show, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie for its art and for its comment on how we tend to take frivolous things too seriously ... I enjoyed the performance for its precision (most of the accents were impeccable) and its subtlety (I loved the way each person walked their dogs) ... <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you have any appreciation for the strangeness of human existence.
