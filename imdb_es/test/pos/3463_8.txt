It's rare that I have the opportunity to review a movie for IMDb that relates to my own life so closely. However, as someone who lives with cerebral palsy (although less severe than Michael, one of the film's main characters) I do not want to give this movie a "free pass" just because it addresses a subject that is rarely addressed; and when it is, it is usually treated seriously. There were minor problems I had with the movie; And I would like to address them first, so that people are clear that it is not my situation that has clouded my opinion about this excellent film in general! <br /> <br /> * Parts of that I felt were blatantly pleasing to the crowd, at the expense of realism. If I had one pound for every time a well-meaning member of the public mentioned power wheelchair races, it would be much richer; but speaking personally, that fits more with the public perception of how we deal with our disadvantages, rather than the reality of what actually happens. The same goes for the time spent watching disabled people go to the pub; It is not a big problem for those who really do it, but it can be admirable for external observers. I appreciate that this is from the previously protected perspective of Miguel; but I still think he would concentrate more on enjoying the experience, instead of reflecting on how important it was that he was really there in the first place. As such, the amount of time we spent seeing them had a bit of fun. <br /> <br /> * I felt that the terminal nature of Rory's disease came to our attention too late; which means that it was only used as a cheap sentimental device to interpose between the pair, instead of something that everyone knew he was going to have to deal with. <br /> <br /> To balance those criticisms, I have to answer. a lot of praise, too. Although I thought that some scenes that showed that they had become accustomed to normal life were exaggerated; The script also ventured into some difficult places that I would not have expected, and has a lot of credit for doing it. For example, raising the theme of love and relationships; and show the daily apparatus that is often used to help and assist the lives of people who are not capable. In addition, despite the overwhelming tactical emotional shock of death that is coming, the film as a whole is much less boring than anyone has the right to expect such films to be. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker can and has been performing variations of her role on the autopilot for what seem like years; but Robertson and McAvoy share a special interaction that must be taken into account. On the inside, I'm doing cartwheels that a group of people somewhere has finally made a movie doing justice to the lust for the lives of many disabled people.
