A very suspenseful giallo from the director of "L'Anticristo" (1974), this one begins with a brilliant sequence that involves a priest, a girl and a broken doll. However, the main story is about the maniac (David Warbeck) marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money. The plot, although it is not original, is really exciting, the acting is good and there are several skillful and bloody murders. The score of Francesco de Massi is quite effective, some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's "The New York Ripper" (1982). Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!
