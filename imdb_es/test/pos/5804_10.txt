Madonna has been rocking the boat for more than 20 years, and with that comes a lot of experience - obviously - and a lot of knowledge. She was never the only one to think about yesterday, au contraire, she seemed to know what will be popular tomorrow. She bravely takes all the new trends, technologies and incorporates them into her own acts. His world tours have never been 'normal'. When Madonna acts, she gives 120%, everything is bigger, better, theatrical and meaningful. She takes inspirations from the East, the West, and makes them unique. Everything is given a deeper meaning, and The Confessions Tour is no different. From the beginning, you find yourself sitting on the edge of the chair. She starts with an explosion, then makes brave circus poses on a horse high in the sky, does everything she can to entertain you. She remakes her own songs, giving them a modern touch. She sings in a disco, almost reaches the center of the stage, and with her incredible dance team that does not know the dimensions of fear, the show is absolutely more than you expected. It's a show, an audiovisual orgasm that can not be put into words. Lucky are those who really experienced seeing Madonna on stage. Pushing fifty, she is still in an incredible way. The recent Sticky and Sweet Tour is even more innovative, which shows nothing else, that Madonna was, is and will be the only queen of pop.
