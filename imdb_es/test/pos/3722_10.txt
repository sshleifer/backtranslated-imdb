I'm a big fan of Luc Besson's work, and since I've known his name, I've also searched for this film. I tried to find this movie in all of California for more than four years. Last summer I made a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was at least to see this movie. Long story short, I bought it and saw it in France! I was impressed, I made my trip completely and finally I am happy to have seen the first work of Luc Besson. Character development absolutely incredible, very stimulating, great acting and the best movie concept. If you are a fan of conceptual films, this is one of the most original and classic. I feel it is a rare gift to see a movie like this, it is risky, unorthodox and, ultimately, it is simply unique. If you are a fan of Luc Besson, it is a must, however, whether you are a Besson fan or not, it is undoubtedly an important work, in general a great contribution to the immortal art of cinema.
