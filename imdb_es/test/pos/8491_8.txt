Jamie Foxx does a good job of impersonating the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. To credit the film, it shows the good and the bad with respect to Charles's character and the decisions he made, both personally and professionally. <br /> <br /> This is an elegant looking movie that gives you a sense of richness. of the periods in which the story takes place. Not only does it look good, it sounds good. I wish there was more music here. When it is inserted, it is fabulous, but there is not enough. <br /> <br /> Assuming, at least for review purposes, that the story was true, I was impressed and disappointed with Charles, which means that the story left some memorable impressions since I wrote this 16 months after seeing it. The main impressions include: <br /> <br /> GOOD: To relive Ray's immense talent and his foresight to go out and take a musical risk, like going to "country" for a while. The man had supreme confidence in himself, but he was not so arrogant about it. It was also memorable to show him beat his heroin addiction, without help! That is simply incredible. <br /> <br /> BAD: I also remember through this movie how easy Ray was hooked in the first place and I was disappointed that he was so unfaithful to his wife. One really sad comment was that his wife was more upset with him for missing his children's Little League games than for all the cheating he was doing with her, even if he was the father of a child with a member of his group of singers. . <br /> <The only negative thing I had with the filmmakers was the excessive emphasis on the fact that it was attributed to an early childhood event, the accidental death of his brother. That tragedy was used to avoid all of Ray's wrongdoing when he was an adult, which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions. <br /> <br /> Note: There is an extended version with the DVD, but it is said that it is so badly edited that it is not worth seeing, so keep the "theatrical version".
