John Parrish is a former Union official who plans to sell his ranch and land at Wilkison's in Anchor. The problem is that the price offered is very low and when they start to intimidate Parrish and his workers, he changes his mind, especially when things get worse brutally. <br /> <br /> Originally after seeing this I had a sense of frustration, mainly because of the cast involved. When you have Edward G. Robinson, Glenn Ford and Barbara Stanwyck in the same movie, you expect them to get a story and a script to excel. Unfortunately, they do not have the opportunity to produce a Western classic worthy of multiple visits, or is it that my expectation in excess is doing a bad service? Well, I slept in it and decided to reflect more on the image. I think so, it is fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work, it is, when everything is said and done, a plot that has been milked for everything worthwhile, and something else. But The Violent Men is still a very rewarding movie, regardless of the obvious missed opportunities with production. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford as Parrish is as cool as an Eskimo's nose, and it's always great to see Babs Stanwyck playing A bitch because she's good at it. While Eddie G, when one gets used to being in a Western, is fine in what is a written part. Robinson, who intervened at the last minute when he injured the first option as Lee Wilkison, Broderick Crawford was injured, is the shortest of the manufacturers, even supporting characters like the diabolical Wade Matlock (a smiling delight of the reliable Richard Jaeckel} and Judith Wilkison (a radiant Dianne Foster) get something to leave an impression on, but for what it is, Robinson's "bad" kind is, at least, memorable for all the right reasons. <br /> < br /> He is not shy in action and in the game of weapons, it is with the almost Shakespearean twists and tragedies that Rudolph Maté's film rises above the mundane, yet magnificently framed by the impressive cinematography of Burnett Guffey Lone Pine, in Alabama, has been used in many Western films (see Seven Men From Now for another glorious use), but here Guffey really stands out and manages to dazzle the eyes at every step. a great western film, and perhaps a better director than Maté could have really given to Donald Hamilton's novel, The Big Country, an adaptation to be proud of. But for everything that I liked, I personally found two more reasons to really like it, so it's recommended, for sure. 7/10
