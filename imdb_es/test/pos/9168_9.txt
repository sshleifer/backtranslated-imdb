As I said in the title of this review, it hurts to say this, but the "hook" reaches the zenith of what the Romantic Comedies of Hollywood can aspire. I have criticized both the genre and its namesake since I can remember, but on a note almost tragic, "Hitch" has made me spend in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous smile plastered on my face. <br /> <br /> This film may be misogynist and presumptuous at times, but nevertheless it possesses a certain humor about it whose subtlety can only be described as British. This is a wonderful attempt by Hollywood to do (or redo it as the case may be ...) a movie that appeals to all our wishes of a Romantic Comedy that makes us think and laugh simultaneously. Reluctantly and evasively I give this movie a 9 out of 10 ... Something that you will hardly see me doing for a romantic comedy in the near future, or at least I hope so.
