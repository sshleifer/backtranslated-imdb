It is quite evident that many of your nights were spent alone. If you saw 5 minutes of the actual program instead of watching the commercial, you would have seen one of the best television programs in the history of Canada. Too bad you would have been watching it alone. Probably the reason you hate it ... it's not a game. The keys to the VIP are fun, light and fun. The boys are going to eat this show. My game is tight and I can hardly wait to get into this program. The chicks were HOOOOOT and the clubs kicked the ass. I will be watching every week. I wonder why more shows like this one are not made. It is now clear that talent in Canada has the ability to produce American-quality television.
