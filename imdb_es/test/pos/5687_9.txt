This film intends to do something very particular, but also proposes not to do certain things. In short, it has a defined premeditated trajectory: deal with the idea of ​​facing death (with very few options and all bad) as serious and real instead of something casual or fun. In search of that realism, he has avoided certain conventions, such as bows and hooks of obvious characters. It's not about the characters as much as the human condition. No matter what the actors would do ... what would you do in their situation? <br /> <br /> Open Water may have been an initial notion for this movie, but it goes much further. Unlike that movie, in the end you do not deceive the public when you discover that there are really no sharks to talk about. This has a real monster, not just the idea of ​​a monster and not just an animated stand. It also has good production values, given what these ingenious filmmakers had to work with. And again, in contrast to that other movie, it has an exciting and brilliant action in its climax. And let's not forget the, 'we'll say dazzling', the presence on screen of its youngest star. She can be a great discovery.
