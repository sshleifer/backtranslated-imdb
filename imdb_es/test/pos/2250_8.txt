Let me start by saying that Liev has earned a lot of respect for me after watching his directorial debut "Everything Is Illuminated." Anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with an absurd and hilarious vocabulary of Alex, along with countless flashback scenes and dream sequences. Liev took all this and made it work. The film itself is great: the soundtrack, the performances, the cinematography, everything works. There are many stories about the city and its inhabitants, but there are so many things you can do with an indie, so this part did not bother me too much. It is simply disappointing that not many people see this movie or even know that it exists due to the lack of promotion that accompanies it. I did not even know it was in theaters. I did not know when the DVD came out. One would think that since Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters, SOMEBODY would have at least launched a commercial for him. I had to watch the trailer on my DVD "Paradise Now" (released on DVD in the spring of 2006) to know that it had a theatrical release date of "Fall of 2005". Haha: really sad. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you run into this review in any way because one of your friends read the book and he loved it or saw the movie and is recommending you see it, take my advice and look at that. It is a very good experience. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
