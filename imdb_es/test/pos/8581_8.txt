I have already seen this movie twice and I am very impressed with it. <br /> <br /> The conversations between Nimi and her mother, in addition to Nimi and Matthew are very moving. The Nigerian community shows itself in a very truthful and colorful way as it usually is. <br /> <br /> Although certain things could have done it with a little more explanation; If we knew why Matthew was in the south of France in the first place, the scenes that follow Matthew that he found in his car would be more understandable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Optimum Releasing has a website that contains detailed production notes. that would help make those scenes easier to understand. <br /> <br /> I would go back to see him, but unfortunately he had a limited release in London and is no longer available to watch it. I hope that the release of the video will take you to a bigger audience because the movie deserves it.
