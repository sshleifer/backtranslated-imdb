Did you like "Dead man does not wear plaid"? What about "Top Secret" and "A Chorus Line"? Well, Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of the three, as unlikely as it seems. Very funny "tongue in the cheek" Movie Noir hommage with incredible songs and a great dance. You have to have a little strange humor for this movie, but it's worth seeing. I voted with a nine, if the end was a little more logical, I would have obtained a ten. That's how good that movie is.
