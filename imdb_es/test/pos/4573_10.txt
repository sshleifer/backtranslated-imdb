Idiocracy felt that Mike Judge took my thoughts about society and put them in the movie. In fact, the movie is a social commentary. Almost at times it feels like a documentary. Luke Wilson did a good job playing a boring half Joe (as in most of his films). <br /> <br /> Of course, idiocracy was one end of the current state of society. But that's what makes most comedies fun, one extreme of any situation. Fiction is not very different from reality. <br /> <br /> Children praise the materialistic culture of hip-hop and take pride in being ignorant. When people feel useless in life, they reproduce. Giving them a purpose in the world. And it seems that only the worst people reproduce more. I can understand how others do not like it. It does not help most of the jokes were second-degree bathroom humor. It's not very different from a Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> Idiocracy rejects logic, reason, any intelligence (for a good reason). <br /> <br /> The comeback of Mike Judges was wonderful.
