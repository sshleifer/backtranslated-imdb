In Extramarital we see actress B Traci Lords at its best. She is wrapped in horror and suspense here, a type of paper that is very well suited to her. <br /> <br /> This conventional film lends much of its environment to the 'Basic Instinct' of Paul Verhoeven (1992), by the way. However, there are differences between the main female characters of Traci Lords ('99) and that of Sharon Stone ('92). For example, in Extramarital, Traci adds some tiny elements of his porn past. Nor should we forget to mention the three main actors of Extramarital. By attributing convincing performance, each of them contributes greatly to the overall quality of this film. <br /> <br /> All this makes Extramarital become a very nice B movie. Its plot shows a good accumulation, and its time is well extended from beginning to end. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, until its unexpected end.
