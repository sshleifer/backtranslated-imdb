I can not get this shake out of my brain. It is definitely totally different from anything that is out there. I've seen a lot of movies during the holidays and, although some are fine, nothing shook my world like BlindSpot did. There's something great about the actors and the way they put the movie together. It is as if there were really terrifying things mixed with a bit of hilarious black humor. Franco is great, but the tough older guy steals the show in some scenes, like when he hits the boy in the dirt grave. I guess some politically correct will not appreciate the atmosphere (do not bring your grandmother) but it is totally amazing. What is better is the kaliedescope style. There are some really serious things mixed with super interesting images of the road. The movie really makes you sad and scared in parts, but it also turns your head with what is happening and the way it was filmed. WTF is with the world? Too many critics are enthusiastic about all these supposedly revolutionary revolutionary films and when you see them they are boring and predictable and not all that. I do not understand it because there are many other better options. Blind Spot is really great because it gives you emotions and chills and great star power, but it does it in a completely fresh and definitely totally radical way.
