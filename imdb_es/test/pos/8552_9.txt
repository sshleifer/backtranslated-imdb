Living in Romania, I was almost surprised by the very realistic setting of the scenes and the great care that the director paid to the local details. The performance of Anthony Queen is absolutely great, and the rest of the cast does a great job supporting him. The film requires a little knowledge of the Eastern European context to be able to fully enjoy it, but it is still a great performance with some memorable lines. the ending is perhaps a bit too melodramatic, but that is how people are in this part of the world. I think the script is great, because it presents the horrors of World War II in the most original way: without blood or battlefields. However, lives are shattered and the smiles that you get from time to time throughout the film are quickly killed by the realities of the war that touch the characters.
