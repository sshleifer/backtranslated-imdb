... and this movie easily exceeded my expectations. The fact that it is written and directed by Peter Dalle made me believe that it was in vogue with other films that I'm used to (and I'm bored) to see it. Anyway, I went reluctantly to see this movie and that's what I did. I'm glad for This has humor and depth. 9 out of 10. See it!
