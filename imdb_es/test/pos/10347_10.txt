Recovery is an incredibly moving job, which handles the devastating effects of brain injury not only on the individual, but on the whole family. Without resorting to preaching or boring Hollywood endings, Tony Marchant's drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> The greatest accolades are David Tennant and Sarah Parish for their incredible performances. He had bragged before seeing the drama he would see bleed through his previous on-screen relationship in Blackpool, but he never does. Neither of the two actors is recognizable by any previous work, and I did not see any of them as an actor playing a role during the full 90 minutes. In addition, Harry Treadaway's performance as a son just on the cusp of starting his own life in college was fantastic. Throughout the work, it shows the torn nature of a teenager thrown into the role unwilling as a man of the house, <br /> <br /> Sometimes, almost all the characters in the drama are unfriendly. As a spectator, I wanted to give each one a good blow to wake up to reality, stop being depressed and begin to adapt to the rotten but very present change in their lives. But under the same circumstances, I see myself acting like any of them, switching between trying to show my rigid upper lip to despair to escape anything, including behavior that is completely different from me. It is the greatest strength of the program: the truth, without sugar coating, to force us all to think what we could do in the same circumstances. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult show, but you have to see it. I hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the United States.
