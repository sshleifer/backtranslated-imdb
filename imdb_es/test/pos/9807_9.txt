You have it right! Bobby was Mike's imaginary friend throughout the film, even at the beginning when they were heading to California. His mother knew about Bobby and did not discourage Mike by leaning on Bobby, since imaginary friends are common with young children. <br /> <br /> That's why they both suffered from stomachaches at the same time. That's why the boys were so close. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mike was letting Bobby leave. The "king" was arrested. Mike could continue without Bobby. That's also why Mike's mother did not seem upset when she received the postcard (which Mike had written and sent by post) from the Bobby the Ol 'West tourist stop and the other postcards from around the world. You noticed that Mike's mother turned the first card and looked at the postmark. What a great mother doing the best she could in the late sixties. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 for me. Brings memories ...
