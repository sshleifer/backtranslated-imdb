This movie really used its locations well with some surprising, dark and disturbing shots. The movie moves very slowly, but it constantly keeps you watching. Modern Love performed well on the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year, offering audiences a glimpse of an Australian cinema that is generally neglected. The most important thing is that it is refreshing to see that Australian cinema does not take over the clich√©s of Australian characters and stories that we have seen die over the years. This film would complement any festival and open the debate after its projections. The performances and the characters are well developed, and the cinematography is fantastic. An interesting exploration in family relationships, and environments.
