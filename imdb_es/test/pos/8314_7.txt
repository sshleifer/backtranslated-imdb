This documentary on dinosaurs was undoubtedly fascinating and very well done. However, I found myself looking at many of the bits with concern. In general, the film took a fairly confident stance on what it said and showed, but inevitably much of the behavior of the beasts, their interaction with each other, how they looked, how they moved, what they ate, etc. Guessing - sometimes guessing with reasonable confidence, sometimes just guessing. But the viewer never realizes that, the film aims to observe the real dinosaurs and their actual behavior, etc. That makes it probably better to see it than to confront the audience with mountains of disclaimers, but in my opinion it's a bit too populist.
