With its relaunch of ADV Films, I had the opportunity to see "The Giant Majin" for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of Horror Chiller theaters. Guess what? It's a very good movie! <br /> <br /> The scenarios are authentic, the acting is tenuous and credible, and the giant Majin is majestic, powerful and unstoppable. I loved the subtle touches of fantasy (the enchanted wood, the lucky charm, etc.) and the prayer of the god as a little less than "good". <br /> <br /> This movie is asking for a new version in the new century!
