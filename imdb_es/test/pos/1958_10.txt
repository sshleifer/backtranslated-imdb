I hope that the writer, director, editor and composer (and let's not forget the producer) read this ... because his work was really amazing in this movie. Let me start by saying that I am in no way affiliated with this movie. I'm just a normal guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and I've seen it about 8 times. <br /> <br /> Every second of this movie is moving. Each scene is classic. The acting is real. The movie is honest. You can relate to these characters as people, not as actors. <br /> <br /> This story follows three different assassins at different stages of their lives. The story is carefully thought out and each secondary plot is intertwined and interwoven, culminating in a message that leaves us reflecting on the values ​​of good and evil that each one of us carries inside. <br /> <br /> Crispen Glover, Daniel Roebuck, Dennis Hopper and Joshua John Miller (as a 12-year-old child) give incredible and authentic performances. I've seen this movie about 8 or more times and I'm still so absorbed in its performances that I forget I'm watching a movie. It's that good. Good job to everyone who worked on this. Great job. <br /> <br /> The music is also wonderfully paired and disturbing. With the chosen cast, the carefully timed editing and rhythm, the mood and tone, and even the theme, the director took some of the best decisions for a movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is real. It's honest It's a true cinematic experience that I'll never forget. You may not be interested in the subject, but it's something you can not ignore. Ultimately, it's about people being people ... and everyone can relate to that. I recommend this film to fans of drama, suspense and horror over almost any other movie.
