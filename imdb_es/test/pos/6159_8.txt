Participation from Europe on Czech fighter pilots flying for the RAF during World War II. It is always interesting as an American to see a new point of view about family events in history. There is nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which it was filmed or the romantic love triangle that anchors the narrative. Still, it's convincing all the way. There is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action and symbolism that the director and the cast underestimate to perfection. This is a breath of fresh air after sitting through exaggerated and boring Hollywood epics like "Pearl Harbor". Solid production everywhere. It is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema.
