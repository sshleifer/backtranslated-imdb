Someone was interested in what black cinema was like in the 70s. Watch this movie. Part of the dialogue in this movie is as fun as the summary of my presentation. Also be careful with the boom microphone to appear in some of the scenes, as well as in some of the best karate actions in history. Do not take this movie seriously or you will be disappointed, enter it with an open mind and enter the world of one of the most evil mutha in the world, Dolemite. Editing wisely, it was armed as if it had been cut with a razor, but once again, this movie is much more than what you see in the movie, it has influenced the black community in ways you can not understand!
