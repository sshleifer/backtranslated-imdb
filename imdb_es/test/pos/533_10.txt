Adam Sandler's films are my favorite comedies. The silence of the lambs is my favorite horror movie. The Matrix is ​​my favorite science fiction movie. Anywhere, but here is my favorite drama. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most valuable asset that this film has is its performance. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon is absolutely incredible. At the end of this movie, I felt as if I knew his character better than myself. She did an amazing job. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman also did a great job. I recently rented his first film, Leon (1994), in which he played a 12-year-old girl. I think she is a contradiction in terms; She was a good child actress. Well, 5 years later, she's still such a good actress. In fact, it is much better. <br /> <br /> Not only Sarandon and Portman represented their characters well, they also worked perfectly together. I mean, even now I can hardly believe that they are not really mother and daughter in real life, just like in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is about a 14-year-old girl (Portman) and her restless mother (Sarandon) who leaves her hometown in Wisconsin for Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> At first, Portman hates his mother for taking her away from his cousin and friends, and the two of them start a very tumultuous relationship that increases and over the course of a couple of years (usually below, I could add ). <br /> <br /> Although this explanation is a bit vague, the plot can only be summarized in a vague way. But when you see this movie, you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak, because it is really very deep. What I am saying is that the plot is weakly delineated, but then they focus on it to make it strong. <br /> <br /> And it's very strong, but also the sequence of the plot is excellent. And there are some brilliant scenes that I hope will one day be seen as "classic". <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. I laughed. I cried. And although, it must be admitted that there are some gaps, it is still a stellar movie and it really gets together at the end.
