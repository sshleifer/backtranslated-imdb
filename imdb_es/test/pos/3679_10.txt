What an excellent movie, even more because of the fact that my wife and I ran into her in a very casual way, navigating through channels on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her best, leading a cast of very normal and human characters, through one of the most wonderful and wonderful movies we've ever seen. Why this film did not receive the attention it deserved at its launch in 2002 is hard to understand. Why was it way above so many boring pieces of trash thrown with more fanfare and the attention is evident in the visualization? It is obvious that, as a public in general, we are being nourished by what has been considered "great and wonderful" by the powerful and influential, while true gems such as "Unconditional love" manage to shine through all those who want to enjoy the cinema really nice. Rent or buy this movie ..... you will not regret it!
