It should be noted that this movie was not "improvised" (as you are probably thinking), despite what the title suggests at the end. The film was heavily scripted and rehearsed: Cassavetes did not have enough money to bear the inevitably high production costs of an "impromptu" film class, even if he had wanted to produce something like that. The "improvisation" of the film is contained in the performances of the actors and the emotions that they draw from the lines. <br /> <br /> That said, let me say that this is an awesome job that I 'm sure will come back again and again. The depth of emotion that Cassavetes can extract from the smallest gestures and interactions is incredible. I have no idea how he was able to direct such amazing performances by the actors, especially in the conditions in which he worked. This is truly a magnificent milestone of the film that I would recommend to anyone interested in exploring beyond the mold of Hollywood.
