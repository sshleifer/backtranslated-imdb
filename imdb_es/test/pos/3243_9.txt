Heath Ledgers acting in this movie really bothers me, but overall it's a great watch. Bryan Brown is excellent when I usually do not like him, but his whole gang is a great job. Jimmy is a miserable gangster who can not seem to do anything right (SPOILERS: he loses the money of the pandos, the car of ackos and he almost stumbles on a bank robbery), but he is still on top. <br /> <br /> I did not know what the two children were in this from the beginning, but they combine some stories very well. <br /> <br /> In general, a very fine piece of Australian cinema 9/10
