As you know, Norway is the most developed country in the world (in relation to the HDI, Human Development Index). This film cleverly reveals our future. Our future would be that of Norway, since we are all paddling to achieve the best and offer the least. The life that was shown was perhaps an exaggeration, but when comparing today's concerns with those of our ancestors, it is not far from the reasoning of reality. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing this film free of all our previous assumptions, we can find our two faces; the one that laughs at the brilliant scene of Andreas abandoning his girlfriend and the one who searches the magazines for hours and hours to choose a stupid chair among the stupid collections. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the hole with the hope of lightness was another magnificent idea of ​​the film. The slight glory; but the only one, and the effort that was made to reach it makes us feel closer to Andreas. <br /> <br /> Although I was mainly attracted to the idea and the production of the film, Trond Fausa Aurvaag played quite well and the atmosphere of the film was quite comparable.
