Hal Hartley's entry to a series of European films is one of his two or three best efforts to date and, luckily, one of the few available on DVD. In just 63 minutes of execution time, my only complaint would be with Hartley. I always go out wanting more, but never as much as this time. Martin Donovan is amazing like Jesus. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting as Magdelena, but the highest point for me was Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry Fool) as Satan. Hartley gives him an excellent dialogue and the opportunity to use his resonant voice for a full effect. Look for three scenes in which a microphone is waiting for you, as if the devil wins a poetry hit. I have read other comments about this movie and I had to add mine because there is not enough praise. If you like Henry Fool, Martin Donovan in anything (Opposite of Sex), and / or very intelligent comedies based on biblical ideas, get this as quickly as possible.
