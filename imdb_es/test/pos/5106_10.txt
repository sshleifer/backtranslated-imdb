I enjoyed the movie and the story immensely! I have seen the original (1939 I think) and I enjoyed both. To really appreciate the history you have to be familiar with the English culture and customs. The teacher (Peter O'Toole) dedicated himself to his school and to "the children" in that school. It was a "public" school of English, which we refer to in the USA. UU As a private school (E.G. Andover). She is a very ascetic person and, on the surface, gives the appearance of being rigid, covered, carefree and weak to the point of being effeminate. He is strict in his educational standards because he takes care of "his boys", that is, he does not want them to get a cheap or weak education. Meet (through the introduction) a "dance girl" (Petula Clark) and is totally in love. In England at that time, the reference to the "ballroom" carried the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was definitely "lower class". We find that Prof. is in fact a very strong and courageous person, as well as loyal to the people and institutions that he loves and / or respects. Clark becomes something more than a lover and a wife ... she "breaks" his personality and allows him to grow as a man and as a person, for the benefit of his beloved school and his own happiness. The first film was set BEFORE World War II, it also goes through World War II, it is 1969 (we had the "British Invasion" ... Beetles, etc. Clark had successes and was very popular at that time .. It's still for me), the music is great, the color and photography excellent. I think O'Toole played the character perfectly! There are people dedicated as "Chips" ... around us, but many do not receive recognition. Very nice movie and story!
