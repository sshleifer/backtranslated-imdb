Hmm, is it correct to compare the publication of Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar Saved by the acting bell? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is it correct to give this movie a '10' rating? Hahahahahaha ... that's funny. However, this movie was not so horrible; Better than I expected. Movies made for television are often so similar. Many of them have the same feeling as them. This one had the same feeling, but it worked even though it was another tortured wife who had to get the b * stard in the final story. Before it started, I had imagined Mrs. Thiessen as a seductive vixen type 90210, but here she was as innocent as Kelly Kapowski, which was refreshing. Eric Close surprised me by playing his part really well. With some decent writing, the director got a good and convincing performance from him without being entirely corny. In general, it was something interesting, definitely better than most television movies. My note: B-
