Despite what his critics followed, I enjoyed it enormously for what it is. Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. Soderberg has already done artistic things, before winning Oscar, he is at the top of his game. Ocean's 12 is light, commercial, fluffy, Steve's day at Midway, so to speak. I'm not usually a fan of Zeta-Jones, but I must even admit that Kate is impressed in this movie. It is ending the cries of an upcoming episode and I will be one of the millions who come to see the 120 minutes of George and Brad and Matt parlay through the excavations of Clooney in the Lago di Como while cheating a rich villain over and over time. If we tolerate 3 installments of the Lord of the Rings, I ask if we can drool over Clooney's salt and pepper cover just one more time.
