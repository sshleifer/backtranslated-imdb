For those who are not familiar with Paddy Chayefsky, this is a very good introduction. While Chayefsky deals with the reality behind the myths of many things, including medicine, this work is surprisingly prophetic about the current state of medicine, two decades after the making of the film and a decade after his death. Beyond that, some ideas about Chayefsky's vision of life in general also "slide" into the film. The 20th Century can become the first and last century of the United States in the History of the World. If it turns out that the contribution to the arts of the United States was in the dimension of the "film", this is an excellent example of that art.
