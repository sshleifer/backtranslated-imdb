For those who remember the initial impact of this video, it will never be forgotten, and seeing Thriller is all it takes to feel again at age twelve. But, while it is a great video, it is not perfect, although it seemed that way at the time. When this video came out for the first time, nobody had seen something like that before. Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a new visualization of Thriller will reveal its flaws. Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song? When Michael Jackson is walking with the girl after leaving the cinema, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choirs. After he becomes a zombie, when the time comes for him to sing again, his zombie makeup disappears inexplicably, and the chorus sings again and again, and again, as if to compensate for his previous absence. This may have been the first time a song was deconstructed to fit the visual in a music video, but it certainly was not the last time. It has continued to be a problem in the MTV era. The best videos, like Billie Jean and Jackson's Beat It, have used images to serve music, and not vice versa. Still, Thriller is very fun, and an absolute necessity on Halloween.
