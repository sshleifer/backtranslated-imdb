After the atomic bomb hits Hiroshima, the charred bodies lie around them, the deformed victims try to communicate with relatives who can not even recognize them, and one person after another dies of radiation sickness. This film in black and white, although it is sad and terrifying, does not lack humor. The story revolves around a young Yasuko, who was hit by the black rain after the explosion. She is trying to get married, but everyone is still dying, and people are worried that the same thing will happen to her. After finding a suitable partner (who is losing her mind after being in the war for too long), she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness. This movie is a great representation of atomic attacks in Japan, it will scare you and maybe make you cry. The acting is good, not too dramatic like many other ww2 movies that have been made.
