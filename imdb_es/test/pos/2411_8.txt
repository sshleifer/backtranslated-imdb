OK, this is a complete scam of the first Karate Kid. However, I think there can never be too many movies like the first Karate Kid. There is something in this kind of story that seems to apply particularly to people like me. You have a general feeling of being able to overcome adversity by discovering new things about yourself. In this film, Hillary Swank is a particular gem as the next Karate Kid. You can really say that she has a bright future ahead of her. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that this movie is not without problems. Unlike the first, Mr. Miyagi seems to be a little anxious that Julie learn martial arts and get involved in the fight. It almost seems that he forgot what his values ​​were for the first movie. Also, one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks. The film makes the monks seem to have an overly simplistic view of life, and it does not really explain why they do what they do in the plot. The villains are also a bit questionable, even though they are really hateful bad guys. I also have a suspicion about the Martial Arts films that end on graduation night. <br /> <br /> So maybe this is not a perfect movie. So maybe this would not be the best movie to rent on a Friday night. However, in more ways than one, it is a guilty pleasure. Hillary Swank is so adorable, and the story, though not original, works. In a genre of movies that seems to be based on nothing but action and violence, this is a breath of fresh air. Unlike all those of Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme, this is a film about the spirit and the heart. There are some people who need movies like this, and we will take what we can get. My rating: 8/10
