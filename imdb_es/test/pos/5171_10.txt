It was good to see John Denver again, although he died several years ago. I thought this movie was very moving and a great movie to sit by the fire on a cold winters night and remember what Christmas is all about. The scenes in Georgetown, Colorado, were magnificent and make one want to move there immediately. When I sit here on my own mountain view in So California, I loved the story and the plot. I hope everyone who sees this somewhat older movie enjoys it as much as my mother and I do. Merry Christmas! A great movie for the whole family. I go in and tell the others about it. Thanks for the memories. We need more movies like this to come out of Hollywood.
