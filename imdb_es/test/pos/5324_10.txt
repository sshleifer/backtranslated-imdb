Each role, even the smallest, has been chosen and acted with courage. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary Jena Malone never takes a wrong step. Her two co-stars are equal to her in this movie. Ryan Gosling may be the best actor of his generation. Chris Klein gives his best performance to date. This is a provocative film of thought and conversation that should be seen by teenagers and young adults. You will think and talk about this movie for days. Highly recommended
