I saw the pp the other night. I have to say that I was really impressed by how real the film looked. It felt like a documentary. I also believe that the film presented realistic possibilities. In the film, the war in Vietnam intensifies to the point where China has become involved. What if that had happened? I think the scenarios would be similar to those portrayed in the film. We've had camps before in this country ... and we still have ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to everyone ... especially the radicals ... <br /> <br /> I keep saying that if I was in the position that those kids were in that they would just kick my ass. I love America and its great wars (wink wink)
