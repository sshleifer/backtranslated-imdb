1969 was the year. The city of New York was the place. Putney Swoope was Robert Downey's second film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and unpleasant. Those two films were petty to the point that they actually stopped the Prince's film career for several years. <br /> <br /> The issue in question is Putney Swoope. And it is a crazy farce / satire that must be seen to be believed. I will not go through the plot here. What plot? People looking for a plot are going to scratch their heads. Keep scratching! This movie is not about PLOT! You could compare this with a Mel Brooks movie; Only without the Hollywood parody party that Mel always threw. I also see a bit of Monty Python in this. By the way: this movie was shot before Monty debuted on the BBC. <br /> <br /> I realize that gags and lines that are fun and fun do NOT transfer well by word of mouth. You have to see them in the context of the movie. There are some flaws in the movie; But even the flaws are unique. For example: actors often repeat the SAME LINE over and over again; and somehow it works. How many syllables mario? Putney says that the Borman Six girl has to have a soul! etc ... <br /> <br /> Black and white photography is exceptional. The sound / score is even better! The edition is regular. The performance is above average. The script is priceless. The jokes are as uncomfortable as you can get: MR. The bad news says that "Sonny Williams just got stuck in a motel with a 13-year-old girl." Putney says: "Well, at least he's not superstitious", beware of timid conservatives. The anti-establishment mentality of this movie will take you directly to the room. Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> There are many things in this movie that belong to the present: NO SMOKING! Reverse racism; with African-Americans treating Caucasians as trash. The manipulation of the mass media on the masses; Madison Avenue, Deroit, Hollywood, intentionally pedaling something that any 8 year old can say is trash; Internet, I'm talking about "the drum"; Interracial appointments; I could go on and on ... <br /> <br /> I must also mention that there are approximately 8 minutes of this film that was shot in 16 mm of color. These are the commercials filmed by the Putney agency. The spots work quite well the first time. They become tired although in repeated visits. The real magic here is inside the B / W sections of the movie. They are the non-scenic lines that remain with you: "Alqu√≠llate A CHORT Schmuck". "I love you, I love you, I love you ... did you take your pill?" "Everything I have to say would be redundant." And a lot of others. I also really like what I have with the small stick mounted on the wall: "The Game Ranger wanted me to return it ... I put together such a fight, I decided to mount it!" <br /> <br /> Featured in the cast include Buddy Buttler as Putney's # 1 bodyguard. It should have been a much bigger star. Antonio Fargas as the Arab. He continued to stardom on television and in movies. Arnold Johnson looks the right way as Putney Swoope. Robert Downey used his own voice instead because Arnold could not remember some of his lines. Downey also realized that he could complete any additional dialogue / joke later on if he doubled his lead actor. <br /> <br /> The movie has some shortcomings. The short execution time is one. I would like the beginning with the members of the white board to have been extended. Stan Gotlieb and Allen Garfield are exceptional. The final seams had come together as if he could not think of more gags. All in all, this is one of the best low budget independent films of its time. A time when very few indys were playing outside of New York, Chicago, San Francisco and L.A. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see this at least twice. Putney Swoope, from Downey, is ahead and, beyond that, it's time.
