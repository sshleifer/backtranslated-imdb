I found this movie in a rental store. I had never heard of that before, but it was a good movie. Great performance, and exciting plot. Great congratulations to Vincent Ventresca. It made the character of Thomas very attractive and gave a special atmosphere to this film. <br /> <br /> NJ <br /> <br />
