Jack Black and Kyle Gass team up to promote their Tenacious D band in this Rock Classic called Tenacious D In The Pick Of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invented their own Rock Opera ... it was like a Rock 'N' Roll Opera. Some of the most twisted events took place in that movie ... the part of the big foot ... the part of the mushroom ... and in the end, when they made the rock against the Devil. A classic formed in Tenacious D ... one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The last two things I saw in the theater were stupid ... but this movie is amazing. This really made me laugh a lot. The whole base is Jack Black Run to find his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and the man who has always been bald. They work together to find this magical selection that can make the most terrible musician touch a lot. Finally they arrive at the Rock 'N' Roll Museum and steal the selection. On the way they meet The Stranger played by Tim Robbins. They come to the club to win their cash prize when the owner takes the selection and all the time he was the devil and he fights the D in a Rock Off. The D does not win, but the devil's horn falls and sends him back to hell. Therefore, LIVE THE D !!!!!!!!!!
