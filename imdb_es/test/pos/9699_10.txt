This movie is hilarious. I would say that it is much more painful and disgusting than the previous movie. All the cast of the film and previous series is present. <br /> <br /> It's great to see this kind of movie in the Movie Theater because everyone in the audience is crying with laughter, especially in the terrorist part that was damned disgusting. I would like them to do more of these types of movies. <br /> <br /> A strong stomach is required! They got some crazy tricks this time. Warning: Includes many snakes! I'd love to write about that, but I can not spoil the fun. Go see it !!!
