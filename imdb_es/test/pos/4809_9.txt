I just bought An Zhan (I ran out of time) on DVD and it was an excellent movie, I must say. It's not really action-packed, in terms of weapons game, but definitely exciting and witty. I do not think I saw Andy Lau in better shape. And the editing of this movie was very well executed. Go see this now if you are a fan of Lau or HK thiller / action film.
