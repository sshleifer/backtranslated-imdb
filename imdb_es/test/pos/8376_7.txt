Previous commentators have noted the similarity in appearance between this film and The Third Man, the classic film noir by director Carol Reed, starring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. This similarity hits the viewer almost immediately. In fact, it is a great compliment to compare it with the award-winning cinematography of the Robert Krasker academy in The Third Man. <br /> <br /> The Stolen Identity plot has also been delineated with quite precision but in fairly ordinary terms. I found it highly creative and entertaining. As common as the "wrong or stolen identity" device is both in the theater and in the cinema, it is just a device and should not be confused with the plot itself. Consequently, while the viewer may have seen this device "a thousand times", the Stolen Identity screen is full of surprises and twists based on this device. It is the unexpected twists that make this film much fresher, more original and fascinating than a synoptic plot could convey. The stolen identity is not based on the kind of suspense that characterizes most movies, because there is no real mystery here. Instead, it is based on constants, small surprises. In summary, the wrong identity device is quite common; but this plot is not. <br /> <br /> Finally, although I was not familiar with the cast, I found that the performance was uniformly good, sometimes exceptional. I could easily have imagined other actors turning this movie into a melodrama, with bombing, exaggerated gestures and obvious facial expressions. The acting is always more measured and subtle. Donald Buka is especially moderate and credible, he never "blows his cover" with an obvious facial expression as we see too often in movies that rely on maintaining subterfuge to maintain dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment in this film, otherwise, fine, was the very weak development of the secondary plot of the love story. As it is, it seems like a last-minute idea, a slight surprise, in fact, stuck at the end. Or maybe during their shared experience, the actors simply could not convey a palpable level of chemistry that I could appreciate. This secondary plot should have become more evident as the story unfolds. In general, I thought that this movie was a little gem and I wondered why I had not seen it before. Try it, you will like it.
