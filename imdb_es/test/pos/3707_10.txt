This movie was made right in the area where I grew up and now I live. I personally know most of the owners of the different places used in the film. When I was a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road that is shown at the end of the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr and the car. They tell me that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are natives of North Carolina. I was lucky enough to see him at a local show. In that sample, one of the people who helped select locations and secure accessories, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the film. The bus had no reverse gear and, during the taxi, the driver could not stop several times and had to drive several miles to get back to the right place. Those details of the technical issues added to the enjoyment for me. The film accurately describes life in this area during World War II. A well made movie and I look forward to the availability of the DVD.
