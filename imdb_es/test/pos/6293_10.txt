One of our family favorites of all time. When we need to laugh ... we just put this on and laugh as if it were the first time we see it. This movie has good family humor, clean. Pauly Shore is brilliant! Without plans for Thanksgiving holidays, Crawl (Shore) is invited to spend the holidays with a conservative scholarship, Becca. Crawl, being a big city boy, must adapt to the life of the farm if he wants to fall in love with Becca. But, Crawl is not the only one who is learning new things. Crawl teaches Becca and her parents to be more open with their feelings and to accept others. This is fun for spectators of all ages.
