The End Of Suburbia (TEOS) is a very useful movie. It is also important and provocative. It seems that there is no middle ground either with the film or with its main source of entertainment, the anti-expansion Meister, James Howard Kunstler. <br /> <br /> Although I am not a big fan of New Urbanism, my criticism is due to his small vision. In the case of the new town planner Peter Calthorpe, another talking head, you finally hear what is obvious in and between the added special shots of TEOS ... Calthorpe simply does not understand the peak of oil. <br /> <br /> I have used this as a teaching tool in economics classes to understand the importance of land as a factor of production, a fact that has diminished for a long time in neoclassical economics, and also as a vehicle to educate about: Peak oil, land use debris, global warming, threatened food production, public transit our committed future <br /> <br /> Move over South Park! .... Made by Toronto Canadians for $ 25,000 and published in May 2004, this video sold more than 24,000 copies in October 2005. One of the leading providers of DVD rentals recently purchased almost 400 more copies. <br /> <br /> The End Of Suburbia's sales actually went up 1 1/2 years after its launch and has also been available in one of the leading online video services since September 2005. <br / > <br /> A sequel is being prepared, Escape From Suburbia with a possible release in August 2006.
