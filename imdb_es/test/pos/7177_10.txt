In 1968, when "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" was released, it came out of nowhere and hit like a psychedelic thunder. The African-American actor and filmmaker, William Greaves, intended to alter forever the 'documentary' style of making documentaries, and to this day, there has never been anything like that. The film is a film about "the making of a movie," and is written and directed intentionally to create as much controversy and contradiction as possible. Located in the Central Park of New York, the dialogue of action and scarce concerns a couple who fight and fight for homosexuality and abortion. The woman wants to get out of the relationship, and the man wants an explanation. Near the end of this interaction, a homeless drunk interrupts the proceedings and offers his comments and personal history. Then, after the beginning has been filmed, the film crew adds their own views of the filmmaker and what they feel is their inept handling of the film. And throughout the film, several cameras are used to record the action within the scene, and strange comments from the cast, crew and viewers. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in Avant Garde filmmakers, such as Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes or Jim Jarmusch. William Greaves tries to show that a thing can not be really observed and understood because visualization in itself would alter reality. "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" can be seen as a cinematographic representation or an application of the Uncertainty Principle. This is just a possible explanation, and Greave's true intention is certainly open to speculation. Above all, this film seeks to confuse, confront. And stimulate, and without a doubt, it triumphs admirably.
