Hi all! The best drama of all is now on Gospel Music Channel! Go to their website to see the calendar and find out what number is on your cable or satellite. This was one of my favorite shows while I was growing up. It has everything I want it to be a television show, a family drama and clean that does not bother me. The story about a man who, after losing his job, decides to undertake a great adventure across the country. On the way they meet all kinds of interesting people and find themselves in the middle of all kinds of problems. This program was originally a spin off of Touched By An Angel, another really good family program. Make sure you check it!
