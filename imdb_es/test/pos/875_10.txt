This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent years. Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, he as a naive owner of a plantation and she as an enigmatic trap. Words will not do justice to this masterpiece, enough Let's say this is a film that explores the darker side of love and pain, the humiliation and the capacity for self-deception that accompany it, even though it is dressed like a black cinema. Forget about that weak remake with Jolie and Banderas, see the genuine article in its place and enjoy moments of great cinematographic beauty.
