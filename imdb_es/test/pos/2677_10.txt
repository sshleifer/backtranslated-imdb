This show is amazing! I love each and every episode. Carrie is a spitfire and Doug is a lovable and, sometimes, imbecile. Arthur, Spence, Danny, Deacon and Carrie's Boss give the show a final touch, tying all the funny moments in your pants. In one of the seasons, Doug tries to get Carrie drunk, because it's nicer when she's drunk. Good husband, right? Carrie is not much better, when her boss needs an IPS driver to testify in a small case at work, Carrie hesitates, because she sees Doug as a bum and does not want to embarrass her, so she hires Doug's friend . . Wife of the year. But, who I think is more fun is Arthur, who shouts at random. He is dead and funny, and angry. Hey, you would be too if you had to live in a basement where the mold has a strange smell and makes you dizzy. This show is hilarious, and if you have not seen it yet, then you have not lived!
