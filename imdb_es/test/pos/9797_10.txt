I am a 20 year old boy from England. I do not cry in the movies. But this moved me. I cried like a girl! This is absolutely the most moving film I've seen, even though the story was questionable. The face of Joseph Mazello when he dreams of crying made me cry all the time. How could someone hurt such a sweet child? I'm going to cry now just thinking about it! Remarkable.
