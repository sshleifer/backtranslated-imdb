Meville's film is not as good as his most famous film, the delightfully elegant "Le Samourai (1968)". I do not even think that this is the best example of the most beloved subgenre of thefts. The main thing against the film is its long execution time. Meville has this tendency to concentrate on too many trivial details. I could have told the same story in a relatively short time, but for reasons I do not understand, the movie seems to go on and on. Still, the movie is never boring. The direction of Melville impressed me and the cast is very good, especially Alain Delon as a great "great" thief. The color photography that is to be seen in the film is a great asset and Melville uses sound (or lack of sound) in a very effective way. From a technical point of view, the film is practically impeccable. Sometimes, one has the feeling that Meville is just showing off, but when someone has as much talent as him, he has little reason to complain. I still like the other theft movies a bit more ("Topkapi (1964) by Jules Dassin", just to name one), but it can not be denied that this movie is a good piece of entertainment and a good example of what the people mention. Like the "cool" cinema.
