Begotten is one of the most unique films I've seen in my life. It is more, for me, a study of sound, light, darkness and movement than a real story. The kind of thing that looks like a video instillation in the modern art museum that a movie that is enjoyed in the local theater. I will not try to interpret the images of Mother Nature, the beasts in layers, the twisted and tortured body of her "son". Some things simply challenge the interpretation.
