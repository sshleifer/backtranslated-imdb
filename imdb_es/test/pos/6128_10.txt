Of course, my 10/10 rating only applies if you are willing to obtain full and absolute compensation *. Because you know that only John Waters can do that. In "Pink Flamingos" (his directorial debut), he portrays two families in combat to see who can be the dirtiest person in the world. What the famous Divine does in the end practically answers the question. But, apart from that, the film is basically an excuse to surprise people beyond what anyone could imagine. You better have a strong stomach to watch this movie. Even some of the lines are quite amazing. <br /> <br /> * Otherwise, avoid this movie as you would with the Ebola virus!
