Six-shooter, Tunnel Sergeant, Dr. Death, Pinhead, Cyclops and Blade help the young Andre Toulon to get the man from Sutek Egyption in the best sequel to this series. <br /> <br /> The Retro Puppet Master is atmospheric with many sets, quality performances and some fun FX puppets. What he lacks in blood, he makes up for with an interesting plot of good rhythm. <br /> <br /> The best quote: Dr. Death: "Do not you know, friends? They smell the sulfur, see the smoke ..." <br /> <br /> This is easily the best movie of Dave DeCoteau that I've seen. The actors do a more than credible job: Jack Donner as "Azfel" becomes an inspired performance, and the young Toulon does well with the puppets. Oh, and the needle-ring is great. <br /> <br /> The score by John Massari is a good symphonic take of the original songs of Richard Band's Puppet Master, keeping the film playful and mysterious. It is rare that a Full Moon score adds something to a movie, and it does. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dave Allen did not seem to be affordable enough for Band and Co. in the late 1990s and beyond, so all the action of the puppets is done with stick and string. There is no stopping movement like the famous and funny scene in the original where Pinhead is looking for his pinhead. And, of course, as with the full Moon rate of this time period, the RPMs were shot at the Castel Studios in Bucharest, so most of the parts were sent to the Romanians: listening to their "Parisian" accents "It was a bit annoying. <br /> <br /> In general, this is probably one of the 10 best films of the Full Moon. It is without a doubt the most inventive of the sequels of Puppet Master.
