I can not remember the series, I think it may have been "American Masters", but it aired on PBS around 1980. Most people have some knowledge of the development of the A bomb and those who have little or nothing. You probably think it's a pretty dry subject. Anyone who has seen this 7-part series does not feel that way. You get to know the turmoil in Oppenhemiers' mind and how development changed his life forever. You understand the tragic figure he became, and why. With 7 episodes you can meet the main players, and intrigue and stabbing. I contacted PBS about the possibility of obtaining a video or DVD, but I never received a response. Too bad, I'd love to see him again.
