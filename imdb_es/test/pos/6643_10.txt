The shame is quite unique as a war movie (or rather as a film against war) in which not only does it not focus on the soldiers or the politics involved (there is politics, but not how you would think it would look), It occupies its two main themes as the only two beings that can be taken care of at all in this brutal and decaying society in which they live. Ingmar Bergman, in the middle of his best moment, and after two other very psychological films, Persona and Hora del lobo, is much more interested in seeing the effect of war on generally civilized beings, which brings out the worst of them. , and also in a cathartic way it is a reminder of what is truly crucial in life. His two key players are frequent collaborators and friends, Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman (like the Rosenberg, oddly enough), who are musicians who live on a farm on an island (not very different from "Wolf" when you think about it). ). <Br /> <br /> Come the tanks pass, and a couple of old friends are already wearing out, but try not to put it too seriously; There is a sweet scene in which the couple speaks only, frankly but with heart (a full shot, as repeated throughout the film, perhaps to create a sense of being provoked) ... Then comes the problem, including a false propaganda movie. made at gunpoint with the Rosenbergs, the psychological agitation of being prisoners of war and the terror involved with a "friend" in the army (one of Gunnar Bjornstrand's more subtle jobs with Bergman). It goes without saying that this is not one of the easiest films to review in terms of Bergman's filmography, however, for some it may be one of his most accessible works. His religious themes on this occasion remain very discreet, even when the idea of ​​maintaining a kind of faith invades the atmosphere of the film. When there is war action, it is taken unconventionally and quickly (through the great friend Sven Nykvist). <br /> <br /> And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eve corresponds to the context of a chaotic war. - Land where the lines are never drawn with too much security. In a way, this film, shot at the worst moment in Vietnam, is even more relevant for today; I could not help but see chilling and intransigent coincidences between Iraq and other places with some of the scenes of Jan and Eve with the fighters, or the "in charge". The last scene, by the way, is one of Bergman's best (acting, directing, lighting). It is not the kind of war image (or, again, against the war, I find little of the spirit of John Wayne in this Svensk production) that I would recommend from the beginning to all my friends at Saving Private Ryan. more in kinship with Paths of Glory, observing the effects of the hypocrisy of war. But in reality, as in any of Bergman's "genre" films, it is alone, however, one that amasses the artistic crowd.
