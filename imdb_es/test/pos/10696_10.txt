After watching this movie, I have no choice but to write a review with the hope that there are others like me who were impressed by the action of the rocket-driven ninja and the mind-boggling sexual arousal that is Ninja III: The Domination. <Br /> <br /> We all know that Sho Kosugi rocks. That's a fact, but what about Jordan Bennett's ultra-macho interpretation of his police character "Billy Secord"? Bravo Mr. Bennett, bravo. It demonstrates from the beginning, while it tries to seduce the exuberant Christie (interpreted to the perfection by Miss Lucinda Dickey of the fame of Breakin ') that it is not afraid to risk in its office. I especially enjoyed when you do not feel the need to intervene and try to help her while 4 thugs try to rape her out of her gym. Oh, you could have helped him, but by staying there and seeing how you let him know who the boss was. Secord will wear the pants in this relationship. I also liked that Mr. Bennett was not afraid to take off his shirt repeatedly or wear the sleeveless shirt to beat his wife even though the gorilla had shoulders and backs. The back and shoulder hair are hot and Secord knows it. And what about Lucinda Dickey? All I can say is "KABOOM": I see that a sex bomb is preparing to explode. She has all the right movements as a temptress and a genius of martial arts. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what makes this movie work. One would think that she would hate him because he is a corny idiot, but not my friends. The animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they come together like crazy glue. Sho Kasugi is not as prominent as you might think, although he is still a main character, which is fine for me because all I wanted was more Bennett and Dickey. It seems that she wears a lot of makeup on her eyes, which was nice to see. Special effects? Wow. That's all I can say. I will not reveal the ending, but let's say it will not disappoint. I love Ninja III: domination, and I can only hope that there is a Ninja 4. I give it a 5 out of 5 throwing stars. disappoint.
