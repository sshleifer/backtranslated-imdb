I have been a devoted visitor of IMDB for some years. This is the movie that finally forced me to write a review. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie by chance (the opening credits happened when my TV went on one morning). I enjoyed the movie a lot for many reasons, all of which have been well covered by other critics: the mood, the forgotten history of the Czech pilots, the subtle charm of the supporting characters, the fatalism of the main characters and the First view of the person during the battle scenes. <br /> <br /> But the "Dark Blue World" element that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects, especially during combat (and this is a good thing!). While the pilots flew in battle, no musical score accompanied them, manipulative shots of worried wives / girlfriends did not intertwine, every small aerial maneuver did not cause trivial patriotic acclamations, and spectators were not asked to swallow the incredible James Bond pilot heroics. . . Instead, the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy, fear and isolation of these single-fighter fighters as they try to stay in the air during combat. As the comrades are shot down, we save the tearful and heroic howls based on revenge typical (but pleasing to the public). Instead, the other pilots observe with sadness and silence the fate of their fellow pilots: in reality, they must still continue to concentrate intensely on their own safety and objectives at that moment. We only briefly experienced the pilot's breathing and the background roar of the engines while we, the public, witnessed the spiral of a friend in silence until his death. And immediately, 'we' must return to combat mode and concentrate on survival. <br /> <br /> Very often in Hollywood we are fed with the emotions that we are supposed to feel and there is no room for them. The imagination of the spectator. "Dark Blue World" maintains a dispersion that captivates and engages the viewer, allowing us to invest in the film and fill the gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie, which is worth seeing.
