The nice thing about watching random movies in random moments is that you never know what to expect or where the next great film work will emerge. Recently, my visualization has taken the form of classic staples like "Raging Bull" or "Raiders of the Lost Ark", but this time my VCR took me away from modern conveniences and left me right in front of Lionel Jeffries "The Railway Children". This is a skilfully directed film about three young children, a mysterious event with their father, relocation in the open fields of England and, finally, the rewards inherited simply by waving trains. At first glance, this apparently simple infantile film does not seem so hopeful, since it has been lost in the rarity of VHS for some time, but within the first fifteen minutes of this film, one realizes that it is more than just the children's movie of their common place. ?? "Railway Children" was created at a time when purity was more than simply saying "no", when family meant everything and the adventure was ready for you at every bend in the railroad track. This is more than an adorable movie, it has incredible cinematographic techniques, it keeps the habitual spectator stuck to the screen with unanswered questions and offers three perfect companions to continue on this 110 minute journey. "Railway Children" is a lost treasure that must be seen by families and moviegoers. <br /> <br /> There are several moments that stand proudly in "Railway Children" that transform this from mediocrity to excellence. One becomes our three children; Bobby, Phyllis, and Peter. Modern cinema assures us that these three children can not provide enough darkness, laughter and knowledge of the world around them, but the Jeffries children show the opposite. From intelligently spoken lines (both the performance and the script), to the sincere kindness and dedication to this small town, until the final meeting at that train stop; These children are more than just children's stars that advance in a story, they are guiding us with emotion, persuasion and a realism that today's children have not seen. There is more imagination in this little VHS than I've seen in movies for years. A favorite scene that could have been handled with generality, of which I have seen in other films, was Bobby's birthday scene. The way Jeffries makes her float among the guests and the gifts was exciting and refreshing, keeping our eyes enthusiastic about each scene, as well as our mind. Another scene that caught my attention was when the children worked on the gifts for Perks, when they asked a man for a gift, Jeffry just said, "No, I will not, I do not like the Perks." Is the reaction of the children hilarious? Providing moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout. Shot in the 1970s, this small feature provides genuine laughs that most modern comedies do. It is a creative film combined with a great choreography and direction. <br /> <br /> I mean, as much as I loved this movie, it was not perfect. Jeffries does a great job of keeping us guessing what happened to the father, but it felt as if the event was happening, the children stayed in the dark and, all of a sudden, they solved themselves at the end. More details for the father, not much more, would have solidified his character and would have given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reaction. Also, there is a scene in this movie, one of those great wide-screen shots of the English countryside that is simply stunning, but when you look a little closer, you see cars in the background. It made me laugh, but it did not distract me too much from the overall image. Nowadays, this type of cinema is very strange, and, interestingly, it seems that only the British have the capacity to produce it. Films like "Love, Actually" or "Vicar of Dibley" demonstrate the power and emotion of the people of the community, places where everyone knows everyone and we are not afraid of being neighbors. This is more a topic that the American public could have more of? more understanding of what is happening outside, instead of remaining isolated from your own events. <br /> <br /> In general, I loved the "Railway Children". I did not know what to expect when I first put it on the VHS player, but from the opening scene to the train burst and Perks' birthday, Jeffries showed that he could handle the most kid-friendly story with ease. Her ability to make children's actors feel like real characters, to involve less adults and to involve children as adults was outstanding. This is a movie to be seen as a strong alternative to anything Disney throws. The topics of friendship, kindness towards strangers and forgiveness that happen continuously cross the TV with grace and power. "Railway Children" is more than just a children's movie; It is a characteristic that should be a basic element for the modern audience. Not only does it give a great visual aspect to the English countryside, but it also teaches (and shows) how life would be greater with an emphasis on imagination and courage, rather than fighting any kind of CGI.
