If you have not seen it yet, you should do it on DVD. I can not believe how much I enjoyed it! It is incredibly realistic and credible. It is true that much of this is speculated, and I would have liked to know more about what was speculative and what was demonstrated (there are not many of them), but it handles everything very well with the theme "The cruel mother nature" . . It will remind you of the nature shows you've seen on Animal Planet and Discovery Channel, only the animals here are dinosaurs. They act naturally. They eat, kill, mate, play and struggle to survive. Actually, you will find yourself encouraging some and against others. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the effects are excellent. Sometimes they will look too much like CGI, but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic. In some cases, you will be really convinced that you have seen a dinosaur. My favorites were the Coelophysis, the raptors, the diplodocus, the iguanadones, the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds. However, I was very disappointed by the T-Rex, which at times seemed too computer-generated. <br /> <br /> In any case, you should definitely see this production. It's educational, well done and very entertaining. For what it is, it is an A!
