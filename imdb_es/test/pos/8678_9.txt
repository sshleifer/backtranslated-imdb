Andreas arrives in a strange city. He does not remember where he came from or how he got there. He is ordered to come to work and get his own apartment in the city. All of his co-workers are kind and polite to him, say hello and smile when they pass by him. But then, later, Andreas discovers that the city is not as nice as it seems. When he went home from work, he saw some people in gray suits, wiping the bloody mess from a corpse, apparently a suicidal victim who had thrown himself out the window. The procedure is carried out with a calm mind, as if they were emptying a trash can. The next day, Andreas meets the suicidal victim completely alive at work. More and more, Andreas discovers the insensitive environment of the city. <br /> <br /> Den brysomme mannen could be the best Norwegian movie I've seen. The original artistic direction is usually absent in Norwegian films, with few exceptions. The plot is also very original, and could even be called postmodern horror, since the film presents us with a frightening idea of ​​having to deal with a world that has no feelings. and the more you try to fill your life in this city with a meaning, the more meaningless it becomes. I am fascinated by how the director manages to create the sensation of a disemboweled universe, a nightmare, from which you simply can not escape, not even with death. <br /> <br /> Go see it, it's really worth it! I gave 9 of 10.
