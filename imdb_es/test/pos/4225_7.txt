This new installment of the series Child's Play does not have a terrifying scene, but a lot of funny jokes, like a fool who witnessed Chucky giving him the finger and saying "rude f - king doll" and many references to the series: "You can kill I will return. The title of the movie was probably thought before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all the other movies in the series. He does not even have Andy, the central character of all the previous ones. Chucky seems to interfere with the characters of another movie, a soap opera about two teenagers who escape together to get married. There is a scene of elaborate fresh death that involves broken glass and water spilling everywhere. The film is very bloody, very funny and has references to pop culture from Martha Stewert to Jerry Springer. DO NOT SEE THIS BEFORE SEEING THE OTHER THREE. It will really ruin the effect since the first one is really scary. A lot of guilty fun and nonsense. <br /> <br />
