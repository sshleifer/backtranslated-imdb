Campfire Tales (1997) <br /> <br /> An excellent work peace. Everything about this movie is just perfect. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great cast as you can see in IMDb. The reason I brought the movie was because of Christine Taylor and the love of horror movies. let's get to the main parts <br /> <br /> 1. there are 4 teenagers in this movie, after crashing their car they decide to tell some creepy stories 2. there are 3 stories and the main plot (the 4 teenagers are the plot main) 3. The best story is "people can also lick" in my opinion. the less frightening story is possibly the "honeymoon" or the second story (I do not remember the name "<br /> <br /> 4." people can also lick "is about a man who pretends to be a girl 13 years old (over the Internet), start talking to a girl named Amanda and then go home, this story will make you think twice before chatting with someone online, basically, a pervert enters your home and things they get creepy. <br /> 5. The main plot is sweet and simple, teenagers crash, tell stories, try to scare each other, but there is a very good turn at the end. <br /> <br /> the only one bad part of This movie is, teenagers crash their car with another couple, but children do not bother to see if the couple is okay, they only talk about the couple they have crashed with. <br /> <br /> The men and women who made this film managed to scare people, not to make money. "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer", this movie is created to scare you. "Scream" and "I know what you did." Ultimate sumo er "were made to make Big Time effective. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was not publicized as publicly as the scream was, it is still 10 times better than shouting and" I know what you did. last summer. "<br /> <br /> the characters in this movie are great and have realistic characteristics.The actors who play these characters are great.Christine Taylor does a fabulous job with Lauren, she does not exaggerate with the acting. The guy who plays Eric (Laurens' younger brother) also does a good job of showing that men or teenagers can be scared too, screams are like a fake movie, the killer is a joke and children are stupid. br /> <br /> Unlike shouting and "I know what you did last summer," this movie has realistic people, it's not a joke. It should have been more noticed.
