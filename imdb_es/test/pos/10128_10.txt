Normally I'm not a Drama / Feel good type of movie, but once I saw the "Radio" trailer, I could not resist. Not only is it a great movie, but it also has a great performance. Cuba Gooding Jr. did an excellent job representing James Robert Kennedy, a.k.a. "Radio". Ed Harris also did a fantastic job as Coach Jones. I was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy in it as well. So for a great story, a great performance and a little comedy, I give "Radio" 10 out of 10!
