It was very sensitive very deep. It's my favorite all the time, you can not watch a movie deeper than this amazing movie. Susan Sarandon played her role as a mature mental actress, and she realized her role. She deserved the prize. She convinced me to be a nun. The music was very impressive and sensitive. I really liked this profound masterpiece.
