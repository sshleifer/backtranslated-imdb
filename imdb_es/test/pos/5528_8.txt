I saw Six of a Kind for W.C. Fields: it only takes 10 minutes and it has a long scene, the famous pool sequence that made it famous in vaudeville and several other great moments. The 55 minutes of re-entry are also charming, fortunately, mainly due to the hilarious Charlie Ruggles as the banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He is everyone's role. Stutters and stumbles to our liking. In addition, his comedy companion, Mary Boland plays his wife, Flora. George Burns and Gracie Allen join the process. Boland is particularly fun near the beginning and near the end, but Gracie and Ruggles consume most of the image. Gracie is funny, pretty, but she can also get tired. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat Gracie all the time. I do not remember laughing at him once (although he has a big scene with Ruggles, where Ruggles desperately tries to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone, and another to Fields, where he asks Fields to do it. Sell ​​him a sweater, but that part is exclusively from Fields The situation is constantly fun: the Whinneys are going to drive to California, but to help with the expenses, they recruit George and Gracie.
