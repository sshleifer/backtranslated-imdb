This movie is really sick and funny. I have made my friends shudder by describing them. I saw it about 8 months ago, and I still have the song "Will we meet in the river?" Echoing in my head. <br /> <br /> So, basically, it's a Romeo and Juliet, but it goes beyond that. what you expect Let's just say incest, references to child sexual abuse, gore (of course), but unfortunately, it has a kind of happy ending ... more or less ... it's weirder than happy. Cappy Capulet was brilliant! He has this kind of snobbish intellectual tone, he is abusive, but civilized. He quotes Shakespeare more than anyone in the movie ... all while engaged in his sadistic role as husband and father. <br /> <br /> The character of the flesh was also great. He was Juliet's fiance, deeply in love with her, and soon he would be disconsolate for Tromeo. And I'm kidding, a true romantic. He is a handsome boy, very sweet, desperate to find true love. 'She makes torches to burn brightly!' Unfortunately, Troma just had to resort to that horrible fake green vomit and his other antics. They really get carried away by those things sometimes. But hey, this movie impressed me a lot. How often do I refer to him in real-life situations ... wow, that's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enjoy it!
