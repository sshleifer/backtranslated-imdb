I have seen this great movie at the Fantasyfilmfest in Berlin and when I left the cinema I felt like I had been drugged * g *! I have really seen many movies and there are some that I would call perfect like Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Subliminal cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people who saw him in Berlin left the room and I can understand this absolutely because it can be a real shock for someone who lives in his perfect world day by day dreaming his dreams without thinking of the horror on our planet-in our lifetime! I do not think I have to describe the history of the film to you because of the people who have already written on this page! It is a movie that shows everything and more !!! Get 10 points + of 10 !!! It would be great if people who have also seen it want to write me an email too! So far I have not met anyone so impressed and pleased as I am! Finally, sorry for my bad English. I am not a studied person (und das ist auch gut so !!! :-)))))
