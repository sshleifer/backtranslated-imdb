Intelligent psychosexual drama about a wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood) seeking refuge in a secluded Confederate school for young women during the Civil War. Slowly, Eastwood begins to seduce all the girls in sight, until the tables are changed and becomes the pursued in a disturbing end and gothic tones. It has never been a film so deliciously erotic but at the same time macabre at the same time. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the best time of Eastwood (those who tune "Dirty Harry" will be surprised), while the rest of The cast gives uniformly excellent performances. Try watching the movie on video, since television impressions usually eliminate crucial flashback scenes between Geraldine Page and Patrick Culliton.
