What a trip on the path of memory. <br /> <br /> Do not look for credible and excellent acting plot lines, or anything that looks like a quality movie. <br /> <br /> This is pure blaxploitation at its best. Scandalous costumes, unrepeatable dialogues, the objectification of women and the laziest policemen you can imagine. <br /> <br /> This vanity piece of the "Godfather of Rap", Rudy Ray Moore, who left us forever last week, is the standard by which all blaxploitation is measured. <br /> <br /> You not only see blaxploitation at its finest, but you also glimpse its comedy genius and see why its records were stored under the counter.
