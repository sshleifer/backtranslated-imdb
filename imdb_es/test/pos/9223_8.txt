The first time I saw this movie was when I was very small. I was born in 1985, so it was around the age when the 80 cartoons were great. My mother recorded it one day thinking that I might like it. I had never heard of the Rainbow Bright TV program before I was introduced to the film. When I saw it (on one of those old BETA tapes ...) I loved it. I became addicted to her. There are people who say it's badly written and all that, but it's a movie for kids, and things like that do not really matter to kids. I loved the story, and especially I liked the songs and all the female characters. Of course, I pretended to be them, and in the scene where Rainbow met Krys and refused to have to work with the opposite sex, I could totally relate. History was the basic good against the evil enjoyed by children, and there were enough happy moments to balance fears. The world is a fantastic place that would stimulate the imagination of any small child. I am very happy to have had the opportunity to see this movie when I was little. It had a great impact, and seeing it now brings back happy memories of childhood. I would recommend any parent with young children to rent this movie. It will activate your imagination and provide a lot of entertainment. You're only a kid once, so do not let them miss it!
