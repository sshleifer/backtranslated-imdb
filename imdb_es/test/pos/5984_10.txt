This is one of my favorite movies; a charming comedy; so I was delighted to hear that it's about to be released on a DVD in the UK in September 2007. <br /> <br /> Romuald, played by Daniel Auteuil, is a rich president of a dairy company . Juliette, played by the excellent Firmine Richard, is a cleaner at the company's offices in Paris. Juliette, a black mother of several children, discovers a plot against Romuald who initially ignores his attempts to warn him. Slowly, he understands what this lovely lady of the lower Parisian class has been trying to tell him. he seeks refuge in his cramped apartment while his marriage and career crumble. An improbable love blooms. The cultures collide in what is a truly charming gay comedy.
