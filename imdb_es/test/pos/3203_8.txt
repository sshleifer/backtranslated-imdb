The Killing Yard is a great movie, although sometimes it is unequal. Morris Chestnut makes a phenomenal effort as prisoner of a mentally wounded prison and with judicial problems, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and harsh reality represented in the "flashback" scenes of this film have the ability to put viewers directly in the middle of the events that are represented. I was not even born when the Attica riots took place; however, through extensive research, I discovered that "The Killing Yard" makes the story of all just judges. I would definitely recommend this movie for any educational or activist group to see as a much-needed learning tool.
