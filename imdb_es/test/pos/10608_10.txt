I just finished watching Marigold today and will start by saying that I found this DVD on the Blockbuster shelves. While walking around looking for something new and good to see, Ali Larter's picture caught my eye. <br /> <br /> After drooling over Ali Larter, I lifted the lid and continued looking around the cover. Apparently, I thought the costumes were a bit exaggerated. And then I saw the other Indians on the cover and I thought this was kind of a fake movie or something. <br /> <br /> When I turned the part of the synopsis and saw Salman Khan, I made a double shot. . Salman Khan in an American movie with Ali Larter on a DVD on Blockbuster? As Salman Khan is for Bollywood films like Mel Gibson for Hollywood movies, I had high expectations for this movie: I HAD to be good! I am pleased to say that Marigold is a phenomenal movie! It far exceeded all my personal expectations! <br /> <br /> I suppose a movie like this is what happens when you have a decent script, a talented, experienced, expert and goal-oriented director, with two incredible actors performing the main roles and only one cast and team working very hard! Khan and Larter seem to have great chemistry together and both shine on the big screen: they look great together. The musical numbers were not bad at all, which was surprising, considering how muscular and long the musicals of Indian films are these days. And you'll be happy to know that the costumes of India are far from being corny, as you will get. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, the medium was really good, the scenes bring to the climax was quite dramatic, but the ending was just amazing! However, I have some complaints and complaints about the DVD. While I loved the widescreen aspect ratio of the DVD, I did not like the fact that several other things were left out of the DVD. For starters, there are no subtitles. Now that English is my first language, it is not a problem. However, when some of the actors and actresses of India spoke, it was (sometimes) difficult to understand what they were saying; The subtitles would have helped. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I would have liked on the DVD would be a defective roll or some kind of collection of shots. And finally, how about a menu function that allows us to jump directly to the musical numbers? Man, some of those songs were really good! On the other hand, I enjoyed watching Marigold a lot. <br /> <br /> I have many more things to say about the genius of this movie and how much I liked it, but I do not have time or time. Do I want to continue writing why I enjoyed it so much? I hope that Salman Khan makes more films in English besides his Hindi films and I certainly hope that this Hindi movie is not the latest Bollywood film by Ali Larter. And I encourage the director to continue making hybrid Bollywood films with Salman Khan, Ali Larter and other renowned actors, just make sure the scripts are original and good. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - this is just a great one A love story that your whole family can enjoy!
