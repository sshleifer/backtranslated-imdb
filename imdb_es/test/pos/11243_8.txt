Sure, it seems there's only about 17 minutes of real content in each episode, but it's certainly fun to watch. You may find yourself cowering in your chair when the friend puts his foot in his mouth and is shot, or he laughs and shakes his head when a ridiculous line really works. The host panel has a more affable and friendly comment style (I dare say Canadian) compared to the ruthless programming of the American reality. I think people who complain about this show do not understand the joke. They are taking the show more seriously than the show takes itself. Keys to the VIP is a great caricature of reality shows, the culture of sports television and the club scene. I hope they do another season, and I would like to see if an American version appears. It is without a doubt a funny, original premise.
