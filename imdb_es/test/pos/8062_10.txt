As good as Schindler's list was, I found this film much more powerful as it is a documentary and is based on real life. It details the history of the Frank family, and Anne in particular. Although it is a bit slow at first (it details his family life before the war); It becomes very powerful. <br /> <br /> Due to some of the images and photographs of the camps, I would not recommend it to children, but to adults, it illustrates the horror of the Holocaust through a girl. Highly recommended
