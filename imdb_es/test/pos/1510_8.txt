A Gatto nel Cervello, or Nightmare Concert, as it is best known among the English-speaking public, begins when the horror film director Lucio Fulci (played by Lucio Fulci himself) goes to lunch after filming a very bloody and violent scene , however, orders a steak And has a horrible vision related to cannibalism. Grotesque visions, hallucinations and dreams continue and begin to affect your mental state. Fulci decides to seek help and contacts with Professor Egon Schwarz (Dvid L. Thompson) to obtain psychiatric help. Schwarz claims that Fulci can not separate the fantasy from reality and agrees to help him, however, Schwarz has a more sinister ulterior motive when a serial killer begins to brutally kill prostitutes and Fulci believes he could be responsible ... <br / > <br /> This Italian production was co-written and directed by Lucio Fulci, who also stars in the film as a horror film director named Lucio Fulci, who does not seem to have been much effort, anyway A Gatto nel Cervello It's bloody if nothing else and that's why I just liked it more. The screenplay by Fulci, John Fitzsimmons, Giovanni Simonelli and Antonio Tentori is no more than a simple excuse to edit together many bloody images from other Italian films. I suppose it fulfills its purpose. Seeing Fulci on the screen has a certain fascination if you are a fan of him or are familiar with his films, the end is very hasty, almost as if he had run out of money, since he only has one policeman. Telling Fulci that they killed the killer and that's it. Another thing about the end when the two policemen put the white sheet over the dead assassin in the field and then walked away leaving it there without any other police presence, I mean if the police in Italy would leave a corpse in the middle of a field in itself ? It moves at a good pace and if you like your blood, then you have to see this, although if you do not like blood, you will hate it with passion, everything depends on your disposition, so the chosen people are yours. <br /> <br /> Director Fulci was never the most skillful filmmaker from an artistic point of view and is shown here because his images are vapid, flat and it seems that they were filmed for television, the images of the other films (7). in total) they do not match the things that Fulci shot and it is obvious that this has been assembled from different movies. If you are looking for gore, you have reached the boat, people are dismembered with chain saws, move through meat mills, faces melt, there are some decapitations, there are some slit throats, someone's body is crushed with force under a car, a tongue is ripped out, someone has his throat crushed while a wheelchair goes through it, there are lots of stabs, someone has the gills removed with a hook, there is a rotten corpse complete with worms, someone cuts his hand , someone has their head banged in and their eyes drop, a bloody death by the piano wire while cutting through someone's throat, there are a lot of cut limbs, blood chests dotted around and a scene of some cats eating brains and there is also more. Having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake and look corny. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of around $ 100,000, it looks pretty cheap, has no visual style or artistic merit, but then again, why would you want those when you can see a sequence of orgy Nazi and gore from wall to wall? The acting in this is terrible, including Fulci. <br /> <br /> A Gatto nel Cervello is an important movie if you are a hunting dog like me, however, if you are looking for something with a little more substance or any substance then these are not for you. This is the kind of movie that divides people in half, or you'll love what you do or hate it.
