This is a dazzling, but sober adaptation of the Thomas Mann novel of the same title. Dirk Bogarde offers his best performance on the screen, he believed it. The dialogue is minimal, so his face must register the nuances of his anguished character: a composer (a writer in the novel), the only major alteration that travels to Venice in 1910. Visconti delights in the portrait of beauty, is happening, and The essence of decomposition. Trained as an opera director, Visconti combines the music and images of Mahler to perfection in his best film since "The Leopard" (another impressive film, which greatly influenced Coppola's Sicily in the "Godfather").
