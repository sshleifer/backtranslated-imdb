Where do I start? Walt Disney's happiest movie, "The Lady and the Tramp," is one of my favorites in the theatrical canon of Disney animation. The sequel, however, is ... to say the least, nice. I had fun throughout the entire movie. It was, (flame shield up!) Adorable! The Broadway style of the songs and the movie worked, and I was humming the songs for the rest of the night. I can, if they ask me, keep singing all the songs. <br /> <br /> But where the movie was (really) good for me, it was bad in many other places. The animation was sometimes scary. Every time there was a shot close to someone's face, I do not know ... it just seemed terrifying. Besides, where the hell was Lady? It gets like two lines of dialogue and only Doggy hugs Scamp at the end. Get 0% interaction with the plot and your only child! <br /> <br /> But in general, I liked it. Compared to the original, he says? No. The songs are not so good (although still sticky), the plot was less complicated, Lady had almost nothing to do with that, and is not as cute as the first. But, if you go with an open mind, you'll have fun and maybe "gasp!" Like?
