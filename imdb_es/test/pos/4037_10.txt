The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I've seen: much better and deeper than the Romeo & Juliet of Luhrman or the Titanic of Spielberg. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong and loving woman throughout the film. Kay is the poisoner of the dark forces: temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY one, for the love of my life, for Mr. Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time I notice the suffering of Gerda and Kay. And I want it to end soon ... Snowqueen says that, although in my life, I identify deeply with the story and the characters. Thank you at least for Hans Christian Anderson and the director.
