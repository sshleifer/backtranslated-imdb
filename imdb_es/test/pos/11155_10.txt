Although I agree that it was a 1950s comedy, I do not think it was "typical". First, Donna Reed was a STRONG woman, unlike 50-year-old moms. She defended the value and equality of women (recalls the episode in which the television announcer says "only a housewife") and Donna defends what all women do and represent, especially those who do not work outside the home . And when women rebelled against something in the series, it was not trivial ... it was always something to show that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men. Remember, Donna Reed was married to the show's producer, so she had a lot more input to make her a more powerful character. <br /> <br /> The children were intelligent, but not precocious. They were normal children. And they could ACT. <br /> <br /> Another thing that made Donna Reed Show stand out was that the children did not look like their parents, but they could feel the chemistry between all the actors in the real life situation, Then it came out in the characters. Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson often wrote and commented that they were treated as the children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz, and that the adults were fiercely protective of the children's actors and treated them accordingly. Donna and Alex also had a kind of sexual chemistry that was not seen in the other family programs. And the characters can be defective, and to a large extent, and still, accepted by defects and mistakes. These were not super parents who were not wrong and had no emotional ups and downs. They were normal people who acted like normal people. <br /> <br /> Women's rights, drug abuse, child abuse, single parents, poverty, children who need good health care but can not afford it ... everything was shown in this program Quite innovative for the era. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed's show did not last for eight years without a reason. And I could have endured it, if it had not been for the divorce of Tony Owens and Donna Reed. <br /> <br /> This show is highly underestimated and must be shown so that other generations can appreciate the quality. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree with the original poster, which obviously cares about the show, but I think the Donna Reed show has much more to offer than casual entertainment.
