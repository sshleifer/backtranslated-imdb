When reading the comments, there seems to be a lot of nonsense about La Pianiste's emotional banality. I find this difficult to understand given the excellent performance of Isabelle Huppert. Huppert is passionate, he manages to perfectly convey the woman to the limit, full of hatred and deceit. <br /> <br /> The movie has a wonderful rhythm and is judged. It would be as easy to portray the protagonist as a ridiculous figure, for example, consider the scene in the pornography shop. Somehow, Huppert can carry it out, partly because of his brilliant acting but also because the director makes his surreal life real and identifiable. <br /> <br /> Do not ignore this movie. It is one of the most amazing and attractive films (and performances) I've seen. <br /> <br /> Trust Boris!
