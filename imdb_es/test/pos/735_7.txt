I just discovered this dark horror movie of the 70s while browsing YouTube. For a low budget effort, it has many convincing moments of gradual pace that lead to the surprising and surprising end. While there is a woman who constantly takes off her shirt, the fact that she is a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important for the story and there is a scene with the young man with curly hair when he tries to seduce her, that excites me before he retires . He made her scream crazy. The young nurse who enters and is hired is being attracted and I am not surprised that she posed for the cover of Playboy. Some characters are very irritating and some scenes seem ridiculous. However, for the most part, Do not look in the basement (that's the title I saw on YouTube) provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining B-movie.
