For reasons unknown, this beautiful masterpiece did not receive well-deserved recognition and has been much underestimated by many American film critics. Then it is easy to understand that I have encountered many problems when trying to find this movie. I finally saw it and it was so beautiful, sincere and moving that, for the first time in my life, I watched a movie five times in a week after I got the tape. The story focuses on the friendship between two young men, Erik and Dexter, aged eleven and twelve, who are very different from each other, but are becoming the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendship have been shown in the Cure as sincerely and naturally as never before. There are so many beautiful, sincere and moving scenes (particularly in the river), that they strike the heart and can not leave them indifferent to humans. The film is also filled with an incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism (particularly strong with Erik's shoe) that also greatly increases the visual impression of such a beautiful work. The story, written by Robert Kuhn, is well written and, on the contrary, the overwhelming majority of modern Hollywood products, virtually every scene, every phrase and every phrase of the film is significant and contribute something important about the characters and the relationships between them. Peter Horton, who, as I know, had no significant experience in directing films before, showed his great skills and talents in this sphere. The cinematography is also excellent with perfectly selected locations for the film, but the most important is the perfect performance, which with all the above makes The Cure one of the best films in history. Both Brad Renfro and Erik and Joseph Mazello and Dexter created a wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and superb chemistry between two main characters. Only one of these films (I have not seen most of his other works) is enough to name them as one of the best actors of his generation. Annabelle Sciorra also offers an excellent performance as Dexter's mother. It is terribly sad that such talented actors did not get widespread recognition, while many overrated stars enjoy enormous publicity and huge salaries. Finally, it would be unfair not to mention the incredible soundtrack written by David Grusin and the fantastic song by Mark Cohn (one of the best songs I've heard in the movies) My Great Escape. So all I can say about The Cure is a simple word? cool. In any point of view, this film is a beautiful, sincere and inspiring work of all the people involved in the realization of this masterpiece. I have to give credit to all those people who put their hearts and souls into the film and Universal Pictures, who among numerous commercial formula projects has found a way to make such a beautiful film. But such a film seldom reaches movie theaters that, very often, the studios themselves do not realize the jewel they have made of not being able to offer a respective marketing campaign. The only minor drawback of The Cure for me is its short duration (only 97 minutes). <br /> <br /> I do not want to write more about the film because it is simply impossible to express its beauty and its sincerity, so if you have any chance to see The Cure, rent it or buy it. I would not be disappointed <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. I'm sorry for my bad English.
