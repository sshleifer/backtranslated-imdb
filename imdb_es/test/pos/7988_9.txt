When I rented Batman Returns for the first time, I immediately thought that it would be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was definitely the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? Simple, throw Danny DeVito. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is a darker movie than Batman. There are more villains here, less real dark comedy in many aspects and more problems that attract attention. However, the music is similar to the first, if not darker. The landscape is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail until the time of year. This movie follows the same comic format that we came to love in the first Batman. <br /> <br /> Now for the presentations. Michael Keaton fortunately returns as Batman / Bruce Wayne. It was great in the first movie, and so much in this sequel. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, I need MORE! Danny DeVito gave an award-winning performance as The Penguin, the most strenuous, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad and pathetic villain who has ever seen a superhero movie. You hate him so much, but you feel so bad for him at the same time. And that explains it to the last detail, which makes it even more conflictive. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman / Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She also got a good amount of background story too. Christopher Walken did not disappoint Max Shreck, the greedy, critical and selfish CEO of the power company. Michael Gough also fortunately returns as the lovely Alfred, and he was also so good here. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, although I think he never really was in the limelight. <br /> <br /> With many excellent twists and subplots, Batman Returns will surely please any fan of the original. <Br /> <br /> 9/10
