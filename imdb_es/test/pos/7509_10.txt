This film is George C. Scott at his best, Bernard Hughes at his best and Diana Rigg at its best, and of course Paddy Chaevsky writing in "masterpiece" warp! There are also very brief fragments of future biggies like Susan Sarandon, Stockard Channing, etc., that have a scene line that you do not necessarily detect until your fifth or sixth time watching. Nancy Marchand, as a nurse supervisor at a young age, is also excellent, as well as practically all the "faces" in Hollywood in 1970. <br /> <br /> It is one of the few films that improves the more Sometimes you see that. Watch for the "surprise" scene and the "Wait until it gets dark"! This is one of the few movies I've bought on DVD. It's that superb.
