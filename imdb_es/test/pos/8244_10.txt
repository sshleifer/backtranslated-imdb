I must say that I know Mister Ã–rnek's documentaries, so I knew that I will get a very well-made film documentary. I was not disappointed. As a nerd of the story, I saw hundreds of documentaries and I liked the different approach of this work. <br /> <br /> The Director and his 17 Consultants (historians, families of veterans) tried to access the reality of the gallipoli through the letters of welds on both sides. Then, the story is followed by British, Australian and Turkish soldiers. <br /> <br /> Narrated is this document by Jeremy Irons and Sam Neill; both increase the intensity and emotion of this documentary by its great voices. <Br /> <br /> I saw this movie in a cinema in Italy in Dolby Surround. I bought the DVD last year and will wait 3 to 7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentaries. <br /> <br /> Summary: Well done. Intense. History with emotions - wrapped in a war documentary with great storytellers.
