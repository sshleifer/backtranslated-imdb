You know, people who make comedies often forget that it's great to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional love has everything. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as romantic protagonist ... and it works. It does not just work, it works very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard that I think I hurt myself, but the main characters were all so human, so honest and so real. But is not that where the big comedies come from? Do not the characters need real feelings, real emotions and the ability to feel real pain? Well, they do it in this movie. Unconditional love is a movie you should not miss, especially if you need a good laugh, or if you are curious to see a psychotic dwarf in a red raincoat.
