Some may think that Imaginary Heroes is a movie exactly like "Igby Goes Down", but it is not. In Imaginary Heroes, the director lets us feel for the Travis family and the people around them. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is great, and the acting is extremely well done. The performance of Weaver and Hirsch is credible and helps make the film what it is. The actors, director / writer, Dan Harris, have made a movie that a lot of people should see. Do not think it's just another movie for teenagers, it's a movie about a family and its problems. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 10/10 because I think it's not the best movie, that no film can be, but it's as close as it can get to perfection.
