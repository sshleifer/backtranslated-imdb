This movie was a piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood and the little things that shaped Tom Hank's. Using a very cryptic story, they could give you an idea of ​​what really happened to the character of Tom Hank as a child. And while scenes like the flying machine may never have happened, it helped show how even denial can help to tell the truth. In good conscience, I could not qualify this below a 9 out of 10, great performances by all the actors, and while many have not understood the cryptic ending in which his brother is killed by his stepfather, and Tom Hanks covers using A crazy story about a flying machine, pay close attention to the little details, like the turtle you still have, even though your brother "flew" with it. Truly, a beautiful piece of cinema, and each actor deserves recognition for it.
