Recently, finally available on DVD (11/11/08), the film by Severo Pérez ... and the Earth did not swallow (1994) is based on one of the most recognized and discussed novels in Chicano literature. The criticism of Tomás Rivera ... and the land did not swallow him / ... and The Earth did not devour him (1972) is generally recognized by many critics and serious readers like the classic Chicano novel. Originally written in the Spanish characteristic of South Texas and also translated into English, Rivera's novel continues as an indispensable presence within the Chicano literary landscape. <br /> <br /> Perez's film, originally made as a highly rated American Playhouse PBS production, has taken a while to be released on DVD. One can only wonder about this matter because its high quality is not a problem. The film, and now the DVD, however, remains, as far as I know, the only film adaptation of any Chicano novel and clearly is a tribute to the incredible power of permanence of the Earth. This film version also has an exceptionally rooted nerve, that is, both are specifically ethnic, but also universal. Perhaps doubts have arisen about the Earth because it is too "ethnic", too foreign to a mainstream American, too indie "foreign", too limited in economic resources. However, in his art version, Pérez, in my opinion, connects in a very effective, artistic way and creates a very marked representation of a community of Chicano immigrants that focuses on daily family life. As for a production made with relatively limited economic resources, his charming cinematographic work and disturbing music go far beyond his available funding. The simple fact of watching the film shows the artistic value of this film (or DVD). <br /> <br /> In a few words, and the Earth did not swallow him, he portrays in a neotural way the difficult situation, the suffering and the despair of the Chicano migrant workers as they continue the crops northward from the south of Texas to Minnesota in 1952. Local priests bless the battered and overburdened vehicles of these Chicano workers who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the agricultural trail of the migrant worker to the north. This Chicano community, like the Joads of the depression era in Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, forms an epic tide, driven by economic need, an instinct for survival and anguished despair, and ultimately, a barely flickering faith. . A tribute to these people of the earth, a collective hero, the DVD focuses on a focal family, and the most especially emblematic is a young protagonist within the family, a child, maybe twelve. This work then, also, works as a bildungsroman. Ultimately, the viewer's sense of identification is generated through the experiences, subjectivity and struggles of the protagonist. Poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (heatstroke and death due to pregnancy), discrimination, school absenteeism (the escapism of the child of the harassers of discrimination is spent in a beautiful and peaceful cemetery) are revealed as matter of fact. , also symbolically. Worse yet, the problematic conflict between the young man and his mother goes beyond socio-economic and political conflicts to the deeper realms of psychology and metaphysics. In a desperate but artistic struggle, the young man fights against his mother, an archetypal Mexican-traditionalist, representative of the will of God, satisfied with prayer, resignation, consolation and acceptance. Young rebels can not believe in a god who would allow such evil and suffering to be visited. How can God be so cruel, he asks, since his little sister is, without doubt, purely innocent, as to suffer a serious illness in the fields? At this point, the child must overcome even more discouraging obstacles than poverty and discrimination. The problems now include death, doubt, despair and lack of meaning. And he has few resources available to him: strength of character, his own willpower, his intelligence and a powerful instinct for survival. In this desperate struggle, but artistically translated, the nameless young man, the central figure, feels the need for it to endure, for it to achieve a greater sense of meaning and, the spectator expects, a renewed and strengthened Life Force that can serve as a an inspiration for Chicanos and others. <br /> <br /> This tough battle uses a plot device that has just played the original job to unite the episodic work: missing immigrant workers from Mexico who leave no trace of their death, although this DVD is not about migrant workers Mexicans but from Mexico and the United States. A highly existential work: anguish and despair; a search a focus on a project; and redemption, all under the auspices of free will despite the socio-economic and religious determining circumstances. <br /> <br /> Perez has a long list of credits, basically as a documentary maker. His numerous awards are confirmatory. Producer Paul Espinosa is also known and has also been honored for his work. The 1994 movie, in fact, won and won several awards: first place, favorite audience at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1995; First place at the Cairo Film Festival; and a series of other well-deserved awards. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie and DVD, Earth, by Perez is the best Chicano movie ever made.
