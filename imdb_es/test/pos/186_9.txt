This is a magnificent film, and in many ways impressive. I saw him on television as a small child, with my throat almost strangled by tears, and again today on the magnificent restored DVD Criterion. <br /> <br /> Cranes is the very essence of War Weepie. Imagine the umbrellas of Cherbourg without music and without color, or the Waterloo bridge without class consciousness. <br /> <br /> Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, is deeply affecting her as a beautiful girl whose boyfriend enlists and does not do. Do not write or come back. <br /> <br /> The boyfriend, Boris, dies in the front, and his death scene is indescribably romantic. Very daring too, because very close to "above". But that scene will stay with you. <br /> <br /> Although the Soviets were so defined by World War II, the film is quite nonspecific and more powerful for her. The pre-war and post-war scenes have a very 1957 feel. There is no attempt at detail of the time. The whole film becomes more and more stylized, even the Siberian scenes, which feel like a modern opera set (it's a compliment). The final cathartic scene is milked to its last drop, again, comparable to Cherbourg. The production feels like a big budget (those scenes of stairs must have cost a nice kopek). <br /> <br /> Go ahead. Do not expect a bitter socialist pill (although it is, of course, very sad). The cranes are flying is an impressive section of the world cinema, quite advanced considering where and when it was made.
