I saw this movie with the hope of a good laugh, but when I saw it I did not stop laughing for weeks, they are such bad actors and this movie was much more fun to watch. (By the way, Ryan Dunn did not eat the toy car, he stuck it in his ass) The random appearances of the skaters and parts of Vitos were great. Give me some Vito grapes! No Valo, your grapes are in the store. I would not recommend anyone under 13 to see it, frankly, they would not understand half the jokes or what they are talking about. I love VLB and after watching this movie I could not help going to buy it or the Viva La Bam series. What is the deal with this stupid comment? It has to be 10 lines, what kind of Bull-sh1t is that? I should be able to write one as long or, in this case, as short as I want. I will continue writing until you tell me that I can send it. It's just a waste of time, I just wanted to say what I wanted, it was not too much, but then they told me I had to keep putting more and then correct my spelling, and if I did not spell it? Something correct, you understand what I still want to say. This is ridiculously long. <br /> <br /> ~ Those who live by the Sword are shot by those who do not ~
