Finally! Third time lucky. This movie has always been in my mind, but the first time I saw it I forgot and I only got the second half of the movie. Then, just a couple of months later, I had the second chance to see it, so I decided to record it. Only to discover that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the movie. I was not going to let that happen again. So, when it reappeared on TV, I thought I'll wait until it turns on, then I'll record it. And it was a good choice. I had just watched the movie, but they always organized week nights around midnight. <br /> <br /> After discovering a hole in his crowded cell, nine prisoners escape their confinement to trace the key to the universe, which a fellow prisoner known as the Counterfeit King said he had hidden. They think that this key could be an opening for a hidden booty of counterfeit bills. On this trip, of course, they see this as an opportunity to resume their lives before they were imprisoned. Although things do not go the way they intended, most of the criminal plans went astray. <br /> <br /> "9 Souls" is a perky spiritual journey by the Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada, who launched his viewers to a film of two totally different halves. The first half of the story is more like a psychic comedy with criminal ties and situations in which they find themselves as the point of sale, but all that gives way to a second half full of moralistic dramas and consequences , where the real problem begins some rather unpleasant and bloody moments that replace the silly tone with which it began. While, the first half is pretty fun with your game on the road, doodling screwball and jokes out of the ordinary. But it is really the last part really disturbing with its peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you feel sympathy for these very human characters. Even though you are not really innocent of your crimes, you simply entrench yourself with these characters in the first half that when you see them spiraling in their fall, you know it is an effective drama when you get caught in the dramatic scene. change. The nine characters get enough screen time to really understand their personal history and the weakness that will eventually bring them down. The way the plot works is that Michiru and Torakichi are the main characters and, for the most part, we see it from their perspectives. The story about escapism is an unquestionably attractive study that is clear in its objective and raises many questions about society and the path it must choose to escape from life and free itself from these restrictions. <br /> <br /> Whereas, the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told. The visual element does not go unnoticed, because there is only a dream and trance environment that is channeled into a unique environment. What contributed HIGHLY to that factor and gave a boost to the film was the instrumental rock soundtrack of changing mood. The soft atmospheric gel that he was able to create in many scenes left me breathless with the eternal emotions he could provoke. Simply beautiful and frankly powerful control on that front. The rhythm of a film so long (2 hours) seems to go abruptly and the editing is done quickly, because we are very involved in everything. The hypnotic photography is sharp in detail. Whereas, the performances of the cast as a strange group of criminals are of high quality with each one providing enough personality and characteristics to separate. <br /> <br /> I discovered that "9 Souls" is a pleasant and surprising surreal movie that stirs emotions and then hits you with an almighty blow when you change direction. Highly recommended
