Glenn Close has returned as Sarah Plain and Tall, a woman who holds a family together in good times and bad. The performance is magnificent: Christopher Walken (unusually not spooky) as her husband once again offers top-notch performance. It's good to see young Christopher Bell as an adult; Too bad we can not see much Anna (Lexi Randall, also a few years older), but the new addition to the Witting family (played by Emily Osment) was very welcome. And, finally, Jack Palance, as the lost Patriarch Witting, is as good as ever.
