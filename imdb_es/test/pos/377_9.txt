In Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's "Strangers on A Train", Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet for the first time on a train trip and discuss the idea of ​​carrying out two murders . Anthony, who is quite aggressive, suggests that he could kill the infidel wife of Haines and that Haines could kill Anthony's dominant father. The lack of connection between the murderer and the victim in each case must guarantee that both crimes remain unresolved. The tenor of the conversation leaves Haines more relaxed with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious. Complications arise later when Anthony murders Haines' wife at an amusement park and then chases Haines to keep his side of the bargain. <br /> <br /> The differences between the two men are clear from the start. Haines is a professional tennis player, respectable and quite modest about his achievements, while Anthony's life is nowhere to be found and he admits to having been expelled from three universities for drinking and betting. Haines is in a relationship with the daughter of a senator with whom he wants to get married. Anthony interprets this as a cynical maneuver on the part of Haines to give him a shortcut to a race. The differences in character are also visually reinforced. Anthony often dwells in shaded areas and travels in a boat called "Pluto", while Haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by the low camera angles. <br /> <br /> There are some surprising visual sequences, such as: /> <br /> (1) The murder of Haines' wife that is shown through the reflection of her glasses that fall to the ground while fighting for free yourself from Anthony. <br /> <br /> (2) Representation of Anthony alone, dressed in black and very small against the huge white Jefferson Memorial building. <br /> <br /> (3) The occasion when all the spectators in a tennis match are moving their heads in unison, following the action, while a head (Anthony's) remains chilling in a position looking at Haines. <br /> <br /> (4) The scene in which the roundabout goes out of control and eventually crashes dramatically. <br /> <br /> Frequent use is made of "doubles" throughout history, for example, Haines and Anthony were originally presented as 2 p. Foot airs leave their cabs and go to the train. As the train leaves the station, there are 2 sets of tracks, each with a choice of 2 ways to advance. The 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskeys. Hitchcock's cameo sees him fighting on the train with a double bass. Haines feels crippled when his wife renounced an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to settle the divorce. Haines' wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends. When Anthony confronts her before the murder, he lights his lighter and produces 2 reflections in his glasses. Later, Anthony becomes disconcerted when he meets the senator's youngest daughter, whom he sees as a double for Haines' wife. Anthony also feels bowed down when Haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder. When Haines travels alone on a train going to Metcalf, he sees 2 men in the same carriage kicking his feet accidentally in the same way he and Anthony did. <br /> <br /> The action throughout the film continues at a great pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as the youngest daughter of the senator) are particularly powerful.
