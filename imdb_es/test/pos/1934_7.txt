One of the latest films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore, "Ten Cents to Dance" stars Barbara Stanwyck as the "Barbara" dance girl in her sixth role. Stanwyck looks quite "simple-jane" in this case, and opens when the director of the dance room berates her. Then comes rich guy Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez) who wants to knock it down. (Cortez and Stanwyck had made three movies together in the 1930s). Then he meets Eddie, who is very different from the handsome Carlton. The writer, Jo Swerling, had worked on some great ones (Its a Wonderful Life, Guys and Dolls, and Gone with the Wind), so I was surprised that the characters and the script were so common. The story begins to be more interesting halfway, and is VERY similar to "The Bride Walks Out" of 1936, ALSO starring Stanwyck .... T.B.W.O. It is much smarter, but also more docile, due to the application of the Hays code ...
