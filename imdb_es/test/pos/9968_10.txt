I saw The Merchant of Venice in London last week. Great performance by Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins. Compared to other films based on the work of Shakespeare, this production has made the work so easy to understand and follow. Bravo to Michael Radford for directing the best actors. The costumes and scenery are great and, since it was filmed in Venice, it gives the cinema an authentic flavor. I had read the play more than thirty years ago in school and the emphasis was on the anti-Semitic behavior of the characters towards the Jews and the cruelty of the Christians. I do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but, in any case, I'm sure it will get few Oscar nominations.
