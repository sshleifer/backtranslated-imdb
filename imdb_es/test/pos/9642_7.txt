I recommend to moviegoers that, if they are in the New York City area, visit the Intrepid Museum and have an idea of ​​how close the life of the crew members of the classic submarines of World War II was. How much more it must have been for the sailors during the First World War. It must have really been hell below. <br /> <br /> Walter Huston and Robert Montgomery head the cast of Hell Below, Huston as the book. Captain and Montgomery as his number two with free wheels. Both are quite credible as naval officers and the rest of the cast as Robert Young, Eugene Palette, Jimmy Durante, Madge Evans, Sterling Holloway, etc. they fulfill their roles quite well. <br /> <br /> Silent service became more popular during World War II and beyond. It's amazing, but I could name a lot of underwater images like Torpedo Run, Operation Pacific, Hellcats of the Navy, Run Silent, Run Deep and many more, and you'll see the same plot situations in all of them. I suppose there is also a limit in situations. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Durante's performance is interesting. It's quite funny and his scene with the boxing kangaroo while on land is very fun. But I would have to say that a character like him in those tight rooms is probably very necessary for morale. If you do not have someone like that to break the tension on board a submarine, you should transfer one to your ship immediately. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me is the Sterling Holloway death scene. Very similar to Sean McClory's on Island in the Sky. It will chase you long after you have seen this movie.
