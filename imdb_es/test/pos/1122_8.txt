This is a decent effort for a martial arts actor B-Movie. Ian Jacklin, a former American Cruiserweight Kickboxing Champion, is the leader and performs well in the action scenes. The muscular Matthias Hues has the opportunity to add more to his martial arts boy character in this film than in all his many others and, if you are a fan of The Teutonic Titan, rent this movie now! <br /> <br /> Renee Griffin is also remarkable as the romantic interest in this movie. She starts with attitude, but soon warms up with the hero and makes "The beast with two backs" in a very elegant way. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are good in the American tradition (NO Hong Kong stunts! Here!) with an added realism of having Benny "The Jet" Urquidez playing himself as John Larson's trainer (Jacklin) <br /> <br /> In general, this movie seems to have more side arguments than most in its genre, so get MORE than one story.
