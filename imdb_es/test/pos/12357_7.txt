I thought it would be a more fantastic story. But the subject is quite realistic compared to the story about the death car that I expected. In fact there is much more of a social drama. As usual in the "European authors' films". <br /> <br /> The actors are interesting, they do not exaggerate like in the average silent movie. The images are not good enough to be stuck in your mind like in Bergman's Smultronstället. <br /> <br /> This is true: the comparison between the two films is the main point here. Smultronstället begins with a vision of a car of Death in which the character of Sjöström can see his own body. There are watches without hands. He is forced to remember what he has done wrong. There is a vision of his happy family in the country. In Körkarlen, Sjöström's wife does not deceive him before her eyes, but she wants to run away with small children because she would never get better with him. Finally, Edit's confession is a kind of live trial. <br /> <br /> Well, I would only add that Sjöström destroying the door with an ax because his wife closed it and plans to leave with the children reminded me of The Brilliant. That it was much more of a fantasy tale with death circling.
