Well, this was not what I expected. I rented this movie just to see how it would be since I want to see the first one anyway. But, this movie had a B movie everywhere. But when I saw it I realized it was very funny. During the first 30 minutes It was like that the snowman was killing people and a man lost his sanity. But, those first few minutes had some funny line plotters on it. When He vomited the first of his little henchmen, I knew that this would be very, very funny. They all act like the gremlins on the ninteen eighty-four hit gremlins that made it look like I was faking and made me forget that it was a B movie. So if you like to laugh rent this one.
