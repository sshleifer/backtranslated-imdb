The Australian pilot Alex Frayne, born in the United Kingdom, draws attention for his strange, which requires a meticulous reading and a modern visually stunning love (2006). Following in the footsteps of a man unable to control a drastic personality change caused by the death of a close relative offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. <br /> <br /> John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill) and his son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small southern town to take care of their deceased uncle (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward check into a local hotel, John begins to question the locals about Uncle Tom's death; Some say he committed suicide, others are not willing to talk. Puzzled, John has a theory of his own: Uncle Tom is alive and well, hiding in the nearby bushes. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the occasional dialogue lines used to relieve their heavy atmospheric tone, Modern Love could have been easily mistaken for a Sokurov movie. Taken with a 16 mm camera, its faded color scheme is strangely reminiscent of the Russian director's reflections on human agony. It may not be a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival that Modern Love debuted. <br /> <br /> Looking beneath the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating images, however, reveals a slightly different image, while Sokurov's films tend to be painfully intimate, to a point where they intentionally separate the Main protagonists of the surrounding environment, erasing everything in a great touch of the director's favorite yellow, Modern Love feeds heavily on the Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation depends on it and the more the story progresses, the more it becomes clear that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. <br /> <br /> In Sokurov's second circle, a young man returns to the Russian countryside. Bury your late father. In the hut where the old man lived, everything is covered in dust. He gathers the few old clothes scattered and places the body of his father in a coffin. Then he says goodbye and buries him. The rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and dissatisfaction with which many faced. <br /> <br /> In modern love, a little ironically, love is not in sight. On the contrary, it is the pain, loneliness and dissatisfaction with "modernity" that suddenly invades Juan's life. Unlike El Segundo CÃ­rculo, however, here the main protagonist has the opportunity to re-embrace his modern life. His wife and son are waiting for him, however, he walks away. Slowly but surely, the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. <br /> <br /> I doubt that Frayne pretended that Modern Love was so similar to what Sokurov did in The Second Circle. However, the rhythm, and in particular the disconcerting framing, is precisely what transforms this film into an almost meditative experience: a difficult and enormously fragile approach to deconstruct the human psychology that the two directors have mastered to perfection. <br /> <br /> Mark Constable offers first-rate performance when John adds an even greater depth to his highly challenging character. Your facial expressions are outstanding. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger combine perfectly with the tense visual style of their presentations.
