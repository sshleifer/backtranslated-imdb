Let me start by saying that Tourist Trap is a better movie than 99.9% of the horror movies that have come out of Hollywood lately. If you do not believe me, go to Darkness Falls or Them. And it's certainly better than any of those crappy direct ones for video releases like Stab, Bleed, The Pool, etc. One of the big problems with the movie Tourist Trap is that you never actually meet an audience. When the movie premiered in 1979, the MPAA awarded him a PG rating. Anyone who knows horror films knows that a PG in a horror movie is usually the kiss of death for the movie. (Director David Schmoeller talks about this problem on the DVD's comment track). However, there are exceptions such as Poltergeist, which also received a PG rating. However, there are big differences between the tourist trap and Poltergeist. Tourist Trap was not a big-budget Hollywood movie like Poltergeist nor was it produced by Steven Spielberg. That alone was enough to guarantee the success of Poltergeist. (Still, for those of you who have seen Tourist Trap, you will even be surprised why the MPAA rated this film with PG. The 'heartbreak' scene should only be enough for the film to be hit with a rating of R. Or what about the pipe in the back with the blood running?) I have to admit that when I was young I looked at a copy of Poltergeist on the shelf of the video store, I picked it up, I saw it was classified as PG and put it back on the shelf in favor of a classified film R instead. Years later, I finally saw Poltergeist and I realized the great movie that I missed because I did not rent a PG horror movie. From then on, I would never judge a film based on its classification. This is most likely what happened to the tourist trap. People, like me with Poltergeist, will probably overlook it in favor of the R-rated movie. Most likely, it's also a teenager, who is targeted by most of these types of movies. Friday the 13th was not a masterpiece either, but he did extremely well at the box office due to the fact that he had an R rating and that Paramount was heavily promoted at that time. He found his audience and made enough money to generate several sequels. When friends look at it, Tourist Trap is as good as Friday the 13th. The same thing could have happened to Tourist Trap. We could have seen the tourist trap 2, 3, 4 and so on. As for the movie, Tourist Trap is an entertaining horror movie made with an extremely small budget, but well acted, well directed and well done on many levels. Chuck Connors is a riot like Mr. Slausen and gives the best performance in the movie. A special credit must be granted to the composer Pino Donaggio, whose score for this film really is what distinguishes it from others and gives it its chill. The music in the scenes involving the mannequins is especially spooky. Donaggio worked on the horror film Carrie and many other movie scores from Tourist Trap. He has done an exceptionally good job in film and continues to make films to this day. The weakness of Tourist Trap is that there is never an explanation of Davey's powers. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be. He simply has them, and we should accept it for the movie to work. We accept it to a certain extent, but then the script has incidents like Davey making the phone ring in the store while he's in the basement of the house. In that case, is Davey limited in the use of his powers? Can you ring a phone in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is your rank? Those are things that people who did not care about this movie would probably point to as flaws. Others would accept it as a mistake. I accept it. There is not enough of that kind of questions generated by this movie to make me hate. This is a horror movie. We should not be forced to read too much in it. Many people have called this the movie 'killer mannequin'. I assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this movie. The mannequins are controlled by the power of Davey, who uses them as a weapon. This is a common mistake about this movie. Some people have a problem with mannequins and some have even said that they are just dumb. I think they add to the creepy general of the movie. Overall Tourist Trap is a fun rental. *** (out of 5)
