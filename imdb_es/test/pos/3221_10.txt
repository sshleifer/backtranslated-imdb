I did not catch Gilmore Girls when it first came out, so I'm still catching up on the first season. I read most of the comments from the users and, for the negatives, I have to ask, what program are you watching? <br /> <br /> This program is a classic, big lines, characters and good acting. And best of all, NOT your standard formula is always shown with an occasional twist to the story. There are probably more women who are reflected in the Lorelai / Emily relationship than in the Lorelai / Rory relationship. People and stories are not PC, but they are real. <br /> <br /> If the dialogue bothers you, I suggest that you record the program, so that you can see the parts you do not understand.
