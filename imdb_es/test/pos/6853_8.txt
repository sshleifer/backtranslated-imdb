(Spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I've heard some complaint about special effects. But that should detract from the movie. The movie is a thriller. And he's very good at that. So from that point of view, this movie is cool. Franke rocks. Enjoy the content of plastic hearts. So there are no complaints for this movie. Unless you see the dub in English, which is a total farce. It creates the illusion that it is a b movie. <br /> <br /> One complaint I have is the music video on the DVD. It does not say who sings it. I would love to know. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Playable: 5/10
