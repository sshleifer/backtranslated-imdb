If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it is definitely in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect: the clothes, the play, the lines: yes, it's not what people talk about, but ... From the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office, the girls change their shoes. , picking up a wedgie, watering the ivy plant in the office, putting the lunch in the fridge ... Identical to what the girls in the office do today in the year 2005. I think all the secondary characters are wonderful. If someone like Joan Crawford is above, everything is part of the package. If you choose many things in the movie, it is very evident that this was the beginning of the sixties, as women began not to "go to bed", at least not if they did not want to. As for the characters that are contradictory, for example, the character of Suzy Parker acts as if it were all for adventure, but then becomes too attached to the character of Louis Jourdan, is not that what many people are, contradictory? They mix in real things with scenes like the character of Diane Baker, who finds the love of her life after aborting her illegitimate baby in an accident, lying in the hospital with an old and big bandage around her head. This is also part of the package, it's charm - bright escapism. I like the mix of relevant real stories nowadays (the stereotypical career woman who only has relationships with married men, therefore she has no family when she is older) with the ones that make you wish, "ah, if only I could fall in it, he loves a doctor and he will love me even though he knows my sordid past, and he saw everything messy after the scandalous accident. " Also, I just received the DVD, widescreen, it's even more beautiful than the full screen ... Yay!
