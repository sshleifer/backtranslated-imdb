For me, the best and most memorable films are often those about which, when I see them for the first time, I do not know anything. American Movie is a perfect example of such a jewel. When I saw the television in the late afternoon, I saw the only good criticism among the scum; fortunately I decided for a real pleasure. American Movie is a documentary that follows the unforgettable Mark Borchardt (pronounced "orchard", I think), a highly articulate and charismatic boy from Wisconson, as he struggles to write, direct and produce "MidWestern", a high-quality horror film and under budget. In which he has been working for years. In Mark we discover a young man full of contrast. Its appearance is the classic trailer-trailer stereotype: skinny, lint-free mustache, 80s heavy metal style, red mullet hairstyle, etc. However, for the camera, Mark reveals amazing wit and insight while philosophizing about life, love, movies and American style. As the film unfolds, it is sadly clear that Mark's lack of discipline and excessive alcohol consumption are relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts. American Movie is a lovely watch, full of funny moments and vivid characters. Chief among them is Mark's beloved friend, Mike Schank, a soft-spoken reformed fool who, having conquered an addiction to scratch cards, now relies on refreshments. I absolutely loved the American movie. It generates true empathy between the viewer and the main characters, and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.
