I'm from Ireland and I thought this movie had a minute or two in which the accents were a bit muted, but they were not worse than any other Brad Pitt or other American who did the accent. In addition, I have rarely seen a British actor handle an American or Canadian accent, except Colin Farrel in Minority Report. This movie is a small movie and it was entertaining. No, it was not a Blockbuster Hollywood production, but frankly, I'm sick of that shit. I laughed more than a couple of times and had a good time. It was definitely worth the rent. The main character is a parody on other hard British gangsters. At least that's how I saw it. If you expect a production of $ 100 million dollars, you will be disappointed. Enjoy it for what it is: a small entertaining movie.
