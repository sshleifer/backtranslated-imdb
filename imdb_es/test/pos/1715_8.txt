One of the most successful shows in the history of television is back. Now I admit that I never entered the original program ... Well, then I never saw it at all. But the new program is impressive. <br /> <br /> Sci-Fi has released the first two episodes, "Rose" and "The End of the World," this weekend. We meet Rose, an employee in her twenties who is chased by remote-controlled mannequins. It is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself a doctor. Using the Internet, he finds a conspiracy buff who warns him that wherever the Doctor goes, death follows. When his geeky boyfriend, Mickey, is replaced by an impostor, the Doctor informs him of a plot to use the Earth as a breeding ground for more plastic monsters, with whom the Doctor has been fighting through space and time, traveling in a Tardis disguised at 50s. A police-style call box. <br /> <br /> She helps him save the world, otherwise there would not be a show, and she decides to join him. But when he puts his life in danger, he is disturbed, and asks if his company was worth it. <br /> <br /> Although special effects are a bit scarce, and some of the scenes are a bit choppy, "Doctor Who" is (after two episodes aired in the United States) an intelligent and well written work. Apparently, the second season was already aired in the UK, so I predict the same success here.
