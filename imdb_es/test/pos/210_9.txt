The story told by The Cranes are Flying is certainly not so original. Young lovers are separated by war; Bad things happen to both of them. We've seen it many times already. <br /> <br /> However, we have not seen it filmed so well, with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation, destruction or despair. All the most remarkable that comes from the Soviet Union and the reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in the Soviet cinema of the modern era. <br /> <br /> I was reading "The Three Sisters" by Chekhov the other day, and by chance what the meaning of the title of this film might be. In Act 2, Masha is opposed to the idea that we should live our lives without sense or understanding: <br /> <br /> "MASHA: Surely humanity must believe in something, or at least seek the truth, of what Otherwise, life is just, empty, empty, living and not knowing why cranes fly, why children are born, why there are stars in heaven, or you must know why you live, or everything is trivial, mere nonsense without In the same way, Veronika finds it hard to believe that the war, and the sufferings of her and others, have been useless. It is better to assign a meaning, to live as if one's life is important and not give in to despair. Perhaps it is this thought that incites her to her final act in the film. <br /> <br /> By the way, as a minor correction to another comment here, there may be a V pattern in the movie, although I did not. I did not notice them. But the first letter of Veronika's name is not another example of this; in the Cyrillic alphabet, its name begins with a letter that looks like an English "B".
