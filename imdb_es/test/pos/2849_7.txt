Renee Zellweger shines absolutely like the nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, carefree and happy comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> When the obsessed telenovela with waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses the murder of her insensitive husband by two assassins (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she clicks and thinks that the cast members of A Reason to Love are real. He decides to travel to Los Angeles to find the famous heart specialist, Dr. David Ravell (a character in the program). <br /> <br /> Like the two strangely matched Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate something very funny. Chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his off-screen actor character. Renee Zellweger becomes an innocent, covered in sweet, and sometimes terribly sweet as Nurse Betty. She exudes goodness, warmth and is irresistible. While the script sometimes feels like a com-sit, it is full of incredible characters and ideal situations, Zellweger is so nice and so screwdriver that everything is combined. <br /> <br /> With just a few touches of Black Comedy to keep things interesting, a Zellweger winning performance, a great cast cast and a competent script, Nurse Betty is absolutely charming. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
