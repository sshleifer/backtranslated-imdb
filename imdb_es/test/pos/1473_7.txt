It must be said that this movie is definitely one of the best "bargain pot" movies out there, I would feel a little cheated if I had paid £ 15 for it, but for around £ 1.50 I felt that I definitely got more than the value of my money. <br /> <br /> The film can not decide if it wants to be "Mad Max" or one of the "spaghetti westerns" of Clint Eastwood "man", and as such is full of clichés of both. Even the crazy maniac who meets with the bad guys in "Mad Max" is there. <br /> <br /> That type of "Blade Runner" also has a good turnover, although it only appears at the beginning and end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Favorite bit - for me the punch at the top of the oil refinery - if you look closely, we can see the "post-apocalyptic" rush-hour traffic that thunders in the distance. while the two protagonists beat seven bells together. <br /> <br /> Acquire several lagers, some pizzas, sit down and enjoy what is, in the end, a light but entertaining nonsense.
