When Pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, his parole officer found him a job at a large city bank. When some of the criminals in the underworld of their past become aware of their position, they plan to exploit it and steal the bank. Pinky at first is horrified because he really wants to go straight, but when a turn of destiny occurs, Pinky begins to think that one should not have a gift horse in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Also known as The Mayfair Bank Caper {among others!}, This is a hugely enjoyable piece that is the quintessential 70s. London and everything that is very doubtful, the fashions light up like a Christmas tree in Ralph Thomas and the clever and cunning adventure of Guy Elmes. If the viewer can accept David Niven as an old crime lord of some evil (it's not easy for me to tell you), then A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square might surprise you. The actors are not pulling any tree for sure, but it is not really damaging the image, it has an honest and fun quality that is never less than entertaining. The soundtrack and the soundtrack are perhaps guilty of excessive jubilation during the dramatic criminal moments, but it is a minor complaint that leaves me thinking that this is a little-seen British jewel. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan takes on the lead role of Pinky (obviously hoping to attract American viewers}, the heartbeat of the 70s Oliver Tobias (a mass of hair) is there to keep the Interested ladies, while uncles have a pleasing view of Elke Sommer and her delicious legs for company.A clip decent enough and containing a very rewarding ending, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square deserves to be much better than the miserable rating of 5.7 here in IMDb, but I wonder how many people have seen it, hmm, continue, the opportunity is good, 7/10
