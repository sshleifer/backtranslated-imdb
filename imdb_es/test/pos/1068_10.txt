From the perspective of the hectic and contemporary world in which we live, the so-called "good old days" always seem to be much more serene and innocent; A past idyllic time, of which we only have memories and shadows that extend on the silver screen, as in 'Christmas In Connecticut', a warm and endearing film directed by Peter Godfrey. Barbara Stanwyck plays Elizabeth Lane, a popular columnist for the magazine 'Martha Stewart' who writes about life at her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe at the center of the story. One of his biggest admirers is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, the editor of the magazine for which he writes. Yardley has never visited her farm, and in response to an idea expressed in a letter from a nurse, Mary (Joyce Compton), decides to spend an old-fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and son and, as a special guest, one Mr. Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor newly recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his boat was torpedoed. Elizabeth, of course, can not reject her boss, but there are problems; It is not the least of the fact that she does not have a farm and writes her column from the comfort of a skyscraper in the city. It is a precarious situation for her and for her editor, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), since the only thing that Mr. Yardley demands from his employees is total honesty. What follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience to a seemingly simpler time and place, to share a Christmas past where a warm home, good food and kindness prevail. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck absolutely shines like Elizabeth, with a smile and a warmer presence than anything else the larger home can provide, and she is totally convincing as a city girl completely out of her element in the farm. Morgan also does well as the naive sailor, whose trust in his neighbor is admirable. Even with the deceptions that are played around him, he is the kind of person that you know will somehow stand up, and in the end that's why you really feel Elizabeth. One of the true delights of this movie, however, is Sidney Greenstreet. His Yardley has a brusque exterior, but beneath you you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as Texas. It is an honest and direct portrait, and it is a joy to see it work; the most memorable scenes of the film belong to him. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), the terrible Una O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge Crothers). A movie to feel good that plays especially well during the holiday season (although it would work at any time of the year), "Christmas In Connecticut" is a memorable movie that never takes itself too seriously, is completely stimulating and will leave you with a Warm place in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world look like a good place to be. It is a true classic, and one that you will not want to miss. I qualify this 10/10. <br /> <br />
