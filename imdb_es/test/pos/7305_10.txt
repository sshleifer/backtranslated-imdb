I was very touched by the soft power of this film and the mood it created. I think he should have received a lot more credit than he got. I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer should have been nominated, but I think all the performances were exceptional, and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of the sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity. Although I did not read the book, the modern concept of King Lear seemed very good to me. I will certainly never see the work in the same way again!
