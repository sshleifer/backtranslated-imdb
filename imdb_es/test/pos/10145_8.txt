This is another funny and entertaining Hitchcock movie. James Stewart and Doris Day are incredible in this movie. Bernard Herrmann appears as himself near the climax. <br /> <br /> The scenery and the places are excellent, except for the early scene in which the background was obviously false, which does not make sense to me, since the scenes before and after were on the same stage and They were real location shots. I've heard that Hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes. <br /> <br /> The critics for this movie seem to be varied. I think this is a Hitchcock movie better than average. Very entertaining and has a great light comic scene at the end. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie with 8 out of 10. <br /> <br />
