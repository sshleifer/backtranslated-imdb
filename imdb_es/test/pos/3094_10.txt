Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It is the most unconventional film of Werner Herzog. It does not have a plot or history. Instead of a story, we receive a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully. It is not a documentary either. Some of the people in this movie are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and disturbing images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating in the middle of the desert that are not really there, but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror. The use of music in this film is so brilliant, by Leonard Cohen, Mozart and the band of the third ear. Imagine Stanley Kubrick's 2001: an odyssey of space in the desert; This is how this movie is. This movie is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as if your spirit has left your body. You must see it. It will change the way you watch movies. Score: 10 out of 10.
