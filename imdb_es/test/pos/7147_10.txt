I really liked this movie about the love between two adults in post-war Britain. The high standards of BBC TV are evident in the production, and the excellent main actors (Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland) make this an encouraging experience. Bloom and Ackland have worked together in theater, and their chemistry and interaction is splendid. I recommend this version of Shadowlands on the film version of 1993.
