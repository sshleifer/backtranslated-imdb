This second feature of Lone Ranger of long duration is not up to the classic of 1956, but it is a good movie with enough sudden action and overturned and moves at a good pace. The Ranger investigates a series of mysterious murders that have a sinister pattern for them with peaceful Indians who are victims of a gang of hooded assassins. There are more murders and violence generally associated with the adventures of Lone Ranger and the film has an underlying current of racial insensitivity, whose comments are spread throughout the script. The Ranger wears costumes as only he can gather clues and expose the band of outlaws and bring them to justice. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels star in a colorful presentation that shows the desert and the cactus country of old Tucson to great advantage. The musical score is good, but the familiar theme of William Tell Overture is put aside with voices that are interesting but lacking the charm and beauty of the traditional theme of the Rangers.
