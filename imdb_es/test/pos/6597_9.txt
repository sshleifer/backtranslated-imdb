This movie was amazing. It is a documentary about how surfing influenced skateboarding in the first days. He has interviews with skaters like Tony Hawk (my idol) =), and Stacy Peralta to name a couple. Dogtown is a part called "ghetto" of California, where there used to be an amusement park that was demolished. People started riding alongside the dangerous ruins of the park. Soon, the Zepher Surf team was formed. That led to Skateboarding's first real start at Dogtown. The Z boys were a team of ragtag teenagers who loved skateboarding and started the phenomenon known as vert skating. They started skating in drained pools. That's just a little bit of the story behind him. It even contains rare images of Charlie's Angels by Stacy Peralta making a cameo. I think you should buy this movie if you're a skater. It will teach you that skating was not always popular. Even if you're not, BUY!
