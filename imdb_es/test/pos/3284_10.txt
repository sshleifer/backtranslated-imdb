First, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why does South Park blindly follow what other media do? And what Republicans do is more serious and less fun than Al Gore and his hysteria about global warming. <br /> <br /> But aside from that, this episode is just fun. The representation of Al Gore has to be one of the best cartoons of a politician that I have seen, it was original and based on the opinions of people about man. I do not want to give anything away, but it made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> There are also some of Cartman / Kyle's best moments. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say that this is one of the best episodes the program has had, and I would recommend it to anyone.
