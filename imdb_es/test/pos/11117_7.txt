This film and the subsequent follow-up of his television series has become the iconic symbol of what is great about America. <br /> <br /> Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several highlights, including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara * and the superb Gene Anthony Ray. The last one who plays a dancer without credentials or with "street" credentials is an amazing personality and it is worth observing what is essentially a portrait of himself. A wonder in sight, as a king would say. <br /> <br /> The plot follows an interesting format: sometimes chronological, gender on other occasions, personalities in some cases ... but, in reality, everything ends. in a kind of porridge. <br /> <br /> Where Parker succeeds is to push this movie into a periodic overdrive - with the score of extremely moving and sometimes beautiful and open campy music that matches the pace of the performers for the passage. <br /> The climax of the movie is a climax for all time. And this complete climatic cast of many musicians and dancers and talented music is fortunately repeated throughout the credits. These are a set of credits that are worth sitting through ... an achievement for all ages. The music of Christopher Gore is a gift for the eyes.
