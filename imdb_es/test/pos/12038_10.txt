This is a hard movie to find in the USA. UU., But if you can find it, and are interested in the life and music of Percy Aldridge Grainger, a surprise awaits you. It's quite accurate historically. Richard Roxborough's Grainger looks amazingly like Grainger in this period in time. Karen Holten by Emily Woof is quite prettier than the real Karen, but that was an inaccuracy that I was happy to discover (!). However, I think what really struck me was how well Roxborough captured Grainger's outrageous personality. The Barbara Hershey rose was also a treasure. If she looks considerably younger than Rose in that period, she is more than compensated for how well she captured Rose's obsession with Percy. It is an easy movie to recommend. (I should note that when he saw "Passion" my wife had no particular affinity for Grainger and his music, but she was totally captivated by the movie.
