Imagine you've been on a plane for 18 hours. You've been on a business trip to South Africa. You are a well paid professional. You have lived in the United States for 20 years. You are in your mid-thirties, you have a wife, a small child and another baby on the way. One thing, even if you have a green card, you are still Egyptian. In transit you are asked to come with 2 security guards, the next thing you know is that you are dominated, hooded and chained, and after a brief interrogation (although in a reasonably civil way), you will be surrendered! This is what happens to Anwar the Ibrahimi at the beginning of the film. Hers is a story of pain and (literally) torture. It is one of several lines of history. One follows his wife's attempts to obtain more information. One follows the (cold) bureaucrats behind the interpretation. Another story is about the family of the man who directs the interrogation of Anwar el Ibrahimi. There are also other stories and in the end they all come together perfectly. Although the most famous actors like Reese Witherspoon (as the anguished pregnant wife) Jake Gyllenhaal (as the CIA rookie forced to see the interrogation in North Africa) and Meryl Streep (as the CIA hotshot Corine Whitman) are really the most unknown actors. The story and give your heart. For me, the actor who plays the unfortunate Mr. El Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) was the heart and soul of this film. His portrayal of a man in distress was surprisingly well made. It's almost like I'm being really tortured! Also the Israeli actor Yigal Naor was very impressive, since the part worried about the man of family and partly for the cruel head of torture. Difficult to see and not exactly fun, but still worth it.
