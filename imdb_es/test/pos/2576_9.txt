I was surprised how amazing it turned out to be Black Snake Moan. Be a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson. Identification identification I tried it. And when this was over, I was amazed at how great this movie was. I mean, everything was excellent and very accurate. This film shows how the great director and writer Craig Brewer (who made Hustle & Flow another great movie) can take anything, even something that looks ludicrous, and become this. Well, I like how it's just a good time, like if it was a movie that makes it his in a good way. I also love that it does not show great southern steroeypes and how it has been represented in things. as the most repulsive place to be, but this movie is not very precise and that's why it's very easy to find. The appointment in this was phenomenal, especially on the part of Christina Ricci (who deserves an Oscar for this role), the always brilliant Samuel L. Jackson, and even Justin Timberlake also did a great job. In general, alm The best of everything is great, and while it is not the kind of movie for everyone, it is definitely worth seeing anyone who can enjoy a good time. Three greetings for Black Snake Moan !!!! <br /> <br /> 9.3 out of 10 stars
