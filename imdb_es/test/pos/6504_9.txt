A wonderfully funny and inspiring feature of the turntablism pioneers. DJ Shadow and Q-Bert are incredible in this fantastic documentary. Take a look at almost all the top DJs who prove their participation from scratch thanks to Herbie Hancock's classic Rockit, and the footage of some of the most complex and amazing turntable routines of all time.
