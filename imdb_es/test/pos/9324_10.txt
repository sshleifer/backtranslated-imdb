For those who are too young to remember, or too old to have been part of the "hype," Michael Jackson's fashion from the early to mid-'80s was at a fever pitch, like the hype about the Titanic, except that this simply It was not. cease Each song, each video, each word spoken by Michael was important. Nothing similar had been seen since the Beatles' apogee. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this video for the first time, on a roller skating rink. Everyone stopped skating. There was no question about whether you were a fan of Michael Jackson or not; you were Everyone grouped around the projection screen and watched the video ... <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the longest music videos ever made, and definitely the best. He consistently gets # 2 in the top 100 annual MTV videos (# 1 is always the flavor of the month, and somehow the number 1 of all the past time slips of # 2, to make way for the new # 1. Go figure.), And Thriller became a phenomenon in itself. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the opportunity, you should watch the video; not only the extracts shown in MTV or VH1. If necessary, you should look for Making of Thriller in a video rental store. Hey ... it's likely that your parents made you see Beatles and Woodstock sequences because "it was important" ... well, this is also important.
