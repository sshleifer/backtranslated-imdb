It was fascinating. I just could not look away. As the film progressed, I began to feel that it was powerful and confrontational, but I had no idea how much more intense it would be. <br /> <br /> The film gives an idea of ​​what is unfortunately the daily life of many children of school age. Some of us live outside of that environment and we walk and do not know what is happening. <br /> <br /> Parents need to watch this particular movie, just to see a glimpse of what their children are going through. Often, parents dismiss their children's problems as trivial, but unfortunately for a high school student they are massive. And unfortunately, problems can become a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Definitely must see for everyone.
