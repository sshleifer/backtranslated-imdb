This is a very nice movie. I had a massive sleepover (girls 10-11) and they loved this movie. They saw it twice! Do not let the rating fool you. You have to be over 13 to qualify for a movie in IMDb, which eliminates the target audience of the movie. If you have a girl (or boy) between 7 and 13 years old, I guarantee you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> A kind of "Notting Hill" invested by gender in high school. Aaron Carter plays a famous pop star who is failing in his tutored private lessons. His mother sends him to a "regular" high school with the ultimatum, "pass high school or not a summer tour." Following the advice of his manager (former pop star David Cassidy), he becomes friends with the smartest girl in the school (Alana Austin) with plans to cheat her. Look for the comical and insightful janitor (another former pop star, Lief Garrett).
