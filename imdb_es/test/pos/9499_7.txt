Gloria Swanson (as Leila Porter) is an understandably boring wife. Job-addicted husband Elliott Dexter (as James Denby Porter) has "lost his romance" along with his waist; He also smokes cigars in bed, eats onions and snores. He can barely remember his own anniversary, which is attended by the caddish Lew Cody (as Schuyler Van Sutphen); the younger man observes the voluptuous figure of Mrs. Swanson, and flirts shamelessly. Soon, Swanson is attracted to Mr. Cody. Then, Mr. Dexter decides to try to recover it. Who will win? <br /> <br /> The three directors are fine, with Swanson more impressive in the fundamental role of the ripped woman. Julia Faye takes the support honors as another Cody interest, "Toodles"; off the screen, he tempted director Cecil B. DeMille. The DeMille touch is evident; especially in an imaginary sequence in which Cody promises Swanson ... "Pleasure? Wealth? Love?" <br /> <br /> ******* Do not change your husband (1/26/19) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Gloria Swanson, Elliott Dexter, Lew Cody
