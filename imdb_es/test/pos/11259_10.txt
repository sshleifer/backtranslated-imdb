I saw this movie last night and it was one of the best television movies I've seen. It was very well directed and the performance was excellent, very convincing. The music was good and the cinematography was very well shot. Take out the despair of Requiem for a Dream and you'll be wasted. An excellent description of the world of drug addiction and its consequences in a very open way with which anyone can relate. congratulations to mtv for giving us a good movie for a change from! * $ *% as Crossroads.
