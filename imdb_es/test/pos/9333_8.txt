Although I'm not a fan of Michael Jackson, I like some of his early songs and some of Jackson 5 as well. 'Thriller' is one of their great songs and comes from the best selling album with the same title. As for the video, it is amazing, one of the best of Michael, but also very eccentric and strange. <br /> <br /> There is a story behind this video, but it is so complex that I can not even understand it. . It's Weird The strangest things are the transformation of Jackson into a werewolf, his evil red eyes at the end (like a werewolf) and the dead dancing. <br /> <br /> The video is very dark, exciting, cold and original. There are great scenarios and adjustments. The music itself is full of life and rhythm, characteristic of the old pop of the 80s. <br /> <br /> I like the soliloquy of Vincent Price. He makes a great narrative with his distinctive and unique voice and his evil laugh in the end is awesome! My favorite videos of 'King of Pop' are "Billie Jean" and "Do not Stop 'til you you enough" (both among their best songs).
