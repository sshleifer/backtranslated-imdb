The retelling of a classic story fits the music of Burt Bacharach and the lyrics of Hal David. The actors look like real people in this fairy tale from the outside world meeting the mystical Shangra-la. It's a joy to see Bobby Van, whose performance reminds me of Red Buttons and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke), who always manages to take gravitas in their roles. <br /> <br /> The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the old High Lama. Who would have known? <br /> <br /> The cast of stars, including Michael York and Olivia Hussey, makes this work a guardian for those of us who appreciate people.
