Not only do I consider this to be the best movie that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has done, but a true tribute to the masters. <br /> <br /> Despite the incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach out to a group of students and take them from nothing to basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods were criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners. <br /> <br /> Voight really showed that he loved teaching and that it was natural. high for he did not exaggerate the paper, and I found it totally believable. Voight is Conrack. <br /> <br /> In addition to the love of teaching, we also see another important point in this film. No matter how good you are at your job, if you move the boat, the bureaucrats will catch you.
