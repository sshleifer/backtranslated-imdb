George Cuckor, known as the director of women, could not have waited for two more beautiful and talented women for his latest film. In itself it is a new version of Bette Davis' old work, "Old Acquaintance," written by John Van Druten. This movie is definitely dated, but it's still lovely. <br /> <br /> Bergen and Bisset shine like the best friends who compete in everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a "serious", intellectual and elegant writer. Meet her best friend of all time, Merry Noel, in an exclusive school for girls and start a competition that is not always friendly for life. Later in her life, when Liz is a fiction writer would be "promising" but blocked, Merry decides to try his writing skills, which infuriates her friend due to the informal approach of Merry on the job she herself takes, perhaps, too seriously. <br /> <br /> To Liz's great displeasure, Merry's malicious novels hit the trash, and ultimately, her old friend Liz is judging her novel for the National Book Award. Bergen steals the show as the arrogant writer of bestsellers who plan to piece together the broken pieces of her life along with her final literary triumph, but, unfortunately, things are never so simple. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes David Selby, whom you might remember as the tragic Quentin Collins of Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner and, of course, Meg Ryan, deliciously young and mercurial, in his first role in a movie since he left the soaps. <br /> <br /> Rich and Famous is catty, campy, witty and wise. It culminates in a New Year's fiasco that emphasizes the enduring nature of true friendship, and I never miss a year without seeing it on New Year's Eve. Look at it and you will see why.
