This game was one of the main reasons why I got a PS2. I remember playing Soul Edge (sometimes called Soul Blade) on the day and I was hooked. <br /> <br /> I played the original Soul Calibur, but I never had the opportunity to play it for a huge amount of time. However, I bought the Gamecube version of Soul Calibur II and that was what really hooked me into the series and I was ecstatic when I heard about Soul Calibur III. This game still gives us the classic characters such as Mitsurugi, Cervantes, Nightmare and Taki. However, he also adds several new characters such as Zasalamel, Tira and the unparalleled Night Terror. (The TRUE head of Tales of Souls) The strategy based on the "Chronicles of the Sword" mode is a new feature that I really like, it can be quite challenging in later chronicles, but it is a good addition to the series. <br /> <br /> Soul Arena mode has several missions in which you must fight against an enemy in certain circumstances. (The exception is "Final Battle", in which you must simply defeat Night Terror) It's another fine touch that makes the game even more fun. <br /> <br /> Some scenes in Tales of Should will be done Press certain buttons to get a different result, this can be to dodge / block an attack or to get a better ending. (Each character has two endings) In short, this is an excellent game and I would recommend it if you are a fan of fighting games.
