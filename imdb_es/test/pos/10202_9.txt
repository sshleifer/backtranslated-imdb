This is a kind of hidden gem. It has little or no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status, and deserves all of the above! One of the great film directors, Fritz Lang, has created a true jewel in this excellent western. An excellent cast directed by Randolph Scott (in probably one of his best performances), the ever-robust Dean Jagger, Robert Young as a surprisingly accomplished guy and many veteran actors: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton MacLane and others in one Zane Gray's exciting story about the installation of Western Union cable throughout the country. He has tense drama, splashes of humor and great effects. It is reminiscent of DeMille and yet Fritz Lang leaves his own stamp on him. At least this is a fucking good western!
