HUNT FOR JUSTICE is a Canadian television drama that became a DVD and is a source of gratitude for those who yearn for educational dramas that inform us about events in current history that are somehow buried in the media. The film is not a Hollywood production, it relies heavily on images from court archives, but it also presents to many of us the act of heroism of Louise Arbor to carry out the trial of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic . <br /> <br /> Louise Arbor (the veteran Canadian actress Wendy Crewson) is a Canadian judge appointed by NATO as Chief War Crimes Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The film begins in 1996, when Arbor travels to The Hague to face the political obstacles that prevent the Court from taking war criminals in the war that Yugoslavia has been waging in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, a war that has evidences of Crimes against humanity in the form of genocide, extermination camps and other atrocious abuses. Progress in bringing criminals to justice is hampered by generals (including one played by William Hurt) who fear a great world war if precautions against them are violated. Arbor, with the great help of his translator Pasko Odsak (Stipe Erceg), his staff, including Keller (Heino Ferch) and the unexpected assistance of the British captain John Tanner (John Corbett), moves forward, focusing the impossible task of carrying all the responsible parties in justice in three specific events. Two of the three main suspects are captured, but during their trials, each finds its end. This leaves only Slobodan Milosevic, and Arbor and his colleagues have managed to bring the war criminal to justice in 1999. <br /> <br /> There are several moving parallel arguments employed in the telling of this well-documented story, stories that It makes the point in the story more personal. Some may find the film images of corpses and prisoners and extermination camps too strong to see, but they are necessary to take home the purpose of the film. Wendy Crewson has the power to carry the message home, the message that war crimes should never go unpunished. There is a lot of current history to learn from this movie: the writers Ian Adams, Riley Adams and M.A. Lovretta have condensed the information and made it dramatic too. Director Charles Binam√© balances the docudrama with the progress of history, never forgetting that he has a story of intrigue to tell as well. It's worth seeing HUNT FOR JUSTICE! Harp grady
