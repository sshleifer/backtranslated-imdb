British director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in the United States and a reputation for popular and critically acclaimed films; But this little movie was where it started. And he certainly showed his talent, with his amazing black and white cinematography and his acronological narrative that prefigures his last 'Moment', albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanically, the plot reminded me of David Mamet's "House of the Games", but the film still feels fresh and clear, until the final touch of the final whose flavor was expected, but whose sharpness is unexpectedly delicious. The performance, on the other hand, is not entirely in the same class: the film has a stylized quality and, possibly, to a greater extent than the director intended. But it's still a good debut, both claustrophobic and seductive.
