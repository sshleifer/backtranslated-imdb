Thanks to the help of an IMDb partner, I managed to see this movie for the second time in almost twenty years, and I can honestly say that it has not lost any of its advantages. I can not believe that Channel 4 has allowed it to disappear without a trace, since it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. <br /> <br /> He focuses on a gang of friends over ten years and his relationship with two 'outsiders' of the school; specifically how they use one and torment the other mercilessly. As the events of both the past and the present unfold, the tension gradually increases, not unlike Chane Meadows's excellent dead-man shoes to cool revenge. The acting, the writing and the direction are very daring for 1983 and still today they are on the verge of collapsing in spite of the accents of the superior crust of the central personages. Yes, it could be established in a public school but it is a world apart from everything offered by Merchant Ivory; I received a state education and I can still draw innumerable parables from history. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you'll remember for a long time if you see it, except you probably will not, because Channel 4 (or FilmFour) chose to bury it. On their own official website, they describe it as "a gem inexplicably overlooked since the early days of Channel 4," ignored by whom? This was one of the first films of Channel 4 (which would later become FilmFour thanks to the success of films like Trainspotting), so somewhere someone must have the master impression. In these days where you can get DVDs of collectors extended of more or less anything, it is a bit of a bad mood that can not give such a good movie the promotion it deserves. <br /> <br /> So, if one of the Channel 4 flunkies is reading this, stop making shows that show humiliating people hoping to get an agreement with the tabloid, pursue this movie and organize a nice anniversary Special Edition disk or something, please!
