Dad (78) and I (46) had a great time watching the movie today. For a boy mainly known for his serious roles, De Niro is a comic actor of heckuva. Of course, it helps to have your past movie images to play against. Consider that one of those roles, 15 MINUTES, was a policeman who had to deal with the interference of the media, and has an interesting set of comparison / contrast actions. <br /> <br /> Murphy plays another of his Axel Foley type characters. Shatner plays a burlesque of himself, an I of the parallel world that was better known by TJ HOOKER and not by STAR TREK. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to observe how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts in television and film. Shatner lectures on the proper means to slide on the hood of a car; De Niro points out that the covers scratch the finish of the hood. Ironically, as the film progresses, the character of De Niro begins to incorporate the illusions of the reality of the television police in the case of the real world in which he is working. <br /> <br /> The film is inspired by a range of sources, so one could make the comment is derived. Yeah, so what? Satire needs to derive its humor to exist. And in addition, the film has extravagant moments of originality. For example, I am reasonably sure that the method of the villain's death has never been done before. <br /> <br /> A question of the reality of the weapons involved: should not these weapons have had some kind of backlash? In order to penetrate the steel, those bullets had to have enough inertia to penetrate. And the highest level of inertia of any bullet is at the moment of shooting. So ... firing a volley of these killer tank bullets should have pushed the shooters back to their ends. Oh, what the hell ... it's a satire. Perhaps the lack of recoil of the pistols is in itself a satire of the B-F-Guns used so lightly in thrillers. <br /> <br />
