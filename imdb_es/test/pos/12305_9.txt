"The Dead" is truly a work of art. Clearly, John Huston intended to show that he was still "in full glory of some passion" in doing so, even when his body was failing him. This film is affecting powerfully and remains in the mind long after it is done. Reading Joyce's story certainly adds more depth to the characters, especially Gabriel's internal confusion, but the essence is in this movie. As an artist's statement of his love for life and his craft, "The Dead" is alone.
