Evil Ed is a Swedish film about a man named Ed (of course) and his collapse into total madness after editing a series of horror films B known as "The Loose Limbs". Ed gets so angry that he thinks he is seeing demons and monsters, but in reality they are people he knows and people close to him, such as his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this 1998 movie and was baffled by what I had seen. To this day, I consider this film one of the darkest comedies in the world. As the movie is almost funny with its bloody scenes, there are still some spooky moments. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, but do not expect anything wonderful. It's just a fun movie that is good to show to some of your friends and laugh. 8/10 stars
