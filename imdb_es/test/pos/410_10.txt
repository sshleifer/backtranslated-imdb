While many make it happen as a B movie, it is, in fact, a first class comedy that is well written and performed. Red Skelton is great, since Wally Benton is best known to radio fans like The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally Carol Lambert's girlfriend. Conrad Veidt leads a gang of very well-launched criminals. I read an account of this movie that says Vincente Minelli directed this movie, unless it changed its name to S. Sylvan Simon, who directed the three Fox films. This is a very entertaining movie made when the imagination was encouraged. So overcome your prejudices in black and white if you have one, sit down and enjoy a great comedy. This was also the first leading role of Red. Take note during the climax of the reference to the transmission of War of the Worlds by Orson Welles.
