I always thought that Batman Returns was a great sequel to Batman. The story was interesting and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave excellent performances. Also, let's face it, Tim Burton was a genius and made the character of the comic more fair than Joel Screwmacher. <br /> <br /> Argument: Oswald Cobblepot, also known as The Penguin (played by Danny Devito) is abandoned by his parents as a son for being deformed. He uses this as an excuse to mask a sinister plot to kidnap the first children of Gotham with the help of his thugs (Red Triangle Gang) and a very somber mogul Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken). Max Shreck later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed by Max Shreck through the window and is revived by cats. Later, she develops cat qualities and seeks to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. His reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic. It has a darker feeling in terms of atmosphere. Tim Burton always had the ability to make dark backgrounds look attractive. Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have been a better rapist for the movie Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry could. Max Shreck is one of the best roles of Christopher Walken. The main reason why I like Batman Returns is that it's fun. Not only is it creative but also fun. Something that many of the big budget movies these days lack. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton decided not to do more. Do not believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thank God that Christopher Nolan brought the series back to life with Batman Begins.
