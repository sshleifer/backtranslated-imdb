A group of teenagers decides to take their pajama party to an abandoned school where, 27 years ago, a horrible massacre took place. Unfortunately for them, the person responsible for the massacre still hides in the corridors of the abandoned school and is not happy with their presence. <br /> <br /> This movie is not like most of the young teenage slashers we've seen. It's much darker, much more suspenseful, no intelligent killer, etc., and I liked it for those reasons. From a cinematic point of view, it's not great. The performance is below average. The writing was pretty bad and it was quite full of clich√©s, which contained random references to American horror films, some of which did not even make sense (like ... "Did you see Scream 3?" Asks a girl. , I've done it, and it had nothing to do with walking through the doors of an old school, so it's not related to this film in any way). But, hey, it's a slasher movie, they're part of the fun. In addition, the underutilization of the characters was very much exhibited in this film. There were six main characters (not including the Security Guard) and, to be honest, only three or four were actually used. Two characters (the token black guy and another girl who was not important enough to get a label) barely spoke: between them, he would estimate a total of five or six lines. In addition, the girls (apart from one) did not train well enough to differentiate between them. They could have replaced each of the girls repeatedly throughout the film and would not have noticed the difference. However, the rhythm works well since the horror starts from the beginning and rarely stops. The environment is well used and the direction reveals some truly chilling moments. . . Although, the overall appearance is a bit cheap because, what I assume, is a low grade (and functioning) camera equipment. The end, although I liked the idea they were looking for, was quite badly done. He felt rushed and without sufficient explanation to make it effective. With the amount of time they spent running without looking for anything, they could have spent a little more time in the conclusion to make sure that it did not feel like a random event launched without a good reason (which is a flaw for many). Modern horror movies are affected by). However, ignore some annoying problems and try to concentrate on the first 98% of the movie instead of the end, this is a good modern slasher that should be reviewed, especially if you are a fan of Spanish and / or atmospheric Horror. <br /> <br /> Mandatory Slasher elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There is a bit of blood and gore, done realistically, but not cubes. The violence is very well done, not in excess, but rather brutal in the points. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: A little, and with the sexiest girl in the movie. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer: Well, security guards almost do not consider themselves "cool", but this guy is pretty mean. His eerie smile was chilling. <br /> <br /> - Asustas / suspense: The suspense is top notch. . . Very tense, very well done. There are also some extremely spooky moments where the tremors of the jumps and the spooky atmosphere merged. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: none at all, really. <br /> <br /> - Uncomfortable dance scene: of course: between A couple of boys and a half reluctant woman in the flashback. <br /> <br /> - Classic movie quote: 'One more trophy'. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 7/10. This may lengthen it, but the fans of Session 9 might want to check it out simply by the similar tone and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
