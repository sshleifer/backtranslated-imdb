The cast for this production of Rigoletto is excellent. Edita Gruberova sings Gilda magnificently and passionately. Luciano Pavarotti also sings splendidly. Vergara is a good Magdalena; Fedora Barbieri is a famous singer who sings to the maid, Giovanna. Weikl sings to Marullo; Wixell sings both Rigoletto and Monterone. Like Rigoletto, Wixell is probably the most convincing acting singer in this set of great singers hard to beat. Kathleen Kuhlmann in the Contessa. All directors are known and recognized worldwide. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting Rigoletto both visually and musically. <br /> <br /> I have it both on laser disk and on DVD. You should have it too!
