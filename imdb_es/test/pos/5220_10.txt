Father Hood <br /> <br /> I can understand why many people hate the story of a father who kidnapped his two children and took them across the United States, but I have seen much worse things, and - when I saw these Years ago - I did not think it was particularly horrible. Patrick Swayze is the worried father who takes his children to flight for personal reasons, and Halle Berry is the policeman who persecutes them. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a decent way to spend a couple of hours of your life. No doubt you could do worse. Have you ever heard of the movie "Pod People"? <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of ***** <br /> <br /> Rating PG-13 for Some traumatic scenes, adult content content, violence and language.
