This movie was originally released as a soft "X", apparently with explicit sex removed. Later, the producers "gave in" (smelled money) and reissued it with the deleted scenes restored (apparently only about 3 minutes). I suppose that, as Kristine was of age, it was carried out against her and her promising career stopped. I guess it all depends on the moment (witness of Pam Anderson's career), but Ronald Reagan was in charge during the Kristine debacle (we had not heard about the affairs of Nancy Reagan), Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski were in full swing during the "exit" of Pam. . <br /> <br /> Sex is just the icing on the cake, both versions satisfy. This mischievous musical is well above others that were released at the same time.
