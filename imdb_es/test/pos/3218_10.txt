This is definitely an excellent show. I do not have a cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a soap for teenagers, you know, who is dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly profound. He is also very ingenious. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you get every time you look at it. It is a comedy drama, which is rare when it is well done. It's about the relationship of Rory and Lorelai. Instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship, it is a story of the best friendship relationship, about a mother and a daughter. The characters are perfectly cast and everyone does an excellent job. It is definitely the best television show I have found.
