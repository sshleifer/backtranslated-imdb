Nevsky is one of the great epic war movies. Of course, others, such as Birth of a Nation and Napoleon had arrived before, but this one is equally influential. The acting is normal, but anyone who knows the first thing about Eisenstein would know that that was part of his film theory. This film, unlike many of his silent works, deals with the heroic individual as much as with the group. This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that had emerged in 1938. Even so, his film shows us the power that people who come together to fight against something they perceive as bad can generate. Nevsky is just one of many men. He is a prince because he is the strongest, but not because he is different from the rest. The romantic angles of the film provide a more personal story than Eisenstein had previously allowed. Not all the elements work and the movie is probably too long, but it still resonates.
