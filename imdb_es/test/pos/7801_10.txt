Andaz Apna Apna is a film that I treasure and it is a film that I do not mind seeing at any time ... well, almost at any time! This movie is just wonderful and, in my opinion, it's the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes, I put it on Hera Pheri ... why? Does Hera Pheri have scenes that you will watch but Andaz Apna Apna? Impossible! Simply because each scene is a scene that you must watch! Aamir and Salman share a great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes, but I will put the characters in order of favoritism: <br /> <br /> Rank # 1. Crime Master Gogo (the best performance of Shakti Kapoor to date and yes, this happened before the cast chair): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to the family of Mogambo (the fame of India). Crime Master Gogo is actually the nephew of Mogambo, but for Mogambo he is more than a responsible son, handsome and charismatic, charming. Gogo, commits the biggest mistake of his life by lending 36,000 rupees to Teja (which is how Balla once said, "A fraud and a cheat!"). Now, Gogo's only goal is to recover what is his and in his journey to recover his lost money, Gogo realizes that there are more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins ... Gogo's fight against the sinful world . <Br /> <br /> Rank # 2. Tile (Main Hoon Tile, Mark Idhar Hai!): Tile is an evil character who is the twin of Ram Gopal Bajaj. Originally called Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. Tile, as a child had always envied his brother and one day, things worsened when his father gave all his wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill his father, but in the darkness of the night, instead killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena's father), although Teja does not regret his actions. The only mission of Teja, now, is to recover his property in some way and start his own poultry and bakery farm. Teja also needs to repay the loan to Gogo (but does not intend to do so). To achieve his evil objectives, Teja employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at pointing) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, the clone and Ajit's son ... who is a very smart kid!) < Br /> <br /> Rank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): Wants to marry the wealthy heiress Raveena, so she sells her father's cheap living room and heads to Mumbai. Amar has no problem taking care of the big business that Raveena's father will give him after his wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and move to London, if necessary. <br /> <br /> Rank # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the film and the way Amar tries to take advantage of him in a friend's mask It is tragic. <br /> <br /> I won 'Do not reveal more characters because Jesus Christ! I just would not stop writing! The movie is downright awesome! Go and get the DVD now and beware of the cheap VCDs, since they have omitted many good scenes from the movie. <br /> <br /> The background music is stallion and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final found between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (be careful), appears in the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and it teaches us a lot about life, values ​​and ethics. It teaches us about bravery (why else would Amar ask Prem to stay behind when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though Prem complained that he had to go to the bathroom?). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where Amanir points to Salman and is given an overdose of stomach pain pills, the part where Teja reveals her sad feelings about why she could not go to London and the part where is Gogo Arrested at the end, without even recovering his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is in general a complete package ... sit back and enjoy the trip! I bet there will be a second trip after that ... and then a third one! <br /> <br /> The movie was considered a failure at the time and I bet no one liked it, but men will buckle it! This movie is a great success! Even if there were not enough people coming to the movies, the movie is one of Home's best selling DVDs and one of the most frequent movies on most channels, so producers have laughed at banks a long time ago !
