This is one of the best action movies I've seen. Geena's portrayal of the hard guys like the nails, 'Charly' / gentle mother 'Sam', was excellent and Samuel L Jackson keeps you laughing completely, with his classic liners. Sure, there were some holes in the real story, but this fast movie keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. <br /> <br /> I felt that Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam / Charly and her versatility as an actress are evident for her role as mother in the recent movie "Stuart Little". Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, the sweet little Yvonne Zima and the newcomers, the sexy Craig Bierko and Melina Kanakaredes. This film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and deviation from traditional male / female stereotypes, as we see Sam / Charly (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) throwing themselves from one disaster to another. <br /> <br /> Although I and many others loved this movie, it is fair to say that there will always be people who do not do it and it is fine, each one, on their own. I recommend this movie to the fans of the action, for its funny scenes and its accelerated action.
