Aaron Sorking poses the same questions that Shakespeare did or does. How could they know so much about the inner workings of palace life? Here, as in The West Wing, Sorkin opens surprising doors that are not a shock, but seem silly, confirming our worst fears. Everything is so casual and, at the same time, so directly responsible for the lives of so many people. A bloated Tom Hanks tells us in one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi-pure intentions but without weighing the consequences, and Julia Roberts, in a southern blonde hairstyle, reminds us of the powers that lie on the sidelines. The subject is serious but the treatment is light, intelligent but light. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the invisible intermediary, steals all the scenes in which he finds himself, as does Charles Laughton in all the films in which he participated. Ordinary comedy The seemingly casual rhythm, full of wit and provocation, provides another badge of honor in Mike Nichol's collection.
