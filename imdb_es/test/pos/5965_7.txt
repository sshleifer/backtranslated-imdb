Many animation fans consider Wladyslaw Starewicz the forgotten genius of a special branch of art, the puppet animation, which he invented almost without help. . . And, as it happened, almost accidentally. As a young man, Starewicz was more interested in entomology than in film, but his failed attempt to film two beetle bouts led to an unexpected breakthrough in filmmaking when he realized he could simulate the movement by manipulating the corpses of the animals. beetles and photographing them a picture. just a moment. This discovery led to the production of Starewicz's incredibly elaborate classic short film THE CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE, which he made in Russia in 1912, at a time when film animation of all kinds was in its infancy. <br /> <br /> The politics The tumult of the Russian revolution caused Starewicz to move to Paris, where one of his first productions ... by chance? - It was a dark political satire known as "Frogland" or "Frogs that wanted a king". A variety of black comedy can be found in almost every Starewicz movie, but here it is very dark, aimed more at adults who can appreciate the satirical aspects than the children, who will probably find the disturbing climax. (I am middle-aged and I found it quite annoying). And, in fact, copies of the film intended for the English-speaking spectators of the 1920s received title cards full of puns and jokes to help smooth out the sharp bite of The End. <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in a swamp, the Frogland Commonwealth, where citizens are not happy with their government and have convened a special session to see what they can do to improve things. They decide to beg Jupiter for a king. The crowd is impressively animated in this opening sequence: it could not have been so easy for many frog puppets to appear alive simultaneously, while Jupiter, meanwhile, is represented as a type of white beard in the clouds. as if I'd rather be taking a nap. When Jupiter sends them a tree-like god who looks at them impassively, the frogs decide that this is not an improvement and they demand a different king. Irritated, Jupiter sends them a stork. <br /> <br /> Enchanted with this new king of formidable aspect that rises above them, the frogs welcome him with a delegation of formally dressed dignitaries. The mayor takes a step forward to give him the key to the Commonwealth while the news cameras record the event. To everyone's horror, the stork quickly eats the mayor and then leaves in a cheerful uproar, swallowing the citizens at random. On a title card it reads dryly: "The news of the king's appetite is spread throughout the kingdom." When the now terrified frogs once again beg Jupiter for help, he loses patience and showers his community with lightning. The moral of our story, delivered by a hapless frog just before they eat it, is "Leave it alone." <br /> <br /> Considering the period of time when this surprising little movie was made, and considering the fact that it was made by a Russian émigré at the height of that country's besieged Civil War, it would be easy see this as a parable about those events. Starewicz may or may not have had in mind the agitation of Russia when he made "Frogland", but regardless of what motivated his choice of material, the film is presented as a warning about universal application. "Frogland" could be the Soviet Union, Italy, Germany or Japan in the 1930s, or any country of any age that lets down its guard and is overwhelmed by tyranny. It's a fascinating movie, even charming in its macabre form, but its message is not a joke.
