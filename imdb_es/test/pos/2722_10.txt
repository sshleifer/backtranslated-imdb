From "36 Chowringhee Lane" to "15 Park Avenue", Aparna Sen has come a long way. If the first one goes down in history as a clean sweep of a debutante, the latter will definitely have a special place like a "mature" movie. Until you see 15 Park Avenue, you can not imagine feeling excited and excited at the same time. Excited to see the ingenuity and agility of the director when portraying really challenging situations and moved by the echo of sensitivity throughout the film. It's not a movie that simply makes you feel 'tchh tchh, how hard life must be for schizophrenics', but it makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality you see and believe. Sen has done a brilliant job in highlighting this supreme fact of our existence that we are all, in one way or another, trying to live in our own fantasy world, trying to run behind mirages called happiness, peace, satisfaction. Along with the description of a delusional mind, Sen's magic has generated many small nuances of human relationships while sustaining stress and tension. The fact that sometimes we all lose our temper, we collapse, we make wrong decisions, we become obsessed with guilt, we behave selfishly, etc., it is captured with extreme skill by the Senator. She showed the cruel dilemma that Shabana had to face all her life. , of having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a husband and children for her. And in the act of always being by his sister's side, being always a strong person, providing support, making judgments, etc., without knowing it, he cut part of the oxygen that his sister needed to flourish. Is not this a very hard truth that sometimes, in an attempt to do the best for someone, we strangle their assertiveness and end up damaging their self-esteem? Of course, the performance of Konkona and Shabana deserves the laurels as always, because if the ingredients had not been so good, the dish could not have been so extraordinary. Aparna Sen once again made a masterpiece of a movie for those who crave some "food for thought". Bravo
