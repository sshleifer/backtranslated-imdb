Very good cinematographic history of a former gay, bitter teen star, who now waits tables. Sexual ambiguities are explored here realistically, and with a real human face. This, and release a serial killer, and you have LOVE AND THE HUMAN REMAINS. A well-portrayed drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. The script is fluid and credible. The performances are well above average, and the twists in the story are sharp. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not the ideal notion of a movie for everyone, but for those who appreciate something different and are skillfully written, it is very worth your time. Highly recommended
