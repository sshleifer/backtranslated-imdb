My husband dragged me into this movie because I had no interest in seeing an Anime cartoon. I was absolutely delighted with the simple story and the incredible animation. In a digital world where the effects are generated by computer, it was refreshing to see a beautiful and imaginative animation drawn by hand. The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a vivid fantasy world mixed with minimal reality. I have not seen an animation like this since I was a child and it's wonderful to see her endure and succeed. <br /> <br /> The actors who provided the voices in the English version were fabulous. The duration of the film was PERFECT, especially for children who tend to get into movies hard. Overall, a lovely experience that is worth it for the prices of the tickets we have today.
