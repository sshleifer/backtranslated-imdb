The title of the film seems quite appropriate given the person of the main character, Fanda. He is an older man who lives at the end of the autumn of his life, but has fun as a jubilant schoolboy who has just entered a spring meadow. The weaknesses of old age and the warning signs of death are illusions for him. His wife supports this idea when he observes: "Fanda laughs at funerals and death." In other words, death is not something that Fanda takes too seriously; It has more important things to do than worry about what is already inevitable. Life, however, and the search to live life to the fullest, is the philosophy that governs the existence of Fanda. He is not one to merely exist, but he must live every day and every moment that passes, because tomorrow is not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to make a strong comment about living as if there were no tomorrow, let alone death. Too many people take life too seriously and, therefore, lose the real part of life. Fanda's wife, for example; she is so preoccupied with preparing herself for death, not in a connotative religious way, but in a way too practical, even lifeless, that she forgets how to smile, laugh and have a good time. His humanity seems to have transformed into automatic zombie pilot mode. Fanda, on the other hand, is perhaps too cheerful and distracted for her own good. He needs a person like his wife, Emilie, to help balance him. <br /> <br /> It is as if Fanda possesses the invincible spirit of a child, like a child trapped in the body of an older man. He is presented as the adventurous type; He pretends to be people who are not for profit, squander money, lie in fact and are always ready for a good laugh. However, deep down he is a kind and gentle old man who wishes to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife. The two compensate each other quite well, although none of them really appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until, metaphorically, they risk death: the meaning, their divorce. It is during this court scene that Fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if she is separated from her only love. His wife emotionally remembers all his faults, however, he is tender to continue loving him despite his crazy behavior. At this moment when she forgave him, Fanda realizes her selfish behavior of driving her wife crazy and makes an internal commitment to make her happy. <br /> <br /> However, ironically, after making this commitment, it becomes what his wife later calls "a living corpse". The lifeblood inside him fades away as he becomes more like her: a zombie that is going through the day-to-day movements. It seems that he no longer lives, but he exists. For example, he abandons his funny jokes, does not waste money, quits smoking for his wife (not for his health) and, in general, only accepts what she wants from him. Put succinctly, he changes because he wants to make her happy. Therefore, the binary quality of your relationship begins to slowly disappear. Realizing that her husband is not who she used to be, there is a part of Emilie that misses old Fanda. She misses the distant attitude of her husband and the fights they used to have, because it was in those moments when they really lived, not only did they exist. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers were trying to convey a specific message here; that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient, but sacrifice and resistance will often be required to go through seemingly bad times. The possibility of death at any time is what reminds people that they should live in each moment. Life is often taken for granted, but when threatened with death, whether literal or figurative, people wake up from their ungrateful dream and wake up to begin living life to the fullest. It is as if they were afraid that they would never live again, so it is better that they make the most of it while they have it. Fanda and Emilie had been married for 44 years with fights along the way, but it was not until they were both threatened with the possibility of a separation similar to death that they began to show their true colors. As the old maxim says, "Love does not know its own depth until the time of separation." Both begin to see what is most important in life and that is the people who are on the road. More importantly, the intimate relationships they make with their significant others.
