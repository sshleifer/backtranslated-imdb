My teacher made this movie. It's a new start. Look at it, and you will not realize it's a Romanian movie. The old boring style is gone. Now it's something else. A post-revolutionary film. He is using the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists. They are unique You will not even know what you are seeing, they will simply transfer you beyond the screen and you will feel every frame. Do not miss it, pay attention to the plot but do not ignore the details. They make the difference between this film and the other Romanian films. You will hear some music at some point. He is representative of a part of us, but he does not represent us. Please keep your head straight and leave your body free.
