I swear that if I ever tried cocaine, I could relate perfectly to this movie. Their rhythm, as well as the dialogue, are shaken at speeds that some viewers may need to stop and relax their heads. <br /> <br /> There are great elements that appear in the film, like Rob Lowe's. the character seems to be always losing a shoe, or how some characters continue to spiral around their zigzag path. The story was set up extremely well and the direction seems impeccable. <br /> <br /> The movie stinks of clumsiness and tenderness. This is one that I think most could enjoy. A few moments of laughter-aloud-stop-if-you-are just making sure that I will certainly be seeing this again.
