The mascot is the masterpiece of Ladislaw Starewicz. Tells the story of a stuffed dog looking for an orange after he hears the mother tell her daughter that she has no money. The dog is chosen with other toys to be sold. In the truck, after the others jump while the vehicle is running, the dog stays and waits to be picked up from the store before leaving on his own. He manages to get orange after biting the woman's leg while she held and sold the fruit. While running, he meets the devil and accepts his offer to stop at the nightclub. There, he meets the other toys that jumped out of the truck. The cat that was next to him in the vehicle is especially determined to get the dog's orange. I'll just stop here to mention that other wonderfully strange things happen at the nightclub that you'll have to see for yourself. Suffice it to say that if you love Starewicz and are interested in all the animations of the past, I definitely recommend you look for this one!
