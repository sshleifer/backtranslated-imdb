This movie is excellent! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade, the pure-class vampire hunter, kicks his ass in such a fluid and violent manner that Bruce Lee is proud. The movie is a fast, exciting journey of action and magnificent tricks. The first action scene and the last one are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs and erases all the fucking heads. The script is quite good and there is also a sharp dialogue. Wesley should have made more action movies than him, I know he is a very good actor and in this he is not as stiff as in his more comedic or dramatic roles, but in regards to action stars, he is the best actor. everyone, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and maybe Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. Also as Wesley is of quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes was considered threatening, but he does. In general, the film is sharp, elegant and I hope that the sequence is done at the same pace.
