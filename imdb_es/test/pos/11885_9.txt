My young aunt is unique in many ways. First, this is Hui Ya-Hung's first action movie (Kara Hui). Second, she was doing the fight scenes after having surgery a few days before filming. Third, this movie is out of the chain. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Wang Lung Wei trying to take the inheritance from his brother. His brother then has Kara to marry him so that Wang can not take the treasure. The story is pretty good, guiding everything to its rightful place. <br /> <br /> At the time of the action, what can I say that has not already been said for films like this, or Disciples of the 36th Chambers, The Victim? , or even the magnificent butcher. The fight scenes are the sales films, and this will have no problem doing so. Liu Chia Liang and Wang Lung Wei got involved in a fight you have to see to believe. Why these two men did not fight anymore surpasses me. <br /> <br /> I do not really want to spoil anything, but you have to see My Young Auntie to get all the emotion. My only complaint is that Yuen Tak was not used as widely as in 3 Evil Masters, or even Invincible Pole Fighter (8 Diagram Pole Fighter) for excellent films. 9.2 / 10
