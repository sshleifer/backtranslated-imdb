Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated rural mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there. She faces a heterogeneous group of crazy people and a seemingly crazier supervisor. Is Dr. Masters everything she seems to be? <br /> <br /> NOT LOOKING AT THE BASEMENT is one of the best low budget movies in the genre and why people always say it is beyond me. The acting is excellent, my favorite performance is Betty Chandler as Allyson, the nymphomaniac. The chills simply jump off the screen. You probably do not have to say, "It's just a movie, it's just a movie," it's not that scary, but it should attract any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre, as I do. It is very difficult to make a spooky movie with a low budget and few really achieve it. AX is another cheap movie that is despised. Maybe people are so ruined by the big budgets of recent films that any film that does not have excellent effects and / or is not considered a classic has no chance with an audience. But I think that after people watch this movie, they will see how important the low budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish.
