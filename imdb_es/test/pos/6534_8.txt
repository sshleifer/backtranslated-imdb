Although I am a little older than the recommended age group, I really enjoyed this movie. It is a small break from reality and must be the dream of all the little girls to become friends of a pop star. I know it was mine, of course! The first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the bad girls said some things that were also slightly cheesy. Once you get over that, you can really start enjoying it. I loved the relationship between JD and Jane, it was very sweet and you could see how much they liked them. The soundtrack is perfect and fits very well in the movie. I also liked the family created for Jane, her sisters seemed lovely. Very well made movie.
