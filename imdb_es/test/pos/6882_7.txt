So Koreans are now defeating American horror films. But they are doing it with style. DOLL MASTER is a close copy of PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS, and even has a bit of CHILD'S PLAY in its favor. Several young adults are invited to attend a special event in a gallery full of dolls, only to discover that they are targets of a vengeful spirit. The dolls come to life and do quite unpleasant things to children. The level of gore is reasonably high, the photography and design of the sets and the production values ​​are first class, the performance is not so bad and the fears are definitely there. DOLL MASTER may not be in the same league with A HISTORY OF TWO SISTERS or even DEAD FRIENDS, but it is close. Give him a watch You will not be disappointed.
