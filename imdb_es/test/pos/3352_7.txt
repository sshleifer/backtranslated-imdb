Alice enters a world of wonders ... but not the kind of wonders you remember as a child. The Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, the Queen and others (including Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice some things about her body, and the bodies of other people, which could be quite wonderful. A story of love and lust like you've never seen. <br /> <br /> Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I must say that, by the standards of the 1970s, this may be the most attractive adult actress of her time. I think this is her only film before continuing with the main job, but it was the best she could have chosen (my love for all the things that Alice is not a secret). Even better than "Fairy Tales" (which is not really pornography, much). <br /> <br /> The songs are cheesy, but they fit the theme of the film. A song, "What does a girl like you do in a gentleman like this?" It was quite fun, and the others had similar themes. The test towards the end was well written, and it fit very well in Alice's world. Logic and humor were definitely explained. <br /> <br /> What else can be said about a movie like this? All I know is that, for people who are used to adult movies in which there is only 30 seconds of introduction to sex, this will overload you with plot and music. But, personally, I think there's something very special about this movie and I hope it has a good DVD release with retouched things and special features (if possible). I can see that this is a cult movie.
