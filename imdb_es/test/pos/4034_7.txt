Those who want to see remakes of film noir, should not see this as a remake, they will always be disappointed. Instead, enjoy a passionate performance by Dennis Quaid and visual images to congratulate. The color drains from the film (literally, not metaphorically!) As the plot accelerates, and the dialogue is crisp and gritty. The opening dialogue is intelligent, and the viewer is carried away by a clear script and a real and original black film sensation.
