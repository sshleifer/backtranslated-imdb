A sandy Australian film, with all the elements for success. Two Hands represents the ability of Australian filmmakers and actors to produce high quality popular material. The film has a new angle, and uniquely incorporates drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this film completely enjoyable on many different levels, but I can also appreciate that it may not be everyone's cup of tea. ' The film has a marked Australian humor, as it portrays the sordid underworld of Sydney, and explores the lives of a young man (Ledger) and a young woman (Byrne), swept at the local crime scene. <br /> <br /> Two Hands addresses the issue of good and evil, both interpersonally and personally, and discusses the issue of the consequences of "our" actions. <br /> <br /> The camera work is elegant and the dialogue humorous. With Bryan Brown, who plays Pando and Heath Ledger as Jimmy, fighting on the screen in the strangest situations, this Australian film does not lack talent as an actor. <br /> <br /> This subtle action / comedy has become a bit of a cult favorite, and one of mine too.
