This is a nice project, which is not a movie as the title suggests. Good performance of Nadia Dajani, who returns to play the role of Grace. I continue to recreate what happens to Mike and Grace in New York City. She leaves, but he wants to get in touch with her. This project is your way of trying to get in touch with her. <br /> <br /> I saw it at IFC. I have heard that it will be released on DVD as well. I like this trend of more independent projects. This is an example of a good project. <br /> <br /> I hope you find it. <br /> <br /> Take a look and be entertained. <br /> <br /> KirbyEF
