As a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to watch the movie. I enjoyed every minute of this. It develops in a very sincere way. Throughout the whole movie, it seemed that Natalie was the mother and Susan the mother. The character of Susan continued to make bad decisions and burned because of that. <br /> <br /> I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Natalie and someone (he's in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept The script if that scene was eliminated. And I think that's great. I think a love scene would have ruined the tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> Natalie should have a special ability to choose good movies because I have not seen her in a bad movie yet. Therefore, any film that has Natalie Portman will undoubtedly be seen by me. <br /> <br /> A good movie. 7/10
