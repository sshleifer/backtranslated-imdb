IN AGREEMENT. Whoever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them all cutting their throats. This "movie" was absolute and absolute filth. What the hell was going on with the strange old eye bags? Seriously, were you taking some kind of horrible drug and then thought you could control people? She was running with her damn evil eye and it was like what? Do I have a booger hanging from my nose? What are you looking at? Are you like the sea witch or something like that? In spite of everything, I thought that the graphics were first class. That's why I would only give him a ten. But it only covers your ears when you are watching it. The pure and complete evil that comes from that film will make your ears bleed and your eyelids fall. Who knows? You may even have a lump in your small intestine. You better be careful with fools.
