I really liked that movie! Markie Post is really great at that. I saw it in my life, and it's in the same entertaining class as movies like 'The Betty Broderick Story', 'Locked Up: A Mother's Rage', etc ... (which, by the way, are also very good! Entertaining films! It's an exaggerated drama, about a single mother trying to separate herself from her predictable middle-class personality. This movie is just pure entertainment! It does not have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction. But, it does show how any "regular" middle-class person can (and they do!) Be addicted to heroin. Drug addicts are not just uneducated people without homes in the street. {By the way, if you look at it, see how the child handles his mother! Spoiled!} 8 out of 10 stars.
