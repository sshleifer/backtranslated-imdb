I was lucky to attend the premiere of this film in London. While I am not a fan of British drama, I was deeply moved by the characters and the BAD OPTIONS they did. I was crying at the end of the movie. Each scene was fascinating. The attention to detail and the excellent performance were quite impressive. <br /> <br /> I would have to agree with some of the other comments here that question why all these women were thrown into such a despicable character. <Br /> <br /> ******* SPOLIER ALERT ******** I also hoped that Dylan would have been killed by William when he had the chance! **** END SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley did a great job and radiated beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was Sienna Miller's performance that really deserved Oscar. <br /> <br /> I am sure that this production will be nominated for other prizes.
