I had to get this movie, since I did not get where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth the wait. I totally fell in love with this movie. The chemistry between Walters and Grint could be seen, since they also worked together in the Harry Potter films. The woman who plays her dominant and fair mother really convinced me well and how hypocritical she is, I think she did a Great job playing the part. I wish we could have seen the sex scene in reality or more. LOL, but, of course, we just have to use our imagination to see how it developed. (giggles) I thought the movie was worth it and if you want to see a good movie. Rent this movie. I have to say that Rupert really did a great job and it's nice to see that he's making films out of Harry Potter, although I totally love him like Ron Weasley. The whole cast did a great job and I hope that Rupert will continue to perform outside of Harry Potter to expand his skill!
