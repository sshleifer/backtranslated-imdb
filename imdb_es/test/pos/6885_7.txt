I entered Blockbuster with a friend the other night after deciding that we were too ruined and too lazy to be active. He decided he wanted to see Closer, which I thought was such a repellent idea that I had to rent another movie because, once, he had gone to bed. Looking around I did not see much that interested me, but I saw The Doll Master in the new releases section. Based on the cover (a doll-faced woman who cries tears of blood) I thought this would be interesting enough to rent. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, seeing it in an almost empty place. The house, with all the lights off, was quite scary. I must admit that I've always had a bit of doll phobia since I was a kid (and I saw a horrible movie called Asylum, one of the stories that involved a mental patient who created a doll that killed people.) Lick, but scary at that time) and the first three quarters of this movie really shocked me. The first half hour in particular was amazing. The eerie premonitory atmosphere really marked the scene well, and without moving the wrists seemed really threatening. But unfortunately, as soon as they started to move, everything got a bit corny, I was a bit disappointed when the moments that could have been really frightening made me laugh at the way they were filmed. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, it's a horror movie, you do not expect anything memorable. I discovered that I remembered names and faces better than most of the Asian horror movies I've seen, which suggests that there must have been a development of hidden characters that I did not notice consciously. The typical stereotypes are valid in this film, each one has some kind of peculiarity of character that distinguishes them from others, from the shy and calm Yeong-ha and his Damien doll, to the outgoing bimbo Seon-yeong. <br /> <br /> The plot itself was quite great, although the ending, which bought many of the loose lines of the plot, seemed a bit confusing and really did not do anything for me, although I did have a couple of things really great twisted plots that I will not ruin here. The basic plot is a group of children who invite to be modeled as dolls by a famous and lonely old doll maker, they have to stay in the spooky house (adorned with terrifying dolls, some big and small) and things start to be our heroin. Hae-mi begins to explore areas of the house and things start to happen to the other inhabitants. <br /> <br /> In general, I would definitely recommend the movie, do not watch too many people as some of the moments will probably make you laugh if you are surrounded by friends, but as something too, watch only in the dark, with the windows and Open doors just a little, in case any doll wants to look with you. It really leaves you guessing most of the movie, which allows you to use outlandish conspiracy theories to then destroy them completely. If you really get into it and ignore what the cheese is in places, I can guarantee you will check under your bed before going to sleep and maybe even leave the lights on. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it's just me: P Regarding Closer, it was fine, but I preferred this.
