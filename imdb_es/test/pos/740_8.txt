A nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by Dr. Stephens. She is upset to learn that the doctor has died, leaving her assistant Dr. Masters in charge. The inmates baffle her, including a mad judge, a Vietnam veteran, a catatonic and a spooky nymphomaniac, but she soon befriends a huge black man Sam. He needs all the friends he can get as people are dying around him. "Do not Look in the Basement" is my first SF horror movie Brownrigg. Despite his low budget, he manages to provide something genuine. chills and a good amount of cheap blood that includes a particularly unpleasant scene with a desktop spindle through an eyeball. The climax of the inmates who take control over the mental asylum is an intense mix of camera work, gore and heartbreaking screams.8 out of 10.
