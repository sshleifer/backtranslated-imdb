The Lone Ranger was one of the heroes of my childhood, and I never missed the opportunity to see his adventures on the reps on Saturday morning in the mid-1950s. However, somehow, this movie happened by my side until I had the opportunity to capture it today courtesy of my local library. I was surprised by a number of elements during the story, since from the beginning, you have a new Lone Ranger song before listening to the traditional opening used in the television program. The adventure uses Tonto (Jay Silverheels) in a very well expanded role, even though he takes his share of the bundles everywhere, being hit and shot more than once. Perhaps the most interesting of all, the Ranger actually shoots to kill in a couple of situations, putting his character at odds with the vision created for the television series that he would never use his weapon to kill, only to hurt himself or protect himself. himself and others. . <br /> <br /> Apart from that, you have a quite traditional western adventure. The Ranger and Fool come to the aid of an Indian tribe whose members are being killed by hooded assailants trying to track five medallions that, together, form the key to a fabulous treasure. Interestingly, the leader of the bad guys is an already rich woman, played by Noreen Nash. His best henchman is Douglas Kennedy, and it was no surprise to see Lane Bradford as one of the bad guys. Bradford's character was one of the men the Lone Ranger shot, which made me wonder how many times it could have happened in the television series. A quick review revealed that he appeared on the show 'The Lone Ranger' fifteen times, while Kennedy appeared a total of six times. <br /> <br /> What could be the most interesting of all about the image is his attempt to portray the Indians in a revisionist light at a time when television and movie westerns still showed the red man like an illiterate savage. The character of Dr. James Rolfe (Norman Fredric) is the most revealing in that sense; he is an Indian who obtained an education and became a doctor, and returned to the land of his tribe to meet the needs of all his citizens. For the purposes of history, he had to pass himself off as a white man to be accepted by local ranchers. This was the most difficult thing that I accepted from the story in reality, since Dr. Rolfe was the grandson of the old boss Tomache (John Miljan). That nobody in history, except Paviva (Lisa Montell) knew that he was really an Indian, was something difficult for me. I suppose it was possible for him to leave the tribe at a young age, but without the story back to come true, it made no sense to me that no one else in the tribe knew who he was. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I'm so intrigued by this, but after seeing and reviewing over two hundred westerns on this site, I've suddenly come across three movies in the last month that use an attraction trick of blankets like the one made by the Scots horse of Tonto in this photo. The trigger of Roy Rogers made a similar maneuver in "Son of Paleface" of 1952, and I caught it again in "The Big Country" of 1958 by a horse named Old Thunder in that film. It's like a bit of comic relief in a situation that would not normally arise for a horse, and now I'm curious when the piece could have been made for the first time. I'll have to keep seeing more westerns of yesteryear. Not to be left behind, Silver also had the opportunity to shine in the image, saving an Indian baby who was about to be used as a hostage by the evil Brady. <br /> <br /> Speaking of tricks, Clayton Moore borrowed a tactic from the television series when he put on a Southern Knight disguise to drive out the villains by masquerading as hooded hunters. Every time he did it in the half-hour format, he was always smart enough to hide his real characteristics, usually with a beard as it is done here. One of the most interesting episodes that I remember had to do with the Ranger posing as an actor disguised as Abraham Lincoln. <br /> <br /> Look out for a couple of nonsense that I discovered on the way. In an early scene at the opening, an Indian is shot by one of the hooded assailants, and in the foreground, there is blood on his shirt, but there is no bullet hole. Later in the story, Ross Brady and Wilson ride the Indians after they have kidnapped one of the villains out of jail. Brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying the assailants, but is shown immediately to make his getaway on horseback with Wilson.
