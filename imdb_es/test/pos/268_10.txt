I'm surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this t.v. The film ... as far as I know, the series itself, has had a large number of followers, expert analysts and real people, have praised a person. Anyway, let me tell you immediately that, if like me, you're a jerk to the dramas of the police, you'll like "The Lost Child" Tennison, the heroine, throughout the series "Prime Suspect", has been fighting against the male Police Establishment, throughout the series, reaching its current rank, comparatively powerful in the police hierarchy through hard work, stubbornness and great talent for police work. She is, in essence, an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and certainly does not hate men. Unfortunately, her relationships are affected by the bad hours her career demands and she has never married, so when she is pregnant with her last issue, she faces the option of being a mother and endangering all her police work. not to mention future advances, or to have an abortion, for what she chooses. This abortion never takes much importance in the drama that follows: it is treated with great skill, in less than a couple of minutes, a marvel of economics in scripts and editing, but it is always there, as a counterpoint to desperate efforts from Tennison to find another "lost child", a victim of kidnapping, before it's too late. The story takes many twists and turns, before the surprise ending, and one is fascinated, alike, by the plot, and the characters (although I found the many villains a little overdrawn), the police, and especially Tennison, not they are always competent, nor so pleasant, that figure, given the unpleasant work they have to do, in the sordid underworld in which habitually lives this series. <br /> <br /> Mirren, herself, has said she will not do anything. more movies in the series, but, as always has been in the role of Tennison, the series itself is as "proof of actors" as another addiction of mine: the "Law and Order" of Dick Wolf, the American, who appear in it, each one could continue forever As is my fervent hope.
