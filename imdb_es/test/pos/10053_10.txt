I had seen this movie as a child and I loved it. I loved how energetic and energetic Nikki is, and how it ruins Louden's perfect yuppie life, corrupts it and turns it into a madness. When I was a kid in the 80s, I saw New York exactly the way it was shown in this movie, the domination of Madonna's character, with wild animals running and bald men chasing people and wreaking havoc. Now, as an adult, I love the movie for the same reasons, and even more so for the love story between the crazy pranks of Mrs. Nikki Finn. Although I would still love to go anywhere and find an inner atrium like in this movie. Pure beauty and genius.
