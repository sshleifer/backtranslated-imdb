It does not make sense to compare this with the original series. Although they are different in appearance and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, a series of SF / horror anthology. Due to indifferent programming in Australia, I could only capture a small number of episodes in the first seasons. The first episode really gave me chills (nightmares at my age ...!) But others stayed on the floor; in general, when the stories moved to the realms of terror and moved away from SF. I just hope that the DVDs will eventually reach us
