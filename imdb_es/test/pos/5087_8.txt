However, the short life "The Amazing Spider-Man" was one of the best television versions of a famous comic book hero. Only "Wonder Woman" (Lynda Carter) (the best of the genre and "The Incredible Hulk" (Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno) were better. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Spider-Man" exceeds the 1966 1968 "Batman", because the high elements of the latter's camp often ruined the adventure. "Spider-Man" overcomes the three television performances of "Superman": "Lois and Clark", "Smallville" and, of course, George Reeves "Superman" who raises the rear. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Spider-Man" was an action drama, at the end of the 1970s, the pre-CGI era, when the tricks had to be made by specialists, not in a computer database. "Spider-Man" had his own highly talented specialist to perform the reckless stunts of death, his name was Fred Waugh, who put on the suit for action sequences Nicholas Hammond, better known as one of The Children of Julie Andrew in the classic movie of all Times "The Sound of Music" was Spider-Man during the dialogue scenes. Hammond's Spider-Man also had his own Identity secrecy as Peter Parker, similar to Christopher Reeve-Superman / Clark Kent, Adam West-Batman / Bruce Wayne, and of course Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman / Diana Prince. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the series is unique. He had thirteen episodes. Because when the first episode hit the airwaves in November 1977, the whole country was watching it on CBS on Wednesday night. To be fair, CBS should launch this pilot episode, as well as "The Deadly Dust", the "Captive Tower", etc. on DVD soon. "Spider-Man" did not last long, but it had many followers, and in my opinion it was much better than the cinematographic interpretation of the famous hero of the comic, starring Toby McGuire. <br /> <br /> CBS You might hesitate to launch these episodes for two reasons. (A) There may not be a broad market for them due to the lack of longevity of the series and to a generation of children and young people who were not born when the series originally aired in the 1970s. (B) One of the first episodes of "Spider-Man" had to do with a terrorist with designs in the World Trade Center, which was attacked twice after this show aired, in 1993, and of course the devastating attack on this Country on 11 September 2001 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost. <br /> <br /> However, I do not think it's in bad taste to release this episode of "Spider-Man" even if the show was adventure, derived from a comic book and nature camp. The live action "Amazing Spider-Man" does not have many followers but has a cult. When CBS released it on DVD, this cult could be explained along with the episode in which Spiderman saved the towers in 1978, but in September 2001 real life proved to be different from the movies. I like to follow the news, but I also like Science Fiction / Fantasy. Therefore, I am eagerly awaiting the release of "The Amazing Spider-Man on DVD."
