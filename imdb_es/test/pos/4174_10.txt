What can I say about this movie that has not been said in all the other comments here? They summarize everything, people who love him appreciate him, people who hate him ... well, they hate him. This is the film equivalent to Marmite. <br /> <br /> Personally, I've saved every second of it in memory, it's cyclical, claustrophobic, introspective, magical and stands out as one of the most exclusive movies ever made. Despite what many have said, I think this really is a cult movie, it's a diamond in the rough that is waiting to be discovered, once you discover its fantastic psychedelic images and an incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable, which is a achievement in itself. One of my friends who saw him compared it more with a musical and, in many aspects, with those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made, will probably take more advantage to see Head as such. <Br /> <br /> I always liked the Monkees, especially the television show when it was repeated during the 80's. My mother had recorded Head for me when it aired on television late at night, since I knew that I liked them, I saw it a day later and I kept it in my memory until I was able to find a DVD copy about 2 decades later . What I would love now is a special edition, it would be fascinating to get a better view of the realization of this masterpiece. We can only wait.
