Widely known as "Do not look in the basement": this is pure horror of the 70s, kindness of the B movie that could happen as the genre version of "Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest". Although the film seems to go nowhere during the first hour + of its execution time, I enjoyed this particular group of peculiar crazy people and their various personalities and shortcomings, such as the former army sergeant, a girl obsessed with caring for a plastic doll, an adorable man. -Na√±a, and a crazy nymph. After a doctor killed his family doctor, a small sanitarium hires a new nurse in his facilities with few staff, which is immersed in the different "ticks" and outbursts of the resident. However, things become increasingly strange when patients begin to act much more abnormally than normal ... You never really know, or care, where the film is going, because it is still entertained until it is completely finished. Several of the "twists" felt a bit too forced and I could have used a little more blood, but I really dug this overly undervalued mix of humor and horror. Check it out...
