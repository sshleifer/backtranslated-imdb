As the war did not go well for the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the prisoners as shock troops. This is the story of such a battalion. There are petty criminals, political prisoners, soldiers expelled from other units, gray-haired veterans of the White Army and some dangerous criminals. <br /> <br /> They are thrown into battle poorly equipped, they are not trained and they face the threat. of the NKVD if they show signs of cowardice or failure. <br /> <br /> Special effects are rudimentary and many of the secondary characters are one-dimensional, but the general story is very human and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing. Seeing the program required the liberal use of the pause button and the explanations of a native speaker of Russian.
