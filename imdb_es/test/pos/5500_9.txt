'In the Line of Fire' is one of those Hollywood movies that appears a lot on television, but although I've seen it several times, I usually end up going over the whole thing. Why? - It's good! Clint Eastwood is great as always, and the character he plays is interesting and more developed than usual. The character, Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan, is obsessed with the fact that he was in the details that did not protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and now he is forced to face a professional assassin who openly declares that he will kill the president. However, the film does not make him a depressed, melancholy and obsessed character. He is charming and pleasant, and is realistic as a man who has experienced a lot in life and feels comfortable in his own skin. He is even quite convincing when he flirts with the fairly young agent played by Rene Russo. The killer, played by John Malkovich at his best, is cerebral, deliberate and enjoys playing high risk games of life and death. It is even known by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth. <br /> <br /> The film is always nice and offers all the goods: suspense, action, romance and drama, all in their proper amounts. It's a funny movie that is really helped by the great actors in it!
