Under the safe direction of F. Gary Gray, "Italian Job" never loses control of being cool and fun. Although the material is annealed and average, the film itself is brilliantly executed and is satisfactorily good. The tone could easily have been much heavier, considering the plot of the murder and the revenge, but F. Gary Gray maintains the light tone with good humor, agile dialogues and pulsating music. It's a pleasure to see these bad guys forming a great bond and sticking to each other through deception and murder, never forgetting to have fun. This is 7/10.
