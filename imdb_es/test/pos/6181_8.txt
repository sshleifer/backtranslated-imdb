It's about getting what you want when you want it. And Bluebeard's Eighth Network message is to be careful what you want, until you want wishes for yourself. <br /> <br /> Most men have heard stories about what happens when your sexual frustration is not alleviated. and a certain part of your anatomy turns blue. Leaving aside the misogynistic pirates, Cooper plays a very rich man who is very used to getting what he wants when he wants it, learning too late that it was not what he expected and never learning his lesson until he comes across the fighter Claudette Colbert. Through a twisted business (in the soul and in practice), he ends up getting married / buying with the intention of going to bed with her, but she will have none of that (literally) and frustrates him at every step, in the corner and in the room, and the tourist attraction. <br /> <br /> The film has definite French sensibilities, which means it has a strong boudoir sense of humor and a double meaning for the day and a edge you're not used to (and you may not enjoy watching) in Cooper or Colbert. The main reason why I saw the movie was because they are "nice" actors, and the objective of this film is that they are unpleasant people, or at least nice people who have developed unpleasant traits to protect themselves, they think, from the world . <br /> <br /> If you can accept it on your own terms, you will find satisfaction in this ingenious and sophisticated film ... and satisfaction, as we said, is what it is about. A film like that with a cast only appears, after all, once in a ... ummm ... blue moon.
