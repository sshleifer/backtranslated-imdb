I saw this movie when it first came out and I've never forgotten it. My uncle Antoine is much, much bigger than the sum of its parts. The film, roughly speaking, is about a preteen who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical, but underneath there is a current building. MUA has a slow pace, but be patient, the reward is coming. I think the movie was subtitled and, as with all movies that do not speak English, I've seen that it's worth avoiding any dubbed version. The dubbed movies inevitably reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors, with the additional need for lip sync lines that do not fit well. The English-speaking Amarcord is a sham, for example, while the subtitled version sings. My uncle Antoine is worth the time to find him and see him in French.
