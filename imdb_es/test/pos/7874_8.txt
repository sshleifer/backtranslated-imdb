This was a rather disconcerting look at an apparently functional family confronted by her daughter's drug-addicted boyfriend. The father is entangled with and finally kills the drug addict boyfriend. When wallowing in guilt, he reveals to a drunken peasant what he has done. Things quickly get out of control before they degenerate completely. The ending that you fear stalks the viewer at all times, but still is able to startle when it finally arrives.
