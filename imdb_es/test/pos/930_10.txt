It seems that the old man's dream will come true after all, and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days. <br /> <br /> An INCREDIBLE ending for possibly the BEST trilogy of all time! Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. He is one of my favorite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema. His use of the colors of the French flag in the three films was incredible, each shot, each scene was like a work of art. Three of the most visually appealing movies I've seen. And its subtle connections between the three films are impressive. It usually means a subtle pause, or a late focus on a scene, to see if it can detect something. I have to mention this and it is a great SPOILER, I loved the ending, how all the characters in the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man looking at her. TV, solidifying his happiness for the suffering he dealt with for so many years. I could not think of a better way to finish the movie, but a smile on my face, a great way to end an amazing movie and trilogy! I recommend it for ALL those who love movies, movies, anything ... A work of art! 10 out of 10 for the film and the trilogy.
