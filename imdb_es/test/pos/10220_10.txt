The movie 'Nightbreed' is one of the best horror movies I've seen in my life. In general, I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but there's something in this movie that is more atmospheric and unlike any other horror movie I've seen. Many horror films that I have seen have liked to see them, however, as they are based on horror, I know that the stories are unreal, since they are fictitious, so I can not take them all seriously. Nightbeed, on the other hand, is a unique horror genre, as it has a sense of realism that I have seen in very few other horror films. <br /> <br /> This film tells how a man is killed and ends. Living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreamy nightmare as it is a very unique and original story. Most of the horror movies I've seen are all fake, but since Nightbreed was incredibly sophisticated and brilliantly directed with excellent acting, especially for the incredible special effects of Craig Sheffer (Aaron Boone), great lighting and fantastic dialogue, I found that This movie has a sense of depth and maturity without false parody of terror, as it is, that many other horror movies have. Nightbreed, in addition to being horror, has elements of suspense, romance and action, all in one. If you have not seen this movie, I recommend that you see it, since I qualify it with a 10/10.
