This is not walking in the park. I saw this when it came out, and I have not had the guts to see it again. You will never see a movie more horribly devastating or depressing. I felt that I had been severely beaten. In what kind of world do we live when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? This is our world, what we have created, what we have allowed to happen. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE is not responsible for this. Babenco made this film to wake us up, to shake us to the depths of our hearts, and he succeeded. How can we be cruel, self-indulgent or careless with our children when we see the graphic results of such behavior? He is accusing us all for doing this to the humblest and least powerful of our society. And if you are not doing something every day to avoid it, then you are part of the problem. I am NOT a religious fanatic, but this movie made me think about the state of my soul.
