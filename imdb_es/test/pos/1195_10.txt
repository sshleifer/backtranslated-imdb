Milos Forman's original HAIR was the perfect film that actually revealed how life was changing in those years, not just in the US. UU., But especially in this country. One of the plots of the film would be used in other films after Hair, for example, in American Graffitti, etc. It was an original story with a touch of generational sadness. The characters in the film were like solitary "cells" in a "body" that was changing completely. In general, a very good movie, maybe a little underestimated. The role of Annie Golden was minor, but she acted very well. It was the movie that practically released John Savage as an actor. One of the members of Chicago played his role well although it was a minor role.
