Considering Chan's films that would follow, this is not bad. A lot of stereotypes that start with the black man at the beginning and when the police captain orders that "all the Hindus of the city" be reduced. A parade of stereotyped characters enter the scene, including Shemp of the Three Stooges. Charlie seems to move quickly through the city going from Sutton Pl. To the village W. in an instant. The end is silly. An obvious toy airplane is used, as it ascends through the sky and then dives into the nose. Ed Wood could not have done it better. The final scene is absurd since the murderer will obviously incriminate himself in his attempt to silence the only person who knows his identity. In general, it's worth seeing.
