There is no doubt that this version of Tarzan is the closest to Burroughs's vision. While he gladly collected his royalties from the films produced during his life, he often made it clear that they were little more than the bastard children of his stories. The ridiculous obsession of film studios with choosing Olympic swimmers like Tarzan was more than ridiculous. I guess we should consider ourselves lucky to have not set our sights on the putters. <br /> <br /> Before this film, the most faithful adaptations were comic strips and comics. As well as some of these were, we had to wait seven decades for a filmmaker with integrity to respect the character as he had created it.
