If you're a fan of the videos of Jackass, Viva La Bam or CKY, then you know what you're on. But this is one of those rare events when a sequel is better than the original! And the man makes this movie package a bad bass hit. But I mean that in a good way. It is the same kind of madness defiant to death and heartbreaking that we have all come to know, love and expect from Bam, Knoxville and Co. But this time with more laughter than ever! With Johnny Knoxville's crazy tolerance for pain, Bam Margera's love for harassing his friends / family and the Steve-O factor, you have an incredibly fun movie. The bar for the acrobatics, satires and general chaos of the crew of Jackass has risen. Jackass 3? Doubtful, because it is almost impossible to improve perfection.
