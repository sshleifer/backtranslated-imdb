Clint Eastwood has a great score in this 1993 thriller. Equipped with an absolute master of the edge of suspense from his seat, Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood offers as he alone can. In addition, John Malkovich continues on my list of most effective screen villains in film history as the insane killer. As for Rene Russo, as Clint's love interest, I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said, referring to his own career: "I keep getting older and my main ladies keep getting younger." This movie is a very effective thriller with enough twists and surprises in the plot to keep moving forward. Eastwood and Peterson should team up more often. First category movie.
