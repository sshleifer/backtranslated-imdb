Another Asian horror movie full of intense and spooky moments. Another Asian horror brand is the complexity of the plot, which is also here. THE MAIN SPOILER WARNING! <br /> <br /> The film starts quite simply: two sisters are going to live with their dad and stepmother after they put her in a mental institution after her mother hanged herself. The sisters seem very hostile toward their mother, especially the older one, and seem to ignore their father. Everything is fine until the mother locks the young sister in the closet and the older sister tells her father. Then it hits you, "your sister has been dead for years." It turns out that the older sister still has not recovered from the death of her mother and what we did not know is that the wardrobe in which the mother was hung fell on the floor. the younger sister and killed her too. As for the stepmother, she is the alter ego of the older sister, it is revealed when the stepmother (actually the alter ego of the sister) is sitting on a sofa when the real stepmother enters! I hope it's cleared up for the confused Asian horror fans out there. <br /> <br /> Finally, my favorite scene is the scene in which the father invites his friends to dinner and one of the friends begins to drown. A panic attack Very spooky! 7 out of 10
