The masterpiece of Visconti! I admit that I am not familiar with much of your work, but I can not imagine that your other work will exceed this fabulous movie. Last night I saw death in Venice after an absence of about 25 years and I was totally captivated by everything I saw. This captivity was a pastiche composed of many elements: the extraordinary shots directed by Visconte, mainly his love for the long and languid shots of people who eat, swim, walk and contain an important character that passes through this mass of people; The filmmakers brilliantly interpreted Visconti's selection of shots; It's true: young people who see this movie for the first time must be aware that they are seeing a unique image. film, a film that could not be made in 2006. A film whose time rests in those brief years of the sixties and early seventies of the last century, when the artistic license passed to film directors and men of money they took secondary roles. As many of the recent IMDb commentators have written, this film, in his opinion, is long, boring (very little action) and pretentious. I suppose that by Hollywood pap standards, these comments contain merit. Unfortunately, they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and similar ones of those years. <br /> <br /> Please, if you have not seen Death in Venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in a movie and a story. from another time. You will be rewarded.
