The sweet and young nurse Charlotte Beale (a charming performance by the dazzling redhead Rosie Holotik) goes to work in a remote rural asylum led by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick). Among the motley assortment of colorful and crazed patients are the insatiable and aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the exquisite Betty Chandler), the lazy judge Oliver W. Cameron (a gloriously hammy Gene Ross), the paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee (very well played by Hugh Feagin), gentle giant Sam (the kind William Bill McGhee) and crazy old Callingham (the extremely irritating Rhea MacAdams). Dr. Masters dangerously encourages these patients to perform their fantasies, which of course results in a series of brutal murders. Director S.F. Brownrigg, who works from an intelligent script and properly developed by Tim Pope, does an expert job in creating and maintaining a suffocating atmosphere soaked with oppressive madness and claustrophobia. The spooky score of Robert Farrar, the dirty design of the stage, some wild and frightening murders, the grungy grungy cinematography of Bruce B. Alcott, a bunch of deliciously robust histrionics and staging landscapes of an unnamed cast of the game (Ross in particular it's a total eye) - and the truly surprising and surprising conclusion of the bloodbath adds to the infectious and general amusement of this low-budget 70's regional horror movie garbage pick.
