A brief history of time is not just a documentary about the beginning and end of the universal and reality as we know it, this is a story about man and the genius known as Stephen Hawking. It is their history that reflects the history of time and change throughout the history of the universal. The style of editing / documentary style of the interviews begins and ends with a rapid fading to black. Almost like blinking between segments and interviews, the documentary gives you a strange feeling that this is Stephen Hawking's point of view and not the camera's eye. The execution time is just a little over an hour. It is a short story, then, once again, your subject could be treated for days and days. An interesting and proud story.
