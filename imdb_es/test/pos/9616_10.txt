Well, as a fan of Kung Fu movies, I must say that this is one of the best I've seen. Of course there is nothing special about the plot, but man entertains it. Like most movies of the genre. This movie is full of action and does not flaunt its viewers. It's very funny when I see that I have a smile on my face all the time. This also has an impact on future films like Kill Bill. (Many of the effects of Kill Bill's Sound come from this movie, for example). This is an essential visualization for all the known spectators in Kung Fu. The open form to close this movie is full of fights that really are some of the best I've seen in the genre. There are few Kung Fu movies out there that are up to the magic and entertainment of this movie. So if looking for a great Kung Fu movie, check this out for sure.
