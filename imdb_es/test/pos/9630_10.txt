I really enjoyed The Patriot. This film had less violence and was based on a threat to real life that could inevitably destroy our civilization. A line in wesley mclaren's film (seagal) occurred to me to be very true in our society, "western medicine is in the practice of prolonging the disease and I am in the business of curing it". <br /> <br />
