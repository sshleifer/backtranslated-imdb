THE DEATH HAND definitely qualifies a ten on the one-to-one scale, in large part, to the masterful direction of John Woo, along with Kat's excellent picture: some of the tracking shots are slowly worth the price of a rental; There are times when it is limited to becoming an art film. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung are the kind of villains you can not help but love to hate. Tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad guys. It's a reversal of roles that I do not think I've seen before (Tien was usually a hero and, in fact, with his mustache, I did not even recognize him at first). Sammo's "rooster teeth" only make a character that is already nasty look even more flawed; the fact that he is also an expert martial artist makes him even less pleasant, in a villain you love to hate in one way or another. His choreography of the fight scenes is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears briefly (early and late on the road) as a blacksmith, and I think I actually caught a glimpse of Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. As the lead is nothing less than magnificent.
