It was time to make a film about the situation in an Asian country largely ignored as Myanmar and Beyond Rangoon is the answer of Hollywood. Initially, I thought Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add the traditionally Hollywood-type love spice of the Titanic type between the main heroine and the Burmese protagonist who turns out to be an elder. Fortunately, none of that was in place, which may also explain why the film was not financially successful. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film was honest to God and I was happy with the accuracy of the events described. . Apart from the fact that the filming took place outside of Myanmar in Malaysia and Thailand and that I missed the exotic places of Burma, I could not find many flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> You can not blame the film for the despair of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. It is, after all, the real events of a civil war. The music of Hans Zimmer is definitely the USP of an adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it. <br /> <br /> He was only one year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) during this tumultuous time. When I heard a movie about my real life experience that I was too young to absorb, I had to get the DVD and, of course, I could not have any complaints about it, since it is a revealing wonder to me. .
