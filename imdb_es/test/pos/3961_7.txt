This is a movie for teenagers and as you watch it, you wait for some nonsense stuff added here and there, but in general the movie is very effective, it makes you question and leaves you thinking that the story is a bit exaggerated but it is credible and makes you feel good in the sequences, it's not like the usual way of doing and trying. The characters are pretty well defined and convincing. Justin for a long time stands out among all the others and, in the end, take care of his speech. It will convince anyone who with that speech is simply brilliant in that speech. You need to take on some more serious roles, it's worth more than just movies for teenagers. Record this movie and be released.
