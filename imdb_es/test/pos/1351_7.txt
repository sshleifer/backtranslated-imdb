Good entertainment but nothing more: in this western we are among the classics and spaghetti. This gives us a good conventional story, but it is always a pleasure to see Robert Mitchum with his legendary phlegm even if he is not as fit as in the forties or fifties. And do not forget that David Carradine is the son of John Carradine.
