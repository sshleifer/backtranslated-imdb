Kathleen Beller, a Doe-eyed high school student, is found beaten and <br /> <br /> raped in the opening scenes of this television movie. The movie <br /> <br /> then reappears a few days before the rape, since Beller is <br /> <br /> harassed by a stranger. <br /> <br /> Beller and Scott Colomby and her Best friend Robin Mattson and <br /> <br /> Dennis Quaid have double dates from the start. The anxious parents of Beller, <br /> <br /> rested Tony Bill and Blythe Danner, waving, waited at home wringing their hands and so on. Immediately, the 1970s makes its entry dated <br /> <br />, while young couples discuss romance and love in <br /> <br /> "Three days of the condor". <br /> <br /> Beller, an amateur photographer, starts receiving threatening notes <br /> <br /> stuck in his locker at school. The filmmakers wisely give us a lot of suspects: Beller's new boyfriend, Mattson's boyfriend, Beller's father, Beller's ex boyfriend, and what about that <br /> <br /> class teacher too friendly photograph that wants Beller to be a little sexier in her self-portraits? I knew who was the rapist <br /> <br /> because the video box of the company Worldvision Video has an image of <br /> <br /> the attack on the back cover, destroying any suspense in that <br /> < Br /> respect. <br /> <br /> Without revealing who the attacker is, Beller starts receiving <br /> <br /> harassing phone calls and is finally violated. Then, the movie <br /> <br /> heads south while doing as Nancy Drew and secretly sets <br /> <br /> a time lapse camera to catch the boy who is stalking another student . <br /> <br /> Finally, the filmmakers tackle the narrative of a hokey end of <br /> <br /> Beller about the lack of understanding of rape victims on that day <br /> <br /> day and age <br /> <br /> The suspense here is very real, without going over the scary movie. Beller is very good, and look at her and <br /> <br /> Mattson's scene in an abandoned theater, both do great jobs. The movie <br /> <br /> is full of familiar faces, including Ellen Travolta in a small role, <br /> <br /> and they are all professionals. <br /> <br /> This was done in 1978, and that shows us. I'm sure no one had an idea <br /> <br /> that this would be reviewed in 2001 by a horror film lover <br /> <br /> who has to criticize and needs to go to bed and get up early in the morning, but some of the attitudes here are embarrassing. The teacher <br /> <br /> who tells Beller to be sexy is never made to explain exactly what <br /> <br /> he had in mind. Nowadays, if some high school teacher said <br /> <br /> that, then THAT would have been a television movie on its own. <br /> <br /> After Beller is raped, the rapist is still a part of his life, as order orders are issued, blah, blah, blah. There may not be a case because <br /> <br /> Beller is not a virgin, and she can not prove that she was raped by whom <br /> <br /> she said. Many of these problems have been addressed with modern technology and police efforts, but this film obviously <br /> <br /> knew that it would have an opportunity to add to the reform debate. The rape is <br /> <br /> an act of violence that has not disappeared, but the current efforts to catch <br /> <br /> the attackers are far ahead of twenty-four years. The problem <br /> <br /> is that the anti-violation angle feels stuck, like an idea of ​​the last <br /> <br />. Before that, we have a tight little suspender that has really honest <br /> <br /> characterization of God. After the violation, everything changes <br /> <br />, in the sense of the movies, and not for the better. <br /> <br /> I remember Beller from the 70s and 80s (and who could forget <br /> <br /> her revealing role in "The Betsy"), but she has not done anything in <br /> > <br /> almost ten years. This is a shame, since she was very good <br /> <br /> back then. <br /> <br /> I will recommend you "Are you at home alone?" based on the <br /> <br /> acting alone, with a reluctant nod to at least the first two thirds of the movie <br /> <br />. If you want to relive the 1970s made for high school life on television, this is your Tab mug. <br /> <br /> This is not classified but contains physical violence, something sexual <br /> <br /> Violence, and some adult situations.
