TV News producer Jane Craig (Hunter) meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), a promising news anchor at a seminar, and their mutual attraction takes them back to his room. However, the romance is interrupted when it appears that Tom, according to his own words, "is not good at what I am being a success," and Jane realizes that she embodies everything she hates about where the television news goes. . The problem occurs when Tom reveals that he is about to join his news office in Washington. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the initial attraction of Jane and Tom is given a second chance, but Jane can set aside her professional opinion about the man she is attracted to, and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is a very intelligent colleague and confidante of Jane. Despite his obvious talent, Aaron's career is stagnating as he lacks the confidence and skills of the people, and the classic look, to be the success in which his new colleague, less qualified and less, is becoming Smart, Tom. She is also concerned that her good friend Jane has fallen in love with Tom, despite her good judgment, as it becomes increasingly clear that Aaron has his own romantic feelings towards her. <br /> <br /> This central romantic argument is established. within the trials and tribulations of an office of the television news network, where moral dilemmas and ethics are quickly confronted and where appearances and dramatic effects are becoming more frequent and important. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the bite comes from with comments and well-observed scenes. One of the many moments is a scene in which Tom meets the main presenter of the Network, Bill Rorich (a cameo role for Jack Nicholson), for the first time, and the camera focuses on his handshake. In a film full of great lines and dialogues, long and short, you realize much about the character of these two men, with this quick shot of two hands. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between characters is among the most intelligent and ingenious, it is likely that you will ever find it anywhere in the cinema and in such abundance. Brooks gets the best part of them, in line with his character, but even the briefest conversations that are incidental and perhaps heard by one or more of the characters as they move through a room full of people, should be heard . <Br /> <br /> Hunter is a tour-de-force in this role for which she was (and not alone) nominated for an Oscar, and for which she probably would have done it if it was for a role in a movie that it did not. Do not make fun of what had become a closely related industry, and against a strong performance by another actress in a more traditional romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Brooks is also excellent, as he constantly feels frustrated. occasionally too presumptuous for his own good, Aaron Altman. <br /> <br /> Wounded, though he possesses the looks and provides the personality required for his character, he does not always convince that he is so tenuous. The character says he is or is supposed to be. It shows a latent intelligence that allows you to make the most of its apparent limitations, which may be plausible, but I do not think Hurt will achieve it. In addition to when he tells us that he "stinks" or "does not understand", Hurt appears as a bit more intelligent than that. Otherwise, it's an effective performance, in a role where his character is compromised by his intellectual limitations, but Brooks and Hunter slightly eclipse Hurt's performance. It's the only negative thing I can say about the whole movie, and who can say that anyone else would have done better, or behaved better, when I was next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this movie. <Br /> <br /> The support is skillfully provided by, among others, Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack, and there is also a partial part for Christian Clemenson of the subsequent Boston Legal reputation, and the shortest of the bit parts for Joan brother, John Cusack, whose face you do not even see. <br /> <br /> James L Brooks has provided us with many great television shows and movies, and this movie should be the best of all. He may not have won an Oscar, despite all seven nominations, but he won many other awards and made Holly Hunter a star.
