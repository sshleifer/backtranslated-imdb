Recently I came across a television show from "Passion ...." (having lost the first scenes). Ms. Currier is praised for having the vision and courage to bring such a weird Balzac story to the screen. I am grateful to all the cast and crew for their parts in the production of such a fine moving image. It must have been hard to shoot so many scenes in the desert. And I can not understand how his coach managed to persuade a good "performance" of the leopard, Simoon. (This ad reminds us of another suspense adventure, "Naked Prey"). Why is this movie not better known? I hope I can find it on video.
