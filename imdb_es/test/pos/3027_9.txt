What makes seeing and reviewing films a pleasure is that from time to time, when you least expect it, a movie like The Cell appears and takes off your socks. This movie is a magnificent horror that has everything you could want when you want to be scared. Without going into the story, all I'll say is that it has a great beginning, middle and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat while you stay still with the incredible special effects. The acting is good without being outstanding, but that does not matter because the theme and the way it is presented on the big screen make this one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. It's one of those movies you imagined that started as a novel, but they say it does not look like an adaptation, so a lot of credit should go to Mark Protosovich, the writer. 9 out of 10.
