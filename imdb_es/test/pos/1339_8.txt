This is a difficult film to review, since several factors must be taken into account. Let's filter the most critical ... Well, are you interested in the facts related to Jeffrey Dahmer's serial killer? Can you support an independent and low budget movie? Are you objective enough so that you DO NOT dislike a movie just for its lack of stars or professional appearance? Well, if you said yes, then you should have a mind open enough to handle this. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and the subsequent wave of murders, and is designed as an autobiography. It is not a glamorous and unrealistic account that, unfortunately, was the theatrical movie "Dahmer" (2001). The film begins with Dahmer, played quite convincingly by Carl Crew, sitting in the police car while attacking his apartment. His thoughts about what brought him there are presented to us in a narrated and past tense style that accurately explains much of the psychoses and Dahmer's motives that led him to commit murder almost 20 times. We got to know the character, both the tortuous side and the side that approached moderately to live a normal life. It is not anyone's fault, but Dahmer's that 17 people died, but as a student of criminal psychology, I was more pleased than his animal side represented, sincerely, in this film. You see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother, as well as trying to find companionship, but, of course, we are witnesses to the side of him that everyone remembers. It should be noted that there is little real violence on the screen, with much of it suggestive in shots like splashes of blood or a body hit through a blurry curtain. I see two deaths that I remember, one of them is a throat cut with no blood and the other a man pushed alive in a barrel of acid. While you do not see anything graphic, this cruelty and the convincing performance of both Crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene. And while the actual mutilation on the screen remains low, you will see the results. There is a support hand and one or two heads, but it seems that this was to annoy the viewer and does not seem to be an exploiter. In addition, these fake anatomical pieces are where budget constraints are visible. Although they are acceptable, they resemble fakes so as not to be too disturbing. The film actually ends before Dahmer's death in 1994, due to the fact that it was released one or two years earlier. That is the only big difference with real history, and the information that remains is, as I said, very true to the facts. The quality of the film could be better, the dialogue often sounds a bit too quiet, and the performance of several characters is a bit silly, but it is not exaggerated. In my opinion, this is a faulty but, ultimately, honest and serious look at one of the most remembered serial killers in the United States. I think it's also safe to say that the film is memorable, and I respect it for overcoming its limitations to present the story in a credible way, with the help of an excellent Carl Crew like Dahmer.
