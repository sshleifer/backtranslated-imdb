This is a lovely little movie, which like many of them, is due to the circumstances involved rather than the actual dialogue. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford (as always) shines in a great comedic performance as the ruthless Air Force officer, he married after just one day with gold dancer Gold Debie Reynolds. <br /> <br /> After the first wedding night of passion and a change of life in Spain, the two quickly realized that a strong sexual attraction they feel for each other, they have nothing in common . <br /> <br /> However, when she decides to give her marriage a chance, it is on the understanding that only for a one-month test period and sex. It's definitely not in the cards. <br /> <br /> Ford is also suffering a shortage in his new $ 40,000 Lincoln Futura Concept Car (the future Batmobile) he wins in a raffle the same night he meets his new wife. <br /> <br /> The car is giving you unwanted attention from the Air Force, which sees it as a vulgar spread to American wealth and is generating suspicions of corruption and embezzlement, etc. He is also putting it in the 80-90% tax range and without a dime as he now faces a tax bill of more than $ 17,000. It is not the amount of money you should owe when your wife is the kind of person who spends more than $ 1,000 on a single shopping trip. <br /> <br /> Even when you try to sell it, it brings you the misfortune of selling so much. Like a cigarette or a pair of socks for the natives can be punished with a court martial, so you can imagine that a transaction of $ 17,500 practically has the firing squad polishing their rifles. <br /> <br /> Your potential buyer is also causing you problems. As he is an awful and beautiful nobleman who fights against the bull, whose interest in the automobile has led to a greater interest in Ford's wife, it has been aggravated by the fact that she offers a rich jet set lifestyle and is what she has sought. <br /> <br /> With Ford's growing sexual frustration and jealousy in his loving rival, along with Reynolds' materialistic attitude and flirtatious behavior around the Spanish sweetheart who serves to push the wedge between the two, it seems that your vortex relationship is destined to end. <br /> <br /> But, first of all, can the love and attraction that united these two birds of love, shine and keep them together? <br /> <br /> It is not the best example of This genre of film, but because of observable performances by its principles and the pleasant plot, it is certainly a good one.
