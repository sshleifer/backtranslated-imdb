I've seen this movie probably a dozen times since it was released theatrically. Anyone who calls this movie junk or horrible just does not understand the action movies or recognizes a good one. Maybe for some the incidents and the results may seem far-fetched, but in my opinion, screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon / Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) created one of the best thought action adventures I've ever seen. Above or not, this movie flows like a clock and the action keeps coming. The final action sequence is one of the best I've seen in any movie. The cast in this movie crackles. Genna Davis gave a great performance and it is a pity that there is never a sequel to "LKG". Samuel L. Jackson is as funny as his partner Mitch, who does not agree with his private eye of luck, trying to help her discover her lost past and earn a few dollars. If it baffles me, nobody can like this movie. Pack so many emotions and it's so fun. The jokes in this movie still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later. In my opinion, the first movie of Matrix and Long Kiss Goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action movies of the 90s. By the way, Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script. At that time it was the best-selling script and it's worth every penny. It's so sad that the public has never given this film a chance, because they would have seen Renny Harlins the best movie and Genna Davis as you've never seen her before. Long live "The Good Kiss Goodnight"!
