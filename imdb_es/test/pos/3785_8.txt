This movie as it stands now is much shorter than it was when it was released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium-sized Chaplin dumb features (A DOG'S LIFE and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin launched again in the 1950s. In his day, SHOULDER ARMS was a huge success due to his humor in a uniform approach. It's still very funny (Chaplin disguised as a tree, spying on Germans, he's so ridiculous that he's hysterical), but he suffers from being established in his own age. Charlie is dealing with the First World War, a horrible conflict that killed 20 million people, but not the worst (horrible to say) war of the 20th century. Chaplin would live to see that war too, and would cheat his leading architects in THE GREAT DICTATOR. But the latter is more accessible to modern audiences because that film is a spoken image. In addition, Hitler as a target seems to be more important to the public in 2008 than Kaiser Wilhelm II and his staff in general. <br /> <br /> SHOULDER ARMS took us through the vagabond's writing, his training, his getting used to Trench Warfare, and his actual fight against the "Huns" on the Western Front. Much of this is gone: a segment (when Albert Austin is a doctor examining Chaplin in his office at the recruiting center) still exists and was shown completely in the documentary UNKNOWN CHAPLIN. This is unfortunate, because the movie now lasts approximately forty-five minutes, and there seem to be gaps that these scenes filled. What remains is first class, but one is left wanting more ... and feels a little cheated. <br /> <br /> Sydney Chaplin and Henry Bergman do well to support the parties, especially Sydney as Wilhelm. He had done it before in a short film with Charlie for the sale of bonds, giving a militaristic speech before being hit by the vagabond with a huge hammer called "War Bonds"). Here we see that the vagabond manages to capture Wilhelm and the staff in general in the conclusion. It was only surpassed by Stan and Ollie who captured the German army with a tank and barbed wire in PACK UP YOUR FROBLES. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that Chaplin had a great crisis as a result of his activities during the war. . He was not a naturalized American, neither in 1917 nor in 1952, when Attorney General McGranery publicly announced that Chaplin could not return to the United States because he was a foreign enemy (Chaplin and his family were in Europe on a trip) angered by Charlie. in Switzerland for the rest of his life, except when he became a COUNCIL OF HONG KONG and when he went to Hollywood for his special career "Oscar" in the 1970s). Because he was not an American, he could not be recruited by the US. UU So he sold (with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford) EE. UU War Bonds. But in Britain, tens of thousands perished on the battlefields of World War I, and the public there was upset with Chaplin, whom they considered a "vague" and a coward. Chaplin finally got over this, but the remnants of resentment followed him until he died. This does not detract from the success of SHOULDER ARMS as a film, but it does suggest why Chaplin did not make another modern war movie until 1940, and a more dignified goal.
