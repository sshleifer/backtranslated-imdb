At 2:37 pm in a bathroom at a high school in Adelaide, a student takes his own life and the different worlds of six teenagers change forever. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a brutal, honest and impressive film focused on the Pain of being a teenager. The film follows a day in the lives of six teenagers, all intertwined, all dealing with their own personal dramas. While there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix? the beautiful popular girl who deals with body problems, the one who is most obsessed with her qualifications, there are several horrors that are so far from the mainstream that she can get, including a social outcast dealing with a brutal illness and a young Girl trying to make sense of a devastating event in her past. <br /> <br /> The film is mixed with documentary style interviews of the characters, which some viewers may find a little out of place in the otherwise perfect narrative. The pace is also a bit slow, but it fits with the feel of the movie. The young Australian actors are all stars in their own right, in particular Theresa Palmer, whose moving performance earned her an AFI nomination. <br /> <br /> The movie is very well shot, with an excellent address. Some scenes are a little hard to see? in particular, the suicide scene of five minutes, but in general it is a film that leaves a great impact on its spectators. It attracts you from the shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing which of the six main characters will be the one that will end up in the bathroom. Ultimately, it's a beautiful aspect, but a bit unsettling for teenage life.
