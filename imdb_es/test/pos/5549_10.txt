This movie felt very true to life. I liked the ending that seemed to be resolved naturally without great moments but with many small moments together. You could say it's an honest love story. No matter what the "sexual orientation" of the main characters, it is still a story about love and understanding. <br /> <br /> There were many scenes that involved the family. The stage is during what for some people is a very stressful time. Namely, "the holidays". Christmas to be precise. <br /> <br /> Like most good movies, it deals with themes of love, adaptation, expectations and prejudices that can not be overcome. In the end, Alexandra and Casey choose each other, knowing that love is difficult and it is about giving. Well done.
