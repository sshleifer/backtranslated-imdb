A school teacher in a small town (Geena Davis) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and is really a secret government assassin. Soon, there are men behind her and a small private detective (Samuel L. Jackson). <br /> <br /> This was full of action, with some fantastic special effects and really funny phrases (especially from Jackson). Although the action can get a little silly at times, who cares? After all, are not films supposed to be a good time? <br /> <br /> Craig Bierko is funny as a ruthless villain. The movie itself was a good time for everyone. Just do not expect to have to think too much about it because then, if you take it very seriously, then the movie will not really be fun, but stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie does not deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name.
