I chose this film really for my husband, who works in the radio broadcast. I thought it would be more of a movie that he would enjoy and relate, even though it was from the eighties, so it was a little outdated. This movie really attracts you. Sometimes, you just want to strangle the host, Barry. Sometimes you just want to send some of the fans that call you to a real concentration camp. Sometimes you really feel sorry for Barry, because he really has become too big for his jeans if you know what I mean. I was on the Drama channel at Encore, so I think this is a true story. If you really love dramas, you will love this, even if you do not know all the ins and outs of the broadcasting business. If you are a fan of Alec Baldwin and you are seeing it to see it, you should not. Your part is really a small part in this movie.
