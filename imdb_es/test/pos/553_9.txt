The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting, and they really sold me the mother-daughter relationship. It is a family story that is not muted by ornaments and special effects; A story of how he really is. I could not help sighing at the end of this film because, unfortunately, it's a well-told bittersweet tale of how to grow and relate to family and friends. The performance was quite exquisite and I hope we see Portman and Sarandon in family roles in the future ...
