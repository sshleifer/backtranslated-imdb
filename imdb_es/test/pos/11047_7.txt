Anna Christie (1930) <br /> <br /> Anna Christie has some incredible parts, and some amazing performances, and yet, it should be even better than it is. It has drama. Some of the scenes are really atmospheric, and if the interior shots around the table are boring, other shots at night and at sea are really exciting. Then there are the almost historical and animated scenes set in Coney Island (even a short ride on a roller coaster), and the episode where two women are behind a network in separate beds, and visitors who are halfway there can throw balls to try to give them a tip. Once again, and women (sparsely dressed) lay the egg over which men are strangely sexual. Meanwhile, Garbo (at the front of the crowd) looks on. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo is what makes this movie more than another very good early talkie. She plays all sides of her character. She is shy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish. She laughs and cries, withdraws and pushes out. In a way, it's an extraordinary and forward-thinking film (directed by Clarence Brown, who has a whole series of important films from this era of precoded sound). <br /> <br /> Although it is based on a success of Eugene O'Neil playing, it is the writing that struggles a bit, since the actors seem to go through the steps sometimes. Marie Dressler is great in that exaggerated way that almost marks. And then there's Greta Garbo, who really has a natural presence, even if he seems to be acting in an exaggerated way, just a little, sometimes (but also, everyone else). Garbo is, of course, famous first as a silent actress, and this is her film debut. The public loved her so much that she did a German version the following year.
