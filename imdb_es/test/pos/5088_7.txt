Continuing with the exclusive film program on complicated relationships in some European courts, last night at the Schloss theater was "Anna Boleyn", a film directed by the great director of Teutonic film Herr Ernst Lubitsch. The film shows the terrible story of the queen consort of the British King Henry VIII. She was executed by her husband (well, not exactly, the king ordered the executioners to do their dirty work) without mentioning that this marriage caused an important historical political and religious event, the English Reformation. <br /> <br /> The film stars Dame Henny Porten, Germany's first screen superstar during those early years and Herr Emil Jannings, the fattest actor in Germany in that silent era. Both play their characters in a proper way; Dame Porten is an innocent aristocrat who is progressively interested in the power that the court offers her and Herr Jannings as the unscrupulous, capricious and womanizing British monarch, a very suitable character for this German actor who acts properly, given the extravagance and excessive personality of the character himself. <br /> <br /> In the initial period of the film, Herr Lubitsch was known for his outstanding costumes, colossal productions with big budgets ("Anna Boleyn" cost around 8 million marks, a fortune even for this German count). ) taking great care in the magnificent decorations as can be seen during the coronation procession at the scene of Westminster Abbey, which employed 4,000 extras (the idle Germans of that time were used, which caused the revolutionary workers to create a scandal when the German president Friedrich Ebert visited the stage during the filming). <br /> <br /> In addition to the show, one of the most important aspects of this and all of Herr Lubitsch's films, even during his epic period, is the complex relationship between the main characters. We experience a game of different interests, double meanings and the complicated art of flirting, but what is treated lightly in the first extremes is a tragedy. The importance of these historical facts is revealed in an effective way, but Lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between Henry VIII and Anna Bolena. <br /> <br /> And now, if you will allow me, I must temporarily dismiss myself because this German count must take care that one of his fat and rich heiresses does not lose his head for this Teutonic aristocrat. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http: // ferdinandvongalitzien. blogspot.com/
