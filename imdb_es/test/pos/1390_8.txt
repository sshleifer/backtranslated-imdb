1891: Stalwart, the morally upright military doctor, Lieutenant Claude de Ross (solid Claudio Cassinelli) and several other survivors of the shipwreck disembark on a remote tropical island that is ruled with an iron fist by the ruthless and sadistic Edmund Rackham (played superbly to the steep delightful spot by Richard Johnson), who lives on the island with fighter Amanda Martin (a winning performance by the dazzling Barbara Bach) and his unfortunate biologist, Father Professor Ernest Martin (a beautifully stained representation of Joseph Cotten). In addition, Ross discovers that Professor Martin has control over a dangerous breed of fishing beasts that are being exploited as slave labor by Rackham. The director / co-author Sergio Martino tells the animated and absorbing story at an agile and constant pace, offers a tasty evocation of the exuberant and remote tropical environment, does an expert job of creating and maintaining a spooky and mysterious atmosphere in the third phantasmagorical opening. he even more spicy things with a nice line in dry humor, and presents the thrilling climax charged with action with considerable aplomb that roars. Although the central premise is obviously inspired by "The Island of Dr. Moreau", the story, however, receives a lot of freshness and intrigue due to the ingenious fusion of elements as diverse as voodoo, the lost underwater city of Atlantis, in Martino. The climatic volcanic eruption of mondo destructo, the buried treasure, the unscrupulous genetic experiments, and even some exciting fisticuffs between Ross and Rackham during the exciting conclusion in a totally dynamic, imaginative and, often, immensely entertaining set. The sound that acts for the robust cast qualifies as another substantial advantage: Cassinelli becomes a nice hero, Johnson rehearses his part of juicy villain with enormous aplomb, Bach qualifies as a damsel in distress, plus there are clear contributions from of Beryl Cunningham as the sinister voodoo priestess Shakira, Franco Iavarone as the superstitious Joseph and Roberto Posse as the ill-tempered Peter. The sumptuous wide-screen cinematography of Giancarlo Fernando offers a wide variety of striking images, while the pulsating tribal score of Luciano Michelini hits the hot spot. The amphibious creatures of the humanoid fisherman also look twisted. A very funny movie.
