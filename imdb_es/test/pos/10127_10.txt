The radio was a very good movie and, honestly, I never cry in the movies. But I was pretty close to tears. It really moved me when Radio's mother died and he just did not leave his room. I felt really sad about the way in which, if you were mentally retarded, you really could not understand death. I really liked the movie, and it's a must.
