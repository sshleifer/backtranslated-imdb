For the main criticisms of the film ... The love story: that was not a love story. Those were two anguished people who came together trying to find humanity in ALL. The same happened with the soldiers and the Russian boy. He added a feminine touch, but come and see the American movies ... there is not a close love story. There was no argument: does the war have an argument? I think it's a silly criticism. The plot is as follows. They start with 400 men and the film was reduced to show the lives of about 10 men and how each one did his part and died. Death is the ultimate goal of any story. The fact that there is no happy ending does not mean that you do not have a story. <br /> <br /> There was a horrible truth in this movie. I would not necessarily call it "against war." I had a political statement, of course, but the movie was not all about politics. In fact, except for a few cases when the captain? appeared, there was never a suffocating air of Nazi Germany. They were far enough from the reach of the main Nazi party. Fat cats were not going to Russia! <br /> <br /> It may not be completely accurate and it may not be a Hollywood hit, but it shows great knowledge of the common soldier (I would say exactly of almost any nationality and war) and what must happen. It was a losing battle, of course the movie is going to be depressing. And to the person who said he was bold (and silly) to even represent the Germans as victims: there are victims everywhere in all wars (any real soldier will tell you). <br /> <br /> This movie is a good balance between film and documentary. Some problems with him when he defends himself by only one, but instills the best of both worlds. Look at it as such. However, be careful because it is a difficult movie to see if it is not graphic, emotionally. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting until they make a movie about Iraq. It will probably have many of the same themes and it will be very controversial, I want to see who has the guts to do it first. (Jarhead does not count)
