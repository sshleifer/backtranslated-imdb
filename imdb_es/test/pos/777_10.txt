I did not expect much from this movie and they slapped me. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint and Laura Linney present themselves wonderfully as the main characters of this film. Any teenager can relate to parental control and the need to come out as who you really are, which is basically what this movie is about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets the retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas with words. Slowly, but surely, it comes out of its shell and becomes much less uncomfortable. Each and every one of the spectators feels the ups and downs of the film and the theater is filled with laughter 75% of the time. The film satisfies everyone, and I hope that it will soon be released in all theaters in the United States, because many do not have the opportunity to see the film unless they live in big cities. It is a must see!
