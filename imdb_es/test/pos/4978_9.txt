I really enjoy this movie. I have a true sense of justice and "an eye for an eye," and this movie offers that in spades. The great rancher in the valley offers Glenn Ford a very low price for his ranch; then one of the hands of his ranch is hit and shot "to help him make a decision about the sale." When the hand of the ranch dies, and the sheriff refuses to do something, at first Ford seems reluctant to do anything, warning his men not to take things with their own hands. But, that's just what you're about to do. I knew that this movie was about to catch fire when he entered the room and he confronted the man (Richard Jaeckel, one of my favorite actors of bad characters) who had killed his ranch; After a smooth exchange of dialogues with him, Glenn Ford slapped him and killed him all at once. A kind of neat aggregate of justice, kill this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cow hand. In a short time, we try to let Ford let his ranch burn, so his men are justified in ambushing the crew of the other ranch; then Ford and his men abandoned all the horses and cattle of the ranch of the great wicked; then the dependencies and the big luxury house appear on the ground. Talk about getting even great times. Lots of action in this movie. There is more to the story than this, but I will recommend that you watch the movie. Glenn Ford was someone who showed again and again what can happen when you misjudge someone, and I really enjoyed watching him get old-fashioned justice.
