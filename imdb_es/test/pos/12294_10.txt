Pola X is a beautiful adaptation of Pierre by Herman Melville; or, the ambiguities. ' The comments here surprise me, makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction. <br /> <br /> The shock value is the least attractive of this movie, a minor detail that has been exaggerated. The story is about the fall of Pierre, and the subsequent destruction of those around him, which is openly demonstrated in his features, behavior and idiolect. The dialogue and the soundtrack distinguish this film from any other I have seen, and convert a fundamentally traditional plot with controversial turns into an unforgettable emotional epic. <br /> <br /> I can not emphasize enough the importance of not taking everything into account. I've heard about this movie and watching, as I did, with an open mind. You will be, I hope, rewarded in the same way that I was. I felt nervous and nervous since about half an hour, however, the film is far from terrifying in the traditional sense. It will leave you with 1,000 thoughts, each of them at once problematic and exciting. I know I am moving here, but I feel the need to compensate for the negative perception of this movie. It's the best I've seen all year.
