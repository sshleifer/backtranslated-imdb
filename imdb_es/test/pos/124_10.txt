This was a great movie in every sense of the word. It addresses the theme of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviation from the norm. Criticizes a lot of Indian customs that many find oppressive, such as the organization of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their ability to make babies , the binding concepts. of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a moving love story that goes beyond the limitations of the society in which the two protagonists find themselves. The film is well acted and genuine, completely believable from beginning to end, unlike most Bollywood films. The main flaws of the film, as I saw it, were the first, that the two lovers seem attracted to each other, not necessarily by a natural affinity between them, but also by the fact that they are trapped in deadlocked marriages, without passion no feeling. rewards This may play a role in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people caught in the same situation will not become homosexual. It seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual: when Radha makes her scene at the end of the film with Aashok, she makes it quite clear that "she was not dead", and the implication was that if she wanted it that way I could have fulfilled it completely, and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed not to like it. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals: they can seek consolation in other people in the same position, but in the film it is not clear at all that they are lesbians from the beginning, but quite the opposite. Some people are bisexual, it is true, but most tend to be hetero or homosexual. In the case of the ladies in the film, both had insensitive tugs for the spouses. . . If this had not been the case, would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they would not otherwise have considered? The movie ignores this. The other flaw is the appointment of the characters. . . the names of Sita and Radha seem to have been deliberately designed to scandalize and outrage (imagine a movie in the United States showing a homosexual relationship between a man named "Jesus" and another named "Paul"!) using names associated with various writings of Hindoo The film is strong enough to stand on its own and, in my opinion, does not need such devices. In any case, failures do not take away much of the power of the film. In fact, it is a very moving and powerful story: the images and the characters will remain with you long after you leave the theater.
