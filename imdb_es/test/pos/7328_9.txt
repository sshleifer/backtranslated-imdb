I can not say that this movie deserves ten, because I would be lying. Although I loved this movie when I saw it! It carries the unique bond of friendship between a teenager and a dolphin. Although it does not show the sweetness that Jesse and Willy had in Free Willy, it does provide an exciting movie that the whole family will enjoy! If you love marine animals, or if you like a perfect family movie, this movie is right for you! Flipper definitely shows us how adorable the dolphins are, and they are playful and could easily be pets if everyone had a pool big enough! I love whales and dolphins, so obviously this movie works for me. I think the producers should have chosen another shark instead of the hammer to improve the antagonistic part of the story. Maybe a great white? FLIPPER IS MAGNIFICENT! So take a look!
