I am very grateful that the small university town of Abingdon, Virginia, near Bristol, TN. and the home of the famous Barter Theater, where Gregory Peck once acted, managed to put together an art film festival and show this film there. Abingdon is two hours and one hour away from where I live, but the trip was worth it in every sense of the word. UZAK / DISTANT is an incredible, brilliant, discordant, emotive and captivating movie. As a Turkish-American, this film was not only a testimony of what life is like in Turkey; but on a larger scale he tells the world what it is like to be a Turk if one lives in Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York or Omaha. It can last two hours instead of five minutes, but this is indeed our Bob Marley song. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie. It is very difficult to choose only a few at random. But, for me, a revealing scene takes place in a cinema in Beyoglu (center of Istanbul). The main character, played by Mehmet Emin Toprak, who died sadly in a car accident shortly after the completion of this film, follows a very attractive young woman who goes down a staircase to the main auditorium of the cinema. She enters to see "Vanilla Sky". As the image of Tom Cruise is reflected in a glass, we feel that Turkish men compete with Tom Cruise for the affections of their own women, although Tom Cruise is not in Beyoglu. The scenes taken along the shores of the Bosphorus are also quite revealing, as they symbolize beauty, but desperately fall into the gulf, which is a painful fact of life in Turkey. In this film, the gulf separates lovers and families. A simple empty pack of Samsun cigarettes (Turkish brand) and a dying mouse jump off the screen like the seagulls did in the movie "Yol" by Serif Goren-Yilmaz Guney in 1982. Many of Guney's films, including "Yol" , "Suru- the Herd" (1978- completed by Zeki Okten) and "Baba-The Father" (1971) have been considered by many as the best Turkish films ever made. Without the sometimes exaggerated social and political anger of Guney (especially in his latest film, the 1983 prison drama "Duvar-The Wall"), "Distance" captures the essence of Turkish life quite remarkably. This is a great achievement for a director who, in my opinion, can already be proclaimed as the Turkish equivalent of directors like Tarkovsky, Bresson and Ozu. I can not wait to see your other movies!
