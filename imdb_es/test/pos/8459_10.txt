Normally I do not comment on movies in IMDB, but in this case I feel I should. I love movies, and I want to make them, and this movie is a perfect example of fine cinema. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I've seen on the small screen (I originally saw it on the air at AMC, I think, and then on the DVD that I just saw) that made me feel that feeling in the pit of the stomach. That little feeling of gnawing that the director would expect you to feel when watching his thriller. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's performance is excellent, and Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas follow him. I felt so much empathy for Lemmon, whose character is Jack Godell, he just wanted people to hear his warning. <br /> <br /> But what impresses me most about this movie is the lack of a score, and this is also what makes me beautiful. Apart from the initial titles, there is no background music to increase the tension, because none is needed. And while the credits are running, white on black, silently brings the point home. <br /> <br /> I use the movie as an example for anyone who says that music makes the movie. I think the movie should make the film and the music should only amplify that. But for the China Syndrome, music is not necessary to convey the realism and urgency shown here. The characters represent all this much better than music. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, it's one of my favorites. If you like movies, you will not be disappointed. If you like movie soundtracks more, you may not want to give it a try.
