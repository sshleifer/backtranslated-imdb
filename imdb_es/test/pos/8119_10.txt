Bedrooms and Hallways is the kind of movie that makes you realize that the drama of life is hidden in the details. And that drama can be very fun too! Even though their own love lives and their own friends may not be as unique as the characters in this movie, they are all forced to recognize themselves and others in the colorful protagonists of this film. And that is the great strength of the bedrooms and corridors, that the irony of life is that the most confusing things that happen to you can be the most interesting / fun / funny / sexy / ... also things! I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I do!
