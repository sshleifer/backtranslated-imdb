We had the pleasure of seeing a new independent film called "Half Empty". Usually, I go to the local cinema with my husband and I feel as if we were captives of the latest Sequel or Prequel that Hollywood launches us. This was different and surprisingly? Much more entertaining than anything Hollywood spends millions on advertising. When my husband and I go to the movies, are we going to entertain ourselves? and "Half Empty" did just that and the movie did it in a clever way that made me feel like my trip to the movies was worth it. It is a funny, human and surprising story, sometimes musical, that entertains intelligently in its simplicity. I especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom. It's almost like an operetta. That particular scene reminded me of a scene in "The Phantom of the Opera" when 4 of the artists not only sang against each other in a friendly response. I'm not a film expert, but this movie was more enjoyable than any other major studio movie I've seen lately. It's silly, fun, entertaining and fun. Completely nice? which is what I expect from the movies, but they are rarely delivered as "Half Empty".
