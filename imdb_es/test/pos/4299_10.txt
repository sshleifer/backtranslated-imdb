Julian Fellowes adapted Nigel Balchin's novel, which looks like a labyrinth 'A Way Through the Wood', which also directs this 'terribly British' thriller piece. It is a film whose effect is based on the cast that portrays the different benign / malignant characters and this is where the Fellowes director elections are excellent. The story has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the film is the metamorphosis of each player, since a single incident ignites a minefield of disasters. <br /> <br /> James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) is a successful business obsessed lawyer in London, married to Anne (Emily Watson) who needs more in his life: the couple without children lives in the country in a beautiful property, assisted by your "clean" Maggie (Linda Bassett) long term. They attend social outings and find themselves, among others, with William Bule (Rupert Everett), the passively lazy and rich neighbor. Anne decides that they should entertain her neighbors and against James' abrupt protest, Anne proceeds to plan: James makes arrangements to "not attend due to matters". On the night of the party, there is a hit-and-run accident in which Maggie's husband is accidentally killed by someone in a Range Rover (he observed). When James returns to his home, he sees a scratch on William's Range Rover and suspects that William is the perpetrator. Anne discourages James from going to the police with the information: "What good can good do, but ruin Bill's life as a socialite, father and son of an important scion?" From this first 'lie', the virus spreads: James confronts Bill, who tells James not to go to the police, Anne confesses that it was she who was driving Rover de Bill and is the only responsible. In her reputation, Anne confesses that she has an affair with Bill, and all three agree that they will remain united in their great lie for the good of good. Anne finally succumbs to the guilt of not telling her beloved Maggie that she is responsible and Maggie, guilty of a previous robbery whose life was saved by Anne's mercy by hiring her anyway, is the agent who takes the story to her surprising conclusion. . Lies breed lies that breed lies, and so on. <br /> <br /> The biggest impact of this intrigue is the way in which the isolated tragedy affects each of the characters involved. Each one changes dramatically. Take Wilkinson offers the best performance of a career full of brilliant performances: you can say more with your posture and facial expressions than on any actor before today's audience. In the same way, the talented Emily Watson adds another excellent role to her repertoire, as does the surprisingly elegant Rupert Everett, who, despite being another rich British "gentleman", gives us a man with spirit and at the same time , needy. And the always beautiful Linda Bassett assumes a small role and makes it more delicate, turning her character into a central place in the chaotic network of lies. To the multiple atmospheres the story is found. This is a set game at its best, which always means that the director (Julian Fellowes) has a good command of the piece. The interaction of these good people makes the unreliable story work very well. Harp grady
