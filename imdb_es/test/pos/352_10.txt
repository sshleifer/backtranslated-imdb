Like other people wrote, I am a mario fan, and I loved this game. <br /> <br /> This game starts a bit boring, but trust me, it's worth it. As soon as you start, your hooked! The levels are fun and exciting. They will hook you until your mind turns to mush. I'm not kidding. This game is also orchestrated, and it is very well done. <br /> <br /> To keep this spoiler free, I have to keep my mouth shut about the details. But please try this game! Will be worth! <br /> <br /> Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (That's good!) Hardness: 10 Attention trap: 10 Average: 10
