If you are interested in learning more about these kinds of things that happen in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called "Outlaw Seas" or "The Outlaw Sea", and describes, in story after story, how these things happen. Anarchy on the high seas is a reality for several reasons. One, many of the freighters of the world are of questionable record (nationality) and it is difficult or impossible to enforce international laws when the owners of the ships do not have an office in a real country. Two, many lines of ships employ crews from poor third world countries. Crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and harassed to comply with questionable or illegal practices. Three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. The crew is rewarded for its compliance and its silence. Four, once committing an illegal act, boats can hide with the naked eye with little more than a new coat of paint. Anyway, it's a fascinating read. <br /> <br /> Horrible story, excellent movie. Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to make the best and most important movies? Hollywood has trouble launching enough Oscar-worthy films in a given year, so several of the top 5 candidates generally come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema. <br /> <br /> I loved Sean Pertwee's completely evil interpretation. I also, as usual, loved Omar Epps.
