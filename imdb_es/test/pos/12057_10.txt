So many times, Bollywood has tried to remake the successes of Hollywood, only to produce total failures. Fortunately, Yash Chopra's interpretation of "Sleeping with the enemy" is an extremely elegant and well-made film. <br /> <br /> Shah Rukh Khan is obsessed with Juhi Chawla (who looks better here!). When she realizes that Juhi has a boyfriend in Sunny Deol, she does not stop at anything to make sure she becomes his. <br /> <br /> Each frame of this movie is a delight. Whether it's Shah Rukh singing his trademark "I love you, K ... k ... k ... kiran!" or the relaxed scenes between Sunny and Juhi (which make a perfect combination), you will not feel like leaving your food boring. <br /> <br /> Each and every one of the songs in the soundtrack are pleasant to the ears, especially Jaadu Teri Nazar and Tu Mere Samne. Like I said, Juhi looks like a goddess in this movie. Darr may not be the best SRK movie (that honor is for Baazigar), but he definitely figures as one of his most impeccable performances! Sunny is fine. He has done similar roles before, but it's good. <br /> <br /> In general, Darr is g ... g ... g ... great! ;)
